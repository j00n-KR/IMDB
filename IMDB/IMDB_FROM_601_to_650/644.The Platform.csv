0,Leofwine_draca,Something outside the box,6,13 September 2020,"THE PLATFORM is a twist on the usual prison movie with imaginative sci-fi style ideas that make it feel a little like a CUBE revamp. Meanwhile, the whole societal exploration and allegory behind the film makes it feel a lot like SNOWPIERCER, but be warned, it's much more grisly than either of those films I've mentioned. It's less a movie than a collection of arresting ideas and many of them work well, although that doesn't make the film a complete success: the low budget is a little obvious at times and some of the psychological angles feel like padding. But the action, when it hits, is shocking. and the climax an exercise in sustained tension. Add in the usual assured performances you tend to find in Spanish cinema and you have a film well worth seeing for those who like something outside the box.",The Platform
1,kosmasp,Upper hand/deck,9,24 March 2020,"I mean the social commentary is so obvious, mentioning it makes me feel weird. And while movies should not say things directly (to keep the suspense, to build something, to make viewers guess or come up with stuff themselves), this still works more than nicely.If it reminds people of Cube, that should not be a surprise. In a good way that is of course. Cube was even more intriguing with less answers than this one. Still don't expect the movie as transparent as it is, to tell you everything. It has multiple layers to it (pun intended) and works on many levels - ok I'll stop. Maybe. But puns aside, the movie has some sick sense of humor to it, while it mostly remains serious in tone. It has to, which doesn't mean that it won't slip into fantasy territory. There are lines this crosses - you cannot be squeamish or easily disgusted. What would you do in a situation like this? And would you be able make it? It really is tough and might make some people think of what they do and how it affects others ... it would be a nice byproduct to a really great movie",The Platform
2,Sleepin_Dragon,Humanity at its worst.,9,28 March 2020,"It's a very clever and interesting premise, it came up as a horror recommendation, I would class it more in the suspenseful thriller bracket. It showcases mankind at its very worst, it basically sets out a message that you're alright at the top, and as you come down the social order, things just get worse and worse, with those above you doing slightly better.Socially and ideologically this is a major triumph, it really does get you thinking, particularly in these days where has had such a terrible impact worldwide.I thought the acting was superb, normally I dislike dubbed films, but in this instance I didn't even notice it, I enjoyed it that much.Genuinely terrific acting. I would have liked to have seen a bit of those running the regime, but I guess they wanted ambiguity.Quality, 9/10.",The Platform
3,grantss,Good movie...until the final few scenes,5,22 March 2020,"Goreng awakes as a prisoner in The Hole, a vertical prison with two inmates per floor. The inmates are fed by a platform that travels from the top floor to the bottom. The survival of the people on the lower levels is thus dependent on how much the people above them eat. This is not ideal and results in prisoners on the lower levels starving to death, killing and eating each other or committing suicide. Goreng decides to change things for the better.Novel plot that takes a while to gain momentum. The first 30 minutes or so just seemed like a gross-out horror movie. I was starting to lose interest when a twist massively changed the direction the movie was taking. From then on it became very intriguing.It also develops into a decent social commentary. Not a perfect one: some of the aspects of The Hole can't be linked to everyday society. Still enough to make it interesting and thought-provoking though.The plot develops in very exciting fashion from this point. The middle third or so is a riveting action-packed roller-coaster ride. Still not perfect: I hated Gorengs hallucinations, feeling they were just padding: they added nothing to the movie.Everything was set up for a profound or at least satisfying ending when the plot took an obscure turn that derailed everything. The ending is pointless, a massive damp squib that ruins the movie.Ultimately, very disappointing as this could have been great.",The Platform
4,bombersflyup,"Watchable, but surprised by the high rating.",4,26 March 2020,"The Platform has a similar concept to ""Snowpiercer - 2013,"" so not creative and the whole thing vague and underwritten, as well as disgusting.Instead of being a train of classes, we have random platforms of prison blocks and it's all about the food. Interesting enough to begin with, but the characters aren't likable or memorable and it gets tiresome and goes nowhere. A film without an introduction or ending, open to whatever you want it to be. Where did he go? What's the deal with the message? How come this Asian woman didn't make it down before if she didn't die, could she just not make it back onto the platform each time? Who knows...",The Platform
5,trashgang,a real sicky,7,13 June 2020,"Weird weird, that's all I can say except, it is an original script but be prepared to see a slow moving flick that turns into sometimes a nasty and even a little bit gory flick.Nothing is explained and it reminded me a lot of Cube (1997). Except this isn't torture and massacre, this is all about food. The lower the level you are the more hungry you will get. Why? Just watch it.Be adviced that this isn't for people easily offended because when they eat it's messy. It's bloody sometimes, it's slow, it's one of a kind. I still don't know what to make of it.Gore 1/5

6,deloudelouvain,Watching this in the middle of the crisis makes you think about stuff.,8,22 March 2020,"What an interesting and refreshing movie I just watched! I really liked it and that even if i have tons of questions unanswered after the movie, a thing that I normally don't like. If all those questions would have been answered I would probably have scored it with a perfect ten, as El Hoyo shows how far a human can go when exposed to extreme conditions. There is not a lot of changing surroundings in The Platform, it's like watching a whole movie shot in a prison cell but the psychological horror keeps you on the edge of your seat. Good directing from Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia and very convincing acting from the whole cast. There is some gore, it's all well done as well. Definitely a movie I would watch again and recommend.",The Platform
7,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Pleasantly surprising foreign offering,9,13 May 2020,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningGoreng (Ivan Massague) awakens in a giant concrete enclosure, where the only thing separating him from Trimagasi (Zorian Eguileor), an older gentleman, is a large square hole, in which a giant platform with a load of food, occasionally comes down. Whatever's on it, is whatever has been left behind by those above them, and those below will get what they leave behind, and vice versa. As the two men try and make sense of what is happening, Goreng is plunged into a deadly battle of survival as he tries to navigate the different levels.Foreign cinema used to be the sole preserve of the intellectual art house goer, something notably away from the mainstream that a dedicated lover of film would have to go out of their way to seek out if that was what interested them. But in the modern day of streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, it's become more accessible (I'm not being sponsored by them!), and so well received films such as this get everyone's attention. The feature length directorial debut of director Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia, the amount of Independent Film Awards it seems to have won is testament to its success.Anyone with an appreciation for the brilliant low budget 1997 sci-fi film Cube will find the concept vaguely similar here, with much the same air of mystery with regards what's behind it all and the power dynamics that develop between people trying to survive. But, in maybe not the subtlest way, what it's trying to stab at is a metaphor, and commentary on the nature of society, and those at the top taking everything and (here literally) sh!tting in the faces of those beneath them. In the end, it's only by learning to empathise with those lower down that everyone can get through.It might be a little too far fetched and outlandish for some, but many more will likely find it a pleasantly surprising, original and thought provoking piece, with the requisite amount of blood and gore to satisfy those that are used to that sort of thing in sci-fi. ****",The Platform
8,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"What goes down, must go up.",7,2 August 2020,"Every aspect of 'The Platform (2020)' is allegorical for the unfair class system that inevitably comes with any social structure. One could even argue that the picture is a satire, even if it most certainly isn't a comedy. It's unexpectedly consistent, actually. The brutalist architecture of its vaguely sci-fi, decidedly dystopian prison setting matches its equally brutal, uncompromising violence and bleak overall aesthetic. The performances also solidly sell each new stage of situational grief we're introduced to. As such, the flick never feels all that conventional, even when it touches on themes and plot points that have been explored quite a bit before. It moves at its own, surprisingly quick pace and doesn't feel bound by any real expectation of genre. Indeed, it's rather hard to categorise. It doesn't give you answers as easily as you might expect. Though it isn't exactly a fun film, it's well worth a watch. It's compelling right the way through. Plus, despite its heaviness, it's an experience tinged with hope. It tries to to say something worth saying and it doesn't spoon-feed it to you, allowing you to come to your own conclusions about the somewhat obvious but nevertheless interesting thing it serves as an extended metaphor for. If you can stomach its legitimately heavy-hitting violence, I'd give it a go. And remember: we live in a society. 7/10",The Platform
9,ThomasDrufke,"""Obviously""",7,10 April 2020,"I've been hearing great things about The Platform for months after Netflix provided screeners to select critics last fall and buzz started ramping up. For Netflix, which normally doesn't produce high quality film (although they consistently put out great TV), The Platform is quite good. I was expecting more out of the ending but the more low-key finale wasn't bad either. It's an interesting combination of The Raid & Snowpiercer but on a smaller scale, and with just as much to say about class and our current world. Perhaps a little too gory at times, but The Platform is a solid watch.7.2/10",The Platform

Amazing start, plot was interesting, the middle didn't disappoint me but the ending hmm, let's say I can't give maximum just because of ending but the film is very interesting and worth ur attention.

12,851222,Good premise and nice execution with clear metaphor,7,24 February 2021,"Greetings from Lithuania.""El hoyo"" (2019) is movie in which our society is reflected in a view which isn't very optimistic to say the least. I liked the premise of this movie. Its execution also was pretty good with pretty good pacing given the place it all transpires. Yet the the last 10 min of this movie made little sense to me, and even if it did i have to say that i liked most of this movie way more then the ending - it wasn't handled as good as the rest of this film.Acting was descent. Set design was pretty good - i won't spoil anything but creator used this small place very well.Overall, ""El hoyo"" is a movie with basically one metaphor and this metaphor is very clear and loud. I'm afraid this movie's idea and reflection of our society is pretty much accurate, and that what makes this movie even more scarier.",The Platform
13,Thanos_Alfie,Amazing...,7,8 May 2020,"""The Platform - El hoyo"" is a Thriller - Horror movie in which we watch a man going to a vertical prison in which the inmates of its cell are two and they are eating once per day the residues of the cell above them. Each month they change floor either up or down.I have to admit that ""The Platform"" was a big surprise for me not only because of its very clever plot but also because of the amazing interpretations made by its cast. This movie presented very well the current situation and many aspects of society and economy. The interpretations of both Ivan Massagué who played as Goreng and Alexandra Masangkay's who played as Miharu were simply outstanding. Finally, the direction which was made by Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia was simply exceptional.",The Platform
14,eddie_baggins,A memorable effort with a weak finale,7,26 March 2020,"Coming out at the perfect time, as millions around the globe self-isolate and also find themselves victims of a world that went crazy for a time when many forgot that looking after themselves isn't all there is to do as a human being, Spanish horror/thriller The Platform is a unique distraction in our current state of being.Similar in theme to Cube in conception and any other survival horror that deals with the way in which our humanity can crumble where we are faced with life and death options, Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia's visually arresting and at times horrifically staged exercise in consistent tension is a great example of what can be achieved with imagination and a desire to tackle hefty social issues.The film is centered around Ivan Masssgue's book reading Goreng, who signs up for a secretive project that sees him awaken to a vertical prison of unknown levels, with food delivered once a day from a top down manner meaning the lower your level, the more likely you are to find yourself starved of food and sanity.It's a high concept offering and one Urrutia is up for exploring as he holds nothing back in the 90 minutes his been allotted, with cannibalism, sadism and human to human violence all prevalent as Goreng comes across a range of captives in his journey up and down the prison known as The Pit.Accompanied by a strong visual design and an unnerving score by Aranzazu Calleja, The Platform creates a strong identity for itself, but after an extremely strong opening section where Goreng's uneasy friendship with his older cellmate Trimagasi (played by a memorable Zorion Eguileor), the film finds itself struggling to make the most of it's ideas and themes and we begin to progress down a plot line that isn't as interesting or rewarding as we'd hoped it would be.These type of uniquely staged event film's often find trouble tying things up nicely and that's absolutely the case with The Platfrom.You can't help but feel it's insistence too keep many things mysterious and it's outcomes more vague halts this impressive foreign feature from becoming a genre classic.Final Say -The Platform will make you look at food and humanity in a different light and there are times where this Spanish offering is downright brilliant but after a strong opening, The Platform ends up becoming a more so-so affair that can't take us to a destination worthy of it's idea.3 1/2 panna cotta's out 5",The Platform
15,Tweetienator,Dark and Good,7,27 March 2020,"Luckily, I took my chances with that Spanish production - El hoyo/The Platform is a very unique movie with a lot of European character (means you get some good dialogue, some unique ideas, some realism, and not your Hollywoodized/Disneyized standard plot) - its tone remembers me of movies like The Road, Los últimos días (The Last Days) or Blindness and it is a mature work in contrast to your standard US action made by an Emmerich, Bay or J.J. Abrams or whatever director that produces that kind of standard outputs these days. Anyway, if you like some really dark dystopian story and you like some grotesque flavor to your dish, watch this one. For fans of movies like the for mentioned ones and movies like Cube, Circle etc. All in all: really good.",The Platform

17,matthewssilverhammer,Snowpiercer for horror-heads,10,17 July 2020,"This anti-capitalist allegory's intentions are as boldly blatant as its hypnotism. Isn't that the insidiousness of capitalism? No matter how obvious the evil, we are suckered in. Every changing of level, both up & down, is a nightmare, leaving us all the wearier of doing good. We empathize fully with Goreng at every step.

19,Vartiainen,Dark dystopian nightmare scenario,9,2 April 2020,"Somewhere in the not too distant future there exists The Hole, an experimental superprison where the cells are stacked on top of one another. Only two people per cell, with a hole in the center of each cell, going all the way down. A platform brings them food, but it starts from the top and there are no limits on how much you can eat. As thus, if you're on Level One, you eat like a king. If you're in three digits, you'll go hungry. Each month, your cell number changes.A very concept-first movie, but that's the beauty of it. It's such a tightly-cropped idea that it has the strength to carry an entire movie. And yes, of course it's heavily allegorical, speaking for the struggles of the lower classes that are only getting the scraps of those above them. Yet the movie is never preachy about its message. It's not subtle about it either, but you never feel like you're forcible converted to a certain mode of thought.It's also superbly acted movie. We experience the prison through the eyes of Goreng (Iván Massagué), a prisoner serving a six month sentence, who quickly gets fed up with the injustice of The Hole and attempts to rebel against its limitations. Massagué does a fantastic job, as do all of the actors, to be frank.I also like how brutal the movie is. It's very deservedly rated Mature, which adds that final gut punch when people get slaughtered, hacked to pieces and otherwise brutalized. It's the thing that crosses the t's and dots the i's.If I had to name a flaw, I'd say the ending could have been better. Now it's very open-ended which can leave some viewers feeling frustrated. Personally I'm fine with it as it is, but I can admit that it was the only sub-par thing in the entire movie.Nevertheless, one of the best horror movies I've seen in years and one of the best conceptual scifi films I've seen in my life. Not for the faint of heart, but if you can stomach its gore, it's definitely one of the must see films of the year.",The Platform

Soon, he meets different prisoners and tries to survive and help with limited portions of food brought to each level. This isn't bad yet different with dramatic yet gruesome moments.

21,wandernn1-81-683274,One Of The Most Dark And Disturbing Movies I've Seen,8,23 March 2020,I really enjoyed this one. It was disgusting on so many levels. Gore abounds. Blood abounds. Psychology abounds. What an original premise. Or at least I thought so. The only thing that really bothered me is that 'The Platform' itself doesn't really make sense the way it works as far as realistic physics goes. Also there is no way any shaft could be that deep. That's the only things I can really think of that bothered me about the film. A very pleasant surprise of a film really. Nasty. Haha.,The Platform
22,jtindahouse,As good as film metaphors come,8,22 March 2020,"Ever since I heard about 'The Platform' at Fantastic Fest I've been fascinated by the concept and eagerly awaited seeing it. Finally it just came to Netflix and I got that opportunity. So was it worth the wait? Indeed it was. The film was actually slightly different to how I'd pictured it being, but in a better way. The film was everything I wanted. This movie pulls no punches. It has a point to make and it is willing to show anything and everything in order to get that point across.Metaphors in films are a common thing, however they are rarely done as well as the one in 'The Platform' is for the social hierarchy of real life. When put like this it is so simple to understand. There is enough food/money in the world for everyone to share equally, but if the people at the top take too much then everything falls apart. Now that isn't necessarily my political stand-point, I understand that it is far more complicated than that, but still to see it laid out this way and to give people a basic understanding of that has to be a good thing, right?I could easily see the Americans remaking this film. I wouldn't be surprised if the planning for that is put into action immediately. The only thing I feel the film didn't get quite right was the ending. There were a lot of ways I saw this film ending, but the one they picked didn't quite do the trick for me. Otherwise though I had a great time with 'The Platform' and would highly recommend everyone see it. It's not for the faint of heart in some spots, but if you can push through that you'll have a great time with it.",The Platform
23,jadavix,"Silly parable, not intriguing enough to prompt investigation",5,16 June 2020,"""The Platform"" is an endurance test that I feel I have failed. It got off on the wrong foot with me immediately, due to what seemed to be an aggressively simplistic symbolism in the central premise: a tower prison where a luxurious banquet comes down on a platform once a day. Those on the top floor eat first, trampling over what they don't want. Those on the bottom eat last, and by that stage, after the platform has fed two hundred or so people, will be lucky if anything remains.This sounds like Marxism for dummies, like a lame metaphor a first year sociology student cooked up to make her jaded parents as enlightened as she imagines herself to be.I decided to stick with it though, to see what tricks the filmmakers had up their sleeve to dig themselves out of this ""hole"", both proverbial and literal, as the prison is referred to as a hole, despite being a tower.The movie gets perhaps too claustrophobic for its own good. Obviously a prison movie is supposed to make you feel as though you are locked in with the cast, but with an idea this reductive, it is unpleasantly confounding. I kept watching waiting for some kind of big reveal that would make the movie worth my time, but it never happened. It began with a question I didn't care enough about to ask, and ended with more questions that were hardly any more interesting.",The Platform

Each month you awake at a different level.Terrific, unique Sci Fi notion that is well thought through, as slowly the man considers whether there is a solution to this nightmare.

How the upper-class doesn't care about low-born and so the unprivileged have to do illicit work just to survive.I'll definitely recommend this beautifully acted, well-directed movie. And I would prefer to watch it at night to have a spooky experience.Quote from the movie: A great man who is sin-ridden can only be a great sinner.

Prisoners are held in in a multi-floor facility, two per floor, no inmate knows how many floors there are but from empirical knowledge it's at least 200. Food is sent down from above but is all gone by the time it reaches the lower floors. Some prisoners make attempts to promote solidarity but those in the floors above despise those in the floors below them. Scenes of savage violence, cannibalism and insanity abound. Not a film you will forget in a hurry.

29,TdSmth5,Fascinating depiction of life,8,13 May 2020,"A guy wakes up in some concrete cell with another older guy. The cell is pretty large, has a toilet, mirror, beds, and a huge hole in the middle. There, the guy named Rice, I mean, Goreng, can see the same arrangement up and down, apparently in countless floors. They are on floor 48 which the old guy says is a good floor. Old guy reluctantly explains what is going on. Right from the start he says that the whole contraption is about...food. A platform filled with food travels down, stopping at every floor for a couple of minutes allowing the inmates to east. Problem of course is that the lower the platform goes, the less food is left, since on every floor folks just go crazy forcing as much food into their mouths as they can. At some point the platform flies upward. There are also red and green lights and the chambers will change temperature if someone stores food, they are punished with extreme heat or cold. So the can only eat during their allotted time.Even though Rice claims to know nothing, later we learn that he actually volunteered for this...so did everyone else. He did it in exchange for a college diploma. The old guy did it as an alternative to a long prison sentence after accidentally killing someone. Everyone was allowed to bring a personal item. Rice brought a book, much to the surprise of the old guy who brought a self-sharpening knife.One day a woman shows up on the platform. Old guy says that she is traveling down floors looking for her young son. On the floor below the two guys grab her and rape her to the outraged protest of Rice.They spend a month on this floor and then are gassed to sleep and wake up on another floor. Rice wakes up all tied up. They are on floor 171. At that level the platform arrives empty of food. Old guy bound rice because eventually they will have to eat of Rice's body. But then after several days of eating nothing, and when old guy can't stand it anymore and starts slicing bits of Rice's leg, the girl arrives on the platform and kills the old guy and saves Rice.In the next round Rice wakes up on floor 33 with a transsexual whom he recognizes as the woman who interviewed him when he applied for this. The thing is called a Vertical Self-Management Center. And she had no idea of the cruelty that goes on so she decided to join herself and find out. She brought her beloved dog. We learn that everyone is asked about their favorite food. Rice's is snail, which is what the old guy called him as he was preparing to eat him.The woman is an idealist and thinks she can convince people to develop spontaneous sympathy by eating only the necessary ration. So she eats a bit, prepares two dishes for the guys below and asks them to do the same. They scoff at her of course. But she insists every day.When Rice wakes up at the next level, they are at level 202. The girl has killed the woman's dog and both are fighting each other until he intervenes. According to the woman, the children are allowed in The Hole, so the girl can't be looking for her son.Rice then wakes up at level 6 with a black guy who has a rope and wants to use it to climb up with the help of the ones above. But of course, they won't help. Rice comes up with a plan. He and the black guy will ration the food for everyone, and enforce it by force. They will travel on the platform and distribute food and beat up everyone who doesn't comply. And so it is. They travel down distributing food and apparently killing everyone who wants to take advantage of their system. At some lower level they run into another black guy in a wheel chair who is said to be a wise man. He suggests that their distribution plan is not enough, that they need a symbol and should send a message to administration--a pristine untouched item of food should be allowed to return to the top.As they continue traveling down they see nothing but horror, death, and devastation. At some point they are nearly beaten to death because they are protecting the symbolic food. When they arrive at the bottom, they find a young girl...indeed the daughter of the other girl.The Platform is a strong movie by itself but it is enriched by the invitation to interpret it. Often movies are too dull or empty for interpretation. This movie gives you enough but not too much, so things are intriguing and interesting. The Vertical Self-Management Center represents life on this earth, where everything is indeed about food (and reproduction). The items each prisoner is allowed to take in a way represents what they stand for. The thinker brings a book, the killer a knife, the lover her beloved pet, the helper a rope. Economics quickly turns into politics or politics is ultimately all about economics, and when someone claims to have be a revolutionary who found the best system to re-destribute resources and takes it upon himself to put it in practice, only unintended but entirely expected violence can ensue, since greed is beneath reason and power means violence. Often politics morphs into religion and these re-distributors see their role as a religious one; they see themselves as saviors of the rest. Life is cruel and everyone only has hate for everyone else, for the ones above and oddly also for the ones below. Sure, things would be ""better"" if people only used what they ""needed."" After all no one can possibly have use for a garage-full of toilet paper. The thing is that life doesn't have to be cruel. There is hope based on the unlikely but actual spontaneous sympathy which the woman herself represents and which Rice experienced when the girl is attacked, and which the girl experienced when the old guy was eating Rice. Of course the occasional spontaneous sympathy isn't enough. The mistake of the thinking the movie represents is that there are very limited resources, that there is only so much food/money/oil etc.to go around when in fact human ingenuity has allowed for much more expansive ways to procure resources.",The Platform
30,masonfisk,A HOLE TOO FAR...!,8,7 April 2020,"A recent Netflix acquisition which is equal parts sci-fi parable & a reflection of the times we live in now w/the wealth disparities among the caste systems. A man volunteers to enter a prison system for a period of time in order to parlay the stay into a masters degree. Each cell has only 2 occupants bisected by a square empty space where a floating table of food lowers every day for the prisoners to partake in. The facility consists of many floors w/the top one's occupants being the first to partake of the lavish meal while each subsequent floor has to make do as the food dwindles away. Each prisoner can bring one object into jail w/them (our hero brings a book, his older counterpart has the knife similar to the one he used to butcher his family) which makes things interesting to say the least. Change is coming however when another prisoner, a woman, who has cancer & who worked for the establishment decides to dwell in the environment she & her kind have wrought. To try to bring some order to the chaos, she tries to make the lower tiered inmates budget their meals so the entire can populace can feast equally. A last ditch effort by the volunteer to reach the top floor, w/a religious minded cohort, plays out in the last third as we await to see what will happen when the crazies take over the asylum. Owing a lot to Vincenzo Natali's Cube from about 20 years ago, this is classic big questions, let the viewer(s) answer yarn that Rod Serling or Harlan Ellison would've been proud of w/enough story given so no one will be lost as to what's happening but w/enough kernels of truth for one to make up one's mind of the visual meal they've just consumed.",The Platform

32,peterp-450-298716,It's brutal. Confronting. Repugnant. Yet fascinating.,7,29 April 2020,"Don't speak to the people below. Why?
Because they're down below.
The people above won't answer you. Why?
Because they're above.
Obviously!""El Hoyo"" is not just a frightening movie. It's a movie with a moral. A film that makes you think. Could you call it horror? You could have an extensive discussion about this. For some of the detainees who are locked up in the prison portrayed in this film, it's indeed horror. It depends on which floor they end up after a month of extensive eating or a month of terrible hunger. The first thing that came to mind was ""Hey, they designed a vertical ""Snowpiercer"". Be warned though. It's brutal. Confronting. And as I said before, a moral lurks beneath the symbolic surface.However, the set-up of the film is very simple. Take a sky-high building. A magically moving platform (hence the movie title). A group of convicts who are locked in groups of two on each floor. Finally, you establish a culinary department full of kitchen staff who all master the right culinary skills. And this department ensures that this platform is filled with delicacies every day with the same dose of enthusiasm, dedication, and love for their profession. From roasts, fruit bowls, and enormous chocolate cakes to haute cuisine with langoustines, lobster, and other gastronomically refined food. You can guess the outcome. As the platform sinks, the richly filled table turns into a desolate table full of empty dishes, pots, and smashed dinnerware, where you can't even find a crumb on anymore.Despite the simple concept and the fact that the entire film is set in one location, the film remains fascinating until the end. The denouement, however, is rather disappointing. That's the only thing that put a damper on this film. Not that everything is very clear in this film. Why this facility has been designed in this way, isn't explained anywhere. Is it to talk a conscience into the viewers? Is it a psychologically justified experiment? Or was there just someone random who came up with this brilliant idea to design this alternative penal institution? Besides, it's not only convicts who were admitted here. Take Goreng (Ivan Massagué). This person will receive a diploma (as a social worker?) after serving a 6-month prison sentence. Is it a form of an internship? Or self-flagellation? Even the mechanism behind the falling platform remained a mystery to me. But I got no problem with these unresolved questions. Unfortunately, the main question of how the system could be beaten is left unanswered. Or was it just the intention to leave everyone in the dark?It's crystal clear they tried to deliver a socially critical message. It's broadly an allegorical representation of our contemporary society. A society with an unfair distribution of prosperity and richness. And the vast majority of those who own the most wealth in our society, are disinclined to share it with those of the lower classes. And the plea of the less fortunate falls on deaf ears, so they are doomed to rely on less humane practices. And, of course, there are the world improvers among us and people thinking they are a newborn St. Martin, who make frantic efforts to convince others to participate in working on a better world and to call for solidarity. A fairer world. And mocking laughter and derision are usually the results of their efforts. The only difference with real life is that people change in the social ladder from month to month in this prison. Some in a positive, others in a negative way.""El Hoyo"" is a bizarre story that leaves you with an oppressive feeling. As the film progresses you realize how awful it is for some in this gray, grim tower. And these abject conditions are also explicitly shown. Suffocatingly realistic. So expect some bloody and gory images full of excessive violence as well (not suitable for sensitive souls). For some, the sight of men eating food like animals (which reminded me a bit of ""La Grande Bouffe""), it will be repugnant already. But otherwise, this original film is easy to digest (just to stay with the subject). And not only because of the splendid acting. It's not without reason that the film is a great success on Netflix. So you can see that this film platform occasionally programs better movies.More reviews here: movie-freak.be",The Platform
33,valleyjohn,One of the better Netflix films,7,10 April 2020,"In Spanish, it's called The Hole and in English, it's called The Platform and in the current times that we are living it feels prevalent but whatever we are going through at the moment with this pandemic it could never be as bad as The Platform!It's about a man called Goreng who wakes up in a stacked cell that has a hole in the middle . There is a platform with food on , that will descend through the rooms that pauses for just a few seconds, and the prisoners must eat as much as they possibly can while its there. Try to take any food to go, and you'll be punished-the room will become either unbearably hot or cold.
The lower you are the less food , if any , you will get and each month you will find yourself on a new random floor with a new roommate .This is a very clever film . As soon as it's explained to you what the situation is the viewer is hooked .
You know things are going to get rough and boy do they !
This has violence , murder and cannibalism throughout so it's definitely not for the faint of hear .It's a film about trust and if people are capable of teaming together to beat the system or if our life is on the line are we just a selfish species ?It reminds me of of the 1997 Vincenzo Natali movie Cube. It has the same feel of desperation and claustrophobia.One big problem I have with it is the ambiguity of the ending . Perhaps it was just me but I wasn't really sure what it was all about and that frustrates me and I'm sure I'm not alone .Overall , for a Netflix film , it's pretty good and is well worth watching , especially if you are into gory psychological horrors .",The Platform

36,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Strong Social Commentary in a Good Movie,9,12 April 2020,"This movie I actually heard about when a podcast I listen to caught this at a film festival and said it was one they thought was odd, but enjoyed and to keep an eye out for it. I then heard people in the social media communities I'm a part of talking about it as well so I figured I would give it a viewing for a Featured Review on Journey with a Cinephile: A Horror Movie Podcast, especially since it seemed to have a lot to delve into. The synopsis is a vertical prison with one cell per level, two people per cell, only one food platform and two minutes per day to feed from up to down, an endless nightmare trapped in The Pit.Much like the premise of the movie states, we're following Goreng (Ivan Massagué) as he volunteers to come into this prison. He's given the opportunity to get an accredited diploma if he can serve 6 months here. His first roommate is Trimagasi (Zorion Eguileor). He's an older man who gives him a bit of the rules. Once a day a platform of food that lowers from above. You get two minutes to eat whatever you want from it. It then goes down to the next floor until it completes its journey and going back up. The problem is that those at the top are gorging themselves and those below are getting nothing. Goreng points this out and that if everyone just takes what they need, then everyone can eat. Trimagasi accuses him of being a communist for thinking this way.At first Goreng doesn't eat, but eventually gives in. He was trying to take this opportunity to quit smoking and you get to bring one item in, which for him is a book he's always wanted to read in 'Don Quixote'. This experience though really changes a person and pushes them to do things they normally wouldn't.It should also be pointed out that people cannot keep food after the platform leaves, which Goreng learns first hand. You stay in your cell for one month and if your cellmate dies during then, the next month you're given someone new. You also are taken to a new floor each month as well. There's also a woman that is looking for her child, Miharu (Alexandra Masangkay) who rides the platform down once a month, killing anyone that messes with her. As we go on though, there might be more to her character than what is actually revealed.That's all I really want to delve into when it comes to the plot of this movie as I don't want to spoil what happens and what Goreng endures during his time there. This is a fitting time for this movie to get a wide release like it is as well. This has an intriguing concept overall and I'm going to try to hit all of the points that I feel are pertinent.The first is that I think is that Goreng is there voluntarily. I've seen Facebook posts like 'Would you spend x amount of time in prison to have your student loan debt wiped out' or something like 'Would you live in this cabin with no internet or television for x amount of time for x amount of dollars'. This movie is exploring this idea. Instead of going through school, Goreng decides to come here so he can get a diploma to better his life. Trimagasi is there for a different reason and it was only by choice as the other was a mental hospital. There's also Moguiri (Antonia San Juan) who is interestingly here as she feels it is an experiment. She brings a bit more knowledge on the place and for a sad reason on top of it as well. The same could be said for Miharu, which I don't know if we can fully believe what the true story for her character.This is also a fitting time that there's people my age that are speaking out about capitalism and how it's problematic. Before anyone gets upset and if you stop reading now, that's fine, but I have a job that is pretty well paying. I'll probably never be rich, but I can pay my bills, maintain my hobby and do things for fun that I want to do. I want to have more people in this country of the United States to do the same. Goreng presents this idea how if they take a socialist approach, everyone can eat. It is ironic that his older cellmate calls him a communist, as this cellmate really is embodying the 'boomer mentality'. Goreng makes an amazing point though that if everyone would just take what they need and leave the rest, instead of gorging, then everyone could get. This is much like those at the top taking all of the money and the masses being told that it will 'trickle down'. This is a great allegory of why that doesn't work. We also get to see what happens when someone jumps higher levels after being at the bottom, they become just as bad as they feel entitled to since those before them did it. I get that Goreng gets jaded, but never fully loses faith.There's an interesting looks at descending into madness here as well. Goreng is haunted by those that he comes in contact with and I think it is interesting how this plays out. He loses his mind, sometimes due to hunger and other times to just flat out despair for what he's dealing with. Regardless, they become the voices in his head, trying to direct him what to do. They take on the good and evil voices respectively. There's also the character of Miharu. Trimagasi tells him that she's there to find her child. Imoguiri provides a different take on her and stating her child couldn't be here. Regardless, this character once a month continues to search and is quite wild. She creates a bond with Goreng who treats her like a person. This is probably another allegory for how we treat people around us that are below our circumstances.What is interesting is that after the first viewing, I was a bit confused about how this movie ends. With this second viewing, I think that I understand what they're trying to say here. I'm not going to spoil it, but Goreng's final cellmate decides that they're going to take the message that Imoguiri was pushing. I actually think that the ending here is bleak and that is something that really ticks boxes for me. It reflects my thoughts on the state of the world and where it will end up.The acting I thought was solid across the board. I thought that Massagué did a really good at the lead for this movie. He's the first person to bring a book into this place and it almost seemed like he thought he'd be spending his time in a cell, with a mate and just pass the time. I like that he sees an opportunity to do better and even though he meets resistance, continues to try. Eguileor also did a really good as someone who has seen how good it can be to be at the top and has had a difficult decision being down low in it. He's also what is bad with capitalism. San Juan is a tragic character as is Masangkay, depending on the back-story you find true. The rest of the cast rounded this out for what was needed as well.If you couldn't tell, this movie has a bit of a sci-fi vibe to it as well. The platform doesn't seem to have any strings or chains to move it up and down. It just floats. I thought that effect looked good. It is also interesting to how they know if people are keeping food on their floor or not, which causes bad things to happen. There are some effects aside from this that were done practically and looked good. We also get some interesting shots when Goreng loses his mind so props to the cinematography there.Now with that said, I really enjoyed this movie despite its bleak look on the state of the affairs in some places. This is interesting to come out of Spain, but it hits so close to home for me as a resident of the US. I think that the acting is really good and the allegories it is exploring are well done. There are some really good effects in this movie and the soundtrack fit for what was needed. If I have any problems it is that it gets a bit boring at times, but I never lost interest. I would say that my rating here would be a good movie. I might have to revisit this again this year as this could be a contender for my year end.

40,Muhammad_Rafeeq,Read My Review after you saw this movie ( Spanish B+ Movie) My Ratings 7/10,7,17 April 2020,"Every day the cooks supply with little but enough food so that everyone in the hole can survive. The problem is how people share the food. It is easy to blame a leader or a system (capitalist, communist, etc.) but in reality it is the attitude of each one that counts.Entering the hole represents seeking a reward in a short time, and everything bad that happens there is what we do to get it. (maybe we are all in the hole already)The first cellmate has a knife and tells him that each time he uses it he sharpens more, without a doubt reflects the experience in betrayal to survive the stab wounds he has given people to achieve his goal is his best weapon. When the situation gets complicated he does not hesitate to eat his partner to survive and he says, I do it because I only have 2 months left to go out and I have to eat well, and you are young you have a lot of time left .. this reflects that the Lord thinking about his retirement needs more money and more resources than a young person.The cold and heat that you feel if you keep some food, represents the consequences of taking too much (that includes social deterioration but also climate change)The second companion is a vegetarian environmentalist, her dog represents that she is an animal friend and protects you. With a soft voice she tries to convince others to ration the food they eat, but nobody listens to her, she enters the hole because her ambition is to want to change the system.The third partner reflects a person who has struggled to get to the top, makes it clear when he tells the protagonist that he wants to give food to the other two people because they helped him up.The search to send a message to ground zero is like Don Quixote's fight, a noble but imaginary fight. we all have to change, be generous with others (perhaps it is impossible because it is not our nature).The hole is deeper than the protagonist imagined. (poverty is worse than we suppose)When the protagonist reaches the last floor 333 (this number is associated with good luck, which is what one is looking for)The girl represents prisoner 666, a number we already know who represents: she does not smile, does not speak, does not cry. The spirit of the first partner of salde tells the protagonist that she is the message, that they have a gift that he cannot see, that the message does not need a bearer.The girl reflects the bad, the disease, the viruses of excesses, which nobody sees by being in the hole.The girl really was an hallucination of the dying protagonist.The girl's mother, which it really isn't, she was simply contaminated with what the girl represents.What really got to the top was the panacota (dessert), and the chef when he saw the panacota does not understand the message and thinks that they did not eat it because it had a hair.

44,Jeremy_Urquhart,"Goes from pretty good, to way too obvious, to lazy and vague",5,23 March 2020,"This movie is something of a rollercoaster but not in a good way, and certainly not in the way that I was hoping. I think it helps show that a good premise will not always make a good movie. With The Platform, the premise is good enough to sustain interest and intrigue for about the first half hour, but then things start getting repetitive, clichéd, and only sporadically interesting on and off, until the movie takes a nosedive and rushes towards lunacy before abruptly stopping. If you didn't see the spoiler warning already, this is your last chance. When I see a movie with numerous problems- one that frustrates because it could've been really good- it's hard to break it down without discussing key plot points.The film does a good job of dropping you into a mysterious, cruel world. As such, being introduced into it and seeing it through the eyes of the protagonist does make its first third its best. The budget limitations aren't yet a concern, and the claustrophobic setting stays effective during this first half hour or so. There's an uneasy tension, and thoughts about the horrors of what might be happening on different floors- above and below our main character- end up being more chilling, in many ways, than what we actually end up seeing of them. That old saying about showing and not telling is a tired one, but maybe it holds some weight in this regard.Once the main character starts talking to ghost/memory versions of deceased characters, I started losing interest. It's a really lazy trope, and one that I feel like would get torn to shreds if it appeared in an American movie without any twists or subversions. The fact there are subtitles in this movie shouldn't excuse it using such a tired cliché in a way that isn't particularly meaningful, useful, or unique. It also relates to the problem of the restricted supporting cast: the protagonist gets paired with a different fellow prisoner in approximately each third of the movie. It ruined the sense of continuing tension or dread that the first third built, because it gives the film a sort stop and start/ episodic feel. I was interested to see how the movie would progress after his first cellmate died, but then the way he turned into a ghost that taunted him and was simply replaced by other supporting characters began turning me off the movie.Also related to the supporting characters: why did characters keep jumping around the different levels of the tower every month? Was it just for the outer world's amusement? Was there any rhyme or reason to it? It also kind of defeated the whole capitalism critique/ allegory, because it felt like it was up to chance who went where. I may have missed something in this regard, and if so, that's on me. But if other people had this problem, then maybe it either wasn't effectively communicated or just not really elaborated at all.As a whole, the film is very obvious. This isn't always a terrible thing. It beats you over the head about how bad it is that certain classes rule over others, but at a point it just becomes laughable and contrived. The middle class lady wanting to look after an animal by feeding it, and depriving food from other people represents... rich people having pets and not giving food to people in poverty instead? That's not even a metaphor! Worst of all is the rushed and ambiguous ending, where about 80 minutes of blatantly obvious messages are all of a sudden contrasted with an abrupt, honestly vague last couple of scenes. I can barely recount it, it's all such a blur. It's a mess. It really fell apart, in all honesty.I will admit the acting is serviceable, and the film mostly looks good for its budget. Yet unfortunately, the premise runs out of steam at a point. Things get dull, I didn't particularly care about any of the characters, and by the time The Platform ended, I realised that most of the flashbacks as well as glimpses of the outside world didn't really go anywhere. There weren't really any decent pay-offs. Do they want to do a sequel? Would anyone care? Pretty much all the main characters are dead, they were difficult to care about anyway, and we've seen just about every single floor, from the bottom to the top.Most other well-known single location movies are much better than this. I'd recommend Cube, The Exam, and even The Circle over this, and don't get me started on how this doesn't hold even a fraction of a candle to Snowpiercer. That film had a slightly similar premise, but benefitted greatly from its exciting action scenes, superior visuals, sympathetic characters (and better antagonists), a more well developed world, a blunt but consistent message, actual pay-offs near the end, and small doses of Bong Joon-ho's quirkily dark comedy. Also I loved the variety to that film's look, despite being set on a single train. Every time they entered a new carriage, it was exciting, because neither you or the characters knew exactly what awaited them. In The Platform, every level looks more or less the same, and as a result it gets visually tiring and dull at around the halfway point.Like with Marc Maron's recent stand-up special, I can see why this has been released on Netflix at this current time. It's good timing, and I am glad others seem to be getting a good deal out of it. It's always nice to see films not in the English language connecting with English-speaking audiences, even if I'm not personally a fan of them. But from my personal enjoyment, 5/10 is even a little generous. It's probably more of a 4.5/10 rounded up, because it was decently shot, it had a good premise, and I did sort of enjoy at least a third of it. You could technically do worse, as it's not quite terrible, but I think you can do a lot better too. I think the filmmakers could have done better as well, as they did squander a premise that could have given us something truly great.Oh well. Time to see what I can stream next I guess.",The Platform

This isn't the first time I've watched a terrible film and then logged onto IMDb only to see people raving about it, but while most of the time I can understand people's reasons for liking a movie, on this occasion I cannot.Before I even get on to the sheer absurdity of 'El hoyo' or 'The Platform', I have to say that the fact that this film dubbed in English really bugs me. I've seen a lot of foreign-language films and not once have I had a problem reading the subtitles. It's just plain annoying when the visuals and audio don't match.The initial setup in this film is ridiculous to begin with and becomes more and more farcical (and depraved) as it goes along, eventually reaching what is one of the worst movie endings I have ever had the misfortune of seeing.

They've gone to a vert low level and he wanted to eat him like a cannibal and the woman looking for her child stabbed him and untied Snail so that he could kill the old man. The other flatmate of her was a woman with terminal cancer. She hanged herself when they went to a lower level again so that the man could eat her body to stay alive. Then Baharat the Black guy and Snail wanted to be saviors and went down on the table to split the food equally between the platforms. They killed a lot of people. At the lowest platform they found the kid and Baharat died and Snail went even lower and the kid was sent to the very top on the table as a message to the management.

48,rockman182,The Platform (2020),7,11 April 2020,"Had it not been for being on quarantine and bored at home, I would have never checked this gem out. I find this especially relevant at a time like this where crazy and selfish people are hoarding things that are needed for vulnerable and less fortunate people. The timing for this to release could not have been better. While the ending was a little disappointing and could have been better, I found the concept of this to be extremely creative and it was amazing for 3 quarters of the film.
The film is in a dystopian world where members in a prison like facility live in small rooms, two per rooms for hundreds of floors. Each member is allowed to bring one thing with them. The main thing about this facility is gourmet food that is given for two minutes to each platform. The lower you are on a platform the more scraps you eat. Say, if you are on level 33 you are eating whatever is left from what others ate above you. If you are on a lower level in the hundreds, there is no chance of food for you and you have to find out what to do (cannibalism) to survive the month until you are re-assigned.
It was hard to describe what this film is about very well because the plot is so creative. It reminded me a bit of Cube, which was also very enjoyable. The lesson here is probably that a dish that every participant wanted is made, probably daily. If everyone just ate that dish or rationed then there would be enough for everybody. Alas, this isn't the way that humanity works and the lead actor tries to get everyone to act to help others. This films delivery is excellent for most of it, until the end where I feel like the ending could have been better.
The film is really violent at times and it won't be for people who can't stomach the gore. There's messages here and the filmmaker makes it quite obvious but its a hell of a journey in a small scale setting. Its acted and shot very well as well. This is a real streaming service gem that I really enjoyed and I hope that others will check it out too. I'd like to see more worthy content like this come out.

49,Ruskington,Not for people with gentle stomachs or simple minds,8,10 May 2020,"One of the most interesting films I've seen in recent years. A very polished piece of cinema with some very strong messages regarding the structure of society. The film is open to various interpretations and is a film to be watched, rewatched, analysed and discussed. Like many, I was a little underwhelmed by the ending but there more I dwell on it, the more I can accept how everything played out. With so many formulaic eager-to-please films around, imaginative, challenging work like The Platform is something we need a lot more of. Highly recommended.",The Platform
50,markthomassintek,True greed in every sense of the word,7,31 May 2020,"REVIEW - THE PLATFORMThere are 3 kinds of people; the ones above, the ones below, and the ones who fall.This one sentence sums up the underlying meaning of this film, why?In life there those who have and do what they can to retain it, those in life who have enough or nothing and do what they can to survive and then those who simply have nothing, have nothing to retain and nothing to allow them to survive.A prision where on each floor there are 2 prisoners, 300+ floors and a table of food which is lowered, those on floor 1 getting their pick and each floor doing the same unil nothing is left but every month the 2 prisoners on each floor are moved to a different floor, either up or down.Amazing film showing the true nature of greed, the higher floors eating more than they need so those on the lower floors going without.What would happen if each floor only took what they needed and shared the remaining with the floors below?Spanish but available in both subtitles and English dubbed but either way one definitely to see.Rating 7 out of 10",The Platform

It is very original and, for you gorehounds, quite violent. The acting wasn't bad, unfortunately, I saw the Netflix-dubbed version where the voice acting was only so-so. No doubt, the original Spanish version would've been better. Nevertheless, I got out of this movie what I signed up for - a relatively fast-paced, well-done horror that definitely was not a waste of time. Recommended.",The Platform
52,Patient444,Not perfect but...,7,22 March 2020,"Original in its idea, the way it developed, grew and its representation of satire was just beautiful. So out there, right on the screen, yet not for everyone to understand and this is why perhaps some people were really harsh about it. I don't know if it supposed to be a horror production, perhaps some elements here and there, but mostly, a way to talk to the people. Some listened, some didn't.Now, as many complained, I too also found the ending to be bland, I mean, after a few left-right twists here and there, out of nowhere, we are prepared for this ultimate climax. A battle like none before, finally someone taking action and not laying down anymore, but lasted only a few levels and then returned to a more platonic experience. I really don't understand how they let it end like so, I think there was room for more and for a really pleasant and satisfying conclusion.Overall, like many Spanish thrillers, El Hoyo was great, a delight really, not perfect all the way, but hey, I'll take such leftovers anytime and not complain about it. It was different, and it was different good.Cheers!",The Platform
53,tonypeacock-1,A horror that is a highly relevant indictment of human behaviour,6,1 May 2020,"What was I expecting?Your run of the mill, blood splattered gore ala The Saw franchise?
Well The Platform is actually more thought provoking. A social commentary on class, greed and sharing.It tells the story of a prison like facility of over a hundred levels. Two prisoners on each level with a hole in the centre of the 'cell' in which a platform of food goes down each day and stops at each level for a minute or so allowing a quick graze and feed of whatever food is left.You see at the too, level 0 the platform is filled with enough food to feed all the prisoners.
However by the time the platform travels down to say level 50, the food is near devoured and people die. Ravaged by the prisoners on the levels above.
The prisoners have to stay on the level allocated (seemingly at random) for a full month before being gassed unconscious and moved to a new level.The film introduces Goreng. New to the facility and seemingly who has volunteered to be a resident to be awarded a degree?He has taken a book as his object and seems educated. He seems to understand the concept of sharing.However others are less 'educated' exhibiting greed, bringing out the very worst in human nature in their battle for survival.In today's (2020) troubled society undergoing the 'COVID-19' pandemic some of the themes exhibited in the film have in reality been shown to be true with hoarding initially at supermarkets and such like.I watched this Spanish film on the streaming platform Netflix during the lockdown we now face.Directed by Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia, The Platform is a low budget, well dubbed Spanish horror that asks questions about all of us.",The Platform

This movie is about the horrible stuff we will fill our bellies with and the horrible stuff we'll go through to get it. Moreover it's about the poor treatment people mete out to each other.

It felt very low budget but the acting was still great and the dialogue was just so well-written, it was so sharp you can almost talk to the film and it will talk back to you. A nicely done film that feels, however, more like an adapted theatrical play.Of course, it has its flaws and not everyone will agree with how some themes are presented, just because there are so many of these. Life, choice, responsibility, solidarity, capitalism, communism, consumerism, state, power, administration, political movements, activism, faith, religion, death, birth, succession, and more.I loved that they didn't stick to one theme and gave every one of these some screen and storytime.If you love low budget sci-fi that tries to infest your mind with simple but engaging ideas, you might enjoy this one just like I did.

Many inmates resort to killing to survive, but one of them - a reader of Don Quixote - decides instead to send a message to the powers that be.If you find frequent stabbings and rotten, half-eaten bodies offensive, this uninhibited, brazen, graphic, raw and irreverent film may not be for you. While I appreciated the intense and primal nature of the film, at times it was a little too bizarre and orderless even for me. Seen at the Toronto international film festival.",The Platform
58,msbreviews,The Platform promises to be very divisive...,7,29 March 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Netflix has been supporting small, independent filmmaking for a while now. In 2018, Roma (re)opened a Best Picture nomination path to foreign films. Last year, Martin Scorsese's epic The Irishman could only come to life via streaming since no major studio wanted a three-and-a-half-hour runtime for a theater release. Between these two, dozens of other indie flicks got Netflix's (or other streaming networks) support. 2020 brings us a Spanish horror-thriller from a first-time director (Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia): The Platform (or El Hoyo).Since its showing at TIFF, this movie has been receiving overwhelmingly positive feedback. So, obviously, I needed to add it to my list. I watched it a couple of days ago, and I wanted to take time to think about it because it's definitely going to become a divisive film, especially among general audiences. The Platform carries an extremely abstract narrative, filled with symbolism, metaphors, analogies, and allegories to our political-social-economic situation. It's not a straightforward thriller at all.It's a tremendously intriguing concept, developed through captivating storytelling and a very dark tone. It's a prison that resembles our society of today. Filled with hypocrisy and selfishness. One month, you're the king of the world on a level where food comes in excess, but you still want it all for yourself, ignoring desperate requests from down below. As soon as in the next day, you're a miserable human being, fighting for scraps with your ""cellmate"", and on the exact same position those desperate people were before... And now you want their help?!That last narrative analogy to the real world is undoubtedly my favorite. I was never a fan of politics (who is?), so analogies and symbolism regarding that part of our life don't really impact me. However, it's clear that the screenwriters put a lot of effort into making such a meaningful story. If the ambiguousness is removed from the screenplay, there's still plenty to enjoy. Goreng's arc goes from just trying to get a diploma to actually save the people from lower levels. His story takes the viewer through tons of violence, blood, gore, and genuinely disgusting sequences.Therefore, people who want straight-up popcorn-action instead of a more philosophical take as the filmmakers intended, there's a lot to be entertained by. The Platform is also another proof that you don't need a massive budget to build an immersive atmosphere. The set and production design are as simple as they could be, but it's especially due to that simplicity that the claustrophobic prison works so well. For a directorial debut, Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia does an excellent job of controlling the pacing and applying the right shots to each situation.Unfortunately, my main issue is the same as most people: the ending. I will restrain myself from giving away any minor spoilers, so I'll just write that it doesn't work at all levels, at least not for me. As expected, it's as ambiguous as the rest of the movie. As soon as I finished the film, I was frustrated by so many unanswered (logical) questions, and after a couple of days of thinking about it, these questions still exist. You'll never find an answer to everything, but that was never the main goal. There has to be a balance between reality and fiction. Between what's real and what's just a metaphoric symbol. No one can justify *everything* with ""oh, it's just a representation of something else"".For me, there are two ways of interpreting the ending: I could either take everything literally, which would raise tons of questions without an answer, or I could try and solely look at the story through Goreng's perspective. I do believe the latter approach is the best one, even if it still carries other issues regarding secondary characters. It doesn't answer everything, but it's the perspective I find to make more sense with the movie. It makes the screenplay more cohesive and congruent.Nevertheless, the problem I can't seem to avoid is the abrupt break in tone. For such a brutal, raw, bloody display of human behavior in a situation of survival (the way colors are used is very clever), the climax feels detached from everything that comes before. The underlying themes are there from the get-go, but these are precisely what they are: secondary messages lying under a pretty real story. Going from horrible murders, sacrifices, and God knows what else, to such a philosophical, soulful ending in the way the film does... it's far from a seamless transition.Basically, if you go in expecting definite answers about whatever this prison is, who controls it, and how it truly works, you'll probably leave disappointed and frustrated. It's one of those movies that heavily relies on how people perceive its ending and how much impact does it cause on an overall opinion. Looking at the conclusion solely from Goreng's perspective works the best for me, even if some unanswered (logical) questions still exist. The abrupt break in tone transitioning to the film's climax is my main problem, but The Platform has plenty of positives. An extremely intriguing premise is developed through remarkably captivating storytelling, and an exceptional cast elevates the well-written screenplay. First-time director Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia and his team do an excellent job. Set and production design prove how a small budget can still create an immersive, claustrophobic atmosphere. Even if the ending only works partially, the symbolism and allegories of our world's politics and social-economic situation are a brilliant, thought-provoking piece of a screenplay. I like more it the more I think about it.Rating: B+",The Platform
59,SoumikBanerjee25,"A Socio Political Satire, That has something for all the different Societies in the world!",8,25 May 2020,"Set in dystopian future, it symbolises the capitalist society in a darker shade. At the same time putting a lot of emphasis on communist Ideologies and try to promote them as well. But in my honest opinion, No matter what political structure you belong from; it's a a deep socio political satire that speaks for all the civilized countries nonetheless. The disturbing premise, unsettling imagery, the raw presentation is intentionally put there to make you uncomfortable. Convincing performances helped us to understand the different characters and their motives. They all metaphorically means different parts of our society so pay keen attention and try to decode the hidden metaphors here. Great production value, in cohesion with efficient technicalities surely brings out a refined outcome of the script. The uneasiness helps us to understand the failed system even better. I'm not going deeper into explanations and analysis here but you need to see this. Although there are few shortcomings and unclear portrayals of some aspects but It expresses a number of thought provoking things that will surely force you to question humanity and the society we are currently living in. The classism, the privilege, the boundaries are wide apart and no matter how desperate you are to make a change, there will be consequences in every step.

It fell more like the characters just being racist rather than any point actually being made.Also, the ending feels way too abrupt. This movie probably should've been a bit longer.But the performances are great.

61,ThurstonHunger,Platform Post-Prandial - To Serve Man,7,20 July 2020,"I knew little about the film, and watched it....and recommend that to others. It's largely a thought experiment, set tightly in an art brute installation. Like certain meals, the initial fragrance sparks your appetite, but by the last course you may have a strange emptiness gnawing at you.And that may well be the director's and writer's intentions.I've been thinking as of late how ""trickle down"" economics is pretty much what the right relies upon here in the USA in different incarnations, and that those incarnations go back to a plantation mentality if not further. I honestly just now looked up that Will Rodgers reportedly coined the ""trickle down"" phrase to mock from the outset.Anyways those supply side sort of thoughts permeate this film, and even in regular life are hard to swallow, much more so here. Although the film offers an interesting aspect of a monthly shuffling of the deck wherein one might wind up closer to the supply. Or deeper in the hole.Twilight Zone/Black Mirror genre with more horror. The names of the characters stuck out, Goreng is a food I came across last summer, and looking up the other names, there are some other Malaysian flavors/phrases at play here in this Spanish film.I suspect some of the clever nature of the film was lost to me in both dub *and* subtitles.Surely the fact that Goreng chooses his totem to be a book, and that specific chosen book is another spice added to the mix. Some of the other totems were not necessarily weapons, briefly we saw a surf board, and a kiddie pool.Again a worthwhile watch, some great faces so kudos to the casting director. Oh and someone else pointed out that floor 333 would be person 666. I think the ideas in the film, like on a messy plate, ran together a little and diminished the flavor.",The Platform

76,david-meldrum,"A Startling, Gripping Dystopian Parable Which Lingers In The Memory",8,2 May 2020,"This Spanish language Netflix film is a brutally efficient, streamlined (a little over 90 minutes) yet thoughtful science-fiction horror/thriller with more than a little dystopia, seasoned to taste. But it's all driven by ideas, ideas which are followed through.Carrying a plethora of influences - especially The Cube - it's a parable about a building of unknown numbers of floors, in the centre of each of which is a hole. Up on Level Zero a table is packed with fine-dining cuisine, and the table descends through the levels, stopping in the hole in each floor long enough for the two people there to eat. They can eat as much as they want or think they should. So the table descends - and when it reaches the numberless bottom floor, it shoots back up to be restocked. The inhabitants are prisoners or there for a variety of reasons of their own choosing; some of which we learn, most of which we don't. Much of the film's power comes from only giving us the bare minimum of information and backstory, allowing the film to fly. It's technically exceptional too - of particular note are the relentless, percussive score which drives us along with the plot, and the eerie sound design which provides or enhances much of the film's chilling atmosphere .Without ever sacrificing a relentless plot, the film wrestles with political, moral and religious themes, never drowning in them, allowing them to bob to the surface when the time is right. There is also brutal violence, but it's not the violence that's most disturbing here; it's the portrayal of humanity at its worst, all the while putting the central character through the agonising process of twisting his deeply held morals and politics to fit the world in which he finds himself, forced to choose what (or who) to sacrifice for a greater good that may or may not come about. The final few minutes lack something, but overall it's a startling, surprising, and effective film.Watching it mid-Cornavirus lockdown, in one of the world's most unequal cities (Cape Town), is a dizzying experience. For many, it will understandably be too much in these strange days. But whenever you watch it, you'll be gripped and given much to think about long after the credits roll.",The Platform

Netflix has scored a good one here, an intelligent, creative, dystopian Spanish horror cinema piece that has something to say, even if it's not exactly new. If You have enjoyed ""Parasite"", ""Us"", ""Snowpiercer"" or other thematically similar movies, this is a top notch companion piece.""The Platform"" introduces us to Goreng, a good man with a strong moral compass & the place where he will spend many months, a challenging and corrupt place. That place can be best described with the official synopsis: ""A vertical prison with one cell per level. Two people per cell. One only food platform and two minutes per day to feed from up to down. An endless nightmare trapped in The Pit."" And a nightmare it is. We spend the hours, days and weeks with Goreng as he lives through many humanity's challenges, agendas and natures and through a system that mirrors the messed-up'ness of our own world, politically and socially. Director Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia is having a blast delivering a well-aimed allegory about the alarming and real inequality of our society, he has succeeded both philosophically and cinematically. The cast, every one of the characters, does an impressive job bringing this parable to life, with good character writing putting the dot on i. ""The Platform"", set in such a grim and claustrophobic environment, is visually pretty imprevise, well done cinematography, both practical and digital effects and just provides a high-tier overall look. There's a fair amount of violence as well, of the no-cheese kind. Last but not least, ""The Platform"" is carried back and forth with an atmospheric and effectively subtle original score.""The Platform"" is as substantial and compelling as it is entertaining, in the 90 minutes there's enough interesting themes, characters and twists to get kicks out of.

A basic plot, limited characters and more or less static setting all play into the formula that either works or doesn't - depending on your preference.Given the straightforward nature of the film and limited movement throughout, dialogue becomes more important than anything else. Fortunately, there are some memorable conversations that happen between Goreng - our protagonist - and his fellow cellmates he meets along the way, most notably the crotchety elder, Trimagasi. The way the dialogue shifts from cordial to serious is impressive, especially given the overarching uneasiness that hangs over the entire film.'Platform' isn't for everyone, though. It's somewhat unsurprisingly gruesome, including a few scenes that make you lose your appetite (don't watch this right before dinner).

82,backup-50362,"Great movie to watch, banal ""message"" and a lazy ending though",8,12 August 2021,"I've seen The Cube movies and this one is definitely ""inspired"" by them, in more ways than the obvious.But the acting here is great, it's a very suspenseful movie with great characters.But, the whole ""message"" it's trying to show is so basic and obvious, and don't get me started on the ridiculously bad, lazy ending that explains nothing or provides zero conclusion to the story.I know both lazy writers and the average basic viewer tend to call this ""open to interpretation"", but when it's THAT open, it's just a lazy ending, let's face it.Still, the reason I'm upset about the cliche trash ending that makes no sense is because the rest of this movie is amazing.Definitely watch it, it's one of very few good movies to see on Netflix.",The Platform
83,baunacholi-86159,Indicative,7,25 March 2020,"To see statements like BS, garbage and other fancy names given a movie which is basically a mirror of nowadays society and unfortunately also human interaction. Yes it's a bit heavy handed sometimes and hard to look at with a strong claustrophobic feel. The shots are raw, ugly and by no means it's a feel good movie with a stereotype Happy End. The Schacht is apparently for people who dare to watch movies besides pure entertainment purposes. It will touch u and that's actually good. Maybe it even kicks off a thinking process since the portrayed story is actually closer to us than we want to admit .",The Platform
84,jamiedarlow-37510,Really gripping and nasty!,8,28 March 2020,"In this not so unbelievable sci-fi/horror, we spend time in The Hole, a vertical prison with one jail cell per level; the amount of levels unknown to newcomers. In the middle of the cell is said hole in which once per day a square platform comes down offering whatever scraps of food is left from the cells who have eaten beforehand above. We see this hellish place through the perspective of Goreng (Ivan Massague) who has just arrived in the prison, meeting other inmates such as the elderly Trimagasi (Zorion Eguileor) whose angle is hard to decipher. There's so much more to it on an existential level but it's hard to talk about it too much without spoiling it. All I can say is, it's well worth the ride! The acting is pretty superb from everyone, the set design and general atmosphere is fantastically strange and grisly adding a huge weight to the already fascinating and morbid plot. It's philosophical viewpoint through the majority is really revealing of the most cynical part of humanity and the scariest part of the film; despite all the pleading from our main character of other human beings to do the right thing and ration food for others health, it just doesn't work for anyone in a dire situation unless they are faced with brute force or threat. This is what makes the ending all the more poignant aswell; the final half hour is really exciting and I was completely engaged with what was going to happen. If you like a good satire, gore and dystopian visions, I would highly recommend this one!",The Platform
85,DeBBss,A Surprise Hit,8,16 April 2020,"The Platform is a beautifully shot horror film that is true to the horror genre. The platform focuses on cannibalism and unsettling imagery, and without cheap thrills. The Platform has a lot of meaning behind it too, mentioning unfairness and greed in society. There's so much to unpack in a movie that is so short, and it's definitely one of those headscratchers at the end. The ending itself is a disappointment for some, as we don't get an explanation, but I think that the ending is explained very well throughout the last act.The story is creative, as it's a prison where you are stuck in a room with a cellmate, and the only time you can eat is when a platform goes down each level full of food. In an industry that is so saturated with the same plots, The Platform feel almost necessary. Although the plot is so simple, The Platform never gets boring, and during the last act, it gets even more insane. The only issue that I have is with how little exposition we get as a viewer. I can understand that the film is through the eyes of Goreng, but we are the audience, and it wont completely kill the experience if we got some more exposition about the prison.The acting is what I found the most surprising in The Platform. The Platform is a Spanish horror, so I thought that the acting would be quite unremarkable, but these are some of the best performances I've seen in a long time. Every actors role in the film is played too realistically, and it really immerses the viewers. The characters are really well developed, although we don't see their lives outside of the prison; It's easy to understand someone's personality and what they symbolize.Horrors struggle when it comes to the visual aspects, as horrors always focus on other subjects such as the antagonist(s) or eerie settings, but The Platform is an exception. The color palette is grey and blue, and it's strangely comforting for me. The cinematography is amazing; I love how still it is and it really sells the fact that time feels like it's slowed down. CGI is a killer in low budget horrors, but The Platform's CGI was really impressive. The scenes where we see the lower and upper levels are so cool because it looks so real, and it's similar to an illusion. The practical effects are also very impressive, as most of the gore is done practically.The Platform is a very unorthodox horror, as there is no ""bad guy"", there are no jumpscares, and it doesn't have a scary setting. The Platform is about humanity and our society, and the film portrays those themes in a horror aspect. The Platform is genuinely disturbing, and that's what makes it a scary film to watch. The acting and cinematography are on point, and it made the movie so enjoyable to watch. I would recommend this movie, but just make sure you're not eating while you're watching.",The Platform
86,saraccan,A stretched short film,6,16 September 2020,Most of the movie feels like a cool idea for a short film was stretched into a feature. It has a very basic plot that can be summarized in three sentences while the ending doesn't really satisfy the 90 minute watchtime. There have been similar movies in the past so I can't say it is a super unique idea but it was still somewhat enjoyable.A vertical prison where two people live in each cell. A platform full of food feeds them once a day from top floor to bottom.,The Platform
87,zeekwunlau,stay hungry and stay foolish,8,25 March 2020,"When I first saw the trailer of ""EI hoyo"", I was pleasantly surprised by the excellent setting. The platform was full of food. Layers of people became hungry. The upper and lower layers were because of the most basic human needs. And suddenly the contradictions arise. This human simile is too obvious, and there is too much to discuss. The film did not waste such a subject, and conducted some explorations. There are only three types of people in the world, one type of high-level people, one type of low-level people, and one type is falling.
But it is only possible to rise again if you choose to fall.",The Platform
88,mgd_m,Perfect 7,7,28 March 2020,"The Platform is an allegorical movie, so don't bother us with those ""this makes no sense"" comments. A comment like that defines your intelligence.While pedantic in its social commentary, The Platform is a well made movie. Direction, writing, acting and cinematography are all quite good.Lots of people didn't like the ending, but it's perfectly based on the premise of the whole movie.",The Platform
89,WalkdenEntertainment,Really Enjoyable and Feels Fresh but it is Slightly Familiar,8,31 March 2020,"Set in the future, our film is located at a vertical prison where two people share one cell per level. In the centre of their cell, there is a large square hole. During the day a large platform comes down and brings food to the cellmates. The only problem is that this platform starts at the top of the jail and works its way down. This means that depending on what floor you're on (say the near the bottom) you might not get any food to eat at all. Every month the prisoners also change cell levels at random. One man, Goreng (Ivan Massague), wakes up and finds himself as a prisoner on level 18 with another inmate. Goreng begins to learn and understand the system and the workings of The Platform, meeting new prisoners along the way.Right away I'll confess that I loved the film's concept and plot because it's extremely different and feels fresh. Many movie lovers will comment and state that the film has similarities to a 1997 film known as ""Cube""- a futuristic concept with a questionable escape and survival plot. While I agree that there are some similarities, The Platforms does stand on its own two feet and delivers plenty of new concepts to film.Firstly, The Platform is brutal and shocking. Seeing inmates being selfish, murdering one other, committing suicide or eating other people's flesh (especially if they are stuck on levels close to the bottom) are all reasons why this film is R18+ people! The film doesn't hold back from being uncomfortable to watch or from portraying that it's a dangerous place.As a plot, it's also enjoyable. It's fun watching a new prisoner wake up and learn about The Platform because we as the audience are also learning for the 1st time about the system. The film is also loaded with many surprises and the main character's interactions with other inmates keeps the film interesting and held my curiosity. I also found myself consistently wondering which level our leading man would end up on next and if he would have a different cell mate. From a visual point of view, there's lots of creative design work that should be praised. I also couldn't fault any performances here. All very pleasing to watch!While I enjoyed the entire film overall, some may state that the film's ending is dissatisfying. While the final moments of the film were occurring I did pick up how the film would end, and I feel like this type of finale has been done in film's previously. Given the build-up, I was personally hoping for that little bit extra with this film ending to make it a completely new and different film.Overall, The Platform is fresh and exciting. While same may state this is like the 1997 film ""Cube"", the film still manages to stand up on its own. The Platform is not an easy watch due to its gruesome and uncomfortable tones, but I still found it to be a pleasure and a great win for Netflix users. 8.1/10 - Walkden Entertainment",The Platform

96,TheVictoriousV,"The effective minimalism of Cube meets the ""social critique through sci-fi"" of Snowpiercer",7,1 April 2020,"Like last year's Us, the Spanish Netflix original El Hoyo (Eng. title The Platform) works marvelously as a sociological metaphor, yet risks failure as it insists on touching on the logistics of how its extranormal universe actually operates (another thing it shares with Us). It invites the viewer to think of this as a feasible dystopian future, doing itself a disservice. Then again, perhaps the fact that certain things about the Pit don't seem sensible is part of the commentary?But even if we accept the film as a parallel to our society that we aren't mean to overthink in terms of in-universe logistics, there may be issues. More on that in a bit. First, the plot.In a minimalist science-fiction setting reminiscent of Vincenzo Natali's Cube, a man named Goreng (an excellent Iván Massagué) has volunteered to stay in a new sort of prison he knows little about; a tower that contains a chasm with hundreds of different levels, all surrounding the chasm itself, where a platform containing food is lowered every day. Goreng's cellmate Trimagasi (a deliciously menacing Zorion Eguileor) tells him they get to eat whatever is left behind at the higher levels. If they're lucky, they may be relocated to a higher level at some later date; otherwise, they shall resort to cannibalism on the lowest floors. By several definitions, Goreng is getting a taste of how ""those below"" are treated.Goreng discovers other interesting people among the cellmates. A man named Baharat (Emilio Buale Coka) passes Goreng's floor with a rope (each inmate is permitted to bring one possession into the Pit) with the hopes of escaping, and a woman named Miharu (Alexandra Masangkay) rides the platform throughout the chasm in search of her child, attacking anyone who disturbs her.Trimagasi explains: Miharu is known to also kill her designated cellmate, hoping that she will eventually be assigned her baby upon getting caught again. Would the child be relocated if they already have a cellmate? Is she banking on her child's cellmate also dying at just the right time?These are the things that puzzle us if we think too hard about The Platform, but the point isn't that its system makes perfect sense (as mentioned, ""the point"" may be quite the contrary). Instead, we are meant to ponder what this dystopian vision has to say about our present.Of course, Goreng at first figures that there may be enough sustenance for everyone in the Pit if everyone simply takes ""what they need"" when the platform passes their level, but soon realizes this won't be enough to fix a system that's broken at the core. Do you get it yet?The obvious joke is that one wishes they had a statist of some sort to help them decide when everything's even (in fairness, Goreng arguably becomes such a figure near Act 3 and begins to appear corrupt in his own right), but this may be dismissive. As mentioned, however, more questions arise when you think too hard about the metaphor. Should we distribute our resources in such a way that convicted murderers are more fairly treated? And are we prone to shuffling said convicts around so that some of them may experience luxurious food for a month or two while the rest starve (or worse) until we press ""Shuffle"" again? Or are the serial killers merely an exaggeration of ""criminals molded by the system"" - like, say, the Kims from Parasite?This film is mighty entertaining to watch as it unfolds, even if some of it breaks a little when you overthink it (though not as much as the aforementioned Us, in my opinion). Its character relationships are believable in how they form and how they crumble, the production design is splendidly minimalistic, the gore is fun but not meaningless, and the music, lighting, and camera work do wonders for the tone. For the Covid-19 lockdown, it's almost too good a pick.It didn't really ""make me think"" the way a Tarkovsky film might (I checked off Stalker from my watchlist a few days prior to seeing this), although it did make me a bit hungry.",The Platform

I guess this is the best description I can come up with.It reminds me a little bit of the movie ""The Cube"". This surreal prison gets into your head, even when you are just watching it. And the acting helps to set the tone for this movie. Everyone is losing their minds and they have this grim... spirit... surronding them. Surviving at all cost.Most people would find this a hard movie to watch. Not only because it is graphic, but because it is also quite... idle. The only scenario is this prison and what keeps us going is the need to know what will happen.Character development is good.

I don't use the word visceral in any endearing meaning either, because it is all very superficial here. The violence and blood isn't used to capatilize on deaths of characters we have learned to love or to drive the plot forward. It isn't even used as a means to an end. The director just decided this is going to be a wildly violent representation of capitalistic ideology. Interesting as a thought piece but executed without enough style.",The Platform

100,drunken_munki,An original idea executed well,8,6 October 2020,"I think this movie had an amazing thought process behind it. The basic plot shows prisoners who applied for a position in a place called the hole (for a shorter sentence, a diploma, and other personal motivations). This place has a single column of cells, each with 2 inmates.A food platform travels down once a day and the inmates have 2 minutes to eat. There are several key characters met by the protagonist in this movie, and in the end a lot of the intricate rules and weird themes are explained at face value by some of these characters.But what is really interesting to me is that many of them are unreliable, and either don't have all the facts or in some cases are lying.This film provoked many ideas and thoughts from me, and reading reviews online there are some really cool theories of what the hole represents. Some say it is a commentary on society, on greed, a representation of purgatory even.The ending was a little short and rushed in my view, could have been better.8/10 must watch, however.",The Platform

103,TuesdayThe17th,Great Spanish cannibal horror movie,9,26 March 2020,"Great Spanish horror film catered to Americans. The genre doesn't have enough cannibal movies and this is a very worthy addition to the small collection of them. However, this is a bit more than just that. This movie delivers a very similar message to Ben Wheatley's ""High Rise"" but with maybe a bit of a lower budget and ""The Platform"" is horror as opposed to thriller/drama. There seems to be much symbolism here and quite a bit to chew on, however the first 20 minutes will have you pausing the film to look at your friend and just give him a ""wtf?"" Type of look as the structure and dialogue is like nothing you've seen. The mystery runs mildly deep but I feel the elaboration was lacking heavily.

I feel it was quite lazy, such and open ending. Many people like this, and thinking about a good ending themselves, I like the end of the story to close it, so I can process better what's been told.

110,tvcarsd,Many flaws but unfolds nicely,8,9 August 2021,"Puns aside, you can argue that this movie is very entertaining. Immediately I got The Cube vibes from this movie and gore wise its not disappointing either. Here we revisit the idea of being put in a giant puzzle of sorts enduring a survival situation but this time around we get some social commentary along the way.I had to laugh at the thought of people panic buying these days and watching these prisoners act in very similar ways. El Hoyo is without a doubt one of the more creative horrors I have seen in a good while but it does have the typical 'creative flaws' as well where it becomes obvious that much more effort was put into making this movie engaging over closing up any realistic or just rational flaws in regards to what I thought people would be more likely to do. Which is usually fine with me but this movie had them stacked up on top of each other.The idea of people being paired up and placed in a vertical prison with only several meters separating them with a levitating platform that comes down through the 100's of levels once per day with food for them. So the people at the bottom are obviously in the worst position, and the social commentary goes on.There are explanations for why people don't do one thing or another but it doesn't really make sense. However, watching people fight it up and crap on each other literally is why you would want to see this movie, strictly for the crass and violent entertainment value. I enjoyed it and if you liked The Cube you probably will too.",The Platform

Don't be put off that the movie is dubed it's done well enough to be watchable. The plot works on a simple enough premises, the main focus is on the characters we meet and the main problem they all have in common. We learn alot from each of the characters, in turn allowing us to learn more about the 'hole'. This movie ask alot of question you don't nessiarly get the answers too and this is because I feel the director is asking alot of us, the audience. There is alot more to this than would seem. So much to think about, the ideas presented are deep. Yes it's set in the 'hole' but you can't help but see how this applies in a wider sense to society. This movie is not for everyone, while I would consider this as mainly being a thriller it has horrifically dark moments. I would concede thriller though because it does't have cheap jump scares nor monsters, the scary part is all human nature. We are what we eat.",The Platform

113,keelhaul-80856,"Great concept, but needed a tighter ending. Communism is also being force fed.",6,22 March 2020,"This movie really had me intrigued, in the vein of others like The Circle, Snowpiercer, etc. It has a good cast, dark atmosphere, and a feeling of dread and despair throughout. It is great for futuristic sci-fi fans, horror fans, gore hounds, mystery lovers, or dystopian fans. Most people will be drawn in to the basic but puzzling premise.However, as so many other films of late, it is obvious that the globalist message and communist manifesto messages are hard at work to plant themselves into your brain. In fact, early on, the man's cellmate even says to him, ""What the hell are You? A communist?"" I knew that more PC brainwashing was in store for us from there. Still, I will give the writers credit for showing some valid realities about world history and societies, which are somewhat inevitable in human existence thus far.Even with the best intentioned communists, there WILL ALWAYS BE A HIERARCHY. Just as in Orwell's Animal Farm, SOME ANIMALS ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS. I guess that is the most disturbing fact that I worry about most people not comprehending-- they are returning to some lust for socialism, communism, cultural Marxism, and the belief that governments of man can solve all human problems and inequality, while stamping out and silencing the ""evil dissenters"". The problem is that humanity is infinitely flawed and corrupt, regardless, and these supposedly universal and benevolent systems end up flipping on the masses just like capitalism, monarchy, or any other previous system they rail against. At least with capitalism and free markets-- you actually have a chance to do better and have somewhat of a voice and free will, whether you make it or not. The past century has clearly shown us that capitalism is far superior, as is giving the public incentives to earn wealth and barter as they choose. It is not perfect, but neither is humanity. Communism in its modern form is really just another means for bankers to liquidate and control the wealth, assets, and lives of the sheep, for the elite party at the top. It is not the grassroots workers movement for equality it masquerades itself to be. For more on this, study the Russian Revolution, and how it was widely financed and associated with bankers, Western sympathizers, and secret societies with other goals in mind.All that aside, the movie was still good, but could have been much better with a little longer runtime that develops the plot and ends with more satisfaction. As It winds to a close, it seems to run out of time to wrap up the story, and has to rush to a disappointing plot hole conclusion. They didn't have to reveal ALL of the mystery, but having a few more details or reveals would not hurt, and some of the plot holes around the Asian lady and the kid are a bit unfulfilling. I say 6 or 7, but the first half is more close to a 9. Just don't get caught up too much in all the Hollywood echo chamber nonsense and globalist conditioning-- to the point you sign your wealth and success away to elitist overlords who will simply turn the tables back around on you themselves...",The Platform

I don't often see movie trailers with English subtitles that peak my interest so much I anticipate it's release for over 8 months. Since so many films have been let downs through out the years it's really great when a film isn't just what you expect but over delivers on so many levels. ""The Platform"" fits that description to a T. From the start the mystery and intrigue of this detention center is magnified by not only the prisoners but the administration that caters to them. Some disturbing movies aren't so much driven by an original idea layered with intelligence and thought provoking content, Most rely heavy on shock value and cynicism. That is not the case with ""The Platform"" it contains all of those attributes and delivers them brilliantly at a pace that keeps you glued to the screen from the opening until the closing credits.

Also how did they see the protagonist in the beginning put an apple in his pocket when they don't seem to see anything else that happens like men trying to escape? There are no cameras anywhere. Never showed how murdered bodies were removed. They could not just leave them the odor of a rotting body is like nothing else on this Earth it is so horrible it wouod all but kill you the breathing it in. Everyone is telling us what the meaning of the ambiguous ending met.

It's highly philosophic on the one hand, but has no real learning content at the end, on the other hand. The best of the movie is the atmosphere and the attempts of some characters to cope with an unfair system, which the platform symbolizes. It tied me to the screen for the whole playtime, which not many movie are able, but on the other hand it has an unfinished conclusion, plays with stereotypes. I 'm not mad about an open end. Many movies with open end are great. But this one seems to be a cheap trick to not show they had no clue of how ton end this storry. All in all, I recommend that movie to people who like suspense and can take some bad visual violence. I would not recommend it to sensitive people who can't stand violence. But yes, this movie is really suspensefull, specially for the first time watching it. All-in-all it is worthy to watch it.",The Platform
119,snowfre,Thought-invoking and tense throughout with strong acting,8,15 April 2020,"""The Platform"" is a horror movie with a unique synopsis and setting; it follows Goreng (Massagué) who checks in at a self-management center where the guests live at various platforms while being fed by a table of food at a platform that descents through the over 300 floors. This is a source of conflict as the lower the platform comes, the less food it is left. ""The Platform"" deals effectively with issues such as solidarity, redistribution, power, human flaws, without ever being patronizing. The symbolism is also there, with me personally, at occasions, thinking of the Last Supper. What ""The Platform"" also succeeds with, besides being a good horror film and a strong asset in the Netflix library, is remaining interesting from start to finish, when covering the changes in behavior and decrease in optimism from Goreng. Initially reluctant to indulge in the food offered, he soon picks up the habit of his roommate Trimagasi (wonderfully played by Zorion Eguileor). As he switches between the floors, he experience everything from people motivated by their belief in the good of the human nature, and brutal cannibalism as last resort. The horror in ""The Platform"" isn't delivered as jump scares or supernaturalism, but rather the human psychology and the conviction that the film's scenarios could play out similarly in real life. Regarding the ending, initially I was slightly disappointed, as I desired a look on what was taking place at the top of the building as well as a reason for the whole, what I perceived as an, experiment. However, I soon felt content with the ending, which I felt completed the character arc of Goreng in a good manner, as he and witnessed the child ascend on the platform. ""The Platform"" isn't a movie to please your average horror flick cravings, but it is a film that makes you contemplate, while still serving as a good addition to the genre.",The Platform
120,skullhead739,Great idea made mediocre,5,2 April 2020,"Just saying first off that I watched this dubbed on Netflix however didnt take away from the overall expierence and hinder this review.Acting:
Decent acting by all involved, pretty strange overall though. Some scenes they act as if their on a holiday and other scenes they're terrified.Cinematography:
Scenes and set design were all well done and felt real and creepy. This isnt the highest of budgets but like with saw they made the most out of a simple concept, small set and interesting idea.Story:
Not much of a story here besides people are stuck on a platform. On paper it sounds really interesting and the 1st 30mins it is very interesting. Later on it gets very random and veered away from what made it good to start with. They have dumb ideas and the whole time just try feeding people equally the whole movie. All other problems they face get erased very quickly and then the film ends with no real conclusion.. just a mess of scenes sequenced together. It's like they thought of the idea and was so excited they rushed through everything else, it has major plot holes and unanswered questions.Summary:
I would only suggest this if you are insanely bored and dont mind dubbed films. But seriously I'm sure you could find a ton of movies more worth your time.",The Platform

123,Golden_Hope,Such a Interesting Idea That Leaves You Hungry For More,7,24 May 2020,"I really enjoyed this movie particularly at the start. The first chunk is great when the lead and the first 'cell mate' are talking. The dialogue is great and really sharp.This momentum carries in for most of the movie, how ever It did seem to grid to a holt somewhere in the third act and to be honest it was the tail end of the 3rd act.It has lots of build up and mystery and come the third act they set it up like they are gonna get some answers and they are gonna make a change and then it's just like flat. You keep waiting for something to happen and then it doesn't. There is a plot twist? At the end but then it still just kinda limps on for another ten minutes till the credits roll.The allegory is also very in your face but works for the most part. My interpretation is that it is an allegory for societal classes and rich vs poor. But it doesn't make much sense. They are, to me randomly assigned a floor each month so that isn't a class that is just ever changing. One mouth you are the rich and then next you are the poor. I do understand that in it's self is interesting as you never know where you will land so you need to treat everyone well. I guess I wish the actions determined where they landed but maybe that would be a different movie.I also would have loved to explore the world more. This idea is so Intriguing, why was this facility made, who are the administration, does anyone ever leave alive? I feel like this movie could have delved deeper into the lore of this world and really fleshed it out and coloured it in a bit more.So like I said I think the majority of this movie is great but there are just some points that kinda knock it down for me but they don't ruin the film so give it a watch",The Platform

The movie isn't a realistic movie by any means nor does it even obey the laws of physics, though it takes itself very serious at the same time. In that aspect I didn't find it an enjoyable watch...Going into this movie I saw it had a high score and simply involved a vertical prison, so I'm thinking Shawshank of a more abstract sense, and went in hopeful. I didn't read anything about it being a 100% symbolic movie relating to capitalism or social classes and had I known that I wouldn't have watched it. Me personally, I tend to prefer movies purely for their entertainment value, that's not to say I don't like a good thinkers movie such as Interstellar or Inception, but on average I don't like movies driven by a political message, and that's really all this movie is, and the purpose for me writing this review is to let others know.So... Knowing that you may find this movie really appealing and the acting itself is pretty good. I found the first few minutes very intriguing as you are immersed into this world / prison with no information and basically put in the shoes of the main character, and I do like movies where you're just thrown into something not knowing what the heck is going on. However after a few minutes I started to realize pretty quickly that the prison, the people, and everything in the movie is a symbol for a capitalistic society that is striving to be a communistic one given the limited resources, at least that was my take on it. I'm sure others would relish the opportunity to debate every single aspect of this movie from the platform itself down to the escargot, and point out the 101 symbolistic meanings, but for me I find this very uninteresting. If anything I watch movies to escape reality and be entertained, not to dive into the heart of the socialistic onion, meanwhile I'm being bounced out of the movie as I start to wonder ""So how is that platform actually moving up and down again?""So yeah, in the end I can see the appeal this movie may have on political revolutionists, those heavy into symbolism or as a philosophical class project. But for those who enjoy movies purely for entertainment value this may not be your gig. In the end I gave it a 3/10 not because I didn't like it (well that may have some contribution), but because while it's somewhat original I didn't find it that deep or thought provoking other than the obvious ""this is representative of that, wash, rinse & repeat..."" Not to mention I just found a lot of things ridiculous, stupid, and in some cases devoid of any fundamental laws of physics",The Platform
127,marc5477,"Good FIlm, Nutty Reviews",7,31 August 2020,"The movie was interesting and kept me wanting to see how things play out. The idea is that there is a prison that is designed vertically. Each level has a wide hole in the center which is the only the way in and out. Food is made at the top then brought down to each floor where it spends a few minutes for the prisoners to eat then whatever is left continues down to the next floor and each week or so the prisoners switch floors. The movie plays humans behaving like animal vs the humans ability to reason with time being the intermediary factor. Its interesting but not as deep or profound as reviews make it out to be.I did not like how the prison was not well explained nor the idea that people couldn't control themselves. The unbelievable behavior felt more like a play to push a narrative than something that comes naturally in such a situation. This is where reviewers swoop in and give their interpretation of what was happening and apply symbolism and other childish things to make the movie more than it was. Its all nonsense and I think they just ran out of money to flesh out the story better. As many state, the ending was somewhat rushed and silly so obviously money was a factor or they just ran out of ideas. Still this was a fun watch. Give it a go.",The Platform

It can hold around 200 dishes, which will not sustain a group of 600 people, not by feeding them 1 dish a day for months on end.

131,theredsky,The Platform Review,6,31 March 2020,"The Platform came out of nowhere on Netflix last week and I decided to watch it. I thought it was good. It wasn't great but it's better than most films being released on Digital or on Netflix. If you have seen the 2013 film Snowpiercer, then you might detect some similarities between the two. I thought this would be an issue at first but by the end of it, I realized it wasn't too similar to Snowpiercer. Their themes about class and wealth are similar but each film does their own separate thing with those ideas. The Platform takes the themes of class and wealth and says that everyone has a shot at being at the top while Snowpiercer uses those themes for the poor in the back and wealthy at the front. As the film progresses, the similarities start to disappear and its originality starts to shine. The characters are interesting to watch develop and learn about this prison. The performances, for the most part, were decent. We are only introduced to about 4 other characters that interact with the lead and they all did fine. The lead actor, Iván Massagué, did a great job though. He successfully manages to portray someone who doesn't understand what he put himself through with this prison. There are certain points where the main character is in severe pain and his reaction to it is very disturbing. That's also something I like about the film, it's very disturbing. There is a lot of blood and very gruesome moments that could be hard to watch for some. I highly recommend not eating food during this. The film excels in some of its technical aspects but falls below average in others. The score was good although repetitive and sometimes overbearing and the editing was not great. It was choppy and rushed and took away tension from certain scenes but the cinematography and visuals are great. This prison has multiple levels with a hole just in the middle so the food cart can come down. Whenever characters peer down the hole, it looks very really as if this place actually exists. There are points in the film where we do see dead bodies and they also look horrifyingly real. Overall, The Platform is a brutal story with decent/good performances, great visuals and cinematography even if it can be a little confusing with choppy editing and overbearing music.",The Platform

143,manuel_medeiros,"Aside from the ending, it's a very decent movie that makes you think",7,14 April 2020,"I believe the greatest testament to El Hoyo achievement as a film is its IMDb review section.Most user reviews share their own interpretation of the movie, discuss the symbolisms evoked rather than comment on the film itself. Which is one another way of saying - El Hoyo is definitely thought-provoking.The premise is simple but engaging, and definitely what attracts most people to the movie -
There is a vertical prison, with two inmates per floor. Each day, there's a platform with food that starts at level Zero with a banquet. As each pair of inmates goes through the food, less is left for the ones below. You cannot keep food from one day to the other. Therefore, the lower level you are, the harder it is to feed yourself, although you move levels each month.The plot alone creates for enough tension and debate. The interactions between floors and each inmates cause enough tension to keep the audience on edge. Because the inmates you follow have different views on the functioning and survival within El Hoyo, that results in several philosophical debates, which reverberate in the review section here.There is a fair share of gore (both food and blood wise), which may put some people off. Personally, I have seen worse.I definitely valued the tension and the gripping aspect of the movie. The only thing I disliked was the ending, because it leaves to much room for interpretation. I would much rather see the filmmaker take a clearer stand on the matter. Perhaps they did - but I did not think it was the one the movie was leading up to.All in all, it is surely an innovative movie and definitely worth a watch.

Yes, it's meant to be an analogy of the greed of Capitalism, cool, fine.The plot holes though just really shot this film down for me. Let's go over my issues with it.WHY would anyone earn a degree of any kind by asking to be put into a prison? The whole degree thing just makes no sense at all, and is never explained.WHATS with the goofy hallucinations? Again, they add absolutely NOTHING to the film.How was it the woman seemingly EVERYDAY was riding up and down, and never found the kid? If she's on it, then shouldn't we assume she's likely going all the way down to the final floor??This is the biggest one of all. So this kid has been on the very final floor ALL this time, and is perfectly okay, beyond level 300+, while people on anything below level 80+, people are eating each other....? No food is usually making it past level 60, so how is the kid on level 330 (I think?) surviving...? And it's clear that the kid for whatever reason ISNT being moved like the rest, because the crazy mother obviously would've quickly found her then.Why was there a kid in it?Why was the kid never moved?What's with all the Jesus junk thrown in?? He brought people food, so he's akin to Jesus in some way?What makes the kid ""the message""? In what way is the kid a message?Are we to assume that no one is going to snatch the kid off the lift while it's going back up to eat HER??Why did he get off at the end and walk away randomly?These are all questions that I don't believe have an answer. It's not a matter of ""not getting it"". There is a huge difference between, being clever, having to think...and flat out just being random, and making no sense.I also do NOT think we always need everything wrapped up and fully answered, such as ""why does this exist?"" Sometimes part of the horror is just that we don't know why, but what I've listed are WAY WAY too many things that get zero answering in any kind of way besides pure guesses.There is being mysterious, and just making no logical sense in a movie that's supposed to be based in a real world situation.I got a good laugh though when they literally pooped on the guys face trying to climb up.",The Platform

I loved the acting and every one's performance. I wasn't unfamiliar with a lot of the Spanish actors, but that doesn't negate the fact that they were all great. I did recognize one actress, though and that's Antonia San Juan. I really enjoyed this movie overall. Be prepared for a lot of violence and sometimes the movie leads you into unexpected cannibalism among prisoners and don't let the fact that the entire movie is dark and you'll miss something of pertinence if you look away.

167,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,Platform of Empty Promises,6,18 April 2020,"Welcome back quarantine-mates! I hope you all are staying safe out there and staying home. We'll continue to review some interesting flicks for you. This weekend we have for you Platform. It's from 2019, but it is just now hitting the pinnacle of Netflix lore in March of 2020. The idea behind Platform is that we follow Ivan Massague, as Goreng, as he's stuck in a ""vertical prison"" with one cell per level, 2 people per cell, and the only food provided to the cells comes down on a platform in the middle of the cell and two minutes per day to feed all of the levels. Let's see how Goreng's experience turns out.First things first, I papa freaks all the hunnies.... bunnies. Wrong first thing. I digress. First, this movie is in Spanish, originally. I chose to watch with the dubbed English. I understand that creates a difficulty for some people. I suggest, if you watch this, put on the dubbed version and keep it pushing. The voices are annoying and the writing is tragic. If I hear the word ""obviously"" again in the next couple of days, I'm slapping that person on site! Those of you who watched know exactly what I mean.Second, the idea of the movie is intriguing. For those horror/thriller cinephiles out there, picture a combination of the Cube series mixed with The Belko Experiment and Saw or Escape Room (minus games). Stating that, I've said too much but maybe I've also peaked your interest. If I take all the great points of those movies, then we'd be on the right track. Platform is not on that track. In the gory and gross categories, Platform can stand a slight chance. Otherwise, this movie lacks depth. Sure, the concept is interesting until you realize you're just watching a different version of the Cube with food (because how did those people in Cube survive without food?!... neither here nor there). It's ironic to say the movie lacks depth when the whole movie harps on how deep/far the platform goes down! The writers were on to something, but it feels like they just gave up half-way through and said, ""Yeah this is too stupid even for us. Let's just get Netflix to pay us for content.""Finally, this movie lacks resolution and any real explanation. Even though my description states that it's a prison, Platform never explicitly acknowledges whether it really is a prison. Oh, these idiots are locked in alright but what country started this prison system. Shoot! This might be a more effective deterrent to crime than our actual system, but alas we'll never find out. Social experiment vs. Prison reform? You'll never find out.Needless to say, thank God this movie came to streaming only. Forget that the movie has subtitles or poor dubbing, Platform has no direction. That's difficult to say for a movie that literally just goes up and down for an hour and half. For my horror/thriller fans out there... you'll get your handful of popcorn out of this but everyone else this is a single popped kernel that if you're desperate and not squeamish I'd say pop in.",The Platform

Utter mostly the ending thrown me in to speechless and much difficult situation !The film set in a tower type prison. Where people fed by platform that gradually descending level of the tower, each person suppose to their share of food only but inequitable practice people at the top ability to take much food leave less food to bottom people !Writer's #daviddesola #pedrorivero wrote a thin and strong storyline with some significant amount of emotions ! Director #galdergazteluurrutia succeeded while creating their world and gain more acknowledge, appreciation around the globe !The Great thing about #elhoyo is ending events and the child episode.To some degree, the two embrace the dog-eat-dog attitude that runs through the prison, becoming tainted by their sacred mission. For survival's sake, they've already engaged in murder and cannibalism - that's why the purity represented by the child is so important.The girl is both a symbol of humanity's resilience through tyranny, and an indication that change can only come from the youth. But metaphorically speaking, the girl is the future, and likely the only hope humanity has left.I couldn't say it's far better film than #Parasite but I'm damn sure it's perfectly equal to it in the sense of greatness !",The Platform
169,ups-36964,Better than i expected,9,16 April 2020,"My previous experience with netflix was not so good. I watched the 3rd season of money heist, and tbh, it was really disappointed and not as good as the first two. So, i lost interest in spanish shows. But, then this one popped up on my recommendedation. I clicked on it by mistake, and i gotta say, it's one of the best mistakes i've ever made.El hoyo is a satirical sci fi thriller movie, which comments on the society we live in. It's one of the best movies in this genre (after parasite). The best is that it doesn't follows any particular propaganda. It does criticizes capitalism, but it doesn't say we should adopt communism as an alternative. Now, coming back to the movie, Goreng is a man who intentionally joins a prison for degree (i mean wtf) and after going in, things don't go as it was meant to be. People go ferocious and de humanised out of hunger. Food is a great symbolism here. A platform starts from 0 level, waits for 2 min at each level and goes on until the last level. The problem is that no one knows how many levels are actually there. Lack of hunger ignites cannibalism, rape, assault and murder in the prison. Overall, a great movie and the background score ia just awesome and chilling. 8/10",The Platform
170,Luv2Spooge,A gritty reflection on the nature of man,7,9 August 2021,"Some people were praising this film as a model for socialism, but after consideration I disagree. The film is not really about politics as much as it is a reflection of the human soul. As most commented and also reflected in the theme of the film, if only the people worked together and rationed their food, care about their common man, etc... everyone would've survived and be fed. However, human nature is self-serving, insecure, and resorting to violence even in order to survive. This was well depicted in the film even when the protagonist tries to ration the food, they were met with hostility. It's not the system that's the problem, but the innate human condition that must be changed.Overall, it is kind of disgusting, but I suppose it is necessary to express the reality of how disgusting our human soul can be.",The Platform

Not Worth It.",5,21 March 2020,"The Platform has a unique idea of ""allegory sci-fi horror"" which kinda reminds me of Circle (2015) though has a entirely different plot. That being said, the premise is intriguing and has a lot of promise. Unfortunately, that's pretty much it. Just empty promises of the premise. The story became very stagnant with poorly written character. There are a lot of plot holes, but the 2 major plot holes that really bothers me is :
1. How in the effing that the little girl ended up there in the first place. It's explained that the Administration have a very strict policy about children. And there is no way that insane asian woman gave birth to the kid since she's at least 9 years old. And how the heck did the girl survive with no food at all at the bottom level ?
2. If the inmates can move levels with the thing that distributing the food, LOGICALLY the person from the bottom can easily go to the top. Heck, even that insane asian woman did it multiple times. BUT SURE, NO ONE THINKS ABOUT IT.To top it all of, the ending is extremely and i mean, extremely horrible. The black guy ended up randomly dead. AND OF COURSE THE MAIN CHARACTER HAS TO KILLED HIMSELF EVEN AFTER ALL HE DID, WHY NOT ? AM I RIGHT ?
The ending is utterly annoying, there's no need for the guy and that black guy to death. The three of them can just go to the top. BUT OF COURSE, IT'S A DARK FILM, THE ENDING SHOULD BE SOMEWHAT DEPRESSING EVEN IF THEY NEED TO SACRIFICE GOOD WRITING.

176,terrencepatrix,Brutal,7,21 March 2020,"Let me get this right from the get go...this movie is not a 7 in the broad scheme of movies, not at all. It is a 7 in a very bizarre genre where ethics, morals, and poor taste are enclosed within a small space.This movie is disgusting, violent, somewhat graphic, and hard to watch at times. It also just plain doesn't make any dang sense throughout much of it. But I do think it was a fantastic watch!The synopsis explains the basics of the film so I won't bother and waste time. This is a film about how whoever is at top abuses those below them and how that dynamic can shift at any time. And while logic tells us we should adjust our behavior to make things better over time....we really don't. We just repeat the abuse and send it back down over and over never learning our lesson. This is an extreme literal interpretation of our behavior as a society and it is delivered with depravity, blood, and violence.There is an overall message of hope at it's core, but it is literally insulated in blood and viscera. Minds are warped and broken, people die by the scores, everyone is a monster, and yet there is a message of hope at the very end. This movie lays bare how ugly we really are at our core as a people and society, and not in a subtle way. It's pretty brutal and often gross.I enjoyed it. I don't know if you will.",The Platform

The next 30 minutes, went nowhere and I dismissed this as, 'too long a presentation of prisoner's dilemma'. The final 30 minutes were repetitive fight scenes.

I am sticking with my first impression.

179,Jackblyth8,Something Really Special,9,9 February 2021,"The Spanish sci-fi presents prisoners held in vertical cells, those at the top of the building watch those at the bottom starve. Supporting socialism, the film refers to an uneven class system and the problems of capitalism. The lead protagonist - Goreng - meaning ""fried"" in Indonesia, is played by Ivan Massague. The spectacle centres around him and his emotions, used as a socialists mouthpiece to reiterate the importance of helping others. Set in the future, Goreng awakes surrounded by thick concrete walls in cell 48, he meets his cell mate Trimagasi and elderly man who teaches Goreng about the 'platform facility' stating that everyday a platform of food descends from the top, each cell have time to eat before the platform continues its trek downwards; eventually, due to the prisoners towards the top eating carelessly, the platform is empty by the time it reaches the lower cells, causing people to suffer, he mentions that the cell will drastically drop or rise in temperature if food is hoarded. Each prisoner is allowed to bring in an item of their choice, Goreng's being a copy of Don Quixote and Trimagasi being a sharp samurai knife. One day, the platform arrives on the pair's cell, on top is a dubious girl named Miharu who Trimagasi explains comes down every month in search for her child. The two inmates explain their reasons of arrest, Goreng tells Trimagasi that he volunteered to enter the prison in an act of giving up smoking, mentioning that in return he will receive a diploma. Trimagasi admits he was arrested for manslaughter after throwing his TV out of his flat window in anger, unintentionally flattening a civilian. One morning, Goreng is tied to his bed by Trimagasi, the protagonist realises that the pair have been moved, as a part of the monthly scheme, to cell number 171, where the duo will most likely receive no food, Trimagasi proposes that he cuts flesh from Goreng for them both to eat. Furious, Goreng mocks his elderly inmates decision making and questions his choices. Shortly after, Miharu arrives at their cell and attacks Trimagasi, freeing Goreng who uses his partners knife to stab him multiple times, ruthlessly murdering him. Miharu stays and cuts off Trimagasi's flesh for herself and Goreng to eat, before she transmits herself lower in search of her child. In the third month, Goreng wakes in cell 33 with a woman, Imoguiri who he recognises as the prisons administration officer. She explains that she was unaware of the prisons unjust divide and used her terminal cancer as an excuse to come in and encourage change. Everyday, she requests the levels below to ration their food and keep portions for those below, but her attempts fail continuously. Goreng joins Imoguiri in her aim to store food for the inmates at the bottom. Goreng educates his new cell mate about Miharu and her goal, but Imoguiri states that no children under 16 are admitted into the prison. The following month, Goreng wakes on level 202 to see Imoguiri has hanged herself, he eats her flesh in order to survive, experiencing hallucinations from her and Trimagasi. At the start of the fifth month, a weak Goreng wakes on level 6, where food comes in its abundance. His new cell mate, Baharat, unsuccessfully attempts to climb to the next level. Goreng takes Imoguiri's ideologies and convinces Baharat, because their cell is high up, to hand out rations to each cell mate and save food for those at the bottom. Reluctant at first, Baharat joins Goreng in possessing two metal pipes as they stand on top of the food platform, handing out each persons food, and hitting anyone who refuses to cooperate. They estimate that the prison surpasses 250 sells and during their journey they come across Miharu who had been attacked by two inmates, Goreng and Baharat try to save her but can't and injure themselves in the act. They eventually reach level 333 where the platform stops. Goreng identifies a young child hiding under a bed, Miharu's child that Trimagasi spoke about. The two men get off the platform and understand it is a girl, who they assume is in desperate need of nutrition. They give her an untouched panna cotta that they had been guarding as a ""message"" to the Administrators at the top. Goreng passes out and hears Baharat telling him that ""the girl is the message"". The next day, Goreng wakes to see that Baharat has died due to his multiple wounds; when the platform arrives, he takes Miharu's daughter to the bottom of the pit where he once again sees Trimagasi who tells his past cell mate that ""the message requires no bearer"", Goreng steps off the platform and walks into the distance with Trimagasi, they both turn and watch the young girl ascend. 'The Platform', lasting for 94 minutes, manifests an uneven class divide, using the food as a motif for money and having those at the top wealthy, and those at the bottom disenfranchised. Urrutia uses the darkness as pathetic fallacy, emphasising the consequences of capitalism, and highlighting the integral ideology that the rich have a moral obligation to help and support the poor, not exploit them.

The quality of the film lies in the colors, in the eyes of the characters, in the fear through them. The soundtrack deserves a 10 and the setting of the film is spectacular. That itself is not a movie for everyone. It is a movie for those who are able to see beyond and imagine a dystopian world where these things can definitely happen. The film is a social experiment that leads the viewer to think about how to survive in pressing circumstances when there are few but existing means.

190,Diablo1616,Good Movie,6,29 March 2020,"El Hoyo, a surprise hit at last year's Toronto Film Festival, is a suspenseful, dramatic and extremely gory sci-fi/thriller movie from Spanish debutant director Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia.The film begins with a man named Goreng (renowned actor Ivan Massague in a brilliantly understated performance) regaining consciousness on the 48th floor of a concrete prison with just one other 'convict' for company - the seemingly wise yet suspiciously reserved Trimiagi.Goreng's elderly companion quickly explains the only stipulation of their confinement whilst serving their time. A large platform full of delicious and extravagant food travels downwards from the top floor of the prison to the bottom, stopping briefly at each level. However, the further down your floor of residence is will determine how much, if any, food you will eat that month until you are randomly relocated to another level.The movie is genuinely enjoyable and Netflix is now garnering a reputation for streaming high quality foreign language movies which the mainstream UK and US audiences may otherwise not come across.However, this dystopian effort, which mixes themes of capitalist arrogance, social conscience and, to more of an extent, communist paranoia, has one MAJOR flaw.All truly great science fiction movies have one thing in common - an original concept.This does not.Comparisons with Bong Joon-Ho's Snowpiercer and the 1997 cult classic Cube are obvious but what is even more apparent is that the entire premise of The Platform is almost identical to Ben Wheatley's movie High Rise which was released less than 5 years ago.It's a shame as there are so many clever aspects to this movie that you want to run out and recommend it to people but if I was asked to describe it to a friend I would automatically reply that it's very similar to Snowpiercer but without the humour, the visual effects and the general sense of fun. And Tilda Swinton is not in it which is never a good thing.All in all though, the acting is sound, it's entertaining, it keeps you on your toes and it will be one of the better shock-horror movies that you will see this year. As a massive independent sci-fi fan however, I'm keeping my fingers crossed that, in terms of that genre, there is much better to come in the next 8 months.Word of warning: Whilst essentially a science fiction/thriller movie, this is not a film for the faint hearted as murder, cannibalism, sexual violence and extreme gore are all on the menu.6/10",The Platform

People are forced or willing to enter this platform, they have to survive under the established system. Some people carry weapons (violence), some people carry books (civilization). In the upper layer that can be full, there is naturally a room for civilization, and in the lower layer, which is also full of stomachs. Fortunately, you can eat the leftovers of the upper layer, and the bottom can only eat. Under this system (the food and clothing are not resolved), it is not feasible to use civilized reforms. Self-discipline is contrary to human nature. Therefore, we must start from the outside world and force changes. So the system is cold-blooded, but the people at the top may still have a touch of humanity. Passing on the signal to pray for the managers to be touched is actually the last low-level resistance of the people at the bottom. The setting of the film is really wonderful.

195,jcarlos-96740,A good society satire with a rushed ending,7,1 April 2020,"The plot is good and very well constructed. It's pretty obvious that this was all a metaphor and the levels represented the different classes in society and we can assume that ""El Hoyo"" is the world and the administration are the governments. The upper levels eat good and prosper but the lower you are the less food you have, witch often leads to murder and therefore canibalism. A person who is sent to a lower level, despite having been before in a upper level and even having good moral etics like the main character, can still be corrupted and become a killer and a cannibal which represents a thing that I've always have defended: everybody is a killer all you gotta do is push them to the limits! In certain conditions the survival instinct takes command and you gotta do what you gotta do because there isn't enough ""food"" for everyone.Technically it's a pretty decent movie although in a movie like this it's hard to make it bad technically because the main thing is the message. The actors also did a great job!
Despite all these good points that poor ending kinda ruined it all because it puts in question everything that you just had been watching. I love interpretative ending but these one arises a ton of questions and give none: how is the little girl on the level 333? How is there a leve 333 if a women who used to work there said there were only 200? Did she lied or she simply didn't knew? How is there a child when they said nobody underage gets in? The women who interviews people said that the Asian female got in ten years ago and she had no family so she couldn't have a daughter, was she lying? And even if she was if the asian really got in 10 years ago the kid had to be a baby back there so did a baby survived ten years alone? Now it's easy to assume that Goreng could've been out of his mind and had imagined that all due to the starvings and all the things he had been through because he was still seeing dead people but if that was the case how could his friend have seen the child too? Were they both crazy? Or did his friend died before they even got there and he imagined the rest?
And at the end he let's the little girl to go up alone and gets out of the platform and then he leaves to met his dead friend and walk with him, so does that walk with a dead buddy meant that he died? He was imagining it all too? It was all a dream? Was even anything of this real?The questions are loud and numerous but even thought that poor crafted ending I'll still give it a 7 because this still deserved to be watched and reflected upon, if we ignore that ending this is still a good movie but if they managed to end it properly this would be gold!",The Platform

Well, he/she never came.The whole idea of a message was pointless, because the people in level 0 are just slaves focusing on the perfect presentation (they probably don't even know who will eat their food if they care so much about presentation actually) !The people in that experiment are selfish in a wrong way ; if they were self-centered enough to notice that their favorite meal was on the platform everyday, the whole experiment would have been a success.

maybe the table only goes up if there is not much weight on it- only the dishes. that could explain why our protagonist had to step away from the table, so that the little girl could go uppeople, no matter how bad they have it in life, still will think that it could be worse and they are scared of the unknown or something even worse than their level.people are hungry and gave up on life, so they don't even care anymore to go up (like people with depression)if you're on level 150 and don't get any food, you will either die of starvation, kill your roommate or just travel with the table to the next level to kill someone or get killed. but you still wouldn't want to go to the bottom. because you're scared what you might find there. that is the same case with our ego and soul. if you don't go deep, to the darkest bottom of yourself, you won't have a chance to go all the way up and enter greatness. you will just move between the levels and die somewhere inbetween. the question is if anyone even leaves the prison.people complain about the ending being stupid. but how would you feel about a different ending?
the protagonist and the little girl going up and getting out of prisonthem going up and getting kicked down in the pit from someone on level 0the administration ""realizing"" how messed up their prison is and releasing everyone or giving everyone their portion of food...
no matter how else it would have ended, we wouldn't be satisfied. the ending is supposed to be an open ending, because no one really understands the system, except for a few people on top. not even the cooks understand the system, not even the administration and especially not the prisoners. so why would we as viewers and as participants (and prisoners of capitalism) get a chance to see the full pictures, the outside or the mechanism? we are just pawns and are not worthy of knowing it and getting it explained for us. same as in the real world.
there is also a concept of freud's id, ego and superego in this movie. the id lives in the lower leves, where people's worse comes to the surface. where they betray and kill each other in order to survive. the ego is on the upper levels, where people live in piece, but also in selfishness. they try to get as much as they can for themselves (it's the normal state of most of us most of the time in our lives) and the superego is the godly unknown level 0, where everything is perfect- the food on the table is perfectly cooked and beautifully arranged. it's our strive to perfection and completeness.
you can look at this movie as being a criticism of our society, as being religious (dante's inferno or a story about jesus dying on the cross for us, where the little girl is the cross that's left), spiritual in any other way or however you want. it's thrilling and you will probably never forget it after you watched it.",The Platform

205,gabo_alepb,Gore in political times,10,29 March 2020,"My interpretation:
The movie is an examination of the 20th century, its ideologies and their consequences.Stage 1: The critique of CapitalismThe Hole is a social experiment conducted for a group of people called The Administration. They have examined the social cathastrophe produced by industrialization and globalization and are willing to find answers by creating a pyramide like structure where people are put randomly from level 1 to level 250. A huge meal buffet is produced in level 0 and is pulled down for people to eat, so the upper levels eat all the food and the down levels eat the leftovers. This will produce violence, starvation and cannibalism in down levels. People are randomly put in different levels after 1 month. People can wake up in level 2 in one month an the next one in level 200. They get to taste the difference. The administration selects people who have nothing to lose for this experiment.Stage 2: The eternal dream of SocialismTwo people inside the Hole (the most educated ones we are lead to presume) one young man who is willing to be a lab rat for a University Certificate and a woman who is a former worker from the Administration realize that the only way of ""fixing"" the system and claim social justice is to provide equal parts of the banquet. So they try to talk the people in the upper levels to share, but people don't like the idea since they know some day they might be in the down levels and starve so it's better to be prepared and we'll eaten. The plan to socialize the banquet fails. The woman kills herself.Stage 3: The inevitable rise of CommunismThe educated man reclutes a stronger muscle man and convinced him that he has tried to talk sense into people but people are too stupid and mean to realize that sharing is the way so the only solution is going down with the banquet and force the upper level people to starve in order people in the down levels can eat. They go into a violent tour killing every priviledge person in the upper levels who don't want to share. As they go down they realize that there are more than 200 levels, there are 333 levels. After level 250 food is gone. Not only they have become the monsters they wanted to stop, they have also realized there is no way to feed that many people.Stage 4 (Epilogue): The false promise of political change always leads to Nihilism.During the stage of Communism a wise man advise the two men that what is important is not what goes down (food) but what goes up (the silverware of the empty banquet) and they should send a message to the people in Administration. The message should say: We are stronger than you. You can't beat us. They choose to not let anybody eat a dessert and sent it back untouched to the Administration. When they reach the bottom of the Hole they find a little girl who miraculously haven't starved so they think this is a message also. They let the child eat the dessert and send her up to convince the Administration that, in spite of all the violence, inequity, cannibalism and starvation, there is hope in the world. The strong man dies and the idealistic educated man is left in the bottom talking to himself condemned to schizophrenia for trying to save the world. In the end they both forget to survive for a promise it's not clear they even believe.",The Platform
206,faroukgulsara,"The top, below and the will to fall.",8,1 April 2020,"The recent shopping spree shown by the public before an imminent lockdown following the Covid-19 shows how self-centred and selfish our society is. Some people stock up toilet rolls by the trolleys full just because they do not have to worry whether there is money left to be used for other things. The last thing on their mind is the fear of creating panic buying or that his fellow human will be struggling to get his.Some will blame the individual for such behaviour, whereas others will say that the system created such monsters.We should be the change that we want, it is easy to say. Unfortunately, we are worried about our survival that we care less for others. Perhaps, we should learn that the joy of being wealthy is not in spending capriciously but using it judiciously.The change in a broken system does not start from high above but from the people lower down the food chain. The ruling class do not see anything in the structure as it benefits them. Those in the lower rung are too disjointed and entrenched in their miseries that they feel helpless the corrupt. A change within the system needs to be initiated by the middle class to send a message to the ruling class that their system is broken and needed to be amended. This is a revolution. For this, there are people on the top, in the bottom and people who would fall for their cause in their course of action.This Spanish film tells us about the monster that capitalism, which exploits our primal desires, has created. Symbolically, it shows a vertical prison where food is transported via a platform from level 0 all the way down to level 333 (as we later discover. 2 persons per floor would make it 666 occupants. 666, being the devil's reference, show the demonic nature of Man to survive.).The problem is the people on the top floors gorge on the offering, leaving crumbs or nothing for the rest below. Sometimes, they had to resort to cannibalism. Every month, their levels are changed at random. The upper occupants of the jail feel it is their time to indulge as they may not be so lucky the following month.
The whole set-up stinks to high heavens, but no one is willing to take the lead to change or want to improve themselves. At the end of the day, someone had to take the fall to send a signal to the top by influencing the occupants of the bottom.Just like how Don Quixote who travelled around the Spanish countryside to write an account and to unite the people, here the protagonist goes through all the levels to send a message of change. His philosophies of life are heard loud and clear in this show. Maybe, there is a hint that religion that could be an unnecessary diversion. Somewhere in the dialogue, one justifies cannibalism for survival by quoting a phrase often linked to C
hristianity - whoever eats the flesh and drinks the blood will live for eternity. It may be a suggestion that religion only relieves with short-term problems, not in our long-term living situations. That needs a change of mindset, excellent leadership from the middle strata of society, one who is knowledgable (one who reads) and a revolution of thoughts.A thought-provoking one but not for the faint-hearted.",The Platform

Really obvious.,5,15 January 2021,"I'll say it up front: ""The Platform"" is a well produced, well acted drama that's entertaining enough and worth a watch in spite of its nauseating visuals and distasteful world view. It isn't as profound as some analyses in the user reviews would suggest, so I'll spare you any overwrought interpretations.Simply put, this film is a straightforward allegory about class and class warfare that asks the viewer to swallow some unpalatable, and extremely arguable, premises about the evils of capitalism, the moral superiority of socialism, and the depravity of human nature, while actively denying the concept of self determination and the very real phenomenon of social mobility.""The Platform"" hinges on a simple plot device. As a buffet of food travels ever lower in a vertical prison, those on the upper levels engage in gluttony, leaving those at the lower levels to starve. The implications are overt and none too deep.If you can put your Western values in the pantry for long enough -- specifically 94 minutes -- to indulge the filmmakers, you'll be treated to a smorgasbord of human selfishness that hurtles right past indifference and into outright malice toward those less fortunate. Regardless of the height at which people reside, in ""The Platform,"" virtually everyone engages in wanton callousness toward those even a little bit ""lower"" than themselves. Enter our hero, Goreng, who strives to effect change on his breaks from reading ""Don Quixote."" (See what they did there?)While we clearly don't live in a perfect world, the story nevertheless tends toward the simplistic, and when it could serve up a heaping portion of nuance, it dips into a stew of crass obviousness that waters down its true potential. On two separate occasions, we see those ""above"" literally urinating/defecating upon those ""below.""It would be easy to chalk the entire movie up to a dystopian future vision; however, the clear suggestion is that this is the reality of the here and now, not some possible future and, as such, it doesn't ring true.

219,toutouguy,Keeps your attention well but leaves you with no definite answers...,7,3 November 2020,"The film has a great and unique concept overall but I personally am not fond of movies that are open to many interpretations at its conclusion. If you are trying to tell a great story I feel there should be a strong message and this movie leaves you with not one, but several overarching themes for consideration. Which side does the director take? What are his solutions?In my opinion, 'Goreng' plays the role of a model citizen (ordinary sane people like you and I). He seems to be (or thinks he is) rational, compassionate, fair, and brave. Trimagasi also plays the role of many of us in society. He is rational in a sense, but narrow-minded, arrogant, selfish and narcissistic. He's portrayed as somewhat of a thorn in society that causes problems and slows down progression or innovation. These two characters and their moral ethics clash many times but everyone on the platform can agree to the belief that the lower you are, the probability of survival grows smaller as 'prisoners' higher up on the platform will choose to save themselves in favor of suffering/starving a little for the benefit of others. Goreng believes through teamwork and coordination he can change this pattern and impress the Administration (he is optimistic and believes in humanity). Trimagasi, however, sees the glass half empty and concludes that kind of thinking is a wasted effort.As the story progresses, we are introduced to Baharat (a friend of Goreng's) and Miharu (the woman in constant search of her daughter). In my own interpretation, Baharat represents the supporters and positive contributors to a stable and fruitful society and Miharu represents those individuals who don't care about what society thinks of them. Those like Miharu will live their lives and dream their dreams and reach their goals doing whatever it takes. They are exceptionally creative and unpredictable individuals.Skipping through the plot, in the end as we see Miharu's daughter soar higher resting on the platform, I believe we as viewers can either remain hopeful of the political message she represents OR we can imagine many horrible things that might and quite possibly will happen to her (being ripped apart by society).The Platform made it's debut at the perfect time and was a precursor to the 'Coronavirus pandemic' in my eyes.

However, the way it is presented is more frightening as we try to convince ourselves of human kindness. And even when we expect the worst, what comes next succeeds in overcoming what has already been seen, in rawness and despair.The minimalist set design resembles a theater stage. Most of the scenes take place in a structure called The Hole, where cells for two people have a large central opening through which a platform with a table with food for the whole day descends daily.At level zero, there is a kitchen where a banquet is prepared daily with sophisticated foods, delicacies, desserts and drinks. This feast goes down intact to level 1 and then successively, in brief stops, to the lower levels. If each pair consumes a small portion of what is served, it is possible that there will be food for everyone. Of course, that never happens.Selfish, not only do the occupants of the upper cells eagerly devour more than they can handle digesting, but they smear the remains of food they cannot eat. Some justify their actions by remembering that, after a month, a shuffle occurs and they can be transferred to cells below.The movie starts with Goreng (Ivan Massagué) waking up at level 48 alongside the old Trimagasi (Zorion Eguileor). He brings the only object to which everyone is entitled: the book Don Quixote e by Miguel de Cervantes. His cellmate has a knife that sharpens itself.Goreng's odyssey literally has many ups and downs, until he meets Baharat (Emilio Buale), a black man who carries a rope with which he intends to reach level zero, without realizing that, for that, he will need the help of people from above.Together, they intend to send a message to the Administration that, as said by a sage, ""has no conscience"" of what happens at the lower levels.

This premise is, honestly, one of the most interesting things I've ever heard, and it also has a very intuitive metaphorical and sociological flavor to it, that is in fact explored to some extent in the movie.
Without getting too deep in the details of the story, though there are many interesting ones, I want to stress how well the first half of the film is developed. Our protagonist is a normal guy, with a pretty standard moral compass (first he pities the others and expects them to help each other, then he embraces his animal nature and starts to act for survival, then again questions this and so on...), which makes for a very engaging strategy-based story: high level means we can eat as much as we want, low level means we need to find a way to endure for a month (or more!).Now, I see how the story naturally goes to the idea of mutual help. Actually, it is historically clear that a society that cares for others just works better, whatever your moral feelings may be, and I also liked a lot the fact that our protagonist decides to force others to cooperate to an extent.But then, after Imoguiri's death, everything starts to collapse, culminating is an ending that simply makes no sense, just for the sake of leaving the viewer with a mysterious aura.
The kid at level 333 (obviously, the number of God) is supposed to be the message sent by the Messiah. But what does this mean exactly? That this was supposed to be the ""solution"" to the mystery? But then again, this is a prison, a place where people go for specific reasons, not a riddle to solve. Also, why is Goreng supposed to let her go upwards alone? Why can't he go with her? And what was Miharu trying to do? Find the kid to crack the code? And where did she go every time she descended? How come she never went to the top level? Also, it would've been very easy for someone at level 332 to notice that the bottom was nearby, and so on...Bottom line, this story has a great idea at its root, but it would've been better explored with a different medium, like a long comic book, book or tv show. That way, the strategic element could've been stretched to its natural limits without wasting the story's symbolic potential either, instead of rushing an ending that says very, very little.I really hope a good writer, maybe Desola himself, does just that.",The Platform

It needs to be watched very closely, perhaps multiple times, or the dots will not be connected. While I'm not a fan of characters explaining films, the need for these explanations of some major components here means some of the neat subtleties are not obvoius enough to the viewer of a short film.I had difficulty watching for a while since I couldn't appreciate an explanation for why the Hole exists. While it represents something, I haven't read an explanation that answers this other than to say what it represents.I did not feel the ending was rushed at all nor was it disappointing. After reading some of the explanations, it made perfect sense to me. That our protagonist was reading Don Quixote (a character with whom you should be familiar to get the full gist of the movie) is also meaningful in explanation. That there isn't as much dialogue between people of different levels was more symbolic than it was realistic, which makes the viewer struggle to understand unless able to let it go for the sake of seeing the whole.While I'm torn between a 7 and 8, I'll choose the higher because it clearly represents a serious effort by the film makers to show you something new that isn't another painfully derivative sequel.",The Platform

274,cavemould,great movie that is hard to classify,9,2 August 2020,"This movie is difficult to put into words, but i would suggest it poses something of a philosophical question, i.e. can humans overcome their desire for survival and self preservation in order to work together, even when forced into a hierarchy of haves and have-nots. I've watched it twice now, and the way that the prisoners are moved up or down in the prison still remains a mystery, although it is made clear that each prisoner has his favourite dish, so technically, everyone would have their own dish to eat if the ones above were able to share (which as we observe from real human society, they aren't). The only problem I have with this is that it still doesn't solve the problem of everyone having enough to live on, because there is no way you could live for 6 months just eating snails, so while it is a nice metaphor on its own, it has little practical value in context.I'm not sure exactly how the platform moves, there are no obvious lifting mechanisms. This gives it an almost supernatural character to it. Its descent into total darkness may as well be a descent into hell, especially as the prisoners are increasingly desperate , dead, or dying, the further down it goes. The fact that prisoners are allowed to take weapons with them into the prison also pushes them to the extreme of behaviours because it gives one prisoner and unfair power advantage over their cellmate as well as potentially those below. The whole system is essentially set up to force the manifestation of the very worst in human nature by taking something as essential as food and making it a requirement to fight for survival with other humans just to be able to have it. The purpose of the prison system seems to be nothing other than to force humans into a position where they use the weapons they brought in to eat each other to survive. Whoever designed the system is clearly very evil, especially as on the last level is a child , presumably the child of the crazy woman who descends every time to bring food to her, or to look for her. Its not clear if the child spent the entire time on the last level, and its also not clear if returning her on the platform makes any difference or not.This movie is very thought provoking and its worth noting that in the end the final level is 333, but there are two prisoners per level. That's 666 prisoners who are living in a decidedly hellish prison.All of the characters are very well crafted, and each character represents an archetype of society itself. For sure, this movie has an allegorical message beyond simply being about a harsh and cruel prison, probably something related to different political structures and human nature and so on.

El Hoyo enters the pile of films that seek to talk about politics, society and, above all, philosophy. For the mere fact of being in this subgenre, I already like it, because it offers an interesting reflection. But it is not that it is Stalker (Andrei Tarkovsky) precisely. What these works seek to do is THINK the viewer from science fiction, only that Tarkovsky does it with the image and Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia does it with the exhibition.To say that the film is very ""obvious"" or not very subtle is a fact, and although it is not necessarily bad, it makes the public not see it as too cryptic. There will be some intention of believing himself very groundbreaking and then staying halfway, especially at the end.But the movie is good, pretentious but good. This social experiment works only from the script so it was necessary that their dialogues be forceful. They really are, and they make the evolution of the characters a mirror of previous ones. The design of the Hole also seeks the echo of a mirror with the Droste effect in the different vertical rooms.It is a movie with a much faster pace than would be expected. The mount streamlines when time needs to pass quickly. However, he knows how to pause when necessary, making slow plane changes, mixing them, creating a distortion that shows madness very well.It is a good example of the human being pushed to the limit and has a script with very paraphraseable phrases like ""Convince before winning"" that make it very accessible and enjoyable. And also on the national scene, it is a joy that such films exist; especially when people see them",The Platform
281,ryandannar,"A shallow gorefest, convinced of its own profundity.",2,12 April 2020,"The Platform wants to have something to say about class-struggle within a ruthlessly capitalistic society, but its ham-fisted allegory is confused and self-contradictory at best, making sense in individual moments -- but not where it really counts, in the overall big picture.The ""message"" of the film, such as it is, is excruciatingly obvious from the first scene, and is only coherent in individual bite-sized segments. Perhaps this makes it an ideal message-film for the era of Trump and Twitter and the small and illiterate thought - but I doubt that was the intent.To be fair, the film's main premise is an interesting one. The vertical stack of cells, and the ever-descending banquet, create a visceral a depiction of the unfair, top-down distribution of resources and income. However, the film never gets very far beyond its initial premise.The premise is undercut by the early-film revelation that many of the ""prisoners"" chose to be imprisoned here, for reasons which often seem fairly trivial. Also, since not much information is given about the ""outside world,"" and since we're never quite sure if this prison is run by a privately-owned business or by the ""government,"" it's never very certain exactly what this prison is meant to represent. If it is designed to represent the entirety of a capitalist society, then what does it mean that some of the people are here as punishment, but others are here because they erroneously thought it would help them quit smoking, or get them in better physical shape?Likewise, I have no idea what to make of the fact that the people in this prison wake-up on a different level every month. Sure, this creates some cheap dramatic tension -- but in real life, those who ""have not"" don't often switch position with those who ""have,"" and so this plot-device complicates the film's central message in ways that I'm not sure are intentional.As a midnight-movie gorefest, The Platform is certainly more successful -- although its single setting and budget constraints render it considerably more repetitive along these lines then it really needed to be. Some character development or an interesting backstory might have been nice -- but alas, this film is not as invested in those things as it is in depicting acts of cannibalism.Overall, I would describe the movie as a violent, repetitive, and extremely juvenile science-fiction fantasy which believes it has big things to say about class struggle but ultimately can't summon anything more meaningful than a handful of pithy tweets. It all leads up to an ending which is unsurprising and shallow, but seemingly convinced of its own profundity.Grading on a curve, being lenient due to the film's budget constraints (which really aren't the main problem), I might be generous and give it two out of ten stars. Not a film I will be recommending to anyone.",The Platform

283,filmsbyq,Good psychological horror.,8,13 April 2020,"The Platform is a gripping psychological horror up until the last five minutes where it leaves you a little unsatisfied with the conclusion. There are a lot of unanswered questions: What is the hole? Why was the girl in there? What was the purpose? Was it a prison or an experiment? Did anyone ever get out? So many questions!The performances are excellent from all involved and the set design is wonderfully stark and oppressive. Sound is good as well, with the music adding to the already tense atmosphere of the story. Especially at this time - writing during a worldwide pandemic - this story of base human instincts seems particularly relevant.Written by David Desola and directed by Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia, the film does not answer any of the moral questions either, instead leaving it to the viewer to decide who they would relate to or align with.Visually, the film is stark. Rich in the kitchen scenes and scary in the hole scenes. Truthfully though, I could not see the point of the kitchen scenes. They only showed that the food began as haute cuisine. As the film demonstrated that even those who found themselves in a privileged position did not appreciate it, there was little to give weight to these scenes.That being said, The Platform is an engaging watch and it was only really on second viewing and given time to think about it, that I could find these frustrating niggles in the plot. At ninety-four minutes long it is perhaps too short and could have given the viewer a bit more story context with an extra fifteen minutes. The Platform is, nonetheless, a good and highly watchable film.",The Platform
284,iamMarkPrice,Pretentious Garbage,2,4 April 2020,"I'm sure when the writers and director first started collaborating on this film they stood around patting each other on the back, congratulating each other on what they thought was a very intelligent film. It's great to have a voice, but this one was too youthful. For a film that deals with themes of socioeconomic diversity, that might just be a problem.El Hoyo (The Hole; renamed The Platform presumably during the Netflix acquisition) tells essentially the same story as Snowpiercer except instead of moving forward through carriages, it moves vertically through levels. Levels that determine ones socioeconomic status, with extreme economic mobility.Often overly crass and all too fixated on the themes they wanted to convey, the writing regularly forgets it's supposed to be telling a coherent, layered story. This creates a space in which one feels they are being lectured on the importance of the ""next generation"" (ie. Youth) as opposed to watching a film with depth and enjoyable moments. Indeed, no one moment in the entire film stands out. There is no genuine attempt at character development. There is no story arch. There is nothing to actually make you care about what happens to anyone. There is no sense about what is happening. It is just a lecture.This movie is not great, it's not even good. It's like a failed first year film student managed to sell a class project to Netflix. Weird.Taking it literally, this film is filled with inexcusable plot holes. It for example is impossible to heat or cool a single level rapidly or with any measure of control when there is a giant hole in both the ceiling and floor. It is further insulting to an audience to imagine that everyone isn't just riding the platform up to higher levels instead of murdering each other. So we are forced into taking it figuratively, and herein it becomes pretentious and self serving.This is a film that should have only ever ran in a few small film festivals, to be seen by maybe 300 people total. It doesn't belong on an international streaming platform being pushed with a massive marketing budget. If you have a choice, please don't watch this garbage.",The Platform

But the whole thing is blatant with its statement, right to the ending, which isn't confusing at all if you already understand that this wasn't as much a movie, as telling you its commentary on society. It starts off interesting but the hammer of blatant statement making starts banging on your face and a few times you get a glimpse of an interesting turn, but very quickly it's back to the hammer. There are quite a few glaring plot holes, mostly in regards to logic, consistency, or realism, but considering the fantastical story is a front to the message anyways, it's not really important for that purpose.

293,iamdrumil,Looking for something unique? Watch this!,9,21 April 2020,"The Platform is a movie like no other it's an original idea! It's unique in the best of the ways.The movie is about a vertical prison which is of 333 floors with 2 cells mates on each floor. The food is served on a floating slab that gradually descents each level, the people on the lower floors are supposed to eat leftovers and once the slab passes 50 to 80 floors there is no food left at all. The people just die out of hunger and a few manage to kill their cellmate and feed on them.There is no hero in this story or a villain. The characters in this movie are very well written. Trimagasi was someone who had been in prison for almost a year so he knows the struggle, unlike Goreng.
But very soon Goreng learns that Trimagasi was right it's the kind of situation where you either kill or get killed. Another character in the movie which has a lot more meaning then it meets the eye was Miharu the Japanese meaning of this word is to guard or watch over and this is exactly what she was doing watching over her kid, in the beginning, it made no sense kids were not allowed in this hell hole but eventually we learn that the kid was there all along and all she was try to say as much food as possible so it could reach on the floors below (hoping something might just get to her kid).The movie also shows that the people who have it all are never going to care about people below them. On floor Zero, people were so wrapped up in the production of the food and just dealing with their jobs that they had no idea what was going on underneath. Just like that, people on the above floors didn't care about anyone below them. Even someone as small as Trimagasi who was on floor 47 (probable) at the beginning of the movie, resenting both those above him and below him. And people who were on the floor which didn't get any food they were looked over by everyone just like how in society we sometimes don't even think of those so down below us (financially).All in all, this is an excellent movie if you sit and take some time understanding the meaning behind everting and also if that's no you, you don't want to study movie even then it's a very unique movie just watch it for its originality and you will have a good time.",The Platform

The message was so ridiculous and nonsensical that it makes me wonder whether the people who made this movie are ridiculously stupid or just highly irrational.
The movie does not fit the narrative that they were trying to convey. One of the characters claims there is enough food on the table for everyone, but it is obvious to anyone with a brain that there is not. That table could not feed 666 people or the 500 people she believed were there. The idea that the same people can be placed at different levels after a short period of time and they will immediately embrace elitism is ridiculous. Do they really think someone can be placed at level 100 and then get arbitrarily put on level 38 after a short period of time and immediately believe they are better than someone on the level they were just on two seconds ago? In what way does any of this represent the capitalist society most people live in today? There are no food shortages here. The poorest people in my country are oftentimes the most obese. The capitalist system also does not place people in jobs at random and then bring them down or up at random. Luck may play a role in everything in life, but our system is not completely arbitrary.

The film uses the prison pit, an unrealistic prison, to express that the society is always unequal distribution of resources, and that the upper class always eats the lower class. The upper class never cares about the survival of the lower class, and the bottom class is full of cannibalism. There is no spontaneous solidarity in this particular situation, because change is never spontaneous, just as a man who quits smoking has to go to prison to enforce it. Finally, the man read that if a great man has bad habits, his bad habits are also great. A rich man is a miserly beggar if he is not generous.

A stone platform with food on it descends through the building from top to bottom each day, stopping at each level and giving its two occupants a few minutes to eat what they can or want to before it moves on. By the time it reaches the bottom there's nothing left and everyone down there is starving. Every thirty days people are shuffled randomly so they end up somewhere better or worse.The way The Platform starts is great, full of intrigue and crackling dialogue. It remains great for a long time and then, like a vibrant and speeding runner floored by a sudden bout of Ebola, goes down straight on its face.The end of this film is unsatisfying, as you have probably gathered from the other reviews. Unlike the rest of the film, it's poorly paced, turgid, badly scripted, boring and kind of confused in its message. The preceding events seem to clearly tell us that a class-based society is cruelly arbitrary and does not incentivise the compassionate sharing of resources. The building and its food platform are a somewhat imperfect vehicle for that commentary but it works well enough. Maybe it was because I was drunk with boredom, but I don't know what the 'climax' was saying at all.Anyway, this one is still worth watch because the premise is so good and it's well executed for the most part.

The first thing I want to criticize is the woman that drives every time down the platforms. She should have died much before, if she really does was she is doing for that long time. It's not realistic that she safes the protagonist from his cell neighbor because she is there just in the right moment and it's also not realistic that she dies in the moment when the protagonist arrives at the platform, where she was in this moment. I think they could have done her story much better. Like that there are some other logical problems. But my biggest problem was the end. I like open endings, but this one was so confusing. It made me think about it, but I don't know what it means. The message of the film was clear, it showed how people deal with others. If they are above someone they treat him like a worse human...(with some exceptions) It shows how hopeless some people in bad situations feel,... But the end is a mystery for me. I don't know what the film wants to tell me. Is it some kind of a religious end? ...

It made for an interesting movie, thus I gave it 5 out of 10 stars, but you really shouldn't extrapolate this as an allegory of capitalism, because it falls apart so fast.Any analogy or metaphor is going to fall apart if you pick at it too much, but this one falls apart at a slight breeze. I read the other reviews talking about what a brilliant examination this is of the capitalist system, but c'mon... really? Do they really not see the obvious flaws in such a comparison? In the real world, people in the ""lower classes"" really can effect societal change. That's the whole argument behind unions after all. The whole ""the workers control the means of production"" thing. So to say this movie represents the real world in any way is just flat out false based on that aspect alone. And there are other areas where it just doesn't work at all, but you get the point.In fact, this movie says more about the screenwriter than capitalism. They seem to argue that everything is created by those 1% at the top and trickles down in an unfair way, but it doesn't take a great leap in logic to realize that without the 99%, society would crumble. Who grows the food? Who transports it to the stores? Who cooks it?

It has a very obvious message which did come across as a little too overplayed in some parts, it was constantly grinding in the social class theme to the point where I think it lost some of its meaning. It didn't really let much up for interpretation which isn't necessarily a bad thing it just hinders further rewatches.I do believe the film left a great impact, it's pacing was excellent for the first two acts however definitely lost some steam near the end. The characters were for the most part very well acted and compelling to watch although I must say that the film is better off being watched with subtitles rather than the dubbed version. In the dubbed version the speech was very unnatural in some sections, which is to be expected. This did cause some areas of the film to appear more comical rather than frightening which definitely impacted the tone. Whether you view that as a bad thing is up to you, but is must be stated that the film is surprisingly funny which helped to relieve the darker themes presented.By far my favourite aspect of the film is it's sense of scale. They were clearly working on a low budget however the pure scale of the events is executed very effectively. The atmosphere felt so much more oppressive because of that.Overall this film is a must watch, I won't comment on the ending as I want to keep this review spoiler-free but I was left relatively satisfied with the conclusion.",The Platform

340,ana57709,"Simple storyline, yet interesting",7,21 March 2020,"Somehow the writers make the simple storyline of this movie work. The protagonist enters a vertical prison which consist of a many two-person cels or 'levels'. With a giant square hole piercing through all of them, made only for a same-sized 'platform' with food to fit through. Each day the prisoners have 2 minutes to take as much food as they like of off the platform, with the top levels eating well and hardly anything being left for the bottom levels. Each month the prisoners get resigned to a different, random level. This prompts the ones on top to greedily eat all the food they can because they fear the level they might be on next month.The fairly simple, quite obvious metaphor is of course that this prison model resembles our society, in which we will only think about ourselves when we have it good, and, if stripped of laws, will still think only about ourselves when we have it bad. Just in an endlessly more gory and barbaric way of course. It shows how people are willing to go to desperate measures for survival, and still after suffering will not share with others when they have it good again.Would have liked to see a little more character development since you don't really get to know much about the people the protagonist encounters.

342,damfaz,Badly written and not clear,5,29 May 2020,"The premise seemed good. I understand that this movie is about capitalism and social stratification, but in my opinion it doesn't provide a solid setting which a movie should always provide.The vertical building's structure and operation is explained in detail through a ridiculous 10-minutes-long tutorial at the beginning. After that, I think that there is too much mistery about many things which were important to understand the movie logistics. A few examples of inconsistencies are the following:
some people are sentenced to be there because they are criminals and other people have chosen to be there; why? I think that this should have been explained because the movie's final purpose significantly depends on this aspect;people are not allowed to keep food after the platform goes away, but they are allowed to ""travel"" on the platform or to climb up the building, that is some rules seem inflexible and others do not even exist;we discover that the woman who is searching her daughter had entered alone; so what does her character mean? Does she already know about the message or she is just a mad woman?Then, I have to say that I expected to feel suffocated by watching a movie like this. It should have been more claustrophobic, like Cube (1997), for example. Moreover, I didn't feel any empathy with the protagonist and I never suffered with him. I just felt disgusted because of cannibalism scenes, obviously, but that doesn't count.Back to the ""political message"" of the movie, I really didn't get the ending. They finally found the little girl which is ""the message"". But we discover that the message has to be carried to level 0 without anyone else. Why? What does it mean? And now that the little girl has been saved, what happens next? There are too many mysterious holes (not ""plot holes"" because actually there isn't a real plot) in my opinion; but not the intriguing mystery which is typical of thriller/horror movies, just something badly written.

344,andriz,Meaning of this movie - my take,8,29 March 2020,"Lets say for starters - this movie has nothing to do with horror. It aint horror-movie. Horror-story is just mere set design and buthaphoria.Movie is basically allegory about human society (and not capitalism, as some have stated) and stufy of moral options.So basically contemporary society has multiple levels - there are upper levels, midclasses and bottom levels, pretty clear with that.Resources (all thats on the platform) all in all are limited. Are they even sufficient? Cant tell. But its clear they will land first on upper echelon´s table, they can satisfy all their needs and moods first (because they have more money, connections, own resources and other privileges. Lower levels come next and so it goes.It seems, that movie environment has set as allegory of western capitalism. The center points of this study are:1. how to survive, which individual moral choices one would face to survive?2. which methodical alternatives there are?Basically at first Trimagasi offers a survival tactics - that is unbearable for protagonist - you have more resources (younger, healthier, more body mass etc. - lets eat small parts of you without killing you, and keep us both alive. It would be reasonable, but as protagonist is tied up, he is left without his free will - with no choice. So he kills Trimagasi and eats him - not only to survive - but rather to restore the state of free will.Thats the defining point - in order to survive - you have to have certain freedom. When gained that - you face new dilemmas.Next face is study of individual choices. Goreng meets people, who have different moral pathways to survive. Trimagasis (old man whom he killed) choice was rational - but did´nt consider emotions. So he got killed for that. Imoguiris choice was kindness - basically its allegory to christian and buddist etc. philosophy - ultimate divinity is sacrificing for humanity. But the price is also losing life - Imoguiri kills herself so sacrifice would be made and others could benefit from her act. Third - Miharu implemented every means necessary to reach her goals - brute force, violence, lies etc. - so she followed the principle, that purpose consecrates the means. Of course - she got killed and became victim of violence.So these are the main individual options for contemporary western civilization survival. Which are more, which less sustainable? Thats for viewer to decide.Anyway - Gorang is not satisfied with these main options - and sees the solution in revolution. That means you need to reorganise the whole model, all principles. There are definitely lots of ways to do that - Gorang and his companion choose a way, that could be described as socialism/communism.Idea seems to be great - everyone takes as much as he needs to survive. Not more. Plus - everyone gets the same. So - equality. Its pretty clear from the beginning, that only way to do that is from up to bottom - does not work other way around. Why? You cant control upper levels - because platform only goes top to bottom. First floors will go OK, because people are relatively well fed.But then they quickly realize - the bottom the level - the harder it is to persuade hungrier and hungrier people to bare with minimum. There´s a lot of reasons for that - they are in worse shape, they have stronger feel for unjustice, etc. etc. Soon Goreng and his companion realize, that only way to make people - especially people in trouble at lower levels - act in a manner of equality - is brutal force and domination. Basically - its how the communism and socialism have been carried out everywhere in real world. Idea seems to be great - but in reality - circumstances for people are that different, that same portion of resource is not having the same effect. Also - there´s lot more what makes you situation actually unfair - when treated fairly.Plus - it adds a moral dilemma, that is vocalized by a woman from one of the bottom floors - who made you the god of everything? What´s the guarantee, that Goreng´s idea of equality and sustainability - applies or everyone? It does´nt. Because people in different circumstances have different needs. Their condition differs, so their priorities differ etc. Plus - the question of a free will, remember?Pretty soon they both realize that socialism/communism was just unrealistic idea. So they reach a conclusion - with a help of a ""wise man"" - that you can´t use force to apply sustainable model - you have to persuade people. You need to send the message. So they fixate sending the message - to 0 floor - where the table is covered with food.Basically its here, where I started to lose a grip of this study. Why send a message to 0 floor? Those guys there are only waiters and chefs. They dont make decisions.In real world the system itself is not a decision at all - it all comes from how the world has been set. All mammals are living in hierarchies, its not conscious choice. It´s actually the only way for mammals, including people to survive - because we are not competing for reesources only within ourselves - we competing with all the other species as well.So ""the message"" - was it either protest - or just little girl (humanity?) -fell out of the overall logic.What I did actually like about this movie - it didn´t present as much answers and did´nt took stands - it more like postulated central questions. With allegory like that - maybe it got more people to think about society. In a times like these - I think philosophical insight to crucial social questions - and actual thinking about basic mechanisms our sociaty is running on - might be good idea.So I suggest the movie, definitely.",The Platform

Again, if you've been working for a company for 25 years, one would expect you to know this.Imoguiri has volunteered for this ""experiment"" so to speak. Once she was presumably told about what the experiment is (because she'd been working for the company for 25 years), why still opt in?How do they know that a piece of food has stayed behind and not been kept on the platform? Cameras? If yes, where are these cameras? If no, how do they know that the food is staying or leaving the platform?The lower you go, the less food there is available. We clearly see that in front us. Yet the little girl is on level 333 and still alive and doesn't look malnourished in any sense whatsoever. How has she been surviving that long?5) Everyone presumably knows when they would exit the pit, including Goreng. Why have a rebellion then and not just wait it out because you keep switching levels anyway?6) Goreng tells Baharat that they will leave Level 6 and make their way down to feed everyone past the lower levels and that they'll ride the platform back up to Level 6. This is essentially what Miharu had been doing to find her kid.

It has obvious themes of class struggle and how nothing will get better if you let yourself become apart of the problem. It was legitimately scary because it kept making you thinking of what you would do if you were in that situation. Would you conform? Would you let yourself become apart of the system, accept it and play by 'their' rules for the rest of your life. Or will you try to effect change and not be discouraged or stopped by those around you. It shared the other similarity with Cube in we never find out who is truly behind the prison.

Each month, without any apparent logic, the inmates are moved to another floor, with all that it means for food availability.Once the non-rules are accepted, there is no difference between the convict and those who have chosen to enter; all attempts to introduce some sort of humanity and a very basic social cooperation scheme, which would solve the food distribution problem to the benefit of all, fail and not even the ultimate effort to enforce it through force is able to effectively change the relationships and the fate of the inmates.Emblematically, the movie ends on the floor level, level 333, that in numerology represents the spiritual guide that helps those in distress, even though the final message, embodied in a girl apparently born in captivity, does not look so hopeful.The Platform premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and was bought by Netflix, where it has become soon one of the top-watched movies in 2020.
And rightly so!Based upon a theatre screenplay but heavily re-written, the movie is the first direction of Basque director Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia and it is not easy to watch, but for those who will have the stomach to endure the savagely violent and disturbing footage there will be a terrible yet sophisticated and intellectually rewarding parable on the imperfection of the human beings and on their animal instincts, shot with a remarkable visual style and plenty of clever references, to movies, above all Peter Greenaway's for the food elaborate preparation, to literature, with Dante's Comedy and his trip to Hell, as well as socio-political doctrines, with open criticisms of both liberal and socialist systems.Good and effective also the actors' performances, that the director has cannily chosen in some case from actors usually cast on comic, lighter roles.Bearing in mind that some scenes might be disturbing for some viewers, the movie is highly recommended for its artistic value and style and represents a bold choice, therefore to be praised and recognised, for Netflix, which is usually very popular but not necessarily associated with art movies like this one.",The Platform

This is a metaphor for this, ooh and that represents that... So far so good.

Brilliant! This one action represents an act of defiance- the humanity is strong! love it, go on, just a few minutes more!

Nooo! The director decided he liked the smell of his own farts a little too much, I think his head has yet to re-emerge.The movie meant nothing to me in the end.

379,mariadebonne,It all starts with thinking. Did you start?,10,2 April 2020,"I'm very fond of Spanish thriller. Although there are those who claim that the movie has a stereotypical view of the current world order. Will be a cliché when you analyze the problems of the current order and this issue will not be examined anymore? It is also claimed that the result remains unknown, even though it is claimed that the film produces no solution. The movie has a story that asks questions and thinks about solutions, we call it philosophy, and everything starts with thinking, unfortunately, even the thinking part has not started properly. There are also bets on much better artistic and better movies. Hanging on with the art issue is more about formalism than content, and this formalism ruins people.First of all, it is said that there are religious references in the movie. The movie is already doing this directly, so which god do you believe turns the conversation back, or there are quotes from the bible, so there are also direct references. The chef in the restaurant, where the alleged dishes were prepared in indirect references, was the angel who prepared the god dishes or the receptionist, and even someone tried to help people as a fallen angel who came down to the world. The name of this angel's dog is the 2nd Ramses, for example, there is a reference here, because at some point the head hero is seeing the hallucination while our message is called the 2nd Ramses. It may also be necessary to mention Akheneton here because he is an Egyptian pharaoh who had previously adopted the monotheistic belief, which was much loved and later declared infidel. He had the temples closed so he started a great struggle with the clergy of the time. In other words, the root source of the story of monotheistic religions in Egypt and the Middle East is a story that was initiated by him and never completely finished. 2. Ramses is a pharaoh who came to power 55 years after him, and erect the god statues that adore the temples, and a majestic pharaoh who lived until the age of 90, but his second wife was from the dynasty of the beautiful wife Iset Akheneton, and that is why she is not loved. According to the Yasa(The Law), the second Ramses, which he wants to marry Ramses, is very conservative in religious matters (according to the Law of Ma'at, the Egyptian goddess of justice, the law has a parenthesis, the Chinese emperors have two official wives, and the Law in the Turks is very important) No agreement can not be reached because he cannot get his wife to lose his wife because he cannot defeat his wife. Of course, the agreement is the result of the war in the general statement, but these claims about Iset are also narrated based on historical records. I went into these details because the possibility that Ramses would be eaten like a sausage may be related to the humiliation of the Egyptian understanding that Akheneton was ignored and considered deserved. Yes, a very indirect link.In my opinion the chef who prepares the dishes, the blessings, is not the god. My be he is the archangel etc. because the person who set up and manages the system or someone can meet the concept of god made up of people, and we don't know who they are in the movie. we have to wake up the ministers of their affairs because they are those who knowingly or unknowingly spin this wheel. It is obvious that there is no conscience of the other or others, but who knows, maybe those who run like a robot to do the work given to them and do it without thinking, maybe their conscience will not allow this order. If we consider this as despotic systems or wild capitalist order, it can be said that there are a handful of people who designed and maintained the system, but how do they achieve this? Let us say that by establishing a chain of happiness, it provides a top-down nematology without letting people care about the results of the system. More importantly, will someone else do it if I do not, or am I just saying, or trying to get rid of the conscience? If I do not say that someone else will kill and being a hitman, will you save you from being a murderer? Of course, in this story, the food makers are part of the system and there is the security guard of this work, so see the little girl and say what the hell is going on here.Of course, an emphasis in this movie is not actually fasting or sharing, the possibilities are not enough to meet the needs. This is in fact the ferocious capitalist argument, so they say that everyone will live like the kings who are ambitious, determined, and talented to crawl. Of course, the immoral ones, the convoyers and the scammers who they do not count while saying can live like kings, and in general they are the most kings. Religion is being tested to the poor because the test of the rich is great. Wild capitalism can also be rich. Socialism does not deceive with anything, but such a system opposed to human nature is established only by pressure, and then oligarchy is inevitable oligarchy is one of the most toxic fruits, social orders, etc. As practice shows, there are always oligarchs that claim to be free, but the only thing they do is to manipulate people in herd psychology, and in the order that claims to be absolutely not despot, but despotum like honey, and in the order that says despotum, but ask, why despotum. They rarely set up a truly meritocratic order and act in good faith, but they are not immortal, so the order they established did not happen in the next generation, and in the second generation, organized evil is sneakily or publicly spoiled. Entropy is inevitable in all systems.The science of what we call economics is actually modeling the most efficient form of distribution of these scarce resources. Here, we are faced with the problem of immensity of human needs. The primary parameter of this is population, which is actually something that can be planned, but religion traders make it a sin because religion is in the monopoly of oligarchs, who need slaves to exploit and crowded heaps to get their power from. Global capitalists say freedom through the liberals because they always need new customers to make consumption freaks. Let's say you have a company that only sells products for babies, children, adolescents, and birth rates are an important indicator for you. So, if necessary, socialist states implement population planning in the harshest way. We can remember that the head hero in the movie dives into the head, so that I will present equality to people here. Yes, I am doing such a favor. There are many maniacs in our world. The demon angel who needs to justify violence is a crime / sin that needs legitimization. The secondary parameter of unlimited needs is people's greed. The movie is more focused on this.Well, why is greed here because I can't accumulate it later, and then I exploit it to the bottom, it moves on its head. People try to store it in their bodies. In real life, the wild capitalists are very obsessed with protecting their most treasured treasures and never losing their positions. Do you have any money? These happen in some of those who see their absence somehow, and generally never want to fall back to the same level, they exploit until they crack like grasshoppers. Of course, there are those in the movie who say that this is described with reincarnation, so this is what it means to wake up on different floors, but it is enough to see what can happen in one lifetime, that is, not to experience what is happening, and not to be like them. Because, it is said that in capitalist countries they necessarily leave a certain amount of unemployed so that others see their condition and continue working as modern slaves. In the film, it is also mentioned that those who are present don't mind when it comes to thinking about basic needs. The bourgeois has stupid sufferings, yes, even the pain is sought.Since the floors are 333 and there are two people in each of them. The original of the 666 stories, it is the number of the beast, not the number of the devil or the antichrist, and it has 666 children, and it is seen in a person, that is, the person receiving the message, etc. these are a lot of detailed deer here. The opening of the protagonist with the apple also reminds him of the expulsion from heaven because of the devil. In other words, if this is the people produced by this system and people are from it, it receives the message, adapts to the system that receives the message and serves it.So how do these people come here? As you can see, they all come in an agreement and voluntarily. For some to punish the crime he committed (to be fired from heaven and return to him), others would get a diploma for a reward, for example, a hero, this may be a kind of initiation, that is, a spiritual level rise. The fallen angel is coming for help, somehow I'm going to die, let's work, but we don't know the stories of the others, for example, one of the most respectable characters who wanted to be slanting Marilyn Monroe, but from where to where. So they obviously don't force anyone here. In some religions, it is claimed that people are born with an agreement into the world. Why did they accept it? They are willing to reward or to rip off other crimes of their crimes and whatever the punishment. These are all ignorance.The protagonist comes with a guiding story, just like in scriptures, the world is a terrible place, but fight against it as if there was no tomorrow, and although you are a sucker for some, you are actually a hero because you are doing the right thing, etc. Some of them chose weapons, It is very logical to bring a rope that brings a child who brings a dog to bring a companion, an inflatable pool, but it didn't work, but the rope is very useful. Here comes the features that we prefer to have when coming to the world. Knowledge, joy, power, etc.Is there a solution? Of course there is and very simple population planning and everything else planning. So a loving dictatorship :)",The Platform
380,frank-c-giugliano,The Platform Delivers,7,18 May 2020,"In an eat or be eaten world, director Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia's TIFF Midnight Audience Award winner, The Platform presents a slice of life inside the pit; a hellhole where prisoners at the top of the food chain have carte blanche to all the food they desire while prisoners below them eat only the scraps the upper level prisoners throw down.It may be the new zombie craze which came after the vampire craze; a tale of inequity amongst the classes. And while this topic has been picked over many times before, it is now prevalent enough to be considered horror. Here in Gaztelu-Urrutia's hands it is done horrifyingly well with a fresh new twist.In the grimmest way possible, The Platform tells a literal tale of consumerism. We all know what works for the greater good yet we waste when there is excess, then pray to god when we have too little.When Goreng (Ivan Massagué), volunteers to enter the prison system hoping to quit smoking while reading a book (each prisoner is permitted one item of their choosing), he is unprepared for what awaits him. Goreng learns the rules and ropes of his new life on the inside, in trials and tribulations with his pragmatic cell mate Trimagasi (Zorion Eguileor).In the following months when food becomes scarce to none Goreng must learn how to protect his life while adapting to different levels of starvation. His beliefs are shattered and decisions must be made quickly if he is to survive. All that he has ever known will be tested.The Platform's message is clear, however we never feel that we are being preached to. We receive the message and we can do what we want with it. The Platform is not for the faint of heart. It is a horror film at its core. It is bloody and violent and hellbent on making its message clear. But we still can and we will take we want from it and discard what does not fit our narrative.And that is the point of The Platform.",The Platform

383,dan_da_man-60288,"Mediocre, but it's about ethics so it'll be praised.",4,1 April 2020,"First off, the situation; a prison exists with inmates paired in cells. A single food platform moves down each day and you only get what the people above leave, so the lower you get the more likely you are to starve. Each month the inmates are randomly shuffled to different levels. If your cellmate dies you get a new one in the shuffle.Now great, it's metaphorical, but it's the kind of plot that has that hitch right from the start. This would never happen, be approved, or continue to operate. Ok, whatever, suspend disbelief and go with it (which you have to because no explanation is ever offered except ""the people running it don't care,"" and cellmate #2 shows us people working for the organisation don't even know the full extent.)The main character goes in voluntarily (showing that outsiders have no knowledge of how it operates, despite prisoners being released after their sentence) for 6 months in exchange for a degree. A degree in what? Never mentioned. How being in prison is somehow a degree? Never mentioned.The movie just leaves so many important facts completely unaddressed because they know it's so nonsensical that they could never offer a satisfactory explanation.So the last section of the film has the main character and cellmate #3 riding the platform down to the bottom sharing out food equally, finding most of the lower layers dead, and attempting to keep a panna cotta intact as a 'message' to the admin that they protest. I really fail to see how that sends any form of message at all. A full platform maybe, but ""oh hey we didn't eat one thing"" is a pretty dull protest. At the bottom they find a child and feed her the panna cotta and send her back up on the platform instead.So your message is ""we can ride the platform up."" You think people didn't try that? It's a kid so magically they'll grow a conscience and everyone's let out?Overall it's just such a poor attempt at being deep and questioning morals, but because it's really artsy everyone will rave about it.

I've read several positive reviews and it is peculiar, that most viewers describe their feelings, what the movie is about, and not the actual movie.The action takes place in some big dystopian social experiment or a prison, of unclear purpose. The idea and screenplay was pretty fresh and interesting, but it seems, that the authors had no idea how to end the plot in satisfying way. As a result, we have only a morality play, that upper classes consume more, than they need, while members of lowest classes are starving and literally killing theirselves to survive. And it seems, that not only killing of other inmates is not wrong in this world, but it might even get rewarded.It is not relevant, if main character succeeded - as everybody expected, or failed - however it would have been nice, if it was made more clear by the filmmakers. The viewers however deserve to know: what was author's vision about the real nature of the experiment and if there was a possibility to break the rules and how. Especially we would like to know, if the message, that the protagonist was trying to send, had any meaning - and what was it supposed to be. Provided, that it was real, not only an effect of imagination... The effect is like a haunting dream in the morning, which develops in interesting direction, but ends with an awakening and we will never know, if the author had any though: what was it really about.

Up until there was around fifteen minutes in the movie,... I would've given it a 7-8 stars. But this ending,... oh god this horrendous crap on your time ending.So they make it to the bottom floor, and the table stops. Okay, fine sure. But apparently somehow a little girl was the only person there, not another person and nor a body nor blood marks. Weird since EVER floor since has been two people to a floor.

She doesn't talk, and she doesn't comprehend the give and take of the floor she was at,... which just leaves more questions. Like why didn't Miharu ever find her since she's gone down the floors MANY times,.... did she just give up around floor 200 because,... even more reasons we'll never know?Now,... they stay and the food is given to the girl. Which until that point would cause the room to kill it's inhabitants,.... but somehow doesn't now.OFC Baharat randomly dies off camera in such a lackluster way that it makes you want to forget the fact that he gave up his floor 6 privileges to follow some random white dude down 200+ floors,.... to ration out food.

That's the reviewer's take on the movie, which is very fair, but ultimately the movie doesn't force this conclusion upon us.In fact, this film has some premises (such as noted by TheKing97 himself) which are not entirely in parallel with real societal life.For instance, in the movie, eating up your cellmate entails going to a higher hierarchical position (literally up and with more food). That's not true in society (metaphorically speaking of course). Putting morals aside, destroying another person doesn't entail getting any tangible benefit per se. Oftentimes,the benefit wasn't present even when we lived as small groups of brutes in caves.I see the movie more as an essay of human behavior, that happens (sometimes) given that people are fighting for their lives.

440,cornerofspace,A film with a great premise but also lacking in its impact.,8,23 May 2021,"The Platform is perhaps the most obvious story that will get people thinking about the current state of our society. There are so many nuances and the director and story writer displayed so many of them in this movie.Where to start? The simple idea is how the platform levels somewhat represents socioeconomic class. For example, the ones at the top have an ample of resources, and they often don't care about the people at the bottom. In a brilliant stroke, the film also shows how people on the top can force people on the bottom to follow an agenda, even if its a noble one. The show even goes out of its way to show two different ways to do it. One involves passing down the idea with a vocal threat, and the other being a direct show of force.The Platform shows a bunch of other ideas as well; how the ones on the top who aren't fighting for survival could have issues with mental health, as there's always the threat that they'll end up at the bottom. It's a bit of a stretch to correlate this to real social trends, but I like the idea that the film attempted to highlight problems at all strata.I think a more nuanced theme that emerged, perhaps not intentionally, is how humans attempt to create meaning in a meaningless world. Toward the end, the MC is grasping at straws at what the Administration wanted from its participants. He thought bringing the girl up is the solution to their situation. However, there is no evidence suggesting the Administration's true intentions at all.The ending definitely leaves something to be desired. We never get a definite conclusion to the MC's endeavors. It's pretty clear he passed away at this final act, but the story ends as the girl goes up on the platform. There are some interpretations to this. I could see it as a futile act, as realistically the platform moves way too fast for a child to hang safely to reach the top. Perhaps she does reach the top, and the Admin's staff carried her back to another platform. Perhaps the child didn't even exist and it's just the MC hallucinating to validate Miharu's death in his mind. Perhaps his plan worked!?Whatever the case might be, leaving it ambiguous simply doesn't make the film impactful enough. It has a great premise and displayed the human condition very well. However, what then? It's like telling the world there's a fundamental problem, but we weren't able to see if the solution worked or not. Not having an answer is worse than having the wrong answer. I can totally see the ending being incredibly bleak, but it's important to pull the final punch than no punch at all. By not giving us that, it feels like the story had a beginning, middle, and even climax, but no resolution. It kind of just ends at the climax.For me, a conclusion will almost always create a better impact. And I think an impact is needed for this film given how great the premise was. Perhaps the director thought it would be too bleak, but there's a sense of optimism in stories with bleak endings as well. Alas, we will never know. The Platform is a missed opportunity to become a masterpiece, but it is still a great work to get people thinking about the world.",The Platform

Where EVERYTHING is And needs to be explained. Its intentionally leaving things to your own imagination. Think of it like the movie 'mother' with jennifer lawrence. Where each event is a metaphor to something bigger, in which case Mother was references to the bible and with ' the platform ' its current world social standings and human behaviour in a crisis.
So, the pillars in this film everyone can probably agree on in is where the 'administration' is the government. The levels in the prison refer to social standing and the food table represents human behaviour towards resources. I.e the upper class get the best and most whilst bottom levels in life get little/nothing.
Now this is pretty much where the Structure ends and other events that happen could mean a few different things. However it saddens me
To have seen a good few reviews mark this film
Down because of its ending. Reading their reviews, these seem to be the type of person that NEED a Marvel comic ending and everything needs an explanation. In the interest of not writing a novel here im gona skip straight to the ending.I can think of about 3 different things the ending COULD mean but theres prob more. the point is the film gets you thinking and it is what you make of it.
For example we discover the little girl at the bottom level even though the administration said theres no one under age of 16 in this prison. This could mean multiple things . Like Simply the government ignorIng child poverty. Or maybe something deeper as she was literally untouched and had no other cell mate. This could mean after all our greed its the children who suffer the most and we need to look after them. You just simply dont know and i think thats the beauty of this film.
You could go on with loads of other things that happen and say what is the true 'message' ?? Why a pannacotta to be saved?? Why was there 333 levels ?? Is it because that would give you 666 cellmates as a reference to hell and the dark level below 333 was a reference to hell and basically saying were going to there anyway even if we think we are good??
Who knows but i think thats why its a solid 8/10 movie.

The normal working man on the street is paying more tax than the biggest companies in the world right now and we are letting it slide.The movie is dark but sometimes brutal imagery is the only way to convey such a message as other movies like the fantastic ""The Laundromat"" have been largely ignored despite telling us 60 of the top US companies paid 0 tax on 79 billion dollars of profit from 2018.The leading man in this story played his part fantastically well and even tho it is only 90 minutes long it feels much longer. You constantly say to yourself why don't they just eat less so everyone gets their share?!!! But as we are seeing during the worlds current pandemic this is no longer the case in the real world and this movie mirrors that perfectly.Yes it is graphic and in many parts disturbing but movies are there to mimic real life and this is sadly as close to that as possible right now.

What is a diploma? What's the use of it? Some users likened this to Snowpiercer. In Snowpiercer there is an explanation for the existence of the train. In this one, no explanation!2) Is the girl on the bottom floor a hallucination, as some suggest? If no, what is the exact message delivered by sending her up? And if she is not a hallucination what does the scene where the chef reprimands the cook about the panna cotta having a hair on it mean?3) If the girl is a hallucination, as some viewers argue, how can the same hallucination can be seen by two people, Goreng and Baharat? And if she was a hallucination and what was sent up to the floor zero was a panna cota, then it means that the message was not understood because the chef thought that it was not eaten because of a hair on it! But this is also a nonsense, because you cannot expect people who eat each other to worry about a hair when they are so hungry!4) I have not come across such a comment anywhere but I think Goreng represents Don Quixote (the idealist) while Trimagasi represents Sancho Panza (the pragmatist), among other possible representations.5) Just to convey a message that people are greedy, there will be no problem if everyone is happy with their share and does not take more than necessary, does the film need to be so disgusting?",The Platform

What happened when the child ascended to the top? where did the child wind up? in the kitchen quarters? - what did they do when they saw her? I felt like they could have tied this together... it didn't warrant the deep thought provoking ending. The cooks seemed like they knew what was going on down there, the environment didn't seem friendly in the kitchen, was a child being down there supposed to make them angry while people 200 floors down starving and eating each-other didn't? that part seemed dumb to me.also, why would the flan returning to the top signify something to them? were the staff testing the people? was this part of a bigger social experiment? these questions need to be answered to even understand what the point of that was.

Another characteristic is the more-less stability of the classes - you very rarely move more than a few steps up or down the ladder during your lifetime from the position you had been born into. Whereas it is the socialist regimes where, depending on the whim of the dictator, secret police, or some invisible power, you may find yourself on the good floor, and in the other wake up in prison, gulag, or concentration camp.Also, we here don't see any abundance on the top floors! For Christ's sake, those on the top floors are just starved men being given TWO MINUTES A DAY to eat! For thirty days, not knowing where they'll wake up next!

Put it uphill and let it go and it will reach the driest little spot. But he didn't know that money trickled up.""
Will Rogers (1932)In the 1980s, the term ""trickle-down economics"" was used to describe President Ronald Reagan's economic policy that included tax cuts for businesses and the wealthy (those on the upper level of the economic spectrum) under the pretense that it would stimulate business investment in the short term and benefit society at large in the long term. It was not money or water that would trickle-down literally, but other societal benefits that would trickle-down abstractly.At the time, Reagan's economic policy was subject to scrutiny and criticism (even Vice President Bush referred to it as ""voodoo economics""), and yet its influence is still apparent in the economic irresponsibility of those who followed Reagan (in America and elsewhere). Like the prisoners in a vertical prison relying upon a trick-down system to provide food, we are complacent in the political process, hoping that by our complacence we will be reward (elevated to a higher level) or at the very least not punished (relegated to a lower level).For the overwhelming majority, as for the majority of those within the vertical prison, power is abstract and unreachable. We obey their rules voluntarily or upon threat of harm (extreme heat or extreme cold), and we hope that we may live to see another day. We know that there are enough resources for everyone to live comfortably, but we have also resigned ourselves to a reality in which resources are not distributed fairly.The protagonist is a thinking man. But, under the influence of an old and cynical man, he too resigns himself to the realities of the vertical prison. It is not until he meets the dreamer (a woman who is breaking the rules in pursuit of her child who may or may not exist) that he questions the reality (that is, resumes his inherent state as thinker).When the thinker meets one of the architects of the vertical prison (who has entered the prison to improve its system), he answers a call to action. But first he must reject the cynicism of the old man, who imparted his belief that human nature is to blame (rather than a system the imposes a hierarchy). Though the architect is lost in disillusionment, the thinker meets to doer and enacts a plan to reform the prison once and for all.",The Platform

I truly had a lot of caveats with this movie, so I wasn't expecting much about It, and maybe It is a positive point, 'cause if you watch it as a movie It sucks, but as a criticism to our society, it's wonderful.
The positive points of the movie are too many to be quoted, so I'll only highlight some (no technical): The Director's way to show us the history is amazing, the script is also amazing (although there are somethings I would make clearer), the Ivan Massagué performance is what makes the movie great.

Plenty of people are self-sacrificing. Many people live to make the lives of others better. This movie however never questions that people are uncaring towards others and are even intentionally malicious towards others by nature. The whole idea of this movie depends on an unrealistically terrible portrayal of human nature. Why would people eat in insanely messy ways if they knew others would eat the leftovers? It also suggests that even people who find themselves in fortunate circumstances might just kill themselves because they are so concerned with the mere idea of having to face future hardships. Whoever conceived this movie has a dark and dismal view of humanity. This movie could actually push the idea into the mind of the viewers that they should expect others to never have compassion. I worry it could have a bad influence on people. In the real world people generally care about each other, even strangers.",The Platform

But, like, it's soooo symbolic. And it has metaphors. You say it's over-preachy. How bourgeois of you.
It's an interesting concept mechanically, but carried out with blaring tones of the message it was trying to convey.
What message? Watch the first 15 minutes and the message will be hammered at you hard you'll be as sick as the people below Level 50.
Had decent moments. The gore and horror was sickening (well done). The acting would be really good if this were community college theater.
Did I mention the message? Yay communism. Because those on top will always debase the food for all below and betray everyone else, because, humans?

But it introduces an interesting twist where you can wake up every different moth in a completely different class, above or below. If you are way above you get everything, if you are too below you get nothing, not even scraps and give way to the movie's more gruesome scenes. But in Snowpiercer the people in the back of the train worked, in The Platform no one does nothing, they are just prisoners being given things.Now most people interpret this as a condemnation of capitalism, where some take all the profits and others get none. Yet, that is not what capitalism is. Capitalism is the ability to keep the product of you own labor. And in this movie there is no labor. There is only ""The Administration"" that gathers everything into a single pot and them distributes it in a system that it alone sees fit. Prisoners, or more likely, sinners, as they are portrayed, get little more choice than to allow to give to others what was given without labor to them or not.And what system you may ask works in this way? Where production is centrally decided, where all the food/income is centrally distributed? Where the members of the party above get first pickings of the distribution and dilute it more and more as it goes down the distribution chain until it gets to the plebs that have no say of how they work, for whom they work or even need to work in the first place for their share?
I call that communism. Full of good intentions, hoping with all its moral high-ground that people act as robots. without corruption, with machinal calculation, producing just that same as the machine besides them, deserving no more than the machine besides them, no personal wants or needs, robbed of any individuality or differentiation. And what happens invariably is that ""The administration"" dines like kings, and the plebs get scraps and fight each other for survival, not for a better wide screen tv or a better vacation resort, for survival of flesh and blood already been stripped of all humanity.
In the end, only an iron fist imposes charity in such a system, as the main character in the movie comes to understand. In this system you can only distribute a portion of food along with an iron rod. Only one great leader, one messiah, one great savior comrade, can make this society work.And people call this capitalism instead of communism... oh you poor summer child's.
You would choose a prison of ""fair"" distribution of scraps over a system of self sovereignty and voluntary exchange of goods and services. Many have, and many would not do so a second time, many more had no second time.So I give this movie a 7. Interesting philosophical proposition, decent acting though cartoonish at times, plot holes a plenty, I don't care for gore movies, in fact looked away through those scenes, but if that is your cup of tea, they are probably fine.

The movie is already strong enough for the message it's trying to tell. The story line is unique, characters are great . I would like to thank the creator for bringing such a movie.
Also saying that there are some weakness i felt as the movie flows there are just questions which are unanswered till the end. The ending of the movie was not quite convincing, the message is not strong enough. It felt like movie take it turn from realism to spiritualistic.

580,my_lena66,Ending needs some time to process,9,6 April 2020,"Like many others I was taken aback and a bit annoyed by the ending while watching the movie. However after it simmered down in my mind, I realize it was honestly the perfect ending. Thats the point, we cant see things ''end'' all the time. We cant see everything through. We have choices, and chosing to ''fight the good fight'' and hope to achieve change to a horrible system in order to help others is the ultimate quest. We wont always be able to know our actions and sacrifices will really produce the change we want, we cant be sure change will immediately come. And we need to be ok with that, and still do what is right and hope others will do their part and do the same.The platform in its own way is about community and what role we chose to play in it. Technically speaking he couldve easily lasted another month and gotten out of there with his diploma forgetting the whole thing, like many others probably did or planned to do. He chose to fight against a horrible system to his own detriment in the hope of changing things and making things better for others. We arent superheroes that can suddenly out of nothing create massive change all by our selves. We have to rely on other people and hope others will do the right thing once they realize the horrifying reality and the victims. Sometimes change doesnt look nice and comes in many packages (using his power over the level under him to get them to help everyone portion food). But also about willful ignorance of the people that keep the system running, and how who we surround ourselves with affects our lives, thoughts and what we chose to do.Accepting life in the cell and making friends with a selfish ahole who despises others and puts them down to get himself up, leaves him in a helpless position, almost to die, because this person will always look out for themselves first. Being in a cell with a person that wants things to get better he rethinks the system and what he has learned and gets inspired to be a part of making things better for others too. Being in a cell with an energetic, hopeful and idealistic man, energizes him to take charge and do more to help everyone.",The Platform

583,yassinefadhlaoui,"All systems cannot garantee equality, not all classes are the same",10,5 January 2021,"What an amazing film. It is original and can be interpreted in several ways. In my opinion I see that the table is just a symbolic thing, and it cannot be enough for more than 600 people (300 floors × 2 mates on each level). It is a test to see how people will react despite Imoguiri's claim saying that the food is enough for all if one eats only what he needs, we learned that she does not know about the platform because she claimed that there are no humans below the age of 16 but there is Miharu's daughter not only that, but she also claimed that the platform has only 200 levels only but we saw that are more than that. The film reveals how greedy the human being is and that's the first trivial thing we can conclude. Also, we can conclude that all attempts to establish an equilibrium in the platform failed through soft resistance reflected by Imoguiri when she tried to convince the guys living on the level below to only take what they need, so the food can be equally shared and probably enough for every member of the platform to stay alive (that one failed). Also, the hard resistance reflected by Goreng and Baharat where they used weapons to stop people taking more than what they need, but we clearly see that they end up killing people they claimed they will help survive I assume this models communism. The capitalism is reflected by almost everybody else opportunistic people who cannot hide their greed and who cannot think about others also the platform favorites this category because whenever a mate kills his mate and eat him he will be upgraded next month and that's clear throughout the film:Goreng at level 48 => did not eat his mate => reassigned to level 171Goreng at level 171 => he ate his mate => reassigned to level 33Goreng at level 33 => did not eat his mate => reassigned to level 202.
Also, the film sheds light on the difference between the social classes. In fact, the mates of a high class (level 5) were getting enough food, having sex, not thinking about how to survive they were discussing which god Baharat believes in but below in the lower levels (poor classes ) only violence is the predominant thing.
The ending is amazing probably the platform's theorists, engineers and maintainers were waiting for a hint that proves that prisoners learned the lesson by sending back a message : an untouched panna cotta. Surprisingly enough, the dying Goreng sent back the girl which in my opinion shows the engineers and the managers of the platform that even if they put a rule ""no one under 16 is allowed to get in the platform""
They themselves end up by not respecting it.",The Platform

We get it after the first 5 minutes: people are greedy and self-serving. But the details don't make any sense and seem to work against the main moral of the story. Why are they constantly randomly changing levels every month? How does that work into the allegory? What are the motivations of the Administration? How would anybody be expected to be selfless in that situation if they don't even know how many people are below them that need to be fed? Why are some people there as a punishment and others by choice? Why is there meaningless symbolism all over the place (e.g. the bottom level being 333)? Where did the kid come from? None of it makes any sense whatsoever.

A thoughtless structure that traps humans and brings out the most primal in them. Even though in the movie the prisoners are pushed to the limits of their biology and humanity, the example given is nothing short of reality. The platform is like the stairway to financial and social success, in which people who are higher up represent the superwealthy who can feast in compassionless ways, and those on the lower end represent the least fortunate, fighting for scraps. You could compare the structure to our current capitalist driven society. The idea of sharing your food is like socialist basic wealth income, trying to me incepted into the system, only to fail miserably. I can conclude this from that message : Socialism must be enforced by the Administration for it to work, human inherent greed won't allow it to blossom spontaneously, maybe that's why socialism so far was not able to be adopted without a dictatorship.

You are not going to see a film, wherein everything is explained from A to Z. There are many plot holes, if you are looking for them. This could ruin the story for you, but does not have to, if you are ready for seeing it, as a form of art. Despite that, the backround story is thin, almost non-existent, but actually it does not need to be more explaining, although it could be.(Because of this, I do not rate 10 stars)The positive site of this film shows through the beautiful allegory to society and the economic system we are living in. The characters portray different traits of the human mind like egoism, opportunism, altruism and rationalism in a great way. Another positive aspect is the acting, which is as authentic as the makeup.

603,congamabongo,The Platform - A classy Film.,8,14 April 2020,"I liked it. I found it highly entertaining and agree that it contained a metaphor within. However there are gaping flaws in depiction that ""evil capitalism"" has been exposed, which many reviewer's seem to express, and to which, I'll try to convey a contrary viewpoint.I liked that the film, for the most part, respected the viewer's intelligence enough to try not to spell out or push its message too hard, and instead focused on creating drama from the world itself, while allowing that drama to speak on its own terms. But there were unfortunate moments where the writers couldn't help themselves.There's a moment when the lead character, in his apparent naivety, calls for equal distribution of the food. His gruff and experienced cell mate says ""What are you? A Socialist?"" This line was awkwardly shoehorned in. In the specific context, where desperate prisoners are stacked 333 floors high on top of one another, and are forced to survive on the left overs of those above, until there is nothing left to do but cannibalize one another - we can see that the goal of the old cell mate is clearly savage survival at any cost. To think that he is acting on some kind of higher cognitive principle of economic systems is ridiculous. Yet, like I said the writers couldn't help themselves.This single slip dissipates the lack of subtly, and it becomes clear that we are getting preached at about evil capitalism - Even though the rest of the movie is quite well done.On the flip side, it's far more likely that The Administration corresponds to Government, of which Socialist are advocating more of, and supporting the institution of Government to gain absolute control of the economy. This, rather than an imperfect Capitalist system, which in its dirtiest form, encourages bad actors to purchase access to the Government monopolies on healthcare, education, land, money and warfare, from which they can then gain special privileges and advantages over those 99% who do try to play by the rules.The other gripe I have of this film, if it is to be taken as a metaphor, is that it shows everybody within the 'platform' system to be an entirely helpless victim, which in the film, they basically are. The actions of our leading characters show that it is still possible to fight, somehow, even if it seems in vein. But that was admirably left to the viewer to assess the actions, choices and effectiveness of that strategy.In our real society, we're not quite that helpless. Victim mentality is one of the primary reasons people are dissatisfied with their lives and the system. When in contrast, people are far more capable and powerful than they allow themselves to believe. The ruling class depend on people succumbing to that defeated mentality. We can and must take control of our own lives if society is to overcome the ""Administration"" calling the shots for us, while we depend on them and their cronies throwing us their left over chewed up bones. The idea of comfort, security and blissful ignorance are all the things offered in exchange for our individual freedoms. And we will continue to be victims unless we step up and decide we are not.It's much harder to argue the above point, if the Platform scenario were the literal prison in which we live, but thankfully it's not.In the story, the protagonist is trying to get the Administration to see prisoners differently, in order that they can make changes for the better. Is it a good idea to try and appeal to the same administration that set up this whole sadistic, dystopian prison in the first place? Of course not. But perhaps their goal is different.8/10 for visceral impact and originality.",The Platform

If everyone would have just ate their favorite food which they were asked during interview, the food could have reached the last floor in hole. The movie shows fight between two different thoughts of philoshphy: capitalism and communism.In movie, people wakes up every month on new floor. It's like getting born in a different family at different level every month. If it's a rich family you are born in, you will not to have worry about basic needs. But if you are in poor family, you will have to fight for basic survival.In real life, the level on which you are there depends upon your current circumstances (luck) and amount of work and struggle you do to uplift yourself. If there is equal distribution of wealth just like in movie, there will no motivation to work.So, what's the best capitalism or communism?? I think the right way is middle way. Rich should understand beyond a point accumulating wealth will not bring more happiness and they should always do something for those who can't survive and uplift themselves because of their circumstances. At the same time there should always be extra incentive of working hard so that people remain motivated to work hard and keep on working.One more point, movie shows so much of meat being cooked and eaten.

We the audience can see the progression of the character (horror aspect) within the hellhole of the tower change and obviously conflict. The deeper down the floors he gets the much more gory and frightened the scenes turn. Its a clear contrast to the top of the floor.I agree with the theme of the movie being capitalism and it's infliction on the bottom class tricked from the top. However, the ending takes away from the message of the movie. Being ambiguous was a great decision but there are too many questions for the viewer to make any solid judgement which is what the film seemed to wanted. Its difficult to decipher not knowing about if the many floors did exist, if the MC died, if the little boy truly existed, if the message reached the top or not, and so forth.

629,anniepkao,Nothing to do with capitalism,6,22 February 2021,"Cool idea for a film, but if the filmmakers were trying to depict capitalism in our society then they definitely failed.Capitalism is about people at the top TAKING from those at the bottom, not the bottom receiving some kind of welfare from the top. Corporate executives at the top decide to NOT pay the working poor a survival wage so they starve while the stores have to throw away all the food they can't sell. Farmers produce so much food and yet they can't pay their bills because big companies need to make a profit for their investors.We have more than enough food in the world for everyone, but the majority of it gets thrown out. Even if it's literally distributed top to bottom, everyone will still get more than their share. Sure, the lower classes might only get plain food like bread and beans, but it won't run out, not even close. Therefore this film makes no sense if it's about capitalism.Then what is it supposed to represent? It seems more like the Soviet's centrally planned economy. Holodomor maybe? I see some similarities:Those at the Moscow were too disconnected from the famine and did not provide adequate aid.Some farmers hoarded food for themselves while others starved.When people were found out to be hoarding food, they were executed or sent to the gulags.People actually resorted to cannibalism.The authorities set up blockades and limited people's movements.They also suppressed information, preventing news of the famine from reaching the outside world.If the filmmakers were socialists trying to criticize capitalism, then they completely failed and ironically depicted Soviet Communism. But obviously, stacks of bread going down the levels (where people wait in a bread line) wouldn't have looked as good as beautifully made decadent food.***** The Soviet government was NOT socialist. Socialism is when workers get a fair share from their work without any bosses/shareholders or a totalitarian State profiting from them. An oppressive Stalinist State could never achieve socialism even if they called themselves socialists.",The Platform

I did not like the fact that capitalism seemed to win in the end but that's just me.The ending was quite ambiguous - I would have liked to see some more answers to what the hell I was watching. There was potential foreshadowing for a complete revolution and a complete change in the story, but it seemed to keep building up for nothing. The young girl being the 'message' was a bit strange (and how the hell did she stay asleep on that platform moving up at lightning speed?) but as I said the ending resonated with me, and a lot can be taken out of it.

643,jose-21651,A dystopian alegory of the society with lef-wing political bias.,5,28 June 2020,"The story pictures a dystopian correction center where the prisoners are confined in stages and given food remains from upper levels. It's an alegory of the society, where the privileged class is represented by the upper stages, and the renegades of the society by the prisoners in the lower stages.The story shows how the selfishness of some greedy consumers in upper levels result on misery and starvation on the rest of inmates.The trick here is that the prisoners can't do anything except consuming less, their levels seem to be randomly assigned, however an in-depth analysis seem to unveil some patterns where violence and greediness are favored by the system.The political message is clear, and in line with stereotypes of the evil wealthy, who are to blame for the scarcity and inequalities in the world. While it encourages a reflection on our personal responsibility in the inequalities of the society and our consumption patterns, the alegory is biased by the so called moral of slaves, where the personal weaknesses are elevated to virtues.
In the alegory, the amount of food is fixed, and there is nothing that prisoners can do to improve their share, except consuming responsibly. The lack of empthy with lower levels does not seem according to our society either, but on top of this, the inmates can't use their intelligence or theri efforts in order to improve their personal and collective situation, to produce more food, to create value, as it is the case in real life.´This anti-capitalistic spirit is very much in line with the political sign of the government that helped funding this film through public entities. And it goes as far as to justify the violence, since social justice is not spontaneous, an idea that reminds of the concept of class struggle and revolution in Marx or Engels.The end of the movie is deceiving, the story is not properly closed and leaves the spectator with many questions and interpretation...

The upper levels get food while the middle levels get some remains and the lowest levels get broken dishes without any remains. Once per month the ""prisoners"" get sedated with gas and are put into another level. That's the whole concept of the strange place in which the protagonist wakes up.Every person in this kind of prison is there by choice, either to get something as reward (or in return), to avoid regular prison or to prove something to someone.Some scenes where very disgusting for me like when they have to eat the remains of food on which the upper levels spilt their body-fluids on or when the protagonist has to eat chewed human flesh to stay alive.The thing which makes it more than a splatter-gore-psycho-horror is that it tries to deliver a message.

656,dmziontz,A Theologian's Movie,8,10 May 2020,"I write this review fresh from watching ""The Platform,"" without looking at any other opinions.
""The Platform"" is a Netflix original; a conceptual sci-fi/horror movie that brings up many, many intriguing questions about society, caste, and religion. The existential questions posed by ""The Platform"" are rich with self-examination.
To begin, I've always been into the ""You're in a situation that you can't really explain"" approach to storytelling. Real exposition and backstory are not needed. It doesn't matter HOW you got to where you are. Fact is, you're here, and you gotta deal with it. This alone is a great metaphor for life. Understanding a backstory before the real story's beginning is nothing like the linear narrative of our own lives. You can't go back in time to change anything. What truly matters is where you are and what you are willing to do to stay alive. The NOW is everyone's personal benchmark. Planning for the future and learning from the past is important, however they will always be eclipsed by the NOW, what's here in this moment. Not to go all Ram Dass here, but the movie asks us to be here now.
As a Minister and Theologian, I found the religious symbolism throughout the movie fascinating! Our lead character is often referred to as ""The Messiah."" This title he earns quite spectacularly. ""Eat My Flesh, and drink My Blood,"" has never been portrayed as deeply in film as it is here. The unlikely duo that ends this movie are a black and a white man fighting together. This concept explores and represents the duality of Christ; two men who couldn't be less alike in values and morale are brought together to save the world. They represent the martyrdom and mysterious nature of Christ: fully divine, yet fully human,The black guy even gets pierced in the side by a sword. Along the way, they run into priest like characters, and the hero even saves a ""Mary Magdalene"" from being killed. If you dig into the subtext, many other religious metaphors swirl around the scenes and are adeptly woven throughout the dialogue. Even in it's over-dubbed format, the film clearly communicates its deeper concepts (a rare treat!).
Bottom line is this: If you enjoy movies that are symbolically conceptual, evocative, and full of metaphor, this movie is gold. As a Minister (and, yes, we watch scary movies, too), I found it to be a rich buffet.",The Platform

I believe this is a sign of quality.The thriller form of the movie was very well handled. It correctly served the subject of the movie. Indeed, there was nothing to understand behind the gore scenes except for a reenact of the human ego at its worst as well as a representation of hierarchical systems in society.What I found disappointing in the movie was the lack of personal opinion. « El Hoyo » seemed to have displayed the representation of ""oooh the world is horrible"" as THE entire subject of the movie. Even Goreng, the first character who appeared as a disruptive element in the storyline, never give any sort of nuance to the subject. I've seen no solid thesis or personal reflexion about this subject so skillfully presented. Fireworks for fireworks.

674,kamranium,The Platform,8,5 April 2020,"As a 94 minutes long metaphor- ""The Platform"" is proof that you don't need astronomical budgets to make a worthy film. Obviously many interpreted it as a criticism of capitalism and overconsumption hence being pro-communist. But contrary to this notion I think it might indeed have a really strong case against communist ideology. By condemning capitalism, it simultaneously ridicules communist ideas for their futile attempt to tame human nature. At least the former had naturally occurring set of rules forced by nobody whereas to implement collectivist ideas you need to exert brute force as we witness Goreng and Bahart perform during their descent through the floors of the hole. At this point, it is impossible to overlook the direct reference to bloodshed of red revolutions who targeted upper and middle classes in order to provide for the so-called proletariat triggering catastrophic events.
Goring is presented to us as a Don Quixotesque figure who is celebrated for his irrationality on the face of reality and became a comical symbol for revolt against the threats that are not always tangible and real. That being said source of the problem here is not the system. No matter how flawless the system is, humans will always have imperfections contributing to its corruption.

From a finance guy's perspective though, I would like to bring to the discussion what I see as the biggest shortcoming of that allegory: The amount of food on the table is fixed. The movie concerns itself only with the way that fixed amount is being shared while overlooking the fact that the greatest contribution of capitalism to society is the increase of the 'pie' (see amount of food). So, although capitalism creates great inequalities in the sharing part, it attempts to redeem itself by creating a much larger 'pie' to share. With that factor missing from the allegory, I am afraid that the resulting conversation is doomed to be flawed.

The voice over lacked convincement and emotion.Why were people there? Was it prison? Why were people signing themselves in? Why would anyone volunteer for that? And bring a child and a dog there too, I don't get it.The tier system I got. The idea of eating what you asked for was a minute detail that passed in a flash with the guy holding his snails.They leave 6 with a plan to disperse food after 50, but he failed to plan for so many floors around 148? He had been on 202, or did he already forget that.The basement is just a wide open pitch black void? What's holding up 333 floors of concrete? What moves the concrete slab table of food?
At no other point in the movie other than the end did the table ever go up. No cameras but ""they"" know whenever a piece of food is withheld? What generates the extreme hot and cold punishment? We see the basement at the end, there's nothing there.Why all of the high end chefs forced to make gourmet food? Is that supposed to elude to the idea this is some sort of resort? Is that why people sign up to be there?Honestly none of this movie made a bit of sense until I read other people's analysis of it. Complete waste of time. Terrible execution.

696,kaushal0181,Spontaneous Solidarity,10,9 November 2021,"I see the movie exactly as I see the world. There is not one difference. The creator, the god, the unknown prepares everything perfectly and sends it to the universe, the Earth, believing that if everyone takes their share, all would be good.The upper levels represent those who are closest to the creator and are most blinded by their privileges and ignorant of their duties. The lower levels represent those who are farthest away from the creator and are most unheard, suppressed, powerless, and needy.It may be easy and popular to blame the creator (aka. Administration), the cellmate (aka. Friends and family), the level where you are this month (aka. Social status). While we are in the lower levels we can recognise many problems due to our first-hand experiences, but as soon as we get to the upper levels we become the problems.In other words, if you feel unfortunate, unfulfilled, wronged, then you're not close enough to the creator to make a difference. But if a moment comes in your life when you are feeling very fortunate, heavenly, luckiest, then that is the moment you must remember that you're much closer to the creator. If by chance you remember the moments you spent in the lower levels at this point, it will push you towards spontaneous solidarity, and you will become the change, the one who defies the problem itself.The spontaneous solidarity was achieved because someone was able to live through both such experiences. If you are fortunate enough in your life to experience both sides of a situation, you have the opportunity to enlighten the spontaneous solidarity in yourself which will be able to remove the problem, but the action must be taken swiftly while you are the fortunate one (in the upper levels). That is where the problems take shape.",The Platform

706,zaferdc,My interpretation of the movie,8,22 March 2020,"I think rather than focusing on a plot, the movie depicts different edges and human profiles in life. The platform is our world, and the administration are the governments, and the levels are the social classes that are created. The administration (government) works with care, but due to flaws in the capitalist system, there are people suffering/dying.The main character Goreng has norms. However, it doesn't take too much until he loses his mind in a corrupt world. He wakes up in the platform with an old man, who is completely aware about the system, and has already completely adapted. When he is up, he eats as much as he can and abuses it. When he's down, he does everything needed to stay alive. The woman that formerly worked for the administration regrets her earlier duties of sending people in to the platform, as she 'didn't know' - depicting similar people that work for governments nowadays. She regrets it, hence sends herself in and tries to change the system by speaking up to the lower level everyday. However, the tone of her message is not enough in the cruel world; Goreng's tone that includes threatening seems to work though.Goreng tries to change the entire system with Baharat. I think, that ultimately they failed, and that starting from some part of going down (I am not sure from where), Goreng starts to hallucinate. Initially, they are trying to send a message to the administration by sending back untouched clean food - which is normally impossible in their system. They fail in this, but Goreng, imagines a bigger message: in the lower levels, no one is interested in food from the table anyways; they are eating each other. A child that survives the bottom floor would serve as a bigger message, as she is a metaphor to our social norms and ties.
Baharat tried to go up several times, but going up does not have anything to do with willingness. There are always people that are going to stop you. It is a matter of luck, just like in the movie. One day you wake up in a horrific situation, the other day you are happier. When you are happy (or of higher class), you seem to forget about the bad days and lose your emphaty as a human being and exaggerate in every act that you do.The woman that worked for the administration thought that there were 200 levels. The movie describes that there is always worse and way more people suffering than they seem to observe - so bad that the world and the governments (the woman) do not realize (or tend to ignore) while being part of the system.Overall, I think it was a great movie. I like open endings so that I can draw one myself.",The Platform

What's the thing that saves this film? Well, the thing that makes it actually special is the fact that you actually make your own movie meaning, it's a movie for you to think and make your own theories, it's not a simple story presented to you with the common parts, you have to think about the parts that apparently they're trying to show you.

750,spphr,My analysis and interpretation of each character and the overall meaning,10,28 February 2021,"Writers: David Desola and Pedro Rivero
Director: Galder Gaztelu-UrrutiaThe Platform is a reflection of human nature in an everchanging individualistic society. It is a thought provoking story filled with gore, violence, and greed. A great film everyone should watch if they can stomach the gore. Some will blame capitalism failing to recognize the system changed to socialism which shows the fallacy of both systems with the humans in the condition of the platform.Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia said, ""There may be criticism of capitalism from the beginning, but we do show that as soon as Goreng and Baharat try out socialism to convince the other prisoners to willingly share their food, they end up killing half of the people they set out to help.""So what does it mean? My analysis...The platform can only go up or down and has rules to prevent hoarding. The rules of overeating or taking advantage from the top can only be prevented by the people. The people create a cruel or kind system by either overindulging or refraining from gluttony. The platform is a reflection of how human beings and their nature are dependent on their environment. It also shows the limited cohesiveness and isolation of people, preventing a genuine discourse. The separation breeds apathy for those below.Additionally it has multiple layers that show how people who have more privileges will take advantage of the system. It also reflect the subjectivity of what is good or evil. In addition to displaying how some people change with respect to their status in society.The film is a raw and open wound showing you the malleability and darkness of humans and human nature. People inevitable resort to inhumane behaviors to survive starvation. In times of prosperity, they will be kind, social, and caring. What are we? We are creatures that adapt to varying circumstances and we are most often good and evil, with the level of evilness increasing or decreasing depending on our situation and/ belief system. We are also people that can all benefit by uniting and making sacrifices as a group.Goreng (protagonist) is an idealist. He encapsulate Don Quixote an idealist trying to bring back chivalry. Goreng just like Don Quixote never learns his behavior caused more harm than good and he didn't fix anything. He represents the compassionate that recognize the people can make a bad situation better by having a singular mission of solidarity. While ignoring the reality that despair, hunger, and the need to survive overrides rationality. Also, failing to recognize he lacks the knowledge to understand the depts of depravity and if it can be fixed.Trimagasi (old man) has learned how to survive in the system but doesn't exploit it or try to change it. He reflects the average person that knows the system is flawed but recognize we aren't in a position to fix it. He's wise and a survivor by any means.Miharu (women riding down platform) represents those who exploit the system. She always comes from the top, she kills and fights riding down to feed the child on the bottom of the platform (if that child exists). The platform rewards her barbarism by keeping her on the top level. Eventually despite learning and exploiting the system, she still gets consumed by it. She may represent the social activists, or people who try to help the most vulnerable despite their own flaws. Or she may personify people who choose to self-flagellate, while benefiting from the system. I believe she epitomize a search for hope in a distressing environment.Imoguiri (ex admin worker) represents the person who knows the system exist but unaware of the cruelty and extent of the decay. She was ill-advised it's only 200 floors and enough food for everyone. She encapsulates all citizens creating solutions without enough understanding to provide one that works. When she realizes the narrative she believed is false, she folds, unable to handle the depraved reality. She gave Goreng the idea about solidarity oblivious to the complexity of the environment. An idea he ran with because it sounded great in theory.The meals prepared are everyone's favorite food. In theory, if everyone takes their favorite food only, everyone will have something to eat. The reality is portion is not enough and those who are starving or hungry will want more. Those who are in the position to take more, will do so because they can. People who are starving on the bottom will be angry and envious at the top eaters but never angry at those who created the system in the first place. Once the hungry are in the higher position, they too act the same way, with no remorse due to their own treatment on the bottom and due to hunger. This is a great representation for those wanting equality for all when they have nothing and then wanting it all when they have everything.Ramesses II, Imoguiri's dog was eaten. He is named after a Pharaoh best known for creating the first peace treaty ever. He was a great leader and warrior. This represents the death of peace and the beginning of turmoil.Baharat (later platform mate) is like Don Quixote's squire Sancho Panza. He sees the problem and is willing to join Goreng to fix them. He, like Sancho tries to help Goreng fulfill his fantasy of equality while ultimately failing alongside him. He represents those who join a cause they believe in, in hopes for a better circumstance. He and Goreng employ authoritarian and violent means to construct equality, which convinces no one to change.The little girl has double meanings, she is the innocent and weak in the system, she is also hope. She represents the group that cannot survive without help. This can include young children, the disabled, sick, or elderly. Helping this group is altruistic, while also can be dangerous for the helper (at least in the platform). If she exists, then she stays at the bottom because only cannibals go to the top.As hope she survives in the hearts of those who have it. As an illusion (hope), she stays at the bottom because hope barely exists in a system such as the one in the platform.Goreng never makes it to the bottom, the director confirms, the bottom doesn't exist. What we see is a reflection of what he feels he needs to do. This explains why the 333 floor does not heat up or cool down and him walking as if he wasn't injured later. Keep in mind, floor 333 with 2 people on each platform is 666, a number aligned with the devil. It may be a representation of hell. It's possible no bottom exists and it's an infinite bottomless hell.On level zero, The cooks are clueless as to what is going on while meticulously creating delicious meals. They represent the people who have more power, people outside the system that can mobilize change but completely clueless about what is going on because they are too far removed from the ails of society. They are doing their best to ensure the people get their divine food not knowing, the food isn't enough and will ultimately be trampled on, the lower it descends into the abyss. Are these people worker bees in the government? The elite behind their gated homes? Celebrities creating content? We can only guess. The only certainty is they are far removed from the suffering. When the panna cotta returned to the top uneaten, the head chef berates the others because he believes it's because of the hair in the panna cotta. Proof they don't understand the message behind the panna cotta being returned uneaten. This is a perfect example of how people on the outside have a perception far removed from the people adversely affected. While also exemplifying the non-communication between the people who can help and the people needing the help.The system is created by an unknown group of people with no face or name. They know what's going on because they move the people. The motives are unknown. They are ignored because the story is about people in a system and not the system itself.The ending is ambiguous, and Imoguiri is an unreliable source of information on purpose. By her not knowing about level 201+, we will not know if the system stayed firm with the rule of 16 and under or not. What we do know is, whether the child exists or not, we never saw her, we saw a reflection of her through Goreng who was already dead. We also know the child is not Miharu's child because she supposedly had a son.The film brilliantly shows the wickedness of human beings whether for survival, selfishness, greed, or prosperity. Do you change the system or do you change the people? If the system cannot change, then how do you change the people to create fairness and prosperity without resorting to violence? The platform can be viewed as fair or unfair depending on your perspective. Everyone gets two minutes, no food can be stored, and everyone had their favorite food on the platform. The unfairness is the time to get your share. If everyone took only their favorite meal, then it is equal. At the same time, everyone would still be hungry due to the limited quantity. In an individualistic system, with limited resources, and where no one relies on the other, they have no incentive to be selfless.",The Platform

760,antonkostrov,Good film with a meaning.,9,22 March 2020,"The writer had really something in mind and you can tell. This film is a work of art and I love it. The exposition is very clear and interesting. A lot of reviews that give this film a bad rating seem to miss the point by far. You should not watch this film in means of pointing out the plot holes only to be disappointed by the ending. I find it very sad that people are complaining about the wrong things and not getting the whole picture.This should not be taking literally. People seem to think that every movie is like a MARVEL movie meaning you can watch it with one eye closed and then complain about the ending because it did not hand everything out to you. This movie is a study on human mind and psychology In the end, the man sacrifices himself for the greater good, not about the girl, not about him surviving nor escaping.Also I've noticed that the bad reviews come from people who want things explained to them. Things like government in this movie is just an explanation for the whole ""prison"" system to be justified. Suspension of disbelief. Why do these things need to be explained, when everything's that needs to be pointed out, is.It's a very philosophical film and interesting that makes you think deeply about the situation, and how when humans are put into this system, the system takes over and all the good in humans vanishes. And the point is that, it's not our fault. We are programmed like that, and can't do nothing about it. The ending was perfect, doesn't matter what happened to the girl, you'll need to figure out that by yourself. And by that I don't mean theorizing literally where did she end up, but instead what was the point of the girl, the message they had to deliver ground floor, was there really even a message needed to be delivered, or was it just for nothing.Now maybe some answers could be found trom the book Don Quixote, haven't read it, but after this I reckon I will at some point. There was this quote in the end from the book that went something like It's how you use your prosperity and wealth, not how much you have it. That sums up the whole meaning of this prison system, and may be my favorite quote ever among some others.And especially what makes this film marvelous is that it delivers this concept perfectly, I didn't get the feeling of ""oh well great concept but It could've had been done better, because I feel that the director got his message through.Also what I find very interesting is how at the top, where the food was being made, the guy who was responsible for it all, was very picky about how perfect the food had to be and even the tiniest of hair in the food was not acceptable: I KNOW that that is an allegory, just can't figure to what. Maybe god. Need more time to think about it and maybe re-watch the film.",The Platform
761,TheKing87,Many people misunderstood the role of Miharu! My analysis of the movie.,9,8 April 2020,"I think this movie was very interesting and full of interesting symbolism. I definitely recommend watching this movie.I have read a lot of different understandings of this movie, but I think that a lot of people maybe misunderstood the role of Miharu. So this is my analysis of the movie:In general, the facility represents society. The levels represent society classes and hierarchies. The protagonist, Goreng, represents a resistance movement who is ready to use threats and violence to secure that there is enough food for everybody. The old man, Trimagasi, represents a supporter of the system. The woman from the administration, Imoguiri, represents a peaceful movement that wants change but is unable to do so. Miharu who rides down the platform actually represents the upper class (se explanation further below).The cellmates believe that the change of levels each month is random. However, the administration does not randomly choose the levels for all prisoners each month. The administration choses if each prisoner should go up or down the levels each month based on whether they have eaten their cellmates or not. If a prisoner is willing to kill his or her cellmate and eat of them then he or she is secured a higher level the next month. This is evidenced a couple of times in the movie: At first Goreng starts on level 48 with Trimagasi and they live peacefully. Then they move down to level 171 the following month where Goreng ends up killing Trimagasi and eats of him to survive. Then Goreng moves up to level 33 the next month where he meets Imoguiri and they live peacefully. Then they move down to level 202 where Goreng is forced to eat of Imoguiri who has killed herself. Then Goreng finally moves up to level 6 where he meets Baharat.The woman Miharu who rides down the platform actually represents the upper class of society because she knows how to exploit the system. Notice that she always rides down the platform and comes from the top floors and she is always bloodied and emotionless. That is because she always makes sure to kill and eat her cellmates every month, and that's why she always ends on the top floors. Miharu rides down the platform to make sure that there is food for the little girl (which we assume is her daughter) on the bottom floor. The girl is always on the bottom floor month after month, because she has never killed and eaten her cellmate. Miharu rides down the platform once a month so she has to make sure that there is enough food for the girl because she cannot get up again until the month is over (the platform only travels back up to level zero, which prisoners presumably are not allowed to enter). That's why she killed so many prisoners on her way down. Miharu must have a good reason to ride down the platform every month and that was to take care of the little girl. Miharu has managed to stay on top and alive for long because she knows the system. However, even she succumbs to the system when she is killed in a fight with the prisoners.Notice that we learn from Imoguiri that she selected Miharu to enter the facility 10 months ago, that she entered alone, and that nobody under 16 years is allowed in the facility. However, we cannot trust Imoguiri's information because she also said that there are 200 levels, which turned out to be false, and the prohibition against under 16 year olds to enter the facility also turned out to be false. So the question of how the little girl ended in the facility remains unanswered. Perhaps the little girl was born in the facility or she was thrown in there with her mother.The movie hints that there is actually enough food for everybody on all floors because the administration puts every prisoner's requested food on the table. This is evidenced when the protagonist is interviewed by the administration official about his favorite food (snails) and that it will be served while he is imprisoned. We also see that the protagonist sees his requested food for the first time when he is on floor no. 6 because none from the upper floors has touched it yet (but he doesn't eat it). He did not get to see his requested food before because those on the upper floors always ate it before it arrived to him. If every prisoner in the facility kept his or her requested food when it arrived at his or her floor, the floor will not turn hot or cold. This is evidenced by one of the last scenes when the protagonist keeps the Panna Cotta when he is at the girl's floor, which must be the favorite food of the girl. All the prisoners had to do was to take their requested food, and not eat the others' food, so the food would be equally distributed all the way to floor no. 333. However, the prisoners from the upper floors greedily ate more than their favorite food leaving less to the ones on the lower levels. So the main message of the movie is that people are very greedy and are ready to take more than they need, and not so much that the system is flawed. We see that the alternative system that the protagonist tries to enforce by distributing little food to everybody also leads to violence and deaths and is not much better.The end of the movie is quite vague, but it does have a meaning. At the end, we don't see what happens to the protagonist, but it is hinted that the protagonist probably dies. Notice that he was heavily injured and barely got on the platform with the girl, when they reached the bottom, then he suddenly he gets off and walks normally when he sees the ghost of Trimagasi. The girl transports upwards to the top floor at the end of the movie. The protagonist is trying to send a message to the administration by transporting the girl to the top. Perhaps the message is to show that despite that most people are greedy, there are also some people who are willing to show benevolence and generosity to save others.I think this movie was very interesting. The movie is open to interpretation, and this is of course my point of view and I hope you found this helpful.",The Platform

771,darkjewdas,"Fantastic Movie, Great Imagery, Meaningful Plot",9,24 March 2020,"Aside from this being a great movie that really gets you thinking, after thinking for a day or so I think I realized what it was about. They're in Purgatory.Let me point out some scenes to back this up, from highest to lowest. First off, he had a guide from the outset who even after death followed him throughout...his ""Virgil"". For those familiar with purgatory Lust is at the top. When our hero was on level 6, there was for the first time a couple above him. This was the only time in the movie this happened, and you heard lots of sounds. Lust.Floor 32 (or in the 30's) with the woman, she tried to get those below to ration and they told her to basically screw off. They ate as much as possible, moreso than anyone else in the movie. Gluttony.Wrath was all around the entire movie, but when he first woke up in the 70's he saw someone above him murder another inmate. Wrath.Sloth would be when he was tied to a bed for almost an entire month, before having a piece cut off of him. Simple, but effective for sloth I suppose.Envy was a little tougher, I'd have to watch the movie again. But when he woke up to the woman who had hung herself on floor 202 she was envious of him, possibly after the death of her dog? She did pick him to be her room mate.The last one is confusing, but the woman who rode the platform down was Pride. Remember she had NO child, but wanted to be the ""Marilyn Monroe"" type actress. She was at the very bottom, or as close to it, as she could be. Until...Floor 333. Meaning 666 inmates. The bottom floor was hell, or the entrance to it. That means the girl, who set off neither the hot or cold triggers, was possibly the devil or something akin to that. It explains how she was even alive as well.Aside from that, the panna cotta had some symbolism potentially as a false idol....why did the man focus on it? Why did they kill to protect such a mundane item? Just some thoughts...there were lots of little, otherwise unnecessary references that when put together really leads me to believe this.

I'm sure many will say it reminded them of The Cube, sigh, The Platform was so much more than that though.It was refreshing also in regard to the film having a standard length, not the 2.5+ hour drawn out for no reason length that has become so common yet so unnecessary with many of today's films. Not once did I feel as if the movie was dragging or 'filler' was being added. They easily could've gone that route like so many others, especially with the unique and fresh plot that The Platform had, and yet didn't.I am truly torn. Torn between giving it a 9 or a 10.

They're only as good as the world allows them to be. You'll see I'll show you... When the chips are down these civilized people... They'll eat each other.""
It almost seems as if before making this film, Galder just went out and read the whole script of ""The Dark Knight"" and said, "" ah, screw it, I'll make a movie higligthing the bizarre traits of humans that they always try to hide and try to run away from.
And
That's exactly what he does. He captures their freedom and confines them in the barricade of bricks, brick that moves, and it offers something. But this movie, the script, it runs deeper and deeper, with the message and in the search of it. From one hole to another committing and witnessing the human atrocities at its best.
And
For me this movie says what i always think and try to confess, that, ""to be human, it's hard at times.""
Every shot shows a constant withdrawal of human kindness. It also shows how being kind often, well more than often in this situation, is an act to save your future self. Like cirlces, your actions will come in your rescue, whether they are good or bad.
And

Also how did the woman never find her?how does the administration transfer the people to another floor each month? And clean the cells and build new walls or something like that (no scratches) in one night?the self lifting brickThose are the main issues I noticed apart from the misplaced religious content at some points.

796,kanehagen,Food for thought!,6,8 April 2020,"I'm never one to shy away from either foreign films or a dystopian concept, however the stamp of a Netflix original can often taste bittersweet and scream, STANDARDISED! However, Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia's, Spanish film, 'The Platform' provides an interesting and intriguing symbolic portrayal of societal issues of greed, religion and class.Goreng (Ivan Massague) is our protagonist and we wake up with him on platform 48 within a dystopian style prison in which food is descended downwards on a levitating platform. The higher the floor an individual is on then the more food is at their disposal, the lower platforms become understandably increasingly famished, we learn there is about 250. We are introduced to his ominous and deceptive cellmate Trimagasi (Zorion Eguileor) who exceeds in his role of establishing a disequilibrium from the get-go, providing viewers with disgust and revolt as we watch him feast to his hearts content and questionably interrogate Goreng. Trimagasi then goes on to to explain the rules of the prison, exclaiming that each month the duo will be moved to a different random floor, at the hands of fate determining their fortune, the lower floors becoming an abyss of survival, the upper floors a sort of temporary ivory tower in which pretentiousness is seemingly inadvertently conjured. We come to realise that the ambition of the prison is a sort of 'spontaneous solidarity', however the prisons construction does poise issues of hierarchy which are exemplified throughout as those above realise their status and ostracise those below.Throughout Goreng is moved between different floors in which he is faced with adversity we can only begin to fathom, especially in the lower floors where food scarcity is abundant. Scenarios which seem so alienated from our own idealised lives that it propels you into the discontent and disgrace which slowly transgresses Gorengs character in a sort of atypical heroes journey. Starting off as a emphatic protagonist, and becoming somewhat a mere shadow of his former self, his progression as an impression of the situation he is placed under and in doing so he becomes forcibly accustomed to any means necessary survival techniques.The Platform Review 2020The film is surely a jaw-dropping, enthralling and disturbing viewing of which the grotesque nature of the feeding acts to mirror that of the violence throughout, as a sort of dependent relationship of human heinousness. The themes and undertones explored reinforce the structure of the film as ideas of religion are exponentially applicable with the sins of greed, gluttony and murder throughout, with a 'Messiah' is often talked about. The idea introduced within the film in order to combat the starvation of the lower levels of 'spontaneous solidarity' aims creates an overarching essence of consolidation of society and becomes the main aim of the protagonists. Symbolism is therefore at the forefront and needs to be deciphered throughout, this is however potentially a film for active and passive viewers however deconstructing the multiple underlying messages throughout is as entertaining as the animosity our protagonist faces.The films multi-genre nature portrays aspects from horror, thriller, psychological, action and science fiction, and in doing so amalgamate a universe we are luckily distant from. The juxtaposition of the prison from the short scenes we see of the cooks creating the food for the prisoners creates a clear dichotomy of hierarchy whilst establishing aspects of power and status. The cellmates live within concrete cells with just a sink between them and the massive drop in the middle of the cell for the levitating platform, which surely unearthed my fear of heights. Through the grotesque instances we have to experience with Goreng we become increasingly sickened whilst gratified that we don't have to partake in such an entrapment. This possibly provides the basis for reflection of ourselves as a society - without giving too much away the end is potentially consolidating as a relic is achieved, potentially a relic for hope in humanity if fought hard enough for and even whilst shrouded in the revolting acts of the inhabitants. A potential reflection of the anxiety in our own modern day society that if we let greed, murder, inhumane distancing and so on become over-encapsulating in our every day persona, then how are we to properly function as a society. The film is smart like this, the individuals on each floor are so close yet so far, there is a scene when one of the individuals tries to ascend onto the next floor with the upper floor deceitfully helping him before letting go of his rope which really has your toes curling and your teeth grinding. The film plays on the interests of people but also on the business idea that 'problems only travel downwards'. It raises questions about the capabilities of humanity in relation to where they fall in a hierarchy, which, within, is ever changing, and in doing so seems estranged from anything that has come before it.The Platform Review 2020I must say I really enjoyed certain aspects of this film besides the themes and concepts. Goreng's transition is a marvellous portrayal of psychological distress. Whilst, Trimagasi is so detestful in his cavalier position on human life that he becomes a character you love to hate. Furthermore, I believe the dialogue is exceedingly engrossing as the protagonists dissect the situations they are put under and is not once non enjoyable - I would also advise you listen to the Spanish audio with English subtitles as this proves for a more immersive experience. Moreover, the sound and editing creates an eeriness which provides a certain level of uneasiness which is overwhelmingly effective throughout, such as the use of a red overlay in certain psychological scenes to incur a sinister nature.However, some flaws did seem to come to light. 'The Administration', which represents the main antagonist of the film just seems downright generic and can in some sense disconnect you from the film. We learn early on that Goreng volunteered for the prison to quit smoking and read, yet he shares with Trimagasi who is a man slaughterer and is equipped with a knife - his one nominated object which he can bring. In conjunction this doesn't make a lot of sense. Also, it seems Goreng needs a lot explained to him and is put under a lot of very unexpected challenges of which he did not think he would face when volunteering, this also kind of creates an estrangement of the viewer and the story line. There are a few other small things which you may pick up, for instance the ending can feel slightly rushed and especially anti-climatic if the symbolic nature of the film is not deciphered. Some viewers may therefore have a completely oppositional response to the end, however, that is for you to determine.Overall, I did enjoy the concept and themes explored in the film. The characters were also very good and throughout there is a variance of personalities to explored. As aforementioned I did enjoy the editing and the music which creates the atmosphere it is intended to erect. However, there are few discrepancies which do let the film down, which is unfortunate and should have been ironed out before release. Although, definitely an entertaining and unusual watch!",The Platform

800,SarbeswarH,Outstanding visualization of how our Society works.,8,1 May 2020,"The Platform is a Spanish science fiction horror- psychological thriller
film, directed by Galder Gaztelu- Urrutia and was released in 2019.
The film premiered at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival,
where it won the People's Choice Award for Midnight Madness. At
TIFF, the film also secured a worldwide streaming deal with Netflix. It
was released on the streaming service on 20 March 2020.
The 2019 film, is set in a dystopian, futuristic prison known as The
Hole, where the cells are stacked on top of one another. The concept
of ""The Platform"" is undeniably clever. Hundreds of floors tall, it is a
prison in which people are placed on floors two at a time. Every day,
a platform descends through a large hole in the middle of the
building, and it's the only chance for food for the entire day. On level
1, the prisoners have access to a feast of lovingly prepared dishes. If
everyone only ate a small ration, it could make it to the bottom with
something for each prisoner but, it never does.
Goreng is the lead role, who volunteered to enter the prison to quit
his habit of smoking, without knowing the consequences of getting
in. He carried a book with himself so that he could do what he loves
the most. His first cellmate was Trimagasi, the old man who explains
the working principle of ""The Hole"" as the film opens on level 48.
Every day, a platform bearing food descends from the heaven and
goes all the way down, through the opening floor. Goreng at some
point in the film would try to calculate the total number of floors
present in ""The Hole"" by keeping himself awake throughout the dayand observing the movement of the platform and also, listening to
the sound it creates every time it enters a new floor. The rule
explained by the old man and thus, experienced by Goreng was,
every month his cell will change and he will find himself in a new
one. As the level increases, food scarcity increases, and people fight
for their existence by attacking or eliminating their cellmates and
feeding on them. The film is quite disturbing from that point of view.
At level 48, Trimagasi and Goreng can expect some leftovers, and
perhaps, even sip or two of wine. It's a film with multiple impressive
twists given its limited setting, and each of them casts a new light on
how the movie is supposed to reflect society. As the prisoners are
randomly reassigned levels at the end of every month, the old man
says, he was sentenced to 143 at some point. He further says, it was
difficult for him as he killed his cellmate and ate him for survival.
Some of the viewers including me have interpreted as a metaphor of
capitalism and the class system. In the story, the food above the
platform, leaving the upper-tier of prisoners to eat first, while those
lower and lower down the literal food chain left fighting for scraps.
With the heavy metaphorical ending, the director unpacks the
message to the audience.
As the film proceeds, the viewer's come across to see a young girl
who is trapped at the bottom of The Hole. It transpires the child is
Miharu's daughter, and she has been protecting her offspring and
keeping her healthy in the dire circumstances. It seems that Miharu's
insistence to get to the bottom of the hole isn't to find her daughter,
but only to make sure she can make it through the system
unharmed.
In the next part of the movie, we can see the girl and Goreng
attempt to get to the top of the prison, the girl makes her way safely
but he finds it very difficult as he has been too brutalized by the
system, which sees him stuck in the same place. Miharu was an Asianwoman who was kept inside the cell just like others. As the story
proceeds, the viewers have argued that her daughter is a metaphor
of human resilience throughout even the darkest and most difficult
times, and further pushes the notion that only true change can come
from the innocence of youth.
We get to see plenty of food on the top of the platform, and the
motive to do so, was to provide enough food for all the prisoners
present there. While going inside the prison or ""The hole"" each
person was asked to mention their favorite meal so they can add to
the platform. But it is the irony that, within the platform there is
enough food and resources (which can be considered as a metaphor
for capitalism, an economic system we are all imprisoned by) to
satisfy all the prisoners. In our society, the people who come in
power tend to directly or indirectly affect the people below them. If
we take the example of a recent situation we can see, when the
government declared lockdown for a month, people were told to
only take ""the essential things"" and leave the adequate amount for
the rest. But, people here are so greedy and tend to forget their
morals and ethics that they almost did not care about the next
person coming after them. Therefore, creating chaos in the society
for food and resources. We should always keep in mind the concept
of ""Sustainable development"". So, those at the ""top"", over-consume,
and are given no incentive or reason to want to share- leading to
inequality, pain and suffering.
Further, we can see an interesting character named Baharat. Goreng
travels with him through the levels of the prison meeting different
inmates and dividing the food into equal rations. It was said by a
fellow prisoner that the prison is an experiment in ""spontaneous
solidarity"". As the journey continues to the bottom of the prison we
can see dark twisted turns. When they will think they almost reached
the destination, but then will realize that there's more to it and they
are certainly trapped in their own plan. But staying calm in a difficultsituation and keep moving is the only way of life we can interpret by
their actions in the latter half. In one of many twists in the tale,
Baharat succumbs to injuries and dies, leaving Goreng to take the girl
back to the top. But following a strange hallucination where he saw
another inmate Trimagasi telling him that his ""journey is over"", he
unsuspectedly walks away from the platform as the young girl travels
to the top.
The director ended the movie in that manner stating- ""I'll leave what
happens to your imagination"". This states he intentionally wanted us
to realize that the movie isn't going to change the world, but it may
change the viewers. The film has no intention to portray anyone as
""Good"" or ""Bad""; it's about asking yourself what someone would do
if they find themselves in level 200, or level 48 in their life. It's also
about the limits of our solidarity and how easy it is to be a good
person when someone finds themselves comfortably in level 10, but
how hard it can be for them to be at level 182. It's all about ""The
survival of the fittest"" with good morals and ethics.",The Platform
801,atanudhibarad,Original concept matter,9,6 May 2020,"This spanish science fiction thriller is a movie about a prison designed in tower format where prisoners are fed with the help of platform that travels across the tower which moves from top to bottom with a system that each inmate should consume only their share of food. It turns out to be the prisoners at top levels more than required leaving the others below them starving. It leads to bring out the wildnerness and cannibalism among prisoners.The film begins with a man named Goreng the lead character of the movie regaining consciousness on the 48th floor of a concrete prison with just one other 'convict' for company - the seemingly wise yet suspiciously reserved Trimiagi.
He explains the only stipulation of their confinement whilst serving their time. A large platform full of delicious and extravagant food travels downwards from the top floor of the prison to the bottom, stopping briefly at each level. However, the further down your floor of residence is will determine how much, if any, food you will eat that month until you are randomly relocated to another level.This movie is mirror of our society and it is depicted with this figurative drama. It teaches you many things of human nature and a moment to introspect about our own selves.

One I haven't read yet and completely changes the ending is this.
The ending symbolizes the rise of China in our current times and the result of it is yet unknown. It seems very obvious if you think about it . The girl at the bottom is China's poor peasant population, the mother represents the Chinese external relations, bending capitalist rules to take money from the wealthier countries and ruthlessly destroying anything that gets in the way. In the end communism saves China's population from being at the rock bottom and dies out because it has fulfilled it's purpose.

Wouldn't having them, I don't know, ""work"" and then ""pay you back"" make a little more sense? Again, the attempts at critique are earnest, but devoid of any substance whatsoever.

847,IoanSteopoaie,THE ADMINISTRATION HAS NO CONSCIENCE,8,18 April 2020,"""It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self-interest."" These are the very own words of Adam Smith, who was a Scottish economist, philosopher and author also known as ''The Father of Capitalism''.The socioeconomic hierarchy of Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia's The Platform is an obvious parallel to the very world we live in. The film develops a story that points directly at our mode of life, our loose morals, selfishness and lack of compassion for one another, showing the effects of greed that can push someone from being ""a man of principles"" to the total state of dehumanization. This hierarchy is early in the film presented to us by Trimagasi, an old man who's been in the pit for nearly one year. He says that ""there are 3 kinds of people: the ones above, the ones below and the ones who fall.""The motif of social configuration presented here draws similarities to Akira Kurosawa's High and Low, where the precarious conditions and the heat the poor people must endure is the catalyst that is ""leading to conflict and crime"". We might as well mention the newly acclaimed Parasite of Bong Joon-Ho that also depicts how the filth, the floods and the lack of money can force someone to forget about morality.In this case the thing that set the wheels in motion was hunger. Set maybe as an experiment the pit or how ""we prefer to call it, Vertical Self-Management Center"" is what it appears to be a prison like facility with the cells displayed vertically, connected by a hole and with 2 subjects on each floor. Once a day a platform descends through the hole for the purpose of providing the inmates with food. ""Everything is about food. Obviously."" Kind of the same as in our day to day life. We get up in the morning and go to work either we like it or not so we can put food on the table. Here, money have no value as a man who's at the bottom of this hierarchy desperately offers a great deal of green dollar bills to what appears to be just scraps of food.Goreng, the cell mate of Trimagasi, is portrayed as the man who tries not to take part in the system, he wakes up in. At first, he refuses to eat the leftovers of other men, trying to remain true to his values and attempts to persuade the people above and below to start rationalizing the food. A noble gesture, that attracts only criticism from Trimagasi who's assuming that Goreng is a communist. The aftereffect is obvious none. We see here a natural affinity with Don Quixote, the Spaniard hero of the book Goreng chooses to take with him. Could this mean he's fighting with the windmills?Gaztelu-Urrutia goes further showing us utterly disgusting scenes that rarely cross one's mind. With no food to consume, ""the mind clouds over"" and ""hunger unleashes the madman in us"" as Trimagasi says. ""It's better to eat than be eaten."" He does not see a crime in what he's about to do, rather he holds responsible the ones above him. Roles change fast and it's in a blink of an eye that Goreng forgets about the lecture he gives moments before when he's life is at stake.The film built like a metaphor that tells a story far superior to the cinematographic ways it uses, also presents some religious aspects and it's not rarely that it points to some biblical referrals such as John 6:53 ""verily I say unto you: if you eat not the flesh of the son of man nor drink of his blood, ye have no life. He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life. I will rise him up at the last day. For my flash is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him"".
Goreng is even compared with Messiah at some point and the miracle of multiplication of loaves and fishes is brought up. We also may well think about the Matthew 15:26 ""It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs. She said, yes, Lord, yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table.""After understanding the system, Goreng states that ""If that solidarity emerged, they'd know to prevent it happening on the outside"" so the scope of such a place could be the opposite of what we may think at first. When people work together and when they stand up for the good, great things happen. Unfortunately, the modern world is a crazy place and the code of morals is not integral to today's society anymore.""The administration has no conscience"".",The Platform

The message that you COULD take from it, and one that seems very popular is that capitalism is flawed and people towards the bottom of the economic ladder suffer more the further down you go which is a very silly premise so I don't buy that that's what the director intended, unless the director is a moron. Think about it for a second...did you see ANY free markets, bartering or financial profiteering from any of the characters? No, you didn't see that from any of the characters. The creators of the movie DID do those things however.It seems more likely that the metaphor is actually the opposite and could be criticizing communism/socialism instead. Think about it, the government is in total control of the means at the top and in theory, MIGHT have enough to distribute evenly to the rets of the people IF they were to ration everything evenly and fairly, but the REALITY of the situation is that people are not like that and it's a system that just doesn't work.It doesn't work in practice but sounds great on paper, which is the hallmark of socialism/communism.

Our present society is a cycle of organised chaos with no ending. The Platform is a typical modern society with different levels or platform where there are just 3 kinds of people, the ones above (the privileged), the ones below (the unfortunates) and the ones who fall (the disposed).The ones above do not care, the ones below hope to climb further up with the intention of satisfying themselves and dealing with the ones below. Once in a while a reformer surfaces to change the society by simple act of love and showing example but that won't work. Force is deployed and what do you get? Mayhem! A word from the wise appears to be OK but doesn't last because the further down you go in the society the more animalistic the scenario. Friends suddenly becomes enemy at the toss of a morsel of food. Life depreciates the further down you go. Death and silence welcomes you. How further down do we need to go so we could deliver the message? Finally at the bottom you discover that you have lost those who fought with you and you are barely surviving and what you have with you is not the message. The message is at the bottom of the platform which none will get as the platform shoots back up straight to the top.If you are reading this note one thing, the world's society can never be equal. Where you are in life is your platform and while remaining optimistic you only have influence over that platform and maybe the next one below.

So Miharu has no child at all (At least is not in the prison). But who is the child that Goreng tries to save? She is just hallucination of Goreng! Here are 3 strong reasons which back it, first two reasons are backed by mathematics, the other one is backed by story line:1. Miharu went down the hole for many times and she never found her daughter. On average there is a 50% chance for each month that she can go down and find her daughter. There is a 97% (calculations: [[1-[0.5^5]] * 100) success chance for 5 tries in 5 months (during the story timeline). We know that she was there long before Goreng. Let's say she was there for 12 months, the chance that she should find her daughter in there is over 99.9% (calculations: [[1-[0.5^12]] * 100). For 24 months the chance is over 99.99999% (calculations: [[1-[0.5^24]] * 100). So it's really highly unlikely that her child live in that place.2. Mathematically speaking again, there is a 85% chance to be in level 50 or bellow for each month (calculation: 333 total levels/level 50*100), which they have to deal with starvation, and probably kill cellmates and eat them to stay alive. How on earth the kid managed to live for so long time in such a horribly violent place with no food? Clearly she doesn't exists at all.3. If you remember, after the scene that Goreng kills his first cellmate (with help of Miharu) and eats him, there is a scene in the kitchen. The chef is yelling at his assists with a panna cotta in his hands. The chef is angry because he found a hair in the panna cotta and he thinks that they didn't eat it because of the hair. So clearly the panna cotta went up instead of the kid, so clearly the kid is just hallucination of Goreng, and we know that Goreng had already hallucination about his other died cellmated too.This scene clearly shows that instead of the kid, the panna cotta went up to the kitchen, but workers in the kitchen were unable to get the message. Shame.Anyway, if everyone stuck to their own favorite food of choice, or at least eat just one random dish for each day, everyone had enough food to survive.

When you have not enough food and you are counting money before entering the supermarket, or you can't even buy basic things for your child, and at the same time, the rich in the world become more and more wealthy - 0.1% of the population to be more exact (70% years ago was 10%, 30 years ago - 1% and now 0.1! ...), in whose hands more and more wealth is accumulating. This creates the BIG LOSS of resources among people (99% of us), all of this is the fault of the corrupt system in the governments, which are run by the rich, and which must be changed if we want to fix everything! The people should control the government, not the rich! By changing the system, we will be able to enrich our people, and after some time the problem about which the director of this film wanted to show will be solved.

908,russellucas,"Good movie, with holes",6,29 March 2020,"I personally liked the movie, it keeps you on your toes the whole time and has some frightening images that make you realize the complete insane mindset of the people.
A big problem I had with the movie though was how cheap it feels. The protagonist's first cell is with an older gentlemen who has spent ""many months"" there and tells him everything about the platform. One thing that showed heavily to me was when he asked what object he brought with him. The protagonist brought a book he hadn't read yet, hoping it will pass the time for his six month term. The old man goes on about this ad he saw on TV about products in the modern world. He buys a product he thinks is the new thing, and then he turns around and they're selling a new and improved version of it. He gets mad and throws his TV out the window, crushing an ""illegal immigrant"" below and killing him/her. This caused the old man to have to choose between the platform or a mental facility. This all comes straight back to the ""one item rule"" because the ad on his TV was for a knife, and he chose to bring the new and improved one (The ""Samurai Cutter"" or something). This part feels really cheesy because of the way he describes everything about the knife. It brings away the suspense and made me kinda question why he was trying to scare the protagonist in such a weird way.
In addition, the protagonist always has flashbacks of this person and you can never tell when they are real or fake... particularly at the END OF THE MOVIE when he's supposed to be dead, but the protagonist walks with him into darkness like he didn't try to cut him up 2 months ago! (which he tried to do)
Finally, my BIGGEST COMPLAINT ABOUT THIS MOVIE, was how it ended. This girl, who we don't know if she is real or fake goes flying up through the levels on the platform with the audience never getting the answer of if she gets killed or if the ""message"" (the girl) is received. It also leaves off with the main character looking as if he follows the old man into hell. I don't necessarily get the ending for the message or the main character which makes me REALLY MAD about the entire movie.
Overall, a good movie, but had some weird holes and things that were left too open for my liking, but maybe good for others.",The Platform
909,tanesutherland,An interesting film,8,20 March 2020,"The plot is fairly simple - a prison-like vertical underground pit where each level houses two people. Once per day, a platform containing a vast array of food set out like a banquet lowers itself through each floor. The people on each level are given two minutes per day to eat and then the platform moves down a level until it reaches the bottom. There are three simple rules(1) Each prisoner may bring one item into the prison.
(2) No food may be kept off the platform from the platform else your cell will be heated or chilled to extreme temperatures.
(3) Every month the prisoners are moved to a different level of the prison.These three plots may sound basic enough but the film takes us deep into the greed and selfishness of humans. Given that you don't know what level you will end up on every month, needless to say those in the upper levels will gorge themselves leaving no food. The lower the platform goes, the less food due to the greed of those on the upper levels. It shoes heavy parallels to society where the elites of society have no desire to share their wealth and those on the bottom suffer. The film also has an interesting take on social behaviour in that every month you are randomly placed on a level and so one day you may be on top with as much food as you want, the next you're down the bottom starving to death - a situation any of us could experience in real life - one day you're a working man and the next you're homeless.I caught this film on Netflix as it just showed up and I'm glad I took a chance and watched it. B grade, low budget, but delivers a powerful message. It's akin to films such as Ink, The Man from Earth, Cube, The Circle - all low budget films with exceptional story telling and brilliant acting.You will empathise and sympathise with every single character.

How did she even get there when the platform doesn't allow anyone under 16? They give this girl the last bit of food.

It starts slow, with some basic (and easy to guess) details. A prison, food every day, don't starve. The characters were not very complex and it will not be until, but are the little things the one that will truly play with your feelings.The movie begins with a very strong social statement. 'They are above you, they won't listen to you.' and 'They are below you, don't talk to them.'First of all, with every new floor you will pity them more and more. First you hear a number...132 (and most people will try to guess that there are only 150 floors). But then they are taken to 171 and so on until they reach the very end.The second thing that made me wonder was the fact that the protagonist never discovered the truth. The kid was not the message, the cake was not the message...the message was hidden in the question most of them received...What is your favorite food? The main character try to avoid this question but the woman insisted upon an answer. He said ""Snails""...what does he see on the table? Snails.

924,jaspaulseehra,The good and the bad...,6,30 March 2020,"The Platform is a film centering around the will and strength of a person to survive in a poorish, government-controlled dystopia. Goreng, our main protagonist, is thrown into a government-controlled facility centered around hunger, where depending on your level, you may eat or starve and be forced to make unethical and terrible decisions. This idea is deliberately used by the writer to express current societal issues with the rich and the poor, especially with the pandemic going around. Just like any other film, it has its positives and negatives. To start the positives, The Platform does not hold back with its crisp and enticing cinematography, from scene to scene, different camera angles are used to not only show the message but also show our main protagonists descends to madness and, eventual rise and the acting only helps. Each person Goreng gets put with is a part of him. The writer uses an amazing plot device where each partner was apart of his soul being ripped out. From the old man being his lowest point and him purging himself from it by killing him, to the lady being Goreng's last hope in helping everyone in this madness with him, eventually perishing off by suicide, to finally, the black man being his strength and integrity to be free. Another point to note, the last part of him is a black man, symbolizing the unity of his emotions, similar to the unity of multiculturalism. All these characters hold very bland personalities but are admissible because of the ideas explored, as they may just be his emotions. The film also does an amazing parallel to our protagonists' favorite meal, snails. He is compared to the one meal he favourous the most, being stuck hopelessly and being tormented at a slow pace, similar to a snail. Unfortunately, this film holds many negatives with it. For one, the pacing from start to finish is very rushed and almost feels as if they were on a time limit to make this film under. From scene to scene, the audience is not able to fully understand and digest the dire circumstances our hero is venturing through. Furthermore, because of this, the dialogue is very clunky and unnatural at many moments. Additionally, exposition is thrown left, right and center because of this. It almost feels as if I am being told the story rather than viewing it myself. Many scenes are there to just tell the story rather than explore certain ideas. Because of this rushed pacing, a lot of character development occurs off-screen. The worst kind of character development. For example, early off in the film, when Goreng is coupled with the old man, the tragic side of him, he is shown to be a strong-willed man not sure of where he has landed. Instead of exploring his ultimate demise into the madness and eventually progressing towards becoming this old man, we are shown: few, little scenes and the rest are done off-screen with glimpses of what could have been. This film believes the character development is spectacular, rather it falls flat on its face. Due to this, many kills and deaths fail to be cathartic because they aren't earned. Also a quick mention, the idea of him being there for a diploma is stupid. It is a terrible connection and honestly doesn't help the audience feel any more connected to Goreng. Another thing to mention, the ending was amazing and terrible. In many aspects, it tells a beautiful finish to this story while also leaving a bit to the imagination of the audience, but also forces a lot, and I mean a lot, of exposition prior to finish it. I mean, they literally introduce a character and name him ""Wise man"" just so he could say something to wrap the story up, did they give up or something? There are plenty of plot contrivances that I will not mention because I am tired and want to sleep but overall the film has an amazing idea to explore but fails to do so in a storytelling manner.",The Platform

The director himself said he wanted the ending to be upto people's imagination which I feel is just someone scared",The Platform

The atmosphere of the film is very successful The first work as a director is worth seeing and watching again
Then
Even so, there are still some small problems in this movie. In the character building of Asian women and the role stereoscopic sense of the audience, we can add five or six minutes to show the process of her psychological change and her only goodness, like the process of the protagonist's blackening. As the only spiritual pillar of the protagonist, I think we can focus on one more point Next.
Finally
I hope that the director can continue to bring us such a profound and meaningful film. Thank the director, actors and the staff behind the scenes for their efforts.

It will HAUNT me.A caution that this film is incredibly disturbing, but my god is it used effectively in the narrative. This is not brutality for the sake of cheap entertainment, it is truly gripping and visceral; the filmmakers do not shy away from the reality of what starving people will do for food, and it is utterly engrossing and morbidly fascinating.I !!!highly!!!! recommend this film, even if you're not big on subtitles.

932,andrewporto-40728,OK movie based on a flawed premise,2,2 April 2020,"This movie started as enjoyable both acting and plot:
Guy wakes up in a weird prison, little understanding of what is happening, quirky cell mate slowly explaining. It was slow, but it kept my interest.
As the movie progresses, undertones of socialism are introduced (still OK). Once introduced, the message slowly increases to quickly become the sole purpose of the show (about 2/3 way through).
The prison administration is government and they provide the food in a trickledown fashion. The trickle down doesn't work, because the occupants of the top platforms binge eat and urinate on the food. I became annoyed the ""government"" is magically generating the food instead of the food being created by the prison population. The situation related less to true socialism and more towards water rationing in drought stricken regions. (which people generally act responsibly). As the plot became more focused on socialism the flaw became more and more annoying, and I turned it off. From other reviews, it seems the ending was not great anyway.",The Platform

936,harpercorey,A Great Example of Spanish Socialist Film,10,4 April 2020,"A psychological thriller with a strong message, ""The Platform"" delivers as both a gruesomely enjoyable horror and as a fantastic piece of Socialist criticism of the modern zeitgeist. Taking viewers through the depths of the Hole, the film demonstrates the innate flaws in the Capitalist belief system, such as the idea that those above take only what's fair, especially if they've seen the suffering of those less fortunate. The film even ends on this note, as the child, whom the Administration assured could never make herself into the facility, is sent to the top floor, as proof that Capitalism hurts even those it claims to protect.While ""The Platform""s method for pushing its message may rival ""A Serbian Film"" in its heavy handedness, evocative and rather gory imagery honestly portrays the innate inequality rooted in Capitalist society.",The Platform

939,zadolbalologiskat,Thought-provoking movie,10,7 April 2020,"This is my first review on english, so excuse for every mistake.The story happens in one kind of a dystopia or one of our close alternative futures. Main character Gorang is journalist, who takes a part in social experiment at his own will. He must to be kept in prison for two month, then he'll get a sertificate. There are about three hundred cells in this prison, that are arranged vertically, one under another. And there is a platform with food, which is moved beyond this rooms. People who live lower can eat only what is left by previous people.You can't take some food to eat it later, you can get nothing, if you live at lower floors. And once in month you are moved to another level. Coud you stay alive without food for month? Could you kill somebody to stay alive?I have some scenes, that were most remembered by me: some of them are shoking, some are action-packed, and they keep me on the edge of my sit. There are some minor characters, which have important role for plot: first roommate of Gorang is spitting on the food, that goes to lower floors; second roommate is bunching up some meal for people in next levels and trying to explain them to do the same for others; third roommate is trying to get on higher level by rope, that he took to the prison. The woman, who moves on floors on platform searching her child and killing everyone, who tries to interfere her. Feral and insane people on lower floors killing each other for survival. And absolutely empty the lowest floors. That what our main character was seeing while he was moving through the levels. That what kind of people we are.Also I was intrested by Gorang's choice of what he would take to this experiment to him. It's a book, Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes. And as Don Quixote Gorang fights with imaginary enemy - inhuman system, that possessed human mind. But is the system evil? Or people, living in this system, are?What I want to say: this movie has deep, thought-provoking plot. And actors play is very believable. All, from characters and decoration to director's, operator's and editor's work, helps to stay tense till the end of movie.The main question, what I was puzzled by in this story: do we all have that kind of hero inside of us, that can be selflessness and can breake the system at the cost of own life? And what level of our prison we must get on to discover this hero?",The Platform
940,contatogabrielaqa,Not having answers is part of the charm,9,6 April 2020,"I'm seeing a lot of bad reviews that regard specially the ending of this movie and some people missing some facts.
I didn't feel the end was rushed nor that we needed any closure, simply because it does not matter, the message of this movie is delivered and leaves you to think about it, whatever happens to the girl afterwars doesn't matter to it.To the people questioning about the how girl is even surviving by herself on the last floor, here's what I understood:Trimagasi says something around the lines of ""She goes down every month"" about Miharu, this, plus the fact that she always goes down stashed with human (and dog) meat, leads me to believe she wasn't looking for her lost kid, she had long found her. And since it is implied the Admininstration does not know about the kid, she most likely hid her on the last, unhabited floor (I'm not sure right now but I think floor 332 for example had no one in it, and no dead bodies too), without a cellmate. Then, every month she brings meat to the last floor to keep the kid alive.Overall a really good movie, will be watching Snowpiercer because of it. The message can be compared to so many things happening right now and, really, that's one of the great things about good cinema, being timeless.",The Platform

953,jaynuguid-63882,The Platform: A Film Analysis,8,13 April 2020,"While it tries to cloak itself as a science fiction film, the real message of the movie slowly reveals itself as you watch it. You will discover who each of the characters in the film represent in our society. It just boggles my mind how the writer was able to tell a story and create characters that portray how our society functions in the modern era and yet was still able to deliver a viable movie plot that works on its own.***SPOILER ALERT: Don't proceed if you haven't seen the movie yet. Watch the movie first, then read my analysis.***This movie just sums it all up about how our society works in the present. There was no random character in this movie, everyone who appeared in the film represents a group of people in our society. In this analysis, I will focus on those characters starting with the main protagonist:Goreng- He is an Idealist. He represents the people in our society who dreams of change, he is noble and kind. This is evident when he chose to bring a book (Don Quixote of La Mancha) to The Hole instead of a tool or a weapon. The book he brought was even a representation of himself in the movie... a noble knight.The Butler in Level 0- He is the administration, the government. He represents the people in power, the world leaders. He is in control of everything. He meticulously inspects all the dishes being served in the platform, he will not allow any imperfection get away like the single strand of hair he found in the Panna Cotta. He is all about the food presentation, but he does not really care about how far out his dishes will serve the people in the lower levels. Is he even aware that only the people on the higher levels are benefiting from what he serves? Does he only serve the elite... the wealthy 1%?Trimagasi- He is a seasoned veteran. He represents the people in our society who were hardened by the system, people who have already experienced it all and just want to survive day by day. These are the people who no longer desire change not because they never wanted it but because they have given up on all hope. He is the one who told Goreng, not to talk to the people below them because they're down below and also not to talk to the people above them because they will not answer him, ""obviously"".Imoguiri- She is a part of the administration. She worked all her life for the system but she has not really experienced it first-hand. She thinks she knows how the system work but we found out in the movie that she was all wrong. She thought that the Hole has only 200 levels but there were 333 levels in total. She thought that the administration was not letting minors inside the Hole but we found out in the end that a child was in fact in level 333.Baharat- He is a hard-working citizen, the working class. These are the people who aspire for success their whole lives, they work so hard to reach the top of the social ladder but the people higher than them will never allow them to reach their goal because they pose as a threat to their own positions. This was shown in the film when Baharat begged the couple in level 5 to help him climb up; the couple made him believe they were going to help him but they defecated on his face instead.Wise Man in a wheelchair- He is a teacher. He represents the people working in our education system. These are the people who prepare us on how to deal with society, they teach us to be civilized in the modern world. The wise man told Baharat to do a dialogue with the prisoners first before he shows them any aggression but he soon realizes that being aggressive works better.Miharu- She is a parent. She represents the loving parents in our society who would do anything in order for their children to survive. She may appear vicious in the film, but she was only doing what was necessary for her child to survive.Miharu's Daughter- She is the message. She is the message of hope that our society can still reach a sense of solidarity. Sadly, the goal of the Hole for its prisoners was not achieved in the movie, although Goreng and Baharat were able to send a message that there is still hope for the future.It was not explained in the movie how the floor levels are being assigned at the beginning of each month to the prisoners, but I think when you are new in the Hole, they will put you in a level where food scraps will still reach you. Goreng was assigned in level 48 in his first month, Trimagasi's first cell was in level 72, and Imoguiri was placed in level 33 when she entered the Hole. I also don't believe that the cell levels are being assigned randomly to the prisoners in the following months. I think that if the prisoners do not eat or kill their cellmates, they will be assigned to the bottom levels. This is what happened to Goreng and Trimagasi when they went from level 48 down to level 171 the next, then Goreng ate Trimagasi and he went up to level 33. My theory was confirmed when Goreng and Imoguiri went from level 33 down to level 202, then Goreng ate Imoguiri and he was assigned in Level 6 the next month. For me, this represents that you will not be successful in this society unless you learn to be vicious; it's a dog eating dog world; eat or be eaten.This is also the reason why Miharu was killing all her cellmates-- to make sure that she will always be assigned to a higher floor level every month, then she goes down along with the platform to ensure that some food will reach her daughter in level 333. She was not actually looking for her child, she knows exactly where her child is. She never taught her daughter to consume human flesh so she would always be assigned at the lowest level of The Hole. Miharu was doing all of those things to ensure that her daughter will survive.Imoguiri said that the goal of the Hole was to create a spontaneous sense of solidarity, which is also what we need in our society. All the prisoners could have survived if only the people above would be considerate with the people below-- but greed and selfishness always get the best of us. Perhaps the solution was simple: if all the prisoners only stick on eating their favorite food then everyone will be able to eat. The Hole serves all of the prisoner's favorite dish, this was shown during the interview scene of Goreng and confirmed when he saw the Escargot on the platform for the first time when he was in level 33. It was also discovered by Goreng and Baharat at the ending of the film that they can actually keep their favorite food on their cell level without being burned or frozen to death. The Panna Cotta is the favorite food of Miharu's daughter, that's why she was able to eat it in level 333 even if the platform already went down.
Goreng, who dreamed of a better society, tried his best to make the people understand how everyone can benefit if they just stop being selfish and greedy. He made the ultimate sacrifice-- he left the security and abundance of level 6 so he can show all the people how solidarity can save all of them from hunger. But greed and selfishness proved to be the stronger foe.",The Platform

968,isaiahatkinson,An internet gem. Underrated at the least.,8,22 June 2020,"Well! I almost didn't watch this movie because of the reviews.From reading other user reviews I was expecting a film that relied heavily on brash provocative visuals, a film that made little-to-no sense because it wasn't written to make sense, and a film that had a phoned-in EZ Bake Oven ending.What I got instead was one of those rare films that inspire me to continue to search for great cinema! that isn't mired by the modern era meta of insta-feel-good-satisfaction asset flip trash for every genre.The visual & narrative together were top notch.
The plot was left open to interpretation but did not rely heavily on that aspect to carry the film! which is one of the things I really enjoyed about El hoyo.
I personally found the gore and violence to be on the minimal side, when compared to the subject matter, and those aspects of the plot were actually less relevant to my enjoyment then I was lead to believe by other reviewers.There is a ""Je ne sais quoi"" quality to the acting and script that elevates the film to being entertaining while still maintaining its place on the all too crowded shelf of social commentary.A balance that is impossible to strike for most.Don't miss out on this movie! I imagine it will cycle out of Netflix's cavalcade of cinematic options much quicker then their more approachable content.

It dosent show what happens when the girl reaches the top(the message) they don't show an outcome, which holds true to reality, you don't know if that message will either have a big significans to the elites or mean nothing. The movie dosent know because we don't know either, but it will never change, The message will have no meaning whatsoever. If you want to distroy a building to build a newer building, you don't distroy the top floor ( the elites) you have to distroy the foundation so that everything above it crumbles down and get the chance for a new start. That didint happen and it can only happen if there's a restart to humanity. The bottom floor represented the foundation and it was total darkness. You'd think the whole building is floating, That's why the foundation is so strong. It's so strong to the point where you can't distroy it because you can't see it.

974,ahmederenyilmaz,The Platform Review,8,21 December 2020,"A person can live hungry for an average of 45 to 60 days. Hunger is a condition that really tests a person. El Hoyo, the place called ""the hole"" when translated into English, is dystopian and esoteric, a fearful place in the style of a prison, an asylum, an experimental camp where hunger is tested in the worst form. It has 333 floors and two people struggle for life, 666 people struggle for life. 666, although metaphorical, is suggested to be the number of the devil, so is the common opinion. In the Bible, it is stated that this number belongs to the monster and symbolizes man. A hole in itself does not have the property of being a human place. This diabolical number was obviously not chosen at random. The hole is the location of the demon of capitalism in its entirety. If you are not in a brutal capitalist regime, it will drag you into your absence like the swallow of a hole. The hole is equal to the modern world. What is happening in it is indicative of the returns of capitalism. There is the wrath of the hierarchy. If you are at the top, you are the top mind. You are the one who makes the food, creates everything and drives it to the market of all people. The more you go from top to bottom, the closer you get to absence. The value of money, obviously doesn't exist in the hole, just ""eat and survive"", dominates the idea that you will be servant of the system, even if you don't want to. The hole is a reflection of those who dominate the world today, space is only microtransmitted. First novel in the world literary history: Don Quijote. Every person in a hole has the right to keep an object from the outside world with him/her. Goreng is, in all likelihood, the only person in this earthly hell who has taken a book with him. Goreng, who believes that everyone should get what they deserve, that meals on the platform can be done equally and regularly, is placed in the seat of the defender of communism, especially with Trimagasi's claims, because he is on the side of the truth. Communism v. Capitalism are metaphorically removed from us. People's dissatisfaction is endless and inexhaustible. While hunger can be tolerated and people on each floor have the necessary amount of nutrients to carry out their vital activities, no one stops satiating completely. On the axis of the degree lie, the hole is a Life University. It can be read as the naked reality of the world. Goreng, in egalitarian thinking from the beginning, loses himself during a great time with the treachery of Trimagasi. He's completely surrendering himself to his cannibalism. From here, we deduce Goreng's desperation that he has not found the strength to resist the capitalist system for a certain period of time. Trimagasi, though exactly a mad killer, was a victim of capitalism, the knife ad adding water to the sequence of his murders. It was what he did to him that turned Goreng's eye. He said he would not chop. He would kill Goreng to actually eat after he had benefited enough from his body. The concrete equivalent of living a hellish life for yourself is too consistent for the hole, just as it is in our world now. Miharu is presented as an example of a mother looking for her daughter. Although Goreng thinks that it is predominantly true, whether he is a liar or not, he is wrong. Anyway, it's possible that there's no one else besides him who can believe Miharu. Goreng believed that in addition to his genus impulses, there was connection between him and Miharu. Spontaneous solidarity, Platform INC. that's obviously theirs original plan. Goreng's second comrade, Imoguiri, was someone who worked in the admissions for the hole. Capitalism has swallowed it, too. Goreng's hallucinations are also caused by the only effect of this system. Although he says he won't, he becomes a corpse-eater. Spontaneous disaster is available enough in terms of this place. A prisoner named Baharat is a sign that Goreng must perform a show of rebellion. In order to ensure the right and humanity, those at the top need to see themselves. From my point of view, the Baharat-Goreng collaboration is reminiscent of the movie Pompeii. I watched it a few years ago, and their rebellion in the hole is quite equivalent to the Milo-Atticus style. Not gibing in to the system is the main issue, and this issue can hit the entire system deeply. They choose a sweet-gun as a symbol of the riots. Panna Cotta: Italian word for baked dessert. If we examine it as a pronunciation; panna is Latin for ""segregated"", while kotta appears in the literature in Monsoon Asia as ""city"". Segregated city. With this understanding we can make a short inference: The Hole: The collapsed location of the Planet Earth. / The Platform: The mechanism of pleasure that capitalism offers to the elites above. / Goreng: Rebel who defends equality, Don Quijote who fights delusions. / Baharat: Sancho Panza, Don Quijote's deputy, a supporter of freedom, who against racism. / Panna Cotta: Icon of the Goreng-Baharat uprising. The two are the ""segregated city"" of the hole world, which has declared its independence. They act extremely contrary to this place in order to know the value of people. As the Goreng-Baharat rebellion continues towards the wobbly end, the appearance of Miharu's alleged daughter, who has died, seems miraculous. A sign of innocence in the world, the little girl looks stronger than any other people in the hole. Instead of Panna Cotta, the little girl becomes a symbol of rebellion, which we don't know if the people at the top are affected. Given the present, I don't think it will have an effect. In a summary, the hole depicts both mankind and the world. We are brought into the state of a material of the apparatus, subjected to acts that may cause us to lose our humanity, even if we do not want to. When you are hungry, you are not you. It is imposed by the top mind that we do not take the individuals in front of us. A man must not compromise his humanity. Discover the new layout.

Be confused no longer, our team of specialists have deeply deciphered every minute of this film to give our readers a certain truth to the ideology behind the ending.Frankly, this is an devilish experiment. The administration used the workforce for there benefit, by hiding the truth.By withholding key information such as the amount of levels (which was shown through the women with cancer), the age of people allowed ( 16+ was the supposed rule), and most of all, the workers had no idea that these people were being sent to their deaths.The crazy ""mother"" that made her way down the hole every single day was in some way a plant from the administration. Meaning, they drove this women to believe that her child was in the experiment as well ( by making the kid the same race as her) then ""let"" her continually go down the hole inherently reminding all participants that there could be a child in the hole. There is no explanation how she managed to go down the hole and remain alive and then do it again every single day. This shows there was help from the administration.The administration's goal for the ""experiment"" was to continue it in all its brutality until someone was selfless and resourceful enough to make it down to level 333 and send the child up to the cooks. A shocked social experiment of sorts, and to cap it off, they chose to end it on level 333. With there being 2 people per level that means that there are at all times six hundred and sixty six people in the hole. The devils number.From a Psychological point of view, having purposely placed 666 people in the hole represents, how evil can be brought out in everyone, given the right circumstances. The administration seeing that despite what these people have been through, battling starvation and time, society is selfless and resilient.The child making it all the way to the top shows that somebody has to go all the way to the bottom, and then willingly choose to stay at the bottom so the child can go all the way to the top.

They have no obvious way of changing their current situation through cooperation or working hard to make life in the hole better. The only way they can show ""solidarity"" is through starvation, which is a completely wicked idea. Also there is no way of changing the amount of food on the platform meaning it's a zero sum game, which simply is not reality in a capitalist market system.There's also no way to eat 2,000 calories in the one minute the platform stays on each level, meaning everyone is on a starvation diet, even on level one.I truly enjoyed this film, even though I agree that the ending was too vague.

993,alyssareneeshambach,A powerful capitalistic metaphor for the world we live in.,9,4 October 2021,"The Platform, directed by Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia is originally a Spanish film, but Netflix decided to come out with a dubbed version for English speakers. The film takes place in a vertical prison system, where each month, a prisoner and their roommate are moved to different levels of the prison. There are a total of 333 floors, and the prisoners are fed in a top-down manner starting at level 0 and ending at the last, floor 333. This table filled with food is lowered down each level, giving inmates 2 minutes to consume what they want (or can) before it descends to the next. With this, inmates on the first few floors typically consume much more than they need. By the time the platform reaches the middle of the floors, the food is already very scarce. So those on the last few floors typically do not get to consume any food, leading a lot of them to contemplate some questionable ways to survive, like cannibalism. The film focuses on one inmate, Goreng who admitted himself to the facility in order to combat his smoking addiction and to earn an accredited degree. He is put with a man, Trimigasi who was forcibly incarcerated for a year after killing someone, but eventually he meets his fate and Goreng is placed with a new cellmate, Baharat. During Goreng's journey here, he fights to keep his sanity all while trying to change this broken system.The Platform has a very dystopian feel to it and delivers a lot of messages that viewers can resonate with. First, depending on what level inmates are put on, there is an obvious class system to which inmates feel a part of. For instance, those on the bottom floors are looked at as poor, while those on the top floors see themselves as rich because they get to consume as much food as they want. On another note, it is obvious that if everyone just took what they needed, all of the floors would get a chance to eat and survive. Of course this does not happen though. Also, you would think that those coming from lower floors once they are put on a higher one they would feel some sort of compassion for those below them. Wrong again. Instead, it has the opposite effect, igniting a selfish sense for those now at the top to take back what they didn't have before, in this case, food. This leads Goreng to note that excessive wealth isn't accumulated through generosity, but often at the expense of others. The film is basically just a metaphor for how we live our capitalistic lives. There are tons of people starving on the streets with nothing, while we have billionaires in this country sitting on millions that they will never touch. These people could easily make life comfortable for everyone if wealth was distributed equally. The same concept applies to The Platform. There is also a young girl who lives on the lowest level, and her mother is an inmate who has been searching for her throughtout the movie. When Goreng and Baharat are placed on level 333, they discover this girl and this is the ultimate confirmation for them that the system is broken because he was previously told that nobody under 16 is housed there. This young girl serves as an important metaphorical message of hope and innocence. She also demonstrates that children are often the most damaged when it comes to class struggles. The film is very gory, so I would not recommend this to anybody who is squeamish or too faint of heart. However, if gory horror films are your thing, then The Platform is a must watch. The only issue I had with the film would be that the ending is very vague and there is a lot that is left up for interpretation. This may frustrate some viewers, but others may like the mystery of it. All in all, I would have to say that The Platform is one of the most unique horror films that I have seen for quite a while. The film doesn't scare you with ghosts or demons, but instead relies on one of the ugliest sides of human nature to do the job-greed. It is a scary analogy of the inequalities of the world, showing just how ugly things get when people are desperate, and when others are selfish.If I were to rate this film, I would give it 9 out of 10 stars. The concept alone is so powerful that it resonates with the viewers on a real-world level. Sure, this was a fictional horror film and there is no such prison system in the world, but the issue of unequal power, selfishness, greed, and struggle are all the main points of the film which can be seen everywhere in our everyday lives. It serves as a good catalyst to get people to think about how the world would be if everyone just took what they needed. A way of life that would probably drastically improve the world and the inequalities that people face. I took off one star because although the start of the movie was very strong, toward the end it does get a bit confusing, and the ending is very vague. This leaves people guessing what happened or is going to happen...something that some people may find annoying.",The Platform

They committed ordinary crimes and they had the right to choose but they chose this place? Human always prefer what she knows even if it is worse. Nobody prefers the unknown. Never ever.

1000,enikolai-1,Wow! My interpretation of the heavy symbolism and the ending.,9,30 March 2020,"This film full of symbolism serves to represent the structure of a society, with the administration representing the Government, the levels representing power hierarchies in a capitalist system, where people despite having suffered when they were in the lower levels they seem to forget and behave like greedy individuals in the top levels leaving crumbs to the rest knowing that perhaps the next month they will be in an unfortunate situation again.The two main characters (Goreng and Baharat) our modern ""Robin Hood"" couple representing socialism, taking food from the ""kings"" in the superior levels sharing with the ""poor"" people in the inferior levels, people with fear, hunger, behaving increasingly violent as they descent into madness and death, some of them only could be stopped with more violence, this socialist structure gets damaged in consequence.Trimagasi is the pathetic example of human nature and cynicism; Imoguiri the voice of reason and idealism, both doomed.The Asian woman representing a normal individual, a foreigner searching for a daughter that the society don't think she has because like rule: ""the administration doesn't accept people under 16 years of age"".At the beginning of the ""revolution"", panna cotta is a symbol of people learning to get along together in a socialist society, that is not true of course, as they descent to the deep end they discover that the ""daughter of the woman"" exists destroying the system and their rules, this girl represents hope because it is unknown how this little girl survived all this time in that room, the only one not affected by extreme cold or heat or starvation.At the end, children are the ones that suffer when a society forgets that they exist, the silent victims. The ""socialism"" or what's left (Gorang) don't need to go in this platform, the panna cotta was its symbol and it didn't work because they need it to feed the child,
taking care of the child finally fulfilled what socialism meant to be and destroyed the system (The Platform).I really enjoyed this film, mind blowing!",The Platform

Can be watched as a well made horror film, but don't expect the story to go somewhere interesting or have a decent ending.

1012,gkranasioannis,What the movie really is about (interpretation and explanation),8,27 March 2020,"The movie is easy to follow, and presented with a simple premise.That everyone is trying to survive in a dystopian system where some people have it good while others have it really bad, for seemingly no reason other than pure luck. A prison split in levels (we learn in the end it is 333 levels), and a platform of a gluttonous, exquisite buffet travelling from from top to bottom, stopping for 2 minutes at every level. During that time, the level's 2 prisoners can eat all they want from that buffet. As they eat more than they need, the buffet deteriorates rapidly and by the time it reaches lower levels, there's no food left and people are starving and dying.But everything is a metaphor.The ""Administration"" is capitalism, the ""Hole"" is society. The Administration enables the people on top to have an extravagant meal, at the expense of starving people at the bottom, just like in society people on top grab all resources (money, real estate, natural resources), leaving the bottom with nothing, and capitalism enables that.
The cooks prepare an exquisite meal but only people on the top level really enjoy it to the fullest, to the extent you could say the cooks only work for the people on level 1. As you could say capitalism only works for the 1% (or 0.3% if we go by the Hole's 333 levels).Goreng is the common man. He's brought into a system, and questions the rules that don't make sense, suggesting common logic. But he's beaten into submission by the old guy (a seasoned veteran of the Hole), as well as the Hole's rules. Goreng is the idealistic youth that starts with good intentions but are beaten into submitting to the system by old men and their rules (parents, teachers, society as a whole).Goreng wants to start a protest and bring change but soon realises that he can only influence the levels under him but not the ones above him, he doesn't have any power over them. They don't care about his message as it doesn't make *their* lives better, they couldn't care less about the lives of those in lower levels. Like in society, say in a business hierarchy, you can only command your underlings but not your superiors. And the people above you rarely care about your needs. So Goreng decides to start his protest from the bottom and using violence when needed. A metaphor how successful revolutions (like the October revolution) started bottom up (and not top down), and used violence when necessary.The old woman that worked for the Administration, represents an old ""retired"" 1%er. She thought there are only 200 levels. She worked for the system, contributed to it and and enjoyed its benefits, but at the end of her life (she has cancer), she tries to instigate change but in a really inefficient way. She is an allegory for an old, ultra-rich person who retires to focus on philanthropy (bringing change) at the end of their lives. But they manages very little due to how the system works. Also that person has a distorted view of how extreme the level of poverty and suffering can be.Baharat (the black guy) is a driven, hardworking person, determined to make it all the way up. He has all the tools: rope, strength, determination. But, no matter how much he tries, since he started low he can only go up to a point. People above him will - literally - defecate on his face and stop his progress. That's an experience that many talented, driven people in the real world who started from a low place, can empathise with.The child represents the young generation. The child is the ""message"" just like the next young generation will be the one bringing change. Goreng want to stay with the child on the platform and go together up, bringing the message and changing things. But he is not needed for the message to arrive, he needs to step down for the platform to move. He steps down, content that he fulfilled his role. Here the allegory is, the old generation might need to step down, to make room for the young one to rise and bring change in society. The old generation might want to partake in this changed, better new world, but they might not live to see it, just as Goreng will probably not leave to see the effect of the ""message"" being delivered. In this case, the last verse of Bob Dylan's song, ""The times they're a-changin'"" rings true:Come mothers and fathers throughout the land
And don't criticise what you can't understand
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command
Your old road is rapidly aging
Please get outta' the new one if you can't lend your hand

If they eat only what they should.. but no one does they eat as much as they can... so the upper levels have their bellies full while the lower levels starve...Inmates start eating from the platform... from level one to wherever it ends; coz no one knows... as they start eating, food 🍱 started depleting... for the levels below 50 or 100 or 200... there is nothing left... they starve...This movie is a social experiment in my views... to see how much time is needed for someone to loose their humanity... for someone to become an animal... for someone to become cannibal coz of hunger.. for someone to become something...This time #Netflix did it... and gives us something original and a truly gothic dystopian #platform.",The Platform
1019,packerpf,Is up truly the answer?,5,1 April 2020,"The film constantly makes you question whether what you're being told is truth. And at a certain point that's very lackadaisical writing. The lead actor does a great job of going through the psychological ringer but it is ultimately ruined by the ambiguity of the ending. You can see the great comparisons to capitalism you can see the great comparisons to socialism, but what you don't see is a finish..a purpose. It's almost like the director was too afraid to offend someone on one side or the other or feared that a for sure ending would leave open to more criticism.

The actors do a great job, the premise is mindblowing and the ending, although confusing, makes you think so hard it hurts. But what makes it really shine is the eerie feeling of reality you get from this movie. Like it's actually happening at the moment.

When people on top they can be good friends and whatever they are different it not matters they can be good friends. But when you put them bottom they can turn into killer monsters.

1027,wewontlisten,Great timing to see this film,8,30 March 2020,"With being lockdown during this virus pandemic I decided to make a night of watching this movie and is a great metaphor for how people are treating others during this crisis. Obviously this wasn't planned but goes without saying.I think there's a little more in the scenes where the Goreng eats both his floor-mates and then the book.After eating his first floormate he then becomes greedy once he's moved up a few levels and eats as much as he can, even questioning his new floormate, the interviewer, much like Trimagasi did when Goreng was first woken up.Then he eats the interviewer where he then starts to try ration his food for those below him which is what the interviewer's plan was when she came into the hole.Then further on he is on a lower level where he eats the book Don Quixote, which is about a man trying to help/save the community instead of himself, much like Goreng ends up doing.Is ""food"" also a message, much like the pana cotta/child, even if the ""food"" is a person or paper?",The Platform

1029,peazamarumachaveli,A visual representation of an analogy about society,7,21 April 2020,"It is very simple. The higher-ups will always s*** on the ones below. Even though there are enough resources for everyone, not everyone is willing to share those resources. In society today, every single human being was born into this world not knowing what they were, where they were, or why they were here. Everything they know they have learned from the ones before them. They realized that there were no rules of behavior. I can go on and on about the similarities, but you get the point. I would just like to put this idea into your mind. Think about the things that we do. Why do we do these things? Many things that we do daily we do not realize that it is not because we want to. It's because we have to. We have no choice. When you build a car the car doesn't have a choice but to drive. Because that is what the car was created to do. Why do we sleep? We think it's because we want to but in reality we do not have a choice. Why do we eat. We think it's because we want to but in reality we do not have a choice. There are a number of things that we do because we do not have a choice. That is because we are creations. just like the car we have no choice but to do the things that we were programmed to do. If your car knew that its purpose was to provide you transportation, do you think it would continue transporting you? Maybe our purpose is purposefully kept from us. Or maybe it's right in front of our faces but we can't see it. we were born into a place that has been here longer than we can possibly imagine. When a star dies in a supernova explosion, the energy that is produced rips new elements out of the very fabric of reality. These elements are consumed by other entities over and over again until finally they are returned back to the fabric of reality. Everything in the universe is consuming something and egesting something smaller. The smallest thing is then consumed by something else and the cycle goes on and on until the smallest element is returned back to the fabric of reality. These are all facts. So tell me why do we eat? Maybe the answer isn't as simple as you think.",The Platform

1051,bom-barbara,"Not exactly a prison, but a social experiment.",9,10 April 2020,"Well, this is a great movie that leaves room for many hypothesis. One of them, for me, is that the place was not exactly just a prison, but hosted a social experiment.We see the protagonist guy getting in by choice. Seems like he did nothing wrong to be there. They filled a form with his info (including his favorite food, wtf whas that about?) and he would get a certificate for staying there, as he said. But the old man said he knew nothing of a certificate, and that he was sent there for accidentally killing a man (it was that or a psychiatric facility). So the old man is clearly a prisoner. My theory is that the experiment took prisoners and volunteers (that were probably very rare).The whole logic of that system seemed like an experiment, and that woman who used to work there trying to chance people's behavior, plus the two man on the platform trying to take food for the people on the lower levels, all that really made me think there was a purpose in all. I even thought there would be people watching from cameras in each floor. Wouldn't that be interesting (and kind of messed up)?Unfortunately, by the end of the movie I believed I was wrong. But who knows? It's a possible interpretation.I saw someone here with a very interesting theory about eating just your favourite food, in that way, everyone would be able to eat, and for a moment I was convinced this person had figured it out (that would be a great reason for asking that question in the beginning). But then I thought... 333 floors... 666 people (wow, check this number! Maybe the whole thing is Hell), there is no way that platform could fit so many dishes, even if a lot of people shared the same favorite food. A great theory though.",The Platform

It hits on broad moral questions. And the hero's are more real here than in most films.Acting was great, I thought, particularly from Samurai-Plus guy.

On the other hand, the unrealistic atmosphere of confusion, lack of knowledge and impotence towards the bureaucracy of the prison, as well as the motivations of the main character are very similar to that of some novels from Kafka. The reference to Cervantes is more explicit, since the object chosen by the main character to take to the prison is ""Don Quixote"".

However, this film was so entertaining and insightful that I felt almost compelled to submit a review. It definitely makes you wonder about human nature, wealth inequality, and social justice.This movie follows very much in the footsteps of films like ""Cube"", ""Exam"", or ""Circle"", which I also highly recommend watching if you haven't done so already. That is, we meet a cast of characters who appear to be strangers at first but who eventually bond and work together to overcome a difficult challenge. However, the premise of this movie is quite unique. It presents a timely and rather interesting social commentary on the disappearing middle class, albeit in a dramatic and cinematic way.Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. While not perfect, it is extremely well-acted and well-done. I did not mind reading the subtitles either.

A survival of the luckiest scenario where the undeserved above's, for now, see no responsibility to those below. How can the misery end? How can those at the bottom live on nothing? What does that do to you? Who must you become? It exposes the major flaws in Capitalism and how much damage is being done to our humanity.

1. What did the Don Quixote book signify
2. Did everyone have sufficient to eat?
3. Was the little girl real?
4. What did they send up?1. Goreng like Don Quixote wanted to solve harsh real world problems using noble idealistic method. In the classic, Don Quixote suffered greatly before dying. So it would mean he and his partner did not achieve their objective eventually.
2. I think the management did prepare enough food for everyone. Every prisoner was asked beforehand what was their favourite food, allergy etc. The management prepared escargot his favourite food for him.
3. I think the girl was imagined by the lead actor when he was near death. She was too clean and strong at level 333. Furthermore the cell temperature did not change even though the platform was lowered without the pudding. Noted also the lady interviewer said the Asian woman came in alone.
4. So what was sent to the top if the girl was not real? The answer was given in the middle of the movie when the head chef was checking whose hair was in the pudding. So they managed to send the message to the top- the pudding up to the top management! But the management did not get their message and only thought the prisoners have rejected the food because of some quality issues.So the movie was saying that the top management or even government never understood what his people actually wanted even after receiving feedbacks, and some times implemented well-intended policies wrongly and hurt the people instead.",The Platform

With a slightly different plot direction this might have been able to present the powerful message the creators were quite literally trying to feed us. The vertical prison concept, lighting, sound design, and dialogue were fantastic. I like the general critique of society the film was referencing, but good lord, open endings need to be dealt with carefully. A quality one will leave the taste of contemplation lingering.

SPOILER question:
Though the girl is alive and ends up on the table, wouldn't that high speed acceleration up kill her? And if that doesn't, wouldn't her body fling straight up into the ceiling if/when she reached level 0. Then the level zeroers would have no way to know the girl was the message?

For all I know the people on level 0 probably need a spatula to scrape that so called ""child message"" off their ceiling. Good job, Nasi Goreng but it felt like I just lost my orgasm.",The Platform
1086,reganmeloche,"Good thrills, blunt metaphor",6,27 March 2020,"The platform is set in a type of vertical prison made up of many floors, with 2 inmates living on each floor. In the middle of the building is a moving platform that is filled with food. The platform begins at the top at floor 1 and moves down throughout the day to the bottom floor, after which it shoots up to the top to prepare for the next day. Those at the top get to eat their fill, those further down need to hope for scraps, and those near the bottom are essentially out of luck, often resorting to cannibalism or suicide. Every month, the inmate pairs are moved to a new room, apparently at random. The catch is that there might be enough food on the platform for everybody, but it would require everyone to share.It's a very blunt metaphor for capitalist society, where your standing may be arbitrary and undeserved. Resources are finite and scarce, so most of those at the top take whatever they want, without little to no regard for those below them. With such a direct metaphor, the film must sacrifice relatable story-telling in favour of getting a message across. It's difficult to relate to a character when the concept of the film's world is so lofty, but again, that's not the main goal - the message is. The message is very straightforward, and it is evident very early on. When you set up a premise featuring an oppressive power structure, it goes without saying the main character is going to try to overthrow it. In that sense, the plot was very linear. There wasn't much substance in the main events of the plot itself, and instead the film relied a bit more on shock and discomfort to push through the message, which it does fairly effectively.The ending provided some ambiguity, though in my mind the child didn't actually exist, the two men died at the bottom, and the cupcake made it back up. We see this partway through the movie, where the ""boss"" is carrying it around, trying to find who was responsible for a hair being on it. I think there is another interesting layer in this as well. The people upstairs are so divorced from the grim reality of the situation that they actually think the problem was the hair, meaning they were too tone-deaf to even get the message in the first place. In any case, it makes you think.Overall, I found the story a bit thin, the acting fine, and the thrills exciting. It works well as both a thriller with very non-subtle violence, as well as a metaphor with a very non-subtle message.",The Platform

The general idea is interesting but its just that and only that, an idea without much thinking on how to wrap it up in a nice movie. Also almost everyone who rates this is amazed by the meaning which is so obvious from the first 15 minutes and after that its the same over and over again. I was expecting something deeper, something new or at least performance at its best when reading the plot. I am very dissapointed by the movie and from the general public.

A friend told me about this movie and I immediately looked up the reviews. It really was 50/50. A 10 rating followed by a 1. Mainly the 1s for the ending. So I have to say I wasn't surprised by the ""bad ending"" thing is this movie is made to be more of a symbolic movie so the ending is kind of and I mean this loosely it's kind irrelevant.

There was simply nothing I enjoyed from this movie. It is obvious (pun intended) that the director simply didn't know how to create the movie he had in mind.

1112,leebh-70088,"Unique, haunting, philosophical film",8,4 April 2020,"The Platform is unlike any movie i've ever seen before. The concept itself is fascinating, of a tower gradually descending food along floors, leaving those towards the bottom with less and less food. The concept is metaphorical in a lot of ways, reflecting capitalism and greed in society. Those on top with the resources avaliable to them selfishly take as much as they can for themselves, not thinking of the floor below them. And it's not that these people are necessarily immoral either, but their given situation encourages greed and selishness. The main character and the old man form kind of a cute relationship until things get a little ugly. Let's just say it ruined snails for me. Eventually the main character realizes that it's the girl that is the message. It's youth, which may allow those witholding the resources from the lower levels, to see the inherent immorality in their actions. It's a thrilling, gruesome, philosophical film, which makes you question society and human nature. I throughly recommend the film.",The Platform

1118,jayezrecordings,Great idea - Shame about the ending..,7,24 March 2020,"Yet again the spanish come out with another great watch on Netflix!The Platform does a great job to explain life as we know it today.
We have those in power pulling all the strings while the classes fight amongst them selves for everthing that is good in life.
Think of The platform as lifes ""Pyramid"" system to which we all play a role in.
The few at the top looking down and the many below.Its not just about food, its about ethics, politics, education and religion!Throughout our lives we are constantly indoctrinated about all these subjects above - What we take on then plays on our subconscious mind and mold us into a particular way of thinking.Politics:
The entire film is built around a political structure. The administration (The government) each level of the platform (Social Classes)
If you disobey the rules the government turn up the heat!
As in life, those at the bottom get ""hand me downs""or the ""Left overs"" form those above.
In the platform the punishments appear to be temperature / climate related which again could imply the same in the real world with climate changing technologies such as HAARP (which im sure has been down sized these days)Ethics:
In a situation like this your ethics WOULD go out the window! its about surviving - Humans wil always rely this primordial trait.
As they said in the movie ""There are only three types of people: Those at the top, those at the bottom, and those who fall""
With your ethics could you bring yourself to eat another human to survive or would you ""fall""??Education:
This was meantioned many times throught the film. In fact the main character voluntarily entered The Platform in order to get s ""Diploma""
Again this stinks of life! Today students have to live on next to nothing in order to learn and get ""indoctrinated"" by the system!
The cost of which is ridiculously high so much so those that commit to it end up in debt for many many years after.
Everything comes at a price!Religion:
The main character is considered as Jesus - In the end he sacrifices himself to try and save everyone not just the little girl.
The little girl could represent a possible change to the system - being the next genaration!The Bottom Line:
One man can only change the thought process of that of a child.

The story is but a simple cliche that people will even eat each other if needed, and the whole 90 minutes doesn't have anything more to say. A few superficial words about communism and solidarity are added of course for the average audience to mistake the shallow lake for a deep sea. The whole complex made in the movie is ambiguous, the swings in the protagonist's character are the same too and the resolution is incomplete and lacks coherence. The wise man, the child and the mother, none of them are introduced or elaborated on.
