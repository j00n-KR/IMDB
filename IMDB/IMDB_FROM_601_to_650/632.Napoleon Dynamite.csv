0,MartinHafer,I feel like I'm all alone here....,9,6 September 2009,"I am an old man--at least when it comes to watching NAPOLEON DYNAMITE. I realize that the audience for this film is NOT middle-aged, but even in my mid-40s I still enjoy the film. It's funny, actually, because a while back I was sitting in the teacher's lounge and somehow this movie became a topic. Teacher after teacher said how they hated the film and just didn't understand it--during which time, the guitar teacher and myself were laughing hysterically as we recounted our favorite scenes. This day, the other teachers' opinions of the two of us probably dropped considerably! Later, I asked the kids what they thought of this, and while the percentage who liked it was much higher, once again there seemed to be no middle ground. Those who liked the film, loved the film and everyone else seemed to hate it. This seems to indicate that the film probably is one of the more polarizing I have seen and I think this is due to the very, very low-key style of the film. Most who hated it described it as ""boring"" or a ""one-joke film""; those who loved it, loved the joke and didn't mind that all the major characters in the film were so low-energy and bizarre.While I could easily recount the film or discuss moments I like, there have been so many reviews of the film already that I wouldn't be adding anything. 'Nuff said that it's a film you'll probably either love or hate NAPOLEON DYNAMITE.",Napoleon Dynamite
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Napoleon Dynamite mayn't be to everybody's tastes, but personally I liked it",7,16 May 2010,"Napoleon Dynamite by all means is not a five-star masterpiece, and it mayn't be to everybody's tastes but I was surprised at how much I liked it, even with its problems. I can also say I do think there are much worse movies out there- Disaster Movie, Epic Movie, Home Alone 4, Cat in the Hat and Superbabies:Baby Geniuses 2 are much worse than this film.What I did like about Napoleon Dynamite was that it was unique, funny, quirky and original. Where it is not quite so good is in the episodic story structure and some of the supporting characters particularly comic-book-geek older brother and the ageing jock uncle were disappointingly one-dimensional and could have been further explored in terms of depth.Napoleon Dynamite does have a refreshingly distinctive time-warp look that recalls the style-challenged 1980s though, and that was refreshing in itself. The soundtrack is nice and nostalgic, and there are some genuinely laugh-out-loud funny moments. Also the ending is suitably uplifting and the limited horizons of young people in small-town America is nicely conveyed. The script is good and the direction is pretty solid.As are the performances. Jon Heder is delightfully eccentric in the title role, and he is really entertaining throughout, whether it is in the voice, the facial expressions or his character's actions. Napoleon is a blank-faced teen with carrot-coloured hair and seriously underdeveloped interpersonal skills, and here he tries to help his nerd of a best friend Pedro, amusingly played by Efren Ramirez. In terms of other supporting performances, Aaron Ruell also does a good job as Kip and while his role wasn't as well-sketched as it could have been, Jonathan Gries does nicely as Uncle Rico.Overall, not perfect, but amusing, quirky and unique. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Napoleon Dynamite
2,Leofwine_draca,Didn't identify with this one,3,5 July 2017,"NAPOLEON DYNAMITE is one of those low-budget comedies that asks you to be of the same mindset as the lead characters in order to gain enjoyment from it. Sometimes this works for me - I love the documentary American MOVIE because I can identify with the drive and identity of the filmmakers. In contrast, I found that NAPOLEON DYNAMITE left me cold. The characters are cold and sarcastic in that peculiarly American way, obnoxious in fact, and the film's constant ironic humour simply didn't appeal to me. I appreciate that it's different to your mainstream high school comedy, but at the same time I found this uninteresting and interminable.",Napoleon Dynamite
3,SnoopyStyle,One note dead pan comedy,5,27 June 2014,"Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder) is one of weirdest character on film. He lives in the small town of Preston, Idaho with his grandma (Sandy Martin) and his equally weird older brother Kip (Aaron Ruell). He befriends new kid Pedro (Efren Ramirez). Deb (Tina Majorino) is selling things door to door but she runs away after getting embarrassed. Then Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) comes to stay with the boys. Summer Wheatley (Haylie Duff) is the mean girl at school that Pedro likes but she rejects him.Director Jared Hess is doing a weird dead pan style humor writing with his wife Jerusha. Honestly I found it only marginally watchable. For me, the funniest is when the farmer shot the cow. All the dead pan performances are cute but I didn't really laugh. I think we're suppose to laugh at Napoleon but he's more pathetic than funny. That goes for all the characters. The characters are crazy unique but they all strike the same tone. It feels like the same joke over and over again. And it's never as funny as it wants to be.",Napoleon Dynamite
4,gavin6942,The Smartest Dumb Comedy Ever Made,7,11 August 2010,"Napoleon Dynamite (yes, that's his real name) is an outcast student in Preston, Idaho. But he befriends some other outcasts and in their own strange way they may just make themselves known. There may not be a definite plot, but it would be something like that.I am calling this film ""the smartest dumb comedy ever made"" because the humor is all really stupid -- one-liners, absurd events and situations... with characters that really are not your typical movie heroes. But it's clear the people behind the film are not dumb at all. There's a hidden gem in this film.The problem may be that the smartness is not on the surface. The first time I saw the film, I thought it was lame. The second time, I loved it. The third time, loved it more. I showed it to a friend once, who disliked it, but I wonder if she tried it again... and saw the genius. (Some might argue that ""Freddy Got Fingered"" is similar... I'm not going to try that here.)",Napoleon Dynamite
5,jboothmillard,Napoleon Dynamite,6,14 November 2006,"For an independent film by unknown director Jared Hess (who went on to direct Nacho Libre), this almost seems like a proper teen comedy. The only difference is that it is not sex obsessed or gross, it focuses on the geek generation. The anti-hero of this film, Napoleon Dynamite (then unknown and really funny Jon Heder), sticks with his friends Pedro Sanchez (Efren Ramirez) and Deb (Tina Majorino), and brother Kip Dynamite (Aaron Ruell). There is hardly any main story, mainly just big events that Napoleon somehow gets involved in, such as the prom and college president elections. It doesn't really matter that there is no real plot, this is just a good comedy to laugh at because of the geeks and the odd things they get up to. Also starring Jon Gries as Uncle Rico, Diedrich Bader as Rex, Sandy Martin as Grandma, Haylie Duff as Summer Wheatly and Trevor Snarr as Don. The hilarious highlight of the film is towards the end where Napoleon is wearing the ""Vote for Pedro"" shirt and big boots, dancing to Jamiroquai's ""Canned Heat"". If your lucky, you will get an extra scene at the end of the film after the credits have rolled where Ip marries his sweetheart, Napoleon comes in riding on a horse like a some dashing hero, and the happy couple ride away. It was nominated the Sundance Film Festival Grand Jury Prize Dramatic, and it won the U.S. Comedy Arts Festival Film Discovery Jury Award for Best Feature. It was number 49 on The 100 Greatest Funny Moments for the dance sequence. Good!",Napoleon Dynamite
6,ccthemovieman-1,"Not Just Another Teen Nerd Story, This Is Both Original & Very Funny",10,14 July 2007,"If you like dry or dark humor, you should get a big kick out of this movie. I know I did. If you are between 12-20 you might even like it more because this deals with high school kids primarily. However, there are some adults in here who play key roles, too.The teens and the adults have a couple of things in common: they are nerds and weird people and they are all hilarious. They also are unlike a cast of characters you have seen in any other movie. In other words, this movie is an ""original.""I didn't know any of these actors and I think that helped. It made it even more original, looking at new faces. That begins with the title character, played by Jon Heder. A white kid in Idaho with a afro haircut, over-sized glasses, moon boots and an unpredictable and low-key personality unlike anyone I've ever seen in other films. Even though he's pictured as a huge nerd, he surprises you all the time. Just when you think you have this kid figured out, he does something unexpected. Whatever, he's fun to watch and hear throughout the movie.Suffice to say ""Napoleon"" and about everyone in this film is totally whacked and all of them - male, female, young, old, good and bad people are extremely entertaining. A lot of the humor is visual, meaning the looks and reactions on these character's faces and the weird deadpan lines they deliver. Are there stereotypes in here? Yes, like the bimbo, prettiest girl in school running for class president , and her stupid, macho boyfriend, but most of the people were pretty unique.If you like absurd humor, this is your cup of tea, and you don't have to be a teen to enjoy this. Hey, I'm old enough to be Napoleon's grandfather and I laughed my butt off from the beginning to the end of this unconventional film.",Napoleon Dynamite
7,BA_Harrison,"A funny, heartwarming tale of geeks and misfits.",8,20 May 2006,"Sick to death of everyone at work quoting lines from the film and not being 'in on the joke', I finally gave in and watched Napolean Dynamite. I had an uneasy feeling that it was going to be a complete waste of an hour and a half; 'you'll either absolutely love it or you'll hate it', I had been toldI feared it would be the latter.However, I am glad to report that I was pleasantly surprised; I wouldn't say I LOVED it, but I did like itquite a lot! The film meanders quite erratically through its wafer thin plot, introducing us to Napolean, uber-geek, and those who inhabit his surreal world. The humour is offbeat and quirky and won't appeal to all, but if you 'get it', then there is plenty to enjoy.Having been something of a nerd myself in my youth (as opposed to the epitome of coolness that I am now), I empathised with the characters and also recognised some of their qualities in myself and people I knew; maybe this added to my enjoyment.Napolean Dynamite is certainly not going to appeal to everyone, but it is worth giving a goyou may even find yourself quoting the funny bits too.",Napoleon Dynamite
8,Quinoa1984,"You'll either like it or hate it, I liked it- it's an original and satirical comedy about small town outcasts",7,7 July 2004,"Like Wes Anderson, co-writer and director Jared Hess has created his own little world (if it's based on a true story I can't tell, but some little details feel like they're truer than expected), and with a lead character with the title's name. Played with a down-beat, almost dead-pan style by Jon Heder (who, if he plays his cards right, could be a fine character actor), Dynamite's a character that definitely won't appeal to everyone, which is why I can't recommend the film as much as I would like to. Unlike Wes Anderson, the humor in the film isn't so subtle, and many of the characters aren't the kind you'd want to run into on a daily basis. But in Napoleon, and with those he's friends with (a funny Mexican immigrant named Pedro, a shy girl named Deb, and his brother Kip who has a internet dating crush), is an attitude and existence that's a great change of pace from the stretch of teen comedies where the main characters are all perfect looking and the lessor ones (the main characters in this film, even the supporting characters Uncle Rico and Rex) are given minute, in-consequential parts. And, for much of it, there's a lot of laughs.But the laughs don't necessarily come from Napoleon being someone to laugh at (laughing down on), though Hess and co-writer Hess give him some good lines and mannerisms. It's in the other people he knows, and how it's a sort of satire on small-town life. A challenge, it could be said, to like Napoleon, but when other characters turn out to be far more ridiculous than him, he's a worthy protagonist. When his Uncle Rico soon turns out to show himself as a sort of antagonist, it's comfortable to laugh at him. Or with Rex-Kwan Do (with the appropriately goofy Diedrich Bader), this is a scene with some juvenile humor, yet the humor doesn't pit to one part of the audience over another. A film like Napoleon Dynamite owes as much to (though, in my view, is a better than) Revenge of the Nerds, it also is in the vein of a film like Angus, where the ones who are always pushed to the side and made to feel little by the popular ones have their day. And, as a nice little touch, some of the scenes have a very sweet feeling to them (when Napoleon dances, not just in his brilliant climax at the auditorium, but with Deb at the school dance). Though I would usually advise against this, I suggest that if you've heard about this film and don't know whether or not to see it, watch the trailer. It doesn't spoil the better parts of the film, and once you're done with it you'll know if Napoleon Dynamite is the cult comedy film you've been waiting for this year, or if it's a piece of s***. A-",Napoleon Dynamite
9,michaelRokeefe,"Who, what and why is this?",1,12 March 2006,"Looking for intelligence...you won't find it here. This waste of a film is about as interesting as a four day old dog t#^d! Napoleon Dynamite(Jon Heder)is a hapless high school dullard that has trouble meeting the world let alone living in it. The hap-hazards of this awkward character trying to fit into society did not impress me. Some may find humor in it...the whole movie was a loss to me, sorry. It was like watching a NASCAR driver crashing into the wall as you await the vehicle to burst into flames. Sometimes you wait and nothing happens.Uncle Rico(Jon Gries)is a thirty-something slacker that still lives at home with his brother. Napoleon's best and only friend Pedro(Efren Ramirez) is a misplaced Mexican immigrant having trouble learning the ways of Idaho. Then there is Kip Dynamite(Aaron Ruell)a pathetic soul so easily to take advantage of. There is a dull glimmer of sunshine in Deb(Tina Majorino)the quirky love interest of both Napoleon and Pedro. Also in the cast: Haylie Huff, Diedrich Bader and Sandy Martin.Not that I don't find comedy in the unpopular, the underdog and the social misfit...I just didn't find it this time.",Napoleon Dynamite

11,jotix100,My own private Idaho,8,26 June 2004,"This film is a refreshing look at a typical geek in a forgotten part of the country. Jared Hess is to be commended by bringing this dead pan comedy to the screen.Of course, the director is helped by the cast he assembled for the film. The screening I attended had more laughs than I was expecting because, as it is obvious: this is not a comedy for the masses. The director is spoofing the genre in his own way. Napoleon, deep down inside is a great kid. He is not malicious and he has to suffer because this culture will reward a stupid person that appears to be cool and will put down a person such as Napoleon because they perceive him as a nerd prototype. Napoleon belongs to a dysfunctional family, if ever there was one.His brother Kid is playing against type also. He appears to be a feminine boy who is into the chat rooms and has fallen in love with a mystery woman from Detroit. The uncle that comes to supervise them while their grandma is in the hospital is a grease ball and a con man rolled into one. The ending is just hysterical as Uncle Rico can't see the woman he is selling his bogus merchandise is a muscled person with a super strong husband.All the actors are excellent in their roles. One's heart goes to Jon Heder, the Napoleon of the story, for making his character so sweet and likable. Jon Gries, as Uncle Rico, is effective. Napoleon's brother played by Aaaron Ruell goes through such transformation, but deep inside he is just a pretender. Efren Ramirez, as Pedro seems to be in a fog throughout the film. What a joke to have him as class president! Finally, Shondrella Avery as LaFawnduh, gives an incredible performance and Tina Marjorino is perfect as Deb.A film to be discovered for its humor.",Napoleon Dynamite
12,dbborroughs,Well written movie that has a style that you'll either love or hate,2,30 August 2006,"A movie about nothing.Actually a movie about Napoleon Dynamite, a not too bright sweet guy who's on the outside of the world. More a collection of sequences than a narrative detailing Napoleon's life.Done in a mannered and absurdist style the film is one you will either love or hate.I really don't care for it.Lets me be honest. The first time I saw this I really hated the film to the point where I was pretty close to be offended by it. However, I did sit down and watch the film a second time and I did like it a smidgen more. Actually having watched a chunk of the film with the sound off and the subtitles on I think this is possibly one of the best written films from the year this was released. My problem with the movie is that the absurdist style and the flat affect of the lead characters makes the film seem more about belittling them and people like them rather than about anything else. How can you root for anyone when the the movie goes out of the way to make them too far the outsider, we don't laugh with them its always at them. Its not written that way, its played that way.While I can see that it could be argued that Napoleon and his friends should be that way because they are outsiders who make ""good"", they are actually always outsiders since the film always seems to hold them in contempt and less than human. And while I know you can argue that in its way the film reflects the fact that we are all objects of ridicule and that by laughing at Napoleon and his friends we deal with a complicity where we are laughing at and with ourselves and thereby are forced to see that we are better than no one and no one is better than us. It could be argued that but doesn't seem to be the case. We still think Napoleon is a dweeb but we admire that he is comfortable enough to go for it anyway, but we still laugh at him never really with him.Or to put it more simply we or rather I never liked him enough to root for him or to hold him as anything other then as an object of pity. Worse he never does anything that makes him worthy of being someone we laugh at. If you want the truth it can be very funny but it made me feel bad for laughing.Great script. Questionable direction and performances.2 out of 10 is purely my reaction to the film. Your mileage may vary.",Napoleon Dynamite
13,george.schmidt,Sleeper comedy hit of the year: SWEET!!!,10,30 June 2004,"NAPOLEON DYNAMITE (2004) **** John Heder, Jon Gries, Aaron Ruell, Efren Ramirez, Tina Majorino, Diedrich Bader, Sandy Martin, Haylie Duff, Trevor Snarr, Shondrella Avery. Hysterically funny high school comedy about the eponymous delusional nerd (Heder who comes across as the bastard son of Will Ferrell and Jerry Seinfeld) and his misadventures with his wimpy older brother Kip(Ruell), creepily living in 1982 state-of-mind Uncle Rico (Gries) with his hare-brained get-rich quick schemes, extreme living grandma (Martin) and his misfit buddies, the quiet sad-eyed Pedro (Ramirez) and photobug pony tailed girlfriend material Deb (Majorino) set in the endless plains of Preston, Idaho. Facing the daily hell of high school Napoleon daydreams and uses his creative 'skills' to full tilt despite the ridiculous odds stacked against his better judgment. Uproariously funny with some unique production design, costumes and hair-styles makes this microcosm of middle-America come to life with biting wit and style to newcomer filmmaker Jared Hess who co-scripted with his wife Jerusha echoes the likes of 'Election', 'Rushmore' and 'Welcome to the Dollhouse' yet is unique in that it allows its characters to boldly accept themselves for what they are and damn anyone who doesn't get it. Heder is a true comic fine in his weird vocal deliveries and ejaculations of 'Idiot!', 'Sweet!' and 'Dang!' and has a time-capsule moment at the film's climax involving the student council election; 'nuff said. A real sleeper comic ode to the dork in all of us.",Napoleon Dynamite
14,view_and_review,A just tribute to the '80s,7,19 January 2007,"I can see why ""Napolean Dynamite"" quickly became a cult classic. The movie is brilliant in its simplicity. Sometimes a low budget is a good thing, it forces the production team to be more creative. Watching ""Napolean Dynamite"" instantly took me back to my childhood; this movie was wrought with things from the '80s: The wood paneled interior walls, the wall mount phone with the extra long cord, the computer, the hairstyles, the trapperkeeper binder, etc.I think everyone did their roles well. Heder did a great job as the school dweeb. Jon Gries was superb as the stuck-in-the-past new-scheme-a-day uncle Rico. Efren Ramirez was excellent as the emotionless monotone Pedro. And how can you discount Aaron Ruell and the job he did as Kip the puny older brother that found love online.I liked the movie a lot. I didn't quite love it as there were points I didn't think it moved along smoothly, and there were a few lulls with the humor. For the most part ""Napolean Dynamite"" was nice and balanced. It wasn't hilarious, but then again there weren't any snooze moments either.",Napoleon Dynamite
15,neil-476,Grim,1,4 December 2007,"Maybe it's simply a matter of getting too old. I date back to traditional sitcom humour, I grew through the Pythons, and I find South Park very very funny, honest I do.Napoleon Dynamite was on TV last night. I'd read good things about it, so I put it on expecting to like it. Wanting to like it.The good news is that I didn't have to watch the whole thing. I changed channels after 15 minutes.Perhaps I didn't give it long enough. But call me old fashioned, but if something is labelled comedy and if, after 15 minutes, it hasn't made me smile, let alone laugh, even once - and it hadn't - it seems to me that it probably isn't going to.And I'm pretty sure that I understood what it was aiming for, it's just that what it was aiming for was - to me - woefully unfunny.When I changed the channel my wife looked at me and said, ""Well, I know you wanted to watch it, but I didn't like to say....""",Napoleon Dynamite
16,evanston_dad,One of the Best of 2004,9,1 September 2005,"Yes, for all the pomp and broo-hah-hah surrounding last year's ""serious"" films like ""Million Dollar Baby,"" ""The Aviator,"" ""Ray"" and ""Finding Neverland,"" this little quirky comedy made its way on to my personal 10 best list when none of the aforementioned films did. It's small, personal and definitely not to everybody's tastes, but it's also hilarious and even rather touching. Overall, it really is just a goofy comedy with low aspirations, but there is a slightly sober tone underlying the goofiness, whether intended or not. This movie is for anyone who's ever felt the unfairness of being labeled a dork or nerd simply for being different, or having interests outside of the mainstream. Napoleon is weird, and his sullen manner doesn't win him any admirers (though it does provide the film with countless laughs), but there's something noble about his refusal to change himself to accommodate the whims of the popular, acceptable crowd. I loved this movie because all of the outcasts have happy endings on their own terms, but the film avoids any dopey life-affirming lessons.But lest you think I'm taking the movie too seriously, let me repeat that it is first and foremost a silly, goofy, stupid comedy, and on those terms it's a classic.Grade: A",Napoleon Dynamite
17,ferguson-6,Ligers and Talons and Llamas ... Oh My!!,9,4 July 2004,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Director and writer Jared Hess has created one ... scratch that, three of the most bizarre screen characters of all time.  There aren't very many movies where Uncle Rico would not easily qualify as the strangest character, but here he has big time competition. Jon Heder as Napolean is simply spectacular.  Whether giving time travel a shot, firing an orange at a van, caging a chicken or slow-dancing, he is mesmerizing to watch.  His dance solo is priceless (and pretty good!).  His brother Kip finds love on the internet, his best fried Pedro is the shyest class president in history and his girl-crush takes ""glamour"" shots in her garage.  By the way, Deb is played by Tina Majorina who was the little girl with the map tatoo in ""Waterworld"".  This movie is such a wonderful commentary on high school, nerds, small town America, broken families, the need to connect with someone, chat rooms and ""glory days"" that never were. I can't recommend this any higher for all ages.  It is funny and strangely touching.",Napoleon Dynamite
18,anaconda-40658,A Dynamite Comedy!,9,29 April 2015,"Napoleon Dynamite (2004): Dir: Jared Hess / Cast: Jon Heder, Jon Gries, Aaron Ruell, Efren Ramirez, Tina Majorino: Strange yet innovative teen comedy about a teenager who cannot fit in yet manages his resources. Director Jared Hess often jumps about from scene to scene without continuity, which severely disjoints the narrative structure. What makes the film so memorable is its array of odd characters. Jon Heder is hilarious as Napoleon who verses his dysfunction by drawing odd creatures and trying to achieve his goals such as going to the dance. Jon Gries plays Uncle Rico who lives in the past of failed football opportunities. He sells Tupperware dishes that do not meet criteria, but his big goal is to establish a time machine in a delusional attempt to correct past failure. Aaron Ruell plays Kip who is Napoleon's brother involved with Internet dating. Efren Ramirez plays Padro who is rejected by the popular girl but runs for student President with Napoleon providing backup support as well as a much remembered stage presentation. Tina Majorino plays Deb who wears a pony tail on the side of her head as well as shoot photos and create other trinkets. Despite its oddball appeal, its young target audience will likely relate to the pressures of school and proving ourselves. Very bizarre teen comedy about triumphing over difficulties and proving ourselves successful in our uniqueness. Score: 9 / 10",Napoleon Dynamite
19,Mr-Fusion,Imbued with gawky appeal,8,28 September 2016,"Flash back to mid-2005, when ""Napoleon Dynamite"" was starting to ebb. I'll never forget the first time I watched this movie; it was a genuine head-scratcher. No plot, characters doing completely random things and scenes that just sort of happened before moving on to the next one. But there's something lovable about this that keeps you coming back.Take Napoleon, for instance. He's that awkward kid in school; dopey look, stilted gait, stores tater tots in his thigh pocket while priding himself on his nonexistent ""numchuck"" skills. His first scene has him tossing a wrestling figure out of the school bus only to let it drag on the road behind. Why? Why does anything here happen? And believe it or not, he's the hero of this story. He ends up saving the day and winning the girl with some sweet white-boy dance moves.A lot of the dialogue in this movie just seems so out of place and oddly delivered that it makes for a great deal of the humor. It's strangely quotable, and these lines have been thrown around in my family with reckless abandon for ten years now. I love that Diedrich Bader almost (almost) steals the movie with just two-minutes of screen time as a macho sensei. All of this is very aimless, but there's still an undeniable feeling of joy when it ends in a high-five.This is a great movie.8/10",Napoleon Dynamite

Finally when my friends and I just recently saw the horrid ""Date Movie"", they had a little parody dedicated to N.D. I surrender! I will see the movie! Well, to my surprise over all, I did enjoy ""Napolean Dynamite"". It reminded me a little of ""That 70's Show"" with ""American Pie"". But the humor was not necessarily within my tastes.

21,=G=,The opposite of cool,6,28 December 2004,"""Napoleon Dynamite"" is a minimalistic deadpan slice-of-life comedy all about the title character and his assorted kookie peers and kin who inhabit a rural community somewhere in Idaho. Napoleon is a nerdy male teen who is struggling through those awkward high school years where everything is everything but nothing is as everything as the always unattainable state of cool. Little more than a series of situational clichés, there's little plot to be found between the credits of this panorama of the silly misfits, stereotypes, and caricatures who occupy Napoleon's existence. Nonetheless, Hess has nailed the foible fraught character from his lame tetherball skills to his neurotic need for privacy when on the phone to his utter lack of awareness of his own clumsy social skills and created a portrait we can all understand if not fully appreciate. ""Napoleon Dynamite"" will be most enjoyed by tweens and teens or anyone who can look back at adolescence and laugh. (B-)",Napoleon Dynamite
22,MovieAddict2016,Very simplistic in humor and also very repetitive,4,10 August 2006,"By now if you haven't managed to see ""Napoleon Dynamite"" you've still probably heard it referenced a lot. ""Vote for Pedro"" has become a pop culture reference already along with many annoying idiots trying to imitate the voice of the titular character, quoting lines from the movie such as ""Sweet"" or so on and so forth.I started watching this fully expecting to be drawn in from the beginning, but ten minutes in I was loathing it. I wondered to myself how on earth anybody could find such irritating characters to be ""hilarious."" If you consider repetition of words stated in pothead dumb Californian voices to be ""utterly hilarious"" then, by all means, this is for you. There's plenty of that here.

23,Buddy-51,"The real ""Revenge of the Nerds""",7,31 December 2005,"Napoleon Dynamite is a king among nerds, a slack-jawed, mouth-breathing high school student who suffers the slings and arrows of perpetual ridicule, yet who gives as good as he gets when the treatment gets too rough. Luckily, Napoleon is far from alone in his nerddom. He has an older brother who wears buttoned-up short sleeve dress shirts and black-rimmed glasses, and whose social contact is limited mainly to people he meets in internet chat rooms. Napoleon's Uncle Rick is what might be called a ""muscular nerd,"" a used-up, middle aged football player who dreams of his glory days in 1982 when he was just one play away from a career in the NFL and a life of fame and fortune, and who now spends his time hawking Tupperware products, selling miracle breast enhancement devices, and investing in time travel machines he finds in catalogues. Napoleon also befriends the school's newest nerd, a transfer student named Pedro, and tries to start up a romance with the shy and awkward Deb, who sheepishly goes door to door drumming up business for her studio that specializes in ""glamour"" photo shots for a decidedly unglamorous clientele.Set in a small town in rural Idaho, ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is a quirky regional comedy that achieved phenomenal mainstream success at the American box office. Its appeal is in its low-keyed, understated look at a group of people that more of us probably identify with than we would like to acknowledge. This is a movie for anyone who has ever felt unattractive or unpopular, who just never quite ""fit in"" with the people who really counted, especially in those dark ages known as the ""teen years."" One can't help liking and rooting for these bizarre and eccentric individuals who are really just looking for the same love and acceptance that we all are.Director Jared Hess, along with co-writer Jerusha Hess, never feels the need to exaggerate or overstate the comedy. It would have been easy for them to have turned this into another ""Revenge of the Nerds,"" placing their characters in over-the-top predicaments and situations to appease audience expectations. Instead, they let the story develop subtly and gradually, making the film feel more attuned to real life in the process. It may seem like a contradiction in terms, but the writers achieve their humor through a kind of understated hyperbole that allows us to laugh with the characters rather than at them. These nerds may be nerds to the core, but they reflect the longings and doubts common to all of us at one time or another. As a result, ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is warm and humanistic where it could easily have been cruel and condescending.The filmmakers are helped immeasurably by a wonderfully talented cast, all of whom play their parts perfectly. Joe Heder as Napoleon, Aaron Ruell as his brother, Kip, Efren Ramirez as Pedro, and Tina Majorino as Deb all deliver their lines in a flat, emotionless, singsong monotone that perfectly captures the defense mechanism each of them has set up as a shield against a brutal, uncomprehending world. Yet, Napoleon and his fellow nerds never settle for victim status, as each finds a way to assert his individuality and carve out a little piece of happiness for himself. As an actor, only Jon Gries as Napoleon's Uncle Rico gets to break through the somnambulist haze and go for the fences in his delivery.""Napoleon Dynamite"" is clearly not the kind of movie that every audience will appreciate, but those movie watchers with a taste for the offbeat and quirky will have a fun time with it.",Napoleon Dynamite
24,Robert_duder,You have to think about it...or you'll say what the H&%*& am I watching??,6,21 March 2005,"First off...any person, and there are A LOT that say this is the best movie of the year or even their favorite movie, needs their head examined. This is not a good movie...but fortunately for writer film maker Jared Hess, it wasn't meant to be. I have to wonder if he even thought this film would be much of anything or if he was just making a gag film. Fortunately for him the fickle crowd latched on to crazy Napoleon Dynamite and it looks like it's shaping out to be a cult classic.I can't rundown the plot for this film like I usually do...there isn't one. Once again I stress that I believe this was meant to be. I think this is a film about a guy, who just is. We all know him, we all went to school with him, maybe we were even him!! Napoleon Dynamite is the paramount of loserdom. He is every aspect of the kid everyone hated, and he doesn't even know he's a loser. I know most people who have seen this movie will be angry that I try to analyze for more than it is...But I HAVE TO otherwise I HATED this movie. But if I analyze it and think about intellectual satire that exists then it's much more of an interesting movie. If you can say anything about N.D. you can say that it's original and different, a rarity in Hollywood nowadays. If you watch N.D. you'll see a major time warp in the characters and settings and background. You'll see a little of the seventies worked into things like Napoleon's clothes, or the house he lives in, you'll see a little of the eighties worked into the music and some of the supporting characters especially Uncle Rico and you'll see nineties too. It's like a little bit of every era to remind everyone about their high school days. I think Hess is trying to bring out a little sentimentality but not necessarily the good stuff that went on in High School. You got the jock, the cheerleader, the loser, the quiet guy, the cool kids, the not so cool kids...everything is here...school dance, dating, home life, the crazy family, making money, first jobs...everything is hidden within Napoleon's life. Lead actor Jon Heder is good as Napoleon, without him, he just wouldn't exist. His constant childish exclamation of ""GODD"" is just hilarious. Other highlighted performances are Jon Gries as Uncle Rico and Aaron Ruell as Kip, Napoleon's older brother. These three are definitely the highlight of the film. There are some genuinely funny moments mostly stupid funny but the real funny parts to me were the physical comedy which was well done. As I mentioned, the real reason to watch this is that it's different and not very long so you don't have to put up with the stupidity too long. In my opinion it's far from a good movie and it's NOT on my list of favorites but it wasn't the worst by a long stretch. 6/10",Napoleon Dynamite
25,MLDinTN,the movie about nothing,6,4 August 2005,"There really isn't a plot. It just follows the every day life of loser Napolean Dynamite. He's bullied by most people at school and goes around telling tall tales about hunting and his hot girlfriend in Oklahoma. He befriends the new guy, Pedro, who is pretty much a loser like him. They both talk in the this monotone, sleepy sounding voice. There's a goofy outsider girl who hangs with them. Pedro runs for class president and the highlight of the film is Napolean saving Pedro by performing a skit before the elections. The dance is a hit and totally unexpected because it's actually good.The movie also shows Napolean's brother, Kip, and Uncle Rico. Each are goofs themselves. Kip mainly stays on the computer and Uncle Rico is a salesman who still dreams of the big football game in high school. he says he was good but I think we know he sucked. He even wastes money on a ""time machine."" The movie was sort of funny and it was amusing. Napolean says a lot of stupid things and it looks like he either squints or closes his eyes a lot. He resembles a down syndrome child. He's just plain weird.FINAL VERDICT: It wasn't as good as I thought it would be. It was amusing and had a few laughs. So, I'd only recommend it if you are looking for something unusual and not a slap stick comedy.",Napoleon Dynamite
26,g-bodyl,Funny and Original!,9,20 January 2009,"This has to be one of the most surprising comedies of the year. I did not expect much. In fact, I did not expect anything at all. I was forced to see this with my summer camp because it was raining all day. I enjoyed it a lot, so did the other people around me.The plot is very simple and original. It's about some high school nerd named Napoleon in Idaho and his lifestyle. He meets Pedro, a person who moved from Mexico. He decides to run for class president against the most popular girl in the school, Summer Wheatley.This movie had me cracking up and gagging on my popcorn. The jokes are the best! I especially like the way how Napoleon speaks. Gosh! I find his lifestyle funny, too. Ever heard of ligers? I was reading some negative reviews. They mostly say that there is no character development. There is. You just have pay close attention and use your common sense.This is a great movie. I recommend this to everyone, especially under the age of 30. I rate this movie 9/10.",Napoleon Dynamite
27,cricketbat,"An otherworldly, yet familiar comedy",9,22 January 2020,"There aren't many films like Napoleon Dynamite. This unique comedy offers an experience that is otherworldly, yet somehow familiar. It's a simple story filled with interesting characters, hilariously awkward moments, and endlessly quotable dialogue. Not everyone will like this movie, but I certainly love it.",Napoleon Dynamite
28,CuriosityKilledShawn,You will DIE laughing at this film,10,11 December 2004,"Napoleon Dynamite was a total surprise. For me it just came out of nowhere and I only went to see it because of the whacky title. How was I supposed to know I was about to see one of the funniest movies ever.But it's not HAHA funny. Or funny STRANGE. It's a weird kind of bizarre humor that will only appeal to those sick of American Pie 4,357. The story is not original by any means (a high school loser overcomes his adversaries and gets the girl) but the absurdest approach and catatonically laid-back humor make the movie a true gem.Napoleon Dynamite is a stroppy, slack jawed, gangly high school teen. He's an uber-dork. He loves tacky drawings of fantasy creatures (It's a Liger. My favorite animal. A cross between a tiger and a lion.) and has a thing about telling unbelievable lies. But it's not like he feels disadvantaged. As far as Napoleon is concerned, it's everyone else that's retarded. Including his 85-pound, 32-year-old, still living at home nerdy brother.24 year old directer Jared Hess has created a wonderful universe with Napoleon Dynamite. It's full of oddities and quirky characters of the Coen Brothers variety and a thoroughly unoppressive sense of light-heartiness.Plus, Jon Heder is BRILLIANT as Napoleon. If he don't get an Academy Award come February then there ain't no justice. His performance is just perfect in every way. The speech, the posture, the mannerisms the comic-timing. All brilliant. Definitely!As it turns out in my investigation into the wonderful movie, the film was a bit of a sleeper hit when it came out in America. And quite deservedly so. I can assure you I will be buying the DVD of this movie.",Napoleon Dynamite
29,ironhorse_iv,Vote for Pedro and then vote for this movie. Its dry humor is honestly pretty funny! This movie was dynamite for the most part!,7,25 April 2016,"The atmosphere of Napoleon Dynamite is very peculiar, with downplayed arid PG-squeaky clean style humor. It's not that raunchy. It's not really that mean-spirited. It's not toilet humor. It's not really physical slapstick comedy. Last, and most of all, it's not full of shout outs or pop culture references. It's just surreal. Napoleon Dynamite's humor works, because how confusing and strange, it is. It remind me, so much of a Wes Anderson's comedy film with its tone. It's quite quirky in its writing, with the large amount of awkward characters and largely unrelated absurdism sequences. However, Napoleon Dynamite doesn't have the same weight as a Wes Anderson film. There isn't anything, I can say, that was really emotional. Yes, there is parental abandonment, sibling rivalry, and unlikely friendships, but there is little to no depth with those themes. I get that Hess was trying to tell the story of how all the characters in the movie are refusing to grow up, but the whole message of them, trying to change is murky at best. It's really seem like they weren't going anywhere in the character development area. They're pretty much, act the same from the start of the film to the end. Despite that, the story between the trios of friends: Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder), Pedro Sanchez (Efren Ramirez) & Deb Bradshaw (Tina Majorino) and their attempts to overcome their status as social outcasts in High School was somewhat engaging. All of them, played their characters, very well. You really do believe, that all of them, are dweebs. Even the supporting characters like Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) and Kip Dynamite (Aaron Ruell) are somewhat memorable with their characteristic. It's still cracks me up, watching Uncle Rico throw a football, around. Another fault of the writing is how slow the pace is. Seeing how there is no main plot. It's feels like a film full of bizarre juxtapositions, non-sequiturs, irrational or absurd situations and expressions of nonsense. After all, what does any of the scenes with the town's martial arts instructor, Rex (Diedrich Bader) have to do with anything with the main plot? Barely anything. Another thing to note is, how similar, the visuals in this film are to Wes Anderson. Anderson has been noted for his extensive use of flat space camera moves, obsessively symmetrical compositions, snap-zooms, slow-motion walking shots, a deliberately limited color palette, and hand-made art direction often utilizing miniatures. There are plenty of examples of that. A good example is the opening titles. The sequence shows a pair of hands placing and removing several objects on a table. Objects like plates of food had the credits written in condiments, while other objects like a Lemonheads box or a tube of ChapStick had the credits printed on them. None of the items, really has anything to do with the main plot. It really confused people. Another thing that got people weirded out, was the settling. The film is supposedly set during the 2004-2005 school year, as shown on Napoleon's student ID card in the title sequence, but the film contains a number of anachronisms indicating that it would be more appropriately set in the 1980s or 1990s. It doesn't make sense for people to still be using outdated electric equipment like VHS and Cassette Players. I get that the Mormon town they filmed in, called Preston, Idaho is very notorious for being 'behind the curve' in regards to popular culture of almost any sort, but come on! They can't be that behind the times. Anyways, I know that this independent movie isn't for everybody. After all, I have been told by others, how unfunny, they felt watching it, but for me, I found the film to be very fun to watch, even with the deadpan comedy. It was the breakout role of Jon Heder, who also started in the original 2002 short, 'Peluca'. It's really surprising, how much the Seth character in 'Peluca' was later adapted into the titular character, Napoleon. A lot of his famous catchphrases were original ripped from 'Peluca'. Anyways, since the success of the film, many TV Shows and movies tried to emulate the film's style by featuring absurd, deadpan humor and realistic-looking kids in late '70s - early '80s clothes. The movie even influence a fountain full of internet memes, merchandise and random everyday sayings. While, there has been some backlash, for the most part. People still love to quote this film. It hasn't gotta that dated, yet. After all, it was announced in 2010 that an Animated Adaptation was in production for Fox, with the original cast returning to voice the characters. The show premiered on January 15, 2012 with lukewarm reception. Despite being canceled after 6 episodes, I kinda like that cartoon series. Overall: I have to say, Napoleon Dynamite will always be, a favorite of mine. So check it out, if you like to. Gosh!",Napoleon Dynamite
30,The-Sarkologist,A rather strange and disjointed movie that makes sense in the end,8,17 October 2013,"This is one really strange movie. At first I hated it. I remember sitting in my lounge with half the guests laughing their head off and the other half screaming in agony (and I was one of the screamers), so we turned it off and watched the A-Team instead. However, more recently I decided to give it another go, and to say that this is a movie that grows on you is an understatement.To put this movie in a nutshell is to say that it is an independent chick flick. It is a feel good movie with a happy ending (and in fact it ends happily for most of the people, even Uncle Rico, who seriously does not deserve a happy ending) but it is also quite amusing, mostly with all of the quirks that each of the characters has. I guess this is what stands out about this movie, the character quirks. Napoleon enters the movie by tying a He-Man figure to some string and the dragging it along the back of the school bus.The movie is very retro, it appears that it is set in the eighties, and with the exception of Kip surfing the net, there are many reminders of the limitations that existed in the eighties (such as a complete lack of mobile phones). Further, even Kip's computer is retro, and I remember that in the Eighties we had chatrooms which were called bulletin boards.Meat figures predominantly in this film. There is actually an awful lot of meat being cut and eaten. Further, minor parts of the movie turn out to have a significant impact, such as Napoleon learning to dance, and then being given a tape by Kip's girlfriend. Then there is Pedro. He simply appears, and Napoleon decides to be his friend. No reason, just simply because he can, and then we discover that Pedro's influence on the movie, and on Napoleon, is huge.I want to finish off talking about Kip. He's 34 and is basically a child that spends his days on his computer talking on chat rooms. Then one of the girls he was chatting too decides to come to visit him, and all of a sudden we see a huge change in the character. Character growth is a very important aspect of a good movie.It all may seem a bit disjointed, but I guess this is what Napoleon Dynamite is about. It is about life, and how a disjointed reality ends up fitting together and in the end makes sense.",Napoleon Dynamite
31,briancham1994,Too quirky for me,6,4 June 2020,"This film has a very quirky style that sets it apart from other comedies. The delivery is a bit dorky and deadpan.

The style of comedy didn't really work for me, and since it offers nothing else, I could not enjoy it as a whole.",Napoleon Dynamite
32,zkonedog,A Movie That (Slightly) Transcends Its Overall Value,4,11 March 2017,"To be completely blunt, ""Napolean Dynamite"" is a terrible film when being evaluated by traditional movie standards. It has no plot, the pacing is slow, the characters are stranger than strange, and there is absolute ZERO point to the overall experience. That being said, it's one of those ""funny because it is stupid"" type of movies, and should be watched if only to understand why EVERYONE in 2004 was wearing ""Vote for Pedro"" t-shirts.For a basic plot summary...oh, wait...! Basically, this movie follows the utterly random exploits of Napolean (Jon Heder), Kip (Aaron Ruell), Pedro (Efran Ramirez), Uncle Rico (Jon Gries), & Deb (Tina Majorino). There really is nothing else to say.Like I said, I don't see how anyone can sit down and watch this movie and really, really like it. It's just too pointless and stupid for that type of viewing. Instead, you'll just find yourself chuckling at that very stupidity (which can only go so far, of course, but does produce a number of quote- worthy and memorable cinematic moments).In terms of the ""big picture"", I don't quite understand why ""Napolean Dynamite"" has become such a cult phenomenon. I can see why it may appeal to junior-high clientele (what with its juvenile humor and loner/nerd characters), but other than that it just doesn't work on a higher level.I think, in the end, this movie is a rare example of a really bad movie catching lightning in a bottle for some ephemeral reason, becoming a cult classic along the way. You won't like it...but you might just like it a little bit...!",Napoleon Dynamite
33,Floated2,pretty alright,7,10 January 2009,"Napolean Dynamite, what a shocker. This movie is alright and not as great as many fans think. I mean its kinda weird and some of the jokes really fall flat. I rated this film 7 out of 10 because this film owns a taste of little town living, as a geek. The true hilarious moments of life included, this film tells about 3 true friends, and how unique there relationship is. Jon Heder's best performance in a film yet. A funny feature to the film is the 70's style clothes and equipment. Although the movie was supposed to be a small cheesy film, i don't even think they expected it to hit the big screen. This movie is highly overrated, its not the greatest or the worst, its decent in that some what sippin' way. And Jon Heder is in at least 4 more films right after this film was made, and i haven't seen his reputation change since the film. You should rent the movie and watch it, and as i have seen in the past, many will like it and many ill hate it",Napoleon Dynamite
34,johnnyboyz,"People describe Hollywood summer blockbusters as 'nothing special but a hell of a piece of entertainment'. On a much lower level, that's exactly what Napoleon Dynamite is.",7,5 August 2007,"Bizarre, strange, colourful, even ground breaking? There are so many things you could say about Napoleon Dynamite and there are so many words you could use to describe it; words such as: Unpredictable? Realistic? and dare I say even funny although I'm sure there are numerous people who would furiously disagree with me. We all go to the cinema and watch films for one reason or another and Napoleon Dynamite is such a breath of fresh air in the sense it's so different to a number of films I've seen recently (both old and new) namely Die Hard 4.0 and Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End that I actually enjoyed Napoleon Dynamite on the whole.Napoleon Dynamite is a very impressive independent film; made on such a shoestring budget even the titles are presented to us in 'real time' that is to say: they are written onto everyday objects such as chap sticks and plates and are then shown to the camera. This reminded me very much of the Dogme film movement Denmark introduced in 1995  the method of making a film using, often literally, no money what-so-ever by utilising things, people and places that you just go around and discover and then put into your film. Dogme films demand creativity and you're not allowed to edit in titles or sound to your films  it all has to be there as you found, something the titles very much reminded me of as well as the music at the school dance.Although to call Napoleon Dynamite a bone-fide Dogme film would be ludicrous as it disobeys about 90% of the other laws Dogme lays down; it's still the best debut, independent film I think has been made since Clerks. (1994) or in-fact; since the Dogme film movement its self. The film is clever and quirkily funny in its own right; dealing with sensitive and complex issues such as love, past tragedies and life in general. We have Napoleon (Heder) of the title as a school kid who's so out of touch with everyone, he finds companionship with Pedro (Ramirez), the school's lone Mexican student. Both boys do their best to negotiate life, love, school and a host of other bizarre things such as learning how to dance and how to run a campaign for school presidency; something to an Englishman like myself was rather bizarre for a school to be doing yet I still managed to find it entertaining anyway.Uncle Rico's (Gries) part in the film is the tragedy of the narrative as he struggles to come to terms with the fact he isn't going to be living out his dream  a mere twenty two years on. Everything in this picture screams 'independent film' and 'originality'. The acting is dopey and quirky but at the same time funny and effective as is the delivery of dialogue in most cases  oddly enough, it doesn't grate like I thought it would and that's because I cared for the characters. Also, the humour is ingenious in a way; drawing you out from what you come to expect with a typical Hollywood film comedy such as American Pie or a Vince Vaughn film or whatever and almost 'tempts' you to chuckle at the bizarre yet oddly familiar routines and jokes that are being presented to you. It's not the humour you expect but it isn't exactly slapstick either.Nothing stands out as fantastic in this film be it an individual piece of film-making or an acting performance or even the way in which the story's told as everything is purposely done in a mundane and naïve manner which is risky but brave and it although it won't work for everyone, it worked for me  the school dance scene being particularly memorable as although brilliant in its simplicity; the song playing, the people dancing and the dialogue said all combine to create something that's nothing super-duper but it's entertaining; and that one description of the scene at the prom could sum up the whole film.",Napoleon Dynamite

38,insomniac_rod,Brains do not mean boredom. This movie is funny on it's own way.,8,16 August 2009,"This movie is really funny because it uses ""the other"" teenager humor. Here there is no need to get scatological, vulgar, or joke about sexuality or anything similar. The humor here may be considered as light or boring but believe me, if you watch the movie with an open mind; you might find it very funny and clever at the same time.Here, our heroes and their close people are geeks, let's face it. They have mediocre lives and they're not popular. Napoleon and Pedro may be considered as social worms, but as we learn about them and their background, we get related to them. The situations are very high-schoolish but that doesn't mean you can't relate to them. It's not always like ""American Pie"". Think about ""The Big Bang Theory"" without being goofy. Nerds are today's ""in"" for a different way of comedy. Oh but we also get some very funny moments to please every kind of audience; like Napoleon's painful but hysterical dance, the time machine fraud, Napoleon slapping his brother, the extravagant internet black girlfriend, Pedro's wig, Pedro's cousins menacing a bully, etc. Give a try to this character driven comedy for uh, smarter teens. Not very MTV but still it should be considered as a funny movie. The acting is also great by not so good looking guys but you can always feel related to them. Pedro rocked his own way.The very last scene was fresh and ended the movie in such a classy manner: the song, Napoleon asking for forgiveness through a fish!, and the girl trying to play with him. Special mention for the hotness of Emily Dunne. The girl is extremely sexy, beautiful, and curvy. I wish she had more important roles. Haylie Duff is also damn sexy. She and Dunne deliver eye candy while dancing some Backstreet Boys song while wearing skimpy short dresses.",Napoleon Dynamite
39,GOWBTW,This is worth the watch!,10,23 June 2006,"Out of all the movies dealing with being a high school outcast, this movie is the tops! ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is the most outlandish comedy I have ever seen. The cast and characters are great and very unique. I like the main character Napoleon Dynamite(Jon Heder). Yes, he more like a misfit, but an outsider, he's not likely. The only two friends he got are Pedro(Efrem Ramirez) and Deb(Tina Majorino). Pedro is from Mexico, and he's made to run for class president by Napoleon. Deb, is a photographer who's trying to get to college when she graduates. His family life is more odd there. His brother Kip(Aaron Ruell) spends his time on the WWW. They have an uncle(Jon Gries) who was former football star who gets into a scheme that makes everyone in the family to get out of here. Especially when Rico posts those offensive fliers that makes Napoleon very angry. For Kip, he meets his online soul mate LaFundah Lucas(Shodrella Avery) a tall Afro-American female who gets Kip to completely come out of his shell. Which indeed works. He's really lucky! As for Napoleon, his dance skit really got Pedro the votes. Thanks to his future in-law, and the dance video he bought. Great planning Napoleon! Also for his drawing skills, Napoleon is the cool, in his way. With only a few people to rely on, you can achieve anything. This movie shows the real cool and hip. This is not ""Revenge of the Nerds"" folks, it's Napoleon Dynamite! 5 stars. SWEET!",Napoleon Dynamite
40,Turfseer,"'Napoleon' and ""Sunshine' are birds of a feather",2,20 January 2008,"I see many similarities between Napoleon Dynamite and Little Miss Sunshine. The protagonists or 'the good guys"" in both films are quirky, non-conformists who don't fit into mainstream society. The screenwriters elevate these characters to a high level of nobility while at the same time disparage their antagonists (veritable straw men and women) who they characterize as back-stabbing victimizers. Indeed, Napoleon and Little Miss Sunshine both revel in being able to give mainstream society 'the finger'! Since they're both victims, they're not accountable for their actions. In both movies, there's an older male figure (in Napoleon, the Uncle, in Sunshine, the grandfather) who both act out inappropriately with women. Somehow, the screenwriters are saying that this type of behavior is 'okay' because in their eyes 'it's funny'. This is their idea of 'comic relief'. Well in reality, none of the machinations of the uncle or the grandfather in both movies are funny in the least. But remember, since they are members of a family that have been victimized, they rationalize their inappropriate behavior as merely quirky or cute. Both films set up stereotyped antagonists: in Napoleon it's the bullies at school and in Sunshine it's the crass, beauty pageant officials. Note that the writers haven't taken the time to make any of their antagonists complex, multi-dimensional people. The screenwriters in both movies need such poorly drawn antagonists in order to convince themselves that their protagonists (i.e. themselves) are better than people who don't share their ultra-liberal, anything goes philosophy. Hence, the writers of Napoleon and Sunshine can easily be viewed as elitists (masquerading as enlightened liberals). It's interesting that both Napoleon and Little Miss Sunshine both end up 'triumphant' at the end of their respective stories by dancing in a highly suggestive, sexual way before an audience. This is the screenwriters' way (in both films) of again suggesting that they are hipper and cooler (and undoubtedly more sexually liberated) than the conservative people they look down upon. Finally, one notes that both films have meandering or practically non-existent plots which account for some reviews which hold that both films are boring. When one looks closely at both 'Napoleon' and 'Sunshine', it's quite clear that both are more propaganda than drama at the expense of true entertainment.",Napoleon Dynamite
41,dfranzen70,Funny and unique!,7,30 December 2004,"Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder) is the typical sad-sack, luckless loser that has permeated high schools for seemingly centuries. He has no friends, he's picked on by bullies, he has a somewhat-odd home life ... but through it all, he's sure things will be just plain okay in the end.Napoleon and his older brother Kip (Aaron Ruell) live with their grandmother, but at the beginning of the film she tells them she needs to take off for a couple days. Enter their Uncle Rico (Jon Gries), a self-starter who's living in 1982 (when the coach of his high school football team declined to put him in as quarterback, thus altering Rico's life forever). Some of the funniest scenes in the film involve Napoleon's often-combative relationship with Uncle Rico; Rico is also bound and determined to return to those halcyon days of his youth via a time machine he's seen advertised on the Internet, and he enlists Kip to help him raise the funds.Napoleon befriends the new kid in school, Pedro (Efren Ramirez), who has a sweet bike, can talk to girls, and has an actual mustache. But like Napoleon, Pedro is a misfit. Both sometimes hang out with yet another taciturn student, Deb (Tina Majorino, all grown up from Waterworld), who secretly (it seems) likes Napoleon. But there isn't a lot of focus on their relationship, because Napoleon himself is fairly oblivious to how people perceive him. This isn't a story about young love or lust, it's a story about a misfit refusing to fit - while fitting in with others like him.Jon Heder is perfectly cast as the gawky, dorky Napoleon; he resembles Butt-Head in countenance, although certainly not in temperament or intelligence. Mouth agape and with an awkward gait, Napoleon is about as odd a duck as you'd find in high school, and yet he still manages to survive with his dignity intact. He's a good egg, although he seems to overreact at times: ""What are you gonna do today, Napoleon? Napoleon: Whatever I feel like I wanna do.....GOSH!"" Still, his delivery is perfect. You can readily picture a Napoleon in any high school.I think where the film ultimately succeeds, aside from the casting of Heder, is that it doesn't fall into the traps of predictability and stereotyping. Sure, it's a high school movie, and there are snobby pretty girls and arrogant jocks, but not much time is devoted to them. Sure, there's a big dance, but it doesn't necessarily turn out the way you'd expect it to. What you're left with, then, isn't a typical coming-of-age story, but rather a unique take on a rather mundane - albeit life-altering - time in a boy's life.",Napoleon Dynamite

This is a strange comedy, about a strange teenager named Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder), who seems to meander through the film like he's permanently wasted on LSD or some other choice narcotic.But then again, such blandness is one of the reasons the movie works so well, because it's about an average guy who doesn't go above and beyond his average existence, which he's proud of; it's also easy to see why such an approach is so risky and perhaps that's why most audiences here at IMDb and elsewhere seem split on their verdicts of this movie.It's not a teen movie about nerdish anti-heroes who are out to achieve popularity or anything, they're just nerds out to be better nerds. How many of today's mainstream teen movies would dare to display such elements for their audiences? And it is that blandness that permeates throughout this movie that gets lost on some people, and even those that liked ""Napoleon Dynamite"" might say that it's too much; it's for this reason the movie got an 8/10 from me.For the most part though, ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is definitely worth checking out.",Napoleon Dynamite
43,meeza,One of the funniest films ever!,7,29 January 2005,"""Napoleon Dynamite"" is a tour-de-force of comedic entertainment! Napoleon has conquered moviegoers across the nation by gaining 34 million box office dollars. This is another one of those independent film success stories of profit heaven. The film did cost around the $300,000 mark to produce and again did make over 34 million dollars. You do the math! ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is one of those idiosyncratic cinematic gems that most probably will have an undying cult following (actually, it already has!). ""Napoleon Dynamite"" definitely does have dynamic unforgettable characters. Let's start with the Napster himself! Napoleon is a high school geek who is assertive enough to respond confidently to peers who bully him. That is no bull! His catchphrases, mannerisms, temperament, and nuances are unforgettable. Jon Heder's work as Napoleon was ""kid dynamite"". Heder is headed on the right thespian direction. Once upon a time in Mexico & then Idaho there was a teenager named Pedro. He is Napoleon's Mejicano compadre. He is also the new chamaquito who decides to run for class president. Efren Ramirez's performance as Pedro was phenomenal enough for me to ""Vote for Pedro"" as one of the best supporting acting efforts by a young actor in 2004. Then there's Uncle Rico wonderfully portrayed by Jon Gries. He moves into the dynamite household as a caretaker because Grandma Dynamite did not have such a dynamite time ATC riding when she fell and severely injured herself. Rico is enriched with character flaws that are a comedic delight. He is still mentally living back in 1982 when he was a high school quarterback, he quenches for steaks, and works as a door-to-door salesman. He is no ""Rico Suave"" when it comes to professionalism & safeguarding but he is most definitely a scene-stealer. This steak lover grades an ""A 1 A"" when it comes to the Comedia Arts. We cannot forget ""Kip Dynamite"", Napoleon's brother. Kip is the computer chat line addicto who logs in quite hilariously. Aaron Ruell as Kip does quite well with a top-notch performance. He even proves that he is not a ""Kip of the old block"". Writer-Director Jared Hess pumps enough creative Hess gas to create a brisk classic cult film that is quite simply the funniest film of the year. ***** Excellent",Napoleon Dynamite
44,drqshadow-reviews,Awkwardly Spectacular,9,17 June 2011,"I laugh a little bit harder every time I sit down with this one, but can acknowledge that other viewers' enjoyment will depend entirely upon their own experiences in high school. As a proud survivor of the awkward, unpopular farm town geek club myself, though, there's a lot of familiar territory covered between the credits of this little sensation. The film itself is a conundrum; an MTV production that feels like a DIY indie picture, it successfully captures the best elements of each without getting snagged by any of the drawbacks. Napoleon and friends come off as just awkward enough to feel authentic in their small town school, while the studio's big city influence delivers a surprisingly appropriate, not-quite-star-studded soundtrack. It's at once sweet, funny, genuine and flamboyant, with a story arc that always gives me the warm fuzzies. Fellow bully targets who can laugh at their own origins will find a whole lot to like about this one, but members of the other cliques may not find themselves as enamored.",Napoleon Dynamite

If you enjoyed There's Something About Mary, or Clerks, or other movies that relied on whacky characters doing and saying unpredictable things, then this may be just worth your while.Napoleon Dynamite, right from the opening credits, screams low budget originality and offbeat humour. The central character (after whom the film is named) is a high school geek who would be unmitigatedly stupid and hopeless were it not for the originality of his dumb ideas, bad chat up lines and ability for upsetting all the other geeks. Although the formula works very well for a while, the film falls down when we realize it is little more than a succession of sketches, mostly in reverse order of their ability to induce mirth. He teams up with a moronic Hispanic guy who says very little, gets a date under duress, and after what is less than an hour and a half but somehow seems much longer, saves the day. Napoleon Dynamite shows promise and a lot of talent, but it needs to be developed in more directions than this to make an entertaining movie that is truly satisfying.",Napoleon Dynamite

He makes a new friend in Pedro at school, who develops a crush on the popular girl (who can't relate there?), and Napoleon launches on his crusade of adventures and misadventures. He was a bit like Charlie Brown-a misfit with a small circle of friends who never gives up despite his many failures!

Here is a film whose lead character owns a pet llama, who stashes warm Tater-Tots in his pants for future snacks, who lives in rural Idaho with his equally dorky older brother and cycle-loving grandma, and who passes his time drawing pictures of ligers and unicorns. An open-mouthed breather who resembles a curly-headed fish, he is Napoleon Dynamite, in the 2004 comedy of the same name; one of the quirkiest, oddest and funniest films to appear on the indie scene in years. Despite its no-name cast, this is a picture that manages to charm by dint of its oddball characters, offbeat style, deadpan humor and unusual soundtrack. During the course of the film, we meet Napoleon's Uncle Rico, a frustrated jock and online time-machine purchaser, and see how Nappy assists his best (only?) friend Pedro in his bid to be school president. The picture is consistently interesting, always unpredictable, and even features a surprising ""skit"" by Napoleon toward the end; I guarantee you won't see THIS one coming! In the lead role, Jon Heder is just perfect as the decidedly deadpan dork Napoleon; it's as if he was born to play this role. But then again, all the film's characters have been meticulously cast, down to the smallest bit parts, and all are memorable. The picture really is a bona fide winner, and surely a future ""cult item."" Oh...when you do watch this film, be sure to stick it through the closing credits.

49,rbverhoef,Did not like it very much,5,24 January 2005,"I did not like 'Napoleon Dynamite' very much. Yes, there were some funny moments, but most of the time everything was over the top in a film with only one likable character. That character is Deb (Tina Majorino), the love interest, I guess, for Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder). He is one of those high-school nerds without friends and admittedly it is not hard to understand why he has no friends. He is weird, annoying, childish, and acts like he has not a single clue of the world he inhabits. There is one other character you might like a little. His name is Pedro (Efren Ramirez), a new (and only) Mexican kid on their Idaho high-school, who becomes Napoleon's only friend. Other strange people who are in this film are Napoleon's brother Kip (Aaron Ruell) and his uncle called Uncle Rico (Jon Gries).I guess I could mention that Pedro joins the election for class-president. His opponent is one of those annoying popular girls we have seen too many times in the movies. Other things that drive the story is a business that Uncle Rico and Kip start and a girlfriend Kip has found in a chatroom. All these things play like small episodes, some funny, some not, instead of one whole. In some films, 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' is the first that comes to mind, that is not a real problem, here it is. The episodes all seem the same. Nerds, most of the time Napoleon and another, are on a location like school and talk and act strange but the same as in an earlier episode.Like I said, there are some funny moments. I can understand why people think the film itself is very funny because they simply like the premise from which episode starts. I have to admit Heder does a nice job with his Napoleon, even though I did not like the character. It is not that I can not like weird character, ""The Dude"" from 'The Big Lebowski' and Donnie Darko belong to my favorite, but it must not seem a forced character. In my opinion you must be able to find a Donnie Darko or a Dude in the real world; I think a Napoleon Dynamite does not exist. The way he is treated by others is something that I can believe, but again, can you really blame them? Simply said I can not recommend this film. In 2004 we have seen so much better. If you want weird but good try 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' or 'Shaun of the Dead', if you want a film with characters from everyday life go for 'Garden State' and if you just want to laugh try films like 'Anchorman' or 'Dodgeball', just skip this one.",Napoleon Dynamite
50,vertigo_14,Sometimes nothing can be a real cool hand. (contains flippin' spoilers),9,2 January 2005,"As many viewers have already commented, it is surprising that a movie with no plot could be so good. And, Napoleon Dynamite is one of the best movies I had seen in 2004 (of the new ones, anyway, falling just behind 'Garden State' and 'The Triplettes of Bellville').Like many recent indie comedies, the atmosphere is arranged so you're not really sure what year it is. Everyone dresses so retro (especially Napoleon's school friend, Deb), that you'd probably think early 80s. Except, you know that the Internet is around.As for the ""plot"", the first line of the movie really says it all: ""What are you going to do today, Napoleon?"" ""Whatever I feel like, God!"" And that's pretty much what the movie is about--Napoleon doing whatever. The story is more like a string of subplots than it is a traditional story. Napoleon is a giant nerdy kid living in a rural Idaho town. When his spunky grandma eats it while motocrossing in the dunes, she calls on Napoleon's sleazy uncle Rico to babysit her boys--Napoleon and his pale, timid brother, Kip. While Napoleon is busy with school, and, mostly trying to get a date for the dance or helping his buddy, Pedro, with his run for class president, Kip and Rico are local salesman for cheap Tupperware or breast implants. And in the meantime, Kip thinks he just found his soul mate, LaFawnda, whom he met on a chat room. It is more of a series of silly scenes that make this movie so great. The characters are so odd and their situations are so incredible, if not altogether laughable, and that's why I think it had so much appeal, even without much of a story.If you can get past the fact that everyone looks like they got kicked in the face by a mule (especially Napoleon and sometimes, Pedro), or that they tried to 'corporatize' the movie with a dumb wedding scene (added for the DVD release, not the theatrical release), or that sometimes that the characters move so slow (wouldn't it be great to make the movie go a little faster like you can on Windows Media Player when you're playing music), or that Napoleon often talks with his eyes closed, then you've got yourself quite a great little comedy. Napoleon isn't exactly the most appealing character in the world, especially with his excess nerdiness and annoying attitude at times (he gets 'touchy' quite often around Rico and other idiots). But, sometimes you feel sorry for the poor guy (see the school dance scene where his date leaves him hanging). But, just wait till you see that flippin' skit scene after Pedro's speech for class president, and witness what a great friend Napoleon really is. When Pedro gets really discouraged about his chances for victory, Napoleon advises him to ""Just listen to your heart, Pedro, that's what I do."" So, he may be a giant weirdo, but at least he's an honest one. That dance scene is the best scene in the whole film and it is sure to have your cheering for Napoleon. And, even though everyone in the movie may have had you wincing at one time or another, after that dance scene, everyone finishes up the movie in a such a sweet way (oh shucks, so I thought it was cute).I guess there's nothing left for me to do but dance.",Napoleon Dynamite

Story takes place in Preston, Idaho where we watch Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder) who is a seemingly hopeless mess of a person that spends his days at school being picked on. His older brother Kip (Aaron Ruell) is always on the computer on the chat lines and after their grandmother ends up in the hospital their uncle Rico (Jon Gries) shows up to live with them. At school Napoleon meets a new student named Pedro (Efren Ramirez) and they become friends but Napoleon also meets Deb (Tina Majorino) and develops a crush on her.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Uncle Rico enlists the help of Kip and together they go door to door selling tupperware and breast enhancement techniques to make money. Meanwhile, Pedro decides to run for school president and Napoleon and Deb help him but they are running against Summer (Haylie Duff) who's one of the most popular students at school.This film is directed by Jared Hess who is making his feature film debut as a director and he was also born in the same Preston, Idaho and he seems to be satirizing the area in which he grew up in. While a film like ""Revenge of the Nerds"" can be seen as a story that embraces it's characters and actually likes them this film more or less just wants to show them in their own light without to much humanization. This is a very quiet film full of dry humor and odd scenarios but as it comes to it's conclusion it does try to make it's audience root for the characters which has come to being a staple in nerd films. I did find enough of the humor funny enough to recommend this film and I also enjoyed Heder's angry nerd performance and one can't help but be entertained by his dance to help Pedro. I do have one question and if anyone knows the answer to it please e-mail me and explain it. Who is the girl on the bike at the end of the film who rides up to Uncle Rico? I'm at a loss as to who she is! Parts of this film don't work as it comes across as weird or unfunny but I did find enough of this quirky tale humorous enough to recommend.",Napoleon Dynamite
54,Galina_movie_fan,"The best thing about ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is its title",2,11 September 2007,"I did not know much about this independent comedy, until I saw it last weekend. I had heard that it was a surprise favorite at 2004 Sundance festival where it was met with non-stop laughing. Since I admire off-beat humor and am a big fan of a good comedy, I was ready to love or at least like ""Napoleon Dynamite"". I was sorely disappointed. The best and the funniest thing about ""Napoleon Dynamite"" (2004) is its title. By the title alone I expected the movie and its main character to be charismatic and brave as Napoleon I and explosive as dynamite or at least, unpredictable, fresh, and original. Guess what, it is none of the above. First and foremost, the movie is so boring, slow, and non-interesting that I could hardly manage to sit through it. Yes, I've read the comments that Napoleon, and his two equally sleep-walking friends, Pedro, the most impossible candidate for school president and Deb, the girl we should believe Napoleon might have a crush on and few more high school cliché characters are exactly like the regular students in a regular high school. Even if it is true and I hope that it is not always the case, I don't have to sympathize with the trio of walking zombies. ND and his friends are so bored and boring that their boredom becomes contagious - for me it was. I did not find anyone on the screen slightly interesting, leave alone sympathetic. Well, there was one exception, Napoleon's and his older brother Kip's, 32 years old Internet chat rooms addict's grandmother who was injured in a dune buggy accident (that sounded interesting or at least promising) and taken from the screen after the first fifteen minutes. She was lucky - she did not have to endure the presence of her complete idiot-nephew Rico, the ex-jock of the 1982, a door-to-door salesman, whose adventures or projects did not contribute a single funny scene or even a joke to this sophomoric excuse for a movie.While trying not to fall asleep, I was thinking of the others, more successful and much better first movies that might have been the inspiration for ND. Wes Anderson's debut, ""Bottle Rocket"" (1996) even if not a masterpiece is often hilarious and always original. Todd Solondz's first feature which explores the similar subject, ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" (1995) is a terrific film - brave, and passionate - real dynamite.

55,nycritic,Fitting In by the Way Out,10,25 March 2007,"In many respects, thanks to John Waters and his ilk, the little movie that could has become the rite-of-way for many directors who decide to make it into the Big League. Jared Hess' NAPOLEON DYNAMITE can be considered one of these movies, being the extended version of a short film called PELUCA which itself described this odd-ball character who lived in a reality all his own. In this version, Napoleon (Jon Heder) is one of these geeky yet sweetly stupid kids who try to fit in but wind up way out in Pluto somewhere. The catalyst for events that shape his story and make him come into his own (so to speak) is the run for class president, which his dull friend (and Mexican transplant) Pedro (Efren Ramirez) takes on as a means to impress Summer Wheatley (Haylie Duff) who's rejected Pedro. Much of what happens has to be seen to be believed, since NAPOLEON DYNAMITE moves from misadventure to misadventure with singular ease, reaching a hilarious climactic showdown in which Napoleon dances (if it can be called that) to the beat of Jamiroquai's ""Canned Heat"". However, if it weren't so sympathetic to Napoleon, this would be just another exercise in mean-spirited humor towards the geek who doesn't know better: Jared Hess instead goes the other way and tells a story that starts as a punchline and ends up being a lot sweeter than anyone would initially imagine.",Napoleon Dynamite

Nonetheless I was severely disinterested for large parts of this movie, which basically lacks any proper story structure and seems to be more of a random collage of sketches, that range from the absurd to the plain unfunny. Focusing on the quacky quirkiness of all characters playing a part in this movie and absolutely bypassing a plot I can see the movie's potential to captivate audiences. But to do that it has to hit all the right viewer nerves.

As if the MTV logo prominently displayed in the opening credits weren't enough, the credits themselves, though different from the run-of-the-mill stuff, went on, and on, and on interminably. That should have been a warning in itself that the movie was going to be pants. Who shows that many credits at the start of a movie anymore? It was as if the producers realised that it was rubbish and decided that nobody would last through to the end of the film, so they better get the credits over to begin with.In fact, they were correct. I don't often give up on movies. I usually stay to the end, if only to see how bad they get so that I can rant about it on IMDb.

""Napoleon Dynamite"" is all about its characters and not at all about its plot. That's a good thing, because there is no plot. There's only Napoleon, going through the daily motions and spouting non-sequiturs. If there's any coherence, it's purely accidental, because that's clearly not what the makers are going for. Usually I don't enjoy movies without real stories because they often come of as pseudo-intellectual, but the puzzle just fits so perfectly here.

60,Cosmoeticadotcom,Funny,7,15 September 2008,"Jared Hess's cult classic from 2004, Napoleon Dynamite, immediately drew me back to such films as Rushmore, Election, and Welcome To The Dollhouse- films that deal with high school life in comic ways. Yet, of those films, Napoleon Dynamite is probably the most off the wall. The film is set in director Hess's hometown of Preston, Idaho, in the southeastern corner of the state, not far from the Great Salt Lake. It is not a parody, but an absurdist tale, as none of the characters are in the least bit realistic. Napoleon Dynamite is the lead character's name (and yes, it sounds like the name of a loser from a bad punk rock band), and he is played by newcomer Jon Heder- a tall, red afro'd, four-eyed geek who is a not too good liar. He lives with his grandmother (Sandy Martin) and websurfing, geeky older brother Kipling (Aaron Ruell), until grandma wipes out in an ATV accident on sand dunes. Then, their uncle Rico (Jon Gries) comes to live with the boys. Rico is a bad Tupperware salesman who lives out of his aging van, and still wishes it was 1982, when he was a backup high school quarterback. He feels his coach's decision not to put him into the game denied him a shot at the NFL. Napoleon's school life is not much better. He's bullied by kids his age and younger, and makes only two friends- a Mexican kid named Pedro Sanchez (Efren Ramirez), who's as passionless as his name is generic, but who has a sweet bicycle, can work up the courage to talk to girls, and has an real mustache, and a cute, but weird brunet girl named Deb (Tina Majorino), who attempts to run her own door-to-door Glamour Shots business. The film is well written by Hess and his wife Jerusha, and there is a making of featurette not for the film, but the addendum wedding after the credits. This seems wholly in keeping with the film. There is also a commentary with Hess and Heder, but little of note is said, save for the fact that we learn Heder is married in real life, and Majorino (Deb) is a hip hop dance instructor. The film, however, tells much more than other films with seemingly similar subjects because it does not try. What it shows, though, is really, really funny.",Napoleon Dynamite

It can be tiresome to watch the same old stereotypical comedy films that are too scared to try something different, so it was a breath of fresh air when 'Napoleon Dynamite' came along.I can speak highly of this film and recommend it, but it comes down to personal taste as to whether somebody loves or hates it. It's certainly one I would consider a 'guilty pleasure'.",Napoleon Dynamite
63,baumer,A modestly funny film that relates to this generation,7,15 September 2005,"I think every generation has their films that they can relate to. My generation related to films like Breakfast Club, Pretty In Pink and Fasstimes at Ridgemont High. Not to say that these films cannot make an impression on today's youth, because I'm sure that they can, but they were definitely films that appealed to kids my age in the 80's. Napolean Dynamite is a film that, in my opinion, is much more of a film that appeals to today's youth. Napolean is a slacker and just wants to be left alone. He has his circle of friends but for the most part, as the poster says, he is out to prove that he has nothing to prove. The film is humorous in some parts, pedestrian in others and overall it is a film that for someone like me ( 33 years old ), it probably doesn't work as well as it does for someone who is in high school. I know many kids that enjoyed this film and most of it was because of Jon Heder. He embodies the very spirit of Napolean Dynamite and even though I found the film to quite average, I have to admit that even I enjoyed Heder's performance. He obviously has a bright future ahead of him with a total of 7 films to his credit in the next two years.7/10",Napoleon Dynamite
64,Andy-296,Very funny comedy,8,28 February 2008,"In a godforsaken small town in Idaho, Napoleon Dynamite, the nerd to end all nerds, tries to survive high school. Harassed by the school bullies, ignored by the girls, living in a dysfunctional family consisting of his thirty years old brother, his hospitalized grandmother and the con man of his uncle, he clings to his only friend in school, the Mexican immigrant Pedro, and Debbie (Tina Majorino, who made some hit films as a child actress during the 1990s and returns to a major film after a decade), who for some mysterious reason might be attracted to him. When Pedro decides to run for school president, Napoleon Dynamite sees this as an opportunity for revenge from the rest of his class. Napoleon Dynamite seems the impossible: an outrageously funny teen comedy with zero references to sexual humor or bodily functions (maybe this has to do with the writer director being a Mormon). At first, I didn't like this deadpan comedy much, as most of the jokes were at Napoleon's expense, looking as if the director was joining the bullies. But it very soon warms up to his character. It does have a resemblance to some of the movies of Todd Solondz, but without the self-hate and with a much saner sense of humor.",Napoleon Dynamite
65,Beta_Gallinger,"Not much of a plot, but it's more about the laughs, and it usually works",8,18 June 2008,"I may not have known about this polarizing comedy right when it came out in 2004, but first saw it a couple years ago. I had been told that the humour was very ""dry"", and wasn't sure whether it would be my kind of comedy or not. However, while this independent feature-length debut from filmmaker Jared Hess was a little different from what I was used to, perhaps different from anything ever made before (which is good, seeing something original), I still laughed. I watched the entire film for the second time just last night, and it was basically like before, not one of my favourite comedies, but still amusing.Napoleon Dynamite is a listless, antisocial, geeky high school student who tends to look like he's asleep. He lives in Preston, Idaho with his grandmother and his 32-year old brother, Kip, who spends a lot of time in Internet chat rooms, searching for the woman of his dreams. Napoleon is very unpopular at school, but does meet a new student from Mexico named Pedro Sanchez one day and they soon become friends. Not long after this, the two get to know a girl named Deb. While the Dynamite grandmother is in the hospital with a broken coccyx after a sand dune biking accident, Napoleon and Kip's Uncle Rico comes to stay with them. Unfortunately for Napoleon, Uncle Rico will cause him trouble with his scheming business tactics. Meanwhile, at school, Pedro decides to run for student body president, and is up against the mean-spirited but popular Summer Wheatly. Napoleon helps him, but unlike Summer, Pedro doesn't seem very popular, so he has tough competition!Writing that plot description wasn't easy, since the movie doesn't really have a much of one. For the most part, it shows Napoleon in various situations, such as trying to get a date for the prom, having conflict with his Uncle Rico, helping Pedro in the school election, etc. We also see scenes without the main character, such as the ones that involve Uncle Rico and Kip talking about ways to make money. The film is definitely more about the laughs than the plot, so that's mainly what it should be judged by. If you ask me, the humour usually works. The main character usually carries it well with his odd tendencies, his always listless, unenthusiastic, and sometimes angry voice, and the things he says and the way he says them, such as when he says, ""Do the chickens have large talons?"" and ""Are you guys having a killer time?"", as well as the way he says words like ""Gosh!"", ""Gross!"", ""Idiot!"", and ""Lucky!"" The way some people look at him when he does odd things is also funny, such as they way Pedro looks at him when he puts tater tots in his pocket. Other characters, such as Pedro, Kip, and Uncle Rico, also add humour to the film. In addition to the dry humour, there are also some physical gags here and there, a good example being the scene where Napoleon throws fruit at Uncle Rico's truck, and Uncle Rico reacts with a hilarious Homer Simpsonesque scream!Clearly, some people hate ""Napoleon Dynamite"" with a passion, which I can understand perfectly. It's a teen comedy, and teen comedies are known to have a lot of vulgarity and slapstick, which this one, for better or worse, doesn't have a lot of, so anyone expecting the usual could easily be disappointed. Also, the dry humour in the film is obviously not for everybody, and if one doesn't find it funny, there isn't likely anything else in the movie to enjoy. Personally, I didn't find certain parts that funny, such as conversations between Kip and Uncle Rico, which cause the film to drag a bit. However, for the most part, I was amused, and when I wasn't laughing, I think I was usually at least smiling. I really can't guarantee anyone whether they would like or hate it, since it's a unique film, and I don't have anything to compare it to. However, if you're reading this and the polarizing 2004 teen comedy sounds interesting to you, then I would say it's at least worth a try. You could find it funny, and if you don't, you can always stop watching and move on.",Napoleon Dynamite
66,CitizenCaine,"Gosh, This Is So Retarded!",6,23 November 2008,"Jon Heder's career got off the ground with this film made in Idaho about Napoleon Dynamite, the ultimate high school dork who is oblivious to the fact that he's a social leper. Napoleon comes complete with curly-haired 70's fro, high-waisted jeans, and retarded phrases caught in a late 70's, early 80's time warp. He lives with his even dorkier 32 year old brother Kip, played by Aaron Ruell, who's busy talking to babes on the Internet. Ruell resembles a young John Waters and later turns into a character that could appear in a Waters' film. They live with grandma, Sandy Martin, who breaks her coccyx riding an off road vehicle. That's when Uncle Rico, played by Jon Gries, who is caught in a 1982 time warp, comes to ""babysit"". Once we see Uncle Rico and Kip, it's easy to see how Napoleon became such a dweeb in the first place. Along the way, Napoleon befriends Pedro (Efren Ramirez) and Deb (Tina Majorino), two other high school geeks who make Napoleon comfortable. What's interesting is this isn't your typical high school geek breaks out of the doldrums film. Napoleon, more or less, breaks out by accident. He does something definitive for his class president candidate/friend Pedro he thinks is worth doing and takes a risk in front of his classmates to accomplish the task. In the end, the tether ball-playing Napoleon does not become some great hero or anything, but he does win over a willing tether ball opponent whose respect he gains. The film, while spouting realistically high school-based dialog, moves at a snail's pace at times. However, there are enough funny bits in the film to recommend it, although it's no where near the triumph some people think it is. Haylie Duff is the female class president candidate, Summer Wheatly. The film has since spawned an annual Napoleon Dynamite festival in Preston, Idaho where the film was based. **1/2 of 4 stars.",Napoleon Dynamite
67,johno-21,The town that time forgot...and with good reason,7,21 August 2007,"I find it hard to believe that I have now seen this movie twice but sure enough I have. This film is so incredibly dry and deadpan that it's not like watching a comedy but more like being stuck in the little backwater western town it takes place in with the dysfunctional family it follows and having to incredulously observe the day to day events of your time spent there. It's been my observation that most small rural towns across Amercia are at least five years behind the times but this film takes that to the extreme and makes this rural Idaho town about 20 years behind the times except for some technological advances like the internet but basically and culturally it's 1984 despite the calender insisting on 2004. Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder) is your classic high school nerd who lives with even nerdier internet surfing 32 year old brother Kip (Aaron Ruell). They live with their dune buggy riding, would-be llama ranching grandmother (Sandy Martin). In her absence the brothers well-being are overseen by their 40 year old ex-jock uncle Rico (Jon Gries) who hasn't even caught up to the town and lives in a world about 22 years behind the times instead of 20. A new student from Mexico named Pedro Sanchez (Efren Ramirez) is enrolled in the school and proves to be even more nerdier but slight less quirky than Napoleon. Pedro is smitten by the class beauty with the name of amber waves of grain, Summer Wheatly (Haylie Duff) and Napoleon organizes a campaign to elect Pedro as class president with the help of Napoleon's romantic interest Deb (Tina Majorino). Filmmaker Jared Hess had made a short film at BYU called Peluca which starred Heder as a nerd and was set in Hess's hometown of Preston, Idaho. That quirky nine minute film received enough attention that Hess and his wife Jerusha wrote a feature-length screenplay that Hess would direct to become this film. This film may have worked better as say a 24 minute short film, but it works OK enough for me. The MTV crowd embraced it as the winner of Best Movie, Best Musical Performance, (for a dance scene) and Breakthrough Male for Heder's performance as Napoleon Dynamite. But don't let that deter you from seeing it. It has the element of being a cult classic and I will likely someday see it for a third time. I would give it a 7.0 out of 10.",Napoleon Dynamite
68,DarthBill,White & Nerdy,2,4 April 2008,"Longwinded, sporadically funny, mostly plot less film with a few nice 70s/80s nostalgia moments (like using Cindy Lauper's ""Time After Time"" during a high school dance) about a slack jawed, near sighted oddball nerd known as Napoleon Dynamite (Heder), his dysfunctional family, his seemingly lifeless friends (Hispanic kid Pedro and would be love interest Deb), his mundane life, the people who taunt him and his unexpected triumph in helping Pedro thwart charismatic alpha female Summer Wheatly (Haylie Duff) in the class presidential election.Over-praised indie film that many regard as a masterpiece of modern film-making in an era where a lot of people will praise a film simply because it's an indie flick & not a studio flick (and admittedly most Hollywood films of late have not been all that impressive), but just because it's independently financed and made on a nickle & dime budget that doesn't mean it's a good film. I occasionally chuckled at the film's offbeat sensibilities, but it never really builds up to anything resembling a pace and the characters for the most part are either lacking in anything resembling a personality (passing for deadpan is not an excuse) or simply aren't all that likable. Case in point, the title character, Napoleon himself, a nonconformist socially inept slacker nerd who is both insensitive & oversensitive who, when angered or annoyed, shows himself to be just as cruel & mean spirited as the ""cool people"" (jocks, cheerleaders, bitchy school princesses) who ridicule him. We're meant to sympathize with Napoleon because he either represents us as we were as teenagers or represents someone we knew as teenagers; well, it may be true that he represents how some of us were then or represents people we knew, but that alone does not make him a likable/sympathetic protagonist, even by offbeat anti-hero standards. Most of the time, he's actually a fairly repulsive character, which makes it hard to feel for him even when he's the victim of something undeserved. At one point his own grandmother tells him to ""knock it off"" when he's throwing a temper tantrum over not having an immediate dinner to eat and having to share steak with his Uncle Rico, a grease-ball conman who wishes he could have been a professional football player. Napoleon's pal Pedro lacks anything resembling a heartbeat, and Deb, while cute in her shy girl next door way, is not given much to do either.Gets an extra point for not being overly vulgar or loaded with sexually themed humor, which is hard to find these days, but this episodic film falls like a brick in the ocean. I know all the ""hip"" people will bash me writing this less than positive review, but I really can't recommend this to anyone.",Napoleon Dynamite
69,Rogue-32,"Subversive, subtle, sweet",9,14 June 2004,"Napoleon Dynamite (or DJ Nappy D, as I affectionately have named him) is one of those characters you identify with on so many subtle levels, even if you've never been to Idaho or been an actual geek - he's universally recognizable just the same; we've all felt awkward and frustrated, angry and disenfranchised in our growing-up days (and sometimes we still feel it). This is just one of the many things that makes this film so wonderful. There are the other characters, each of them very sharply drawn and realized - particularly Efren Ramirez as Pedro and the fantastic Tina Majorino as Deb - and there are the situations that these characters find themselves in.Most of the time, when someone tries to write a movie like this (quirky teenagers and/or clueless adults trying to cope), the effort is ultimately done in by contrivance and heavy-handedness. But here, all the situations, as outrageous as they are, always feel organic - growing naturally out of the characters' day-to-day existences. And the tone is consistent throughout - there's not one scene that feels out of place or one line of dialogue that doesn't fit. Another thing I really love about the film is how Napoleon always keeps trying -- no matter how bleak and frustrating his life is (and he knows it), he keeps pluggin' away, slowly but surely; this makes him ultimately endearing, and the film's payoff is brilliantly subtle and subversive, the kind of sweet ending Mike White would come up with (and if you know my reviews at all, you know how I feel about him). Jared Hess, Jon Heder and company can be proud of this one.",Napoleon Dynamite

OK, that place it exists somewhere in the middle of Idaho State, and is there where lives and grows up Napoleon, the protagonist of this film.""Napoleon Dynamite"" has been developed from a 9 minutes film called ""Peluca"", and it's more like a collection of sketches of the most absurd and ridiculous daily life in the American empire. Anywhere you look at there's a pathetic dumb ass waiting for his sad existence to be filmed.Newcomer Jared Hess does not achieve Todd Solondz's brilliance (nor his bad-tempered look) from ""Welcome To The Dollhouse"", and has nothing to do with Harmony Korine and his portraits of deep-America psychos from ""Gummo"". What Hess suggests is much more hilarious, though some times you feel compassion for Napoleon's sorry life. So Jared Hess is more like a character creator than a good cinema director, because ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is a character-based movie: there's no big stories in it, it is just a funny picture of how stupid this occidental society can be.

71,FilmOtaku,"Not so much a film, but a series of events",5,10 June 2005,"I normally begin my reviews with a short summary of the film's plot, but in the case of Jared Hess' ""Napoleon Dynamite"", that isn't easily done. Napoleon Dynamite (Heder) is a high school student who is pretty much the epitome of a dork. He and his adult brother Kip (Ruell) live with their grandmother. When she lands in the hospital due to a farm accident, their Uncle Rio (Gries) comes to live with them. Meanwhile, Napoleon makes a new friend, Pedro (Ramirez) who decides to run for class president, so he works on his campaign while also discovering romance with Deb (Majorino).That summary is about all I can construct out of the action in ""Napoleon Dynamite"", since most of the film is a series of basic situation (a school dance, etc.). Because of this, the film serves more as a weird series of stylish and mildly funny vignettes than anything. Everyone in the film is so garishly styled I got flashbacks to Soundgarden's ""Black Hole Sun"" video where everyone is an extreme caricature of ""regular people"". Though the film had no substance, the style (a weird hybrid of 1970's & 1980's clothes and hairstyles) was intriguing and the mannerisms were mildly humorous.I watched ""Napoleon Dynamite"" with a couple of people, and I found the various reactions interesting: My younger cousins (ages 15 & 12 years old) thought the movie was hilarious because of some of the physical comedy and the mannerisms of the characters, my mother hated it because it was weird, and I kind of liked it because of its strangeness. I have noticed that ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is a polarizing film; most either love it or really hate it. I fall into the small minority who didn't feel either emotion  I thought it was just okay, and while I was fine with watching it once, I'm pretty sure I won't need to see it again. 5/10",Napoleon Dynamite

You will either like the humour or hate it; I think this sort of humour appeals to people in their mid-20s and younger. Think 'Jackass.' The film is not particularly funny, but there are a few memorable lines (ligers, chickens, etc.) and memorable scenarios. It's also pretty low budget, and I found a lot of the film to be dull. I could not watch most of it a second time through; the film started to get on my nerves and bore me the second time through at the dance scene. Overall, it is a pretty wacky film.

Why does the ridiculously named main character have a Pegasus Crossing sign on his door? Why does he have an emu for a pet? Why is ""vote for Pedro"" or god said in a funny voice supposedly hilarious? I don't know and the movie can't seem to get past making jokes of the character's quirky behavior and type appearances.

81,lawprof,"Insipid and Pointless, Colorless and Drab",2,6 August 2004,"With almost five months left until New Year's Day, ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is a sure front-runner for my Worst Flick of the Year award.  Boring and aesthetically tasteless, this insipid but mercifully short film is an example of how an Indie release can garner praise simply because it's there. And caters to cine-fundamentalists who worship at the altar of Independent Films.The lead character is Napoleon Dynamite, no clue as to his name.  Jon Heder plays him with deadly flatness, his lack of affect suggesting not that he's a nerd as much as he suffers from psychosis.  He goes to Preston High School in rural Idaho where his one-dimensional classmates and principal and other hangers-on treat him like a nerd.  But a true nerd has redeeming, often beguiling, features.  It's sad when I watch a character kind of hoping to see him just disintegrate.The story is basically about Napoleon's slow emergence into proto-human guise, a process in which he seeks to escape from his weird family, form a real friendship and - hope of hope - land a girlfriend.  Here the potential sweetheart is Deb who, with her off-center ponytail, acts like she's maintained on powerful meds.The cinematography is as washed out as the story although, to be fair, this part of farmland Idaho is definitely off-putting.  But setting the film in New Jersey wouldn't have helped.Films about teens tend to fall into two categories.  One is aimed at kids themselves and the other as ominous beacons of light alerting adults to the devils amongst us (""Reefer Madness"" is still the best in that category. Really.).  ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is in a third grouping: a movie about high school kids that makes watching paint dry a sound, welcome alternative.I don't know if Heder can act.  He deserves another shot.

82,movieguy1021,Napoleon Dynamite: 6/10,6,6 August 2004,"The 1990s is often sited as the rise of independent film. With that came a lot of offbeat films, some good, some not so good. But all of them experimented with cinema not seen probably since Godard or even Orson Welles. Over the last 15 or so years (and also largely thanks to Miramax), independent films have become more mainstream. They have critical approval, people flock to the theaters, and most don't see eye-to-eye with the critics. Surprisingly, one that does not fit that is Napoleon Dynamite. A film festival favorite and picked up by Fox Searchlight, it drew mixed reviews from critics but, from the audience where I was, everyone loved it. Kind of the reverse, it seems. Again, like the aforementioned movies, I side with the critics with Napoleon.Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder), resident of Preston, Idaho, is an odd sort. He and his family, which consists of computer addict Kip (Aaron Ruell), Grandma (Sandy Martin), and Uncle Rico (Jon Gries), live in a house that, like everything Napoleon has, wears, or does, comes straight out of the 70s and 80s. The film chronicles some time in the life of Napoleon, as his friend Pedro (Efren Ramirez) runs for class president against popular girl Summer (Haylie Duff), his brother and uncle sell worthless products door-to-door, and he may be falling in love with Deb (Tina Majorino). That's what you get when you live in Idaho.What makes Napoleon such an odd film is the title character himself. His huge glasses, wild red afro, and gawky walk add to the epitome of nerd. If there was a kid like this in real life, I doubt he'd live through pre-school. But all of the characters and plot occurrences are complete caricatures, making the whole movie over-the-top and existing in its own alternate reality. This detachment from reality is often used by Wes Anderson (the lack of a recognizable time period, for example, paralleled The Royal Tenenbaums). Therefore, Napoleon is often compared to Anderson movies. I can see that, but this movie, and its characters, stand on their own. Napoleon is such an oddball (with such obscenities as ""gosh"", ""flip"", ""heck"" etc. played to maximum comedic effect) that we can't help but wonder where he's going to go in his journey in his small Idaho town.On the flip side (no pun intended), Napoleon doesn't really have any huge laughs. There's some funny moments, like Napoleon's admiration of Pedro's jump on his bike and his comments to Deb on her milk, but nothing huge. Considering the amount of laughter coming from the audience where I was silent, I could see I was missing out on something. If everyone else understood it, then what was I missing out on? Maybe I was used to Napoleon and co. and didn't find every single thing he did hilarious. Also, as the film's closing down, you can set your watch by what's going to happen. I thought it would go for a more offbeat ending, but it doesn't really. It's a little funny, but still way too predictable for this movie.Heder totally owns the movie here, with his somewhat deadpan, completely over-the-top, completely odd role as Napoleon Dynamite. Why a family would have the last name of Dynamite and name their kid Napoleon is beyond me, but it's completely like his character. His mannerisms, his speech, his looks work completely in sync and create a truly memorable character. Next up on the hierarchy of the acting is Ruell, reminding me of Toby from American Splendor, although his ""transformation"" at the end of the film really annoyed me. It's almost like the easy way out. Diedrich Bader is the largest name in the cast and stars in a few scenes, although I think that with a ""large"" name like that in there, it takes away from the low-budget, independent film feeling that Napoleon has. I'll only remember Bader's career as Oswald from The Drew Carey Show, Lawrence from Office Space and the security guard from Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back.Napoleon Dynamite is not the type of film you'd expect to see at your local multiplex, yet it is. This film gives hope to all of the young nerd out there. No matter how bad things are, remember that you could be Napoleon Dynamite.My rating: 6/10Rated PG for thematic elements and language.",Napoleon Dynamite

84,Mr_Sensitive,Weird But Interesting,7,19 January 2005,"There is a mix feeling after watching this movie (mix review too),Funny- not quite but OK,Fun -it's kinda damn slow,Boring - not really, Good Acting - Good enough and so on.The movie is ""weird"" if you wanted one word answer. The movie did meet with the success in the Box-Office though and that might count if you asked your self if you should watch it or not. The movie is much different than the other movie, example they all wearing and acting like it was 1980's but when it come to music they listen to Jamiroquai and The White Strips. The movie is very dry in every sense - Humor, location, and everything. If you like to watch independence low budget movie then this might be it but if not you will strangle anyone who advised you to watch it. After I have a lot of mix feeling myself and therefore wouldn't advised you on anything.Rating: 7/10",Napoleon Dynamite
85,OriginalMovieBuff21,"Funny, but not as funny as I thought it would be",7,14 February 2005,"I saw Napoleon Dynamite a couple weeks ago and as I finished watching the movie. I thought it was pretty decent. There was a pretty good amount of funny jokes and I thought the best character was Napoleon's brother, Kip. He was pretty hilarious with that gay kind of accent and that scrawny body that acted like he was a ladies man. On the negative side, I just didn't think the movie was too funny. A lot of people saw this movie before I did and they all kept saying all these lines from the movie and it just bugged me and when I saw the movie I knew it was coming and I didn't think it was that funny. The movie was original and that's why I liked it but it was just way too stupid and had no point to it. Overall a decent movie and had funny jokes but needed a little more.Hedeen's Outlook: 7/10 **+ C+",Napoleon Dynamite
86,raypdaley182,What a pile!,1,21 March 2007,"Wow. I haven't seem a film so long with zero plot and nothing happens for such a long time.Basically we're following a short period in the life of major Nerd Napoleon Dynamite. He's tall, lanky and ginger. He meets Pedro and they become friends.And not much happens. Napeleons grandmother goes away leaving his Uncle to watch him and his older brother who is always online talking to a girl in a chat-room (Is she a transsexual?, by the way she rides the horse like a man at the end).Pedro becomes class president with Napoleons help and his brother marries his online chat-room female (who I'm sure is transsexual)",Napoleon Dynamite
87,elicopperman,I Don't Get It,4,6 November 2017,"Let's be honest with ourselves, humor is incredibly subjective. Someone may find slapstick, dark humor or even college door room jokes hilarious, while someone else could prefer political satire or parodies of certain entertainment media humorous. So with that said, today's movie has been seen as a laugh-riot cult classic ever since it came out in 2004, complete with the famous catchphrases like ""Friggin Idiot"" or ""Are you drinking 1% milk cause you think you're fat?"". That being said, as much as I really wanted to like this film, after watching it, my initial reaction was....uh....that was a movie.Look I'm not saying I don't get deadpan humor, as I did find much amusement in Scott Pilgrim, Dr. Strangelove, Rushmore and especially Oh Brother Where Art Thou. However, I think the reason I barely found any of the jokes funny was because they felt like scenes more than jokes, if you catch my drift. Admittedly, some of the catchphrases from the main character are pretty funny and the dojo instructor was amusing enough, but I think this kind of humor would only make elementary schoolers laugh since it's so silly and juvenile (no offense).As for the characters.....honestly, I don't really care about them. I mean Napoleon has his moments, Pedro is likable enough, and again I liked the dojo instructor, but the rest I found either forgetfully bland like Deb and Kip or just unlikable like Napoleon's uncle Rico and Trisha. I know some are supposed to be aggressive or moody, but when I can't find any characters to really root for outside of their remarks, then I'm left bored out of my mind.OK, OK, OK, you're probably wondering. Is there anything I like about Napoleon Dynamite outside of a few catchphrases?....Well the cinematography was pretty decent, I liked the creative opening credits with all the different types of food, and the dance scene was a lot of fun to watch....uh.....Jon Heder was great as Napoleon....yeah that's about it. If you find this movie funny or if it was a big part of your childhood, that's fine, after all, every movie needs love from someone, and even I have movies from my childhood I enjoy even if most of the general consensus doesn't agree with me such as Looney Tunes: Back in Action, Charlie & the Chocolate Factory and Disney's Robin Hood. I'm just not into this like someone else might be, so enjoy all the tater tots and votes for Pedro all you want fans of this movie, just don't include me in it anytime soon.",Napoleon Dynamite

89,PIST-OFF,bored with boredom,1,24 September 2005,"every now and again a film comes along that seems to hit a particular niche with some people and they find it's humor funny in spite of what is generally considered humor. i'd gotten several mentions of the movie Napoleon dynamite, along with assurances and guarantee's that it was ""hilarious"". a minute in and i saw the MTV productions logo and began to worry (which is to take nothing from the wonderful Joe's Apartment) i think a more interesting film would be a film about the people who like this film, and their reasons for it. no attempt is made to evoke any emotion, or like or empathy for any single character in the entire film. what there is of plot (slow and plodding) is also seemingly sabotaged by the directors willful indifference to care whether people care. the characters and plot seem to operate on the level of an unconnected series of events about unlikable characters involving meaningless actions. it fairly reeks of the ""so cool i don't have to care attitude"" of both lead character and director. i'm not even sure about the running time but the film seemed to drag on forever. it's kind of like hanging out with someone who talks endlessly about how boring EVERYTHING is. there doesn't seem to be a point of entry for any emotional response towards any character. the friends of the lead seem as bland and minus personality as wallpaper, the uncle comes across as a huckleberry used car salesman, and even the villains come across not so much evil as much as...... there? why this movie's popularity? maybe if i were younger i'd see the humor, but something tells me that i still wouldn't have thought much of this fifteen years ago. i can only attribute it to some good marketing campaign",Napoleon Dynamite
90,MichaelMargetis,Requiem for a Geek,8,2 April 2005,"Napoleon Dynamite is like the My Big Fat Greek Wedding of 2004. It started out as a tiny little independent film no one had no idea about, and thought was going to suck, and it Did poorly the first couple weeks of release. But, then some people saw how marvelous and ingenious it was, and spread the news, and then by about the fourth week of release it was packed any time you went to see it. I was turned off by the television commercials of Napoleon Dynamite, and the only reason I went to go see it was because my friends were. I was really expecting it to suck, but the movie really didn't. It was to put it in words it was  awesome!Napoleon Dynamite is an inspiring story about an unpopular loser, who overcomes his odds. The film's hero is a kid named  Napoleon Dynamite, and he well if you see what he looks like you know what I mean. He is a very unpopular high school kid, who lies about the kind of girls he gets, draws pictures of Pegasus, and strives to become popular. The film follows him as he deals with his freaky older brother Kip (played by Reno 911's Aaron Ruell), his borderline- pedophilic con man uncle Rico (played by Jon Gries), and his only friend Pedro (played by Efren Ramirez) who Napoleon helps win the school presidential election against the popular cheerleader like girl at school, Summer Daniels.At the beginning it's kind of hard to root for Napoleon because he is very uncomfortable to watch, and for me he reminds me too much of someone I know (except this person isn't smart, or nice BURN). But towards the end I guarantee you he will become your new hero. The performances are very good in Napoleon Dynamite. Jon Heder plays Napoleon with the utmost perfection, I don't know if he really was a nerd in High School or what, but he really makes us believe he is a nerd. Jon Gries is hysterical as Uncle Rico, while a lot of the film's funniest parts involve Efren Ramirez. My favorite character however is Napoleon's older brother Kip played by comic mastermind Aaron Ruell  (you may remember him on Reno 911 as the john who complained about there not being an ""employees must wash hands"" sign in the restroom of a house of prostitution.) In a whole, Napoleon Dynamite really doesn't go anywhere, but it's fun and inspiring if you were ever unpopular in High School to watch. I predict this will be in talks for some awards this year, it definitely will swipe the MTV movie awards. But if you are looking for something to see, see Napoleon Dynamite, you won't be disappointed definitely will swipe the MTV movie awards.

91,departed07,Nerds do have their days,10,4 August 2005,"Being a nerd is never easy, especially if you're Napoleon Dynamite. Jon Heder plays the hero in this little film in which from day in and day out he is picked on by bullies, eats tatter tots during tests, rejected by the beautiful chicks and lives with a strange family including a cousin who not only is thirty-two years old, but chats on the internet everyday trying to meet the perfect somebody. With the departure of Napoleon's grandma who is away on vacation and has an accident, his Uncle Rico is there to stay and makes his life worse and pathetic for his cousin who tries to get him into schemes. Our main hero tries to help a Mexican kid name Pedro, in which like Napoleon, his life sucks as well. He comes from Juarez, Mexico in which he tries to ask the beautiful girl name Summer (Haylie Duff) to the school dance, but is rejected; even the principal discriminates Pedro's customs.There have been many films featuring loser characters in which not only do we identify with them, but we felt for them also. Take for instance ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" in which Dawn Weiner was the middle child who didn't get the attention she deserved (it's common), plus she was in middle school, the worst days for kids, not to mention her last name was Weiner for which kids made references to hot dogs and placed dog pictures in her locker; Harvey Pekar from ""American Splendor"" is more of a guy's loser in which he placed every detail in life into his comic books, not to mention how much he felt as a worthless human being since society prefer people with an education background or good looks; now people have Napoleon Dynamite, another loser we can relate too.The end of the movie made me cheer as I realize that Napoleon does have his days where he helps Pedro defeat the candidate for student body president, not to mention that his cousin gets the girl he wants and his mean Uncle gets the crap kicked out of him. I revealed the ending, but does Napoleon ever get a girl? You have to find out for yourself.",Napoleon Dynamite
92,MikeyB1793,Quirky -wha da ya think!,8,10 September 2014,"This is quirky right from the get go! I loved it.It captures, unlike many, many films, the awkwardness of adolescence, of growing up. Its' got a lot of heart and a lot of little surprises through-out that keep you watching and guessing. And its' comical, off the wall humor is fun to watch. The characters are well portrayed and the dialogue is real. Jon Heder as Napolean is a hoot! It's about friendship – not fitting in but trying to do so. Mostly though it's just finding your own little niche somewhere, someplace. The film has none of the Hollywood high-speed antics that usually characterize this kind of film on teenagers growing up.",Napoleon Dynamite
93,CinematicInceptions,Low budget humor that will make you smile if you don't mind the weirdness of it all.,8,19 April 2015,"Only Monty Python can surpass this movie in low-budget efficiency. I think it would actually have been a much worse movie if it had used a larger budget because we wouldn't get all of those memorable awkward pauses and strange background music. The comedy in this movie doesn't really have to fit your tastes to be funny, mostly because it doesn't really fall into a comedy sub-genre (e.g. slapstick, romantic, action, dark).Napoleon might not be the first person you would have decided to befriend in high-school, but he is likable in context of the film. You can kind of sympathize with him and can laugh at and with him, whether he's getting annoyed, pulling out a great line, making a fool of himself, or just squinting into the camera. Uncle Rico isn't the greatest comedy antagonist ever, but he is pretty entertaining with his cocky voice combined with a southern accent and his dreams of returning to 1982 to be a football star. Pedro generates some memorable scenes and lines without being portrayed as discriminatory or stereotypical towards Mexicans. Deb is in a number of great scenes, but is not really a source of humor herself. Kip is very easy to laugh at since he's a pretty standard loser that sits around online all day and has a speech impediment. He has lots of great lines like his classic ""I guess you could say things are getting pretty serious now."" None of the characters are written with incredible proficiency, but they are funny and have distinct personalities.Since the budget didn't even exceed half a million dollars, there are no groundbreaking executional feats. The camera work and editing is nothing special and is even arguably below average, but in this setting, it can just make you laugh more. The acting is fair, but it's a little bit hard to gauge the performances since you're not entirely sure what emotion or aesthetic the actor is supposed to be conveying. If nothing else, the performances are enjoyable.The comedy in this film can be enjoyed in numerous ways. You can watch the movie all the way through, find select clips on YouTube, pick it up halfway through, or quote it on a day to day basis. It's very quotable even if you didn't like it. The storyline of course isn't great, and there are several scenes that contribute nothing to the larger plot. But the insignificant stakes of the story is another thing that just makes it better.I couldn't say if it's an accurate portrayal of small-town life since I've never lived in that setting, but I rather think it's not that realistic. The small towns in America probably aren't twenty years behind the rest of the nation, but they probably do have lots of very small problems and have people whose perception of current events don't exceed the town council elections (that's not to say that small town people are naïve, only that there is very little that goes on in their lives).Again, it doesn't really fall into any category of comedies, so I don't know what other movies are similar to it. It's a good movie to watch with a group of friends or immediate family since the content is pretty much family friendly throughout.. If you don't mind a nonexistent plot and an overall strange environment, I would suggest giving it twenty minutes and going from there. I can understand if people think that it's just a really stupid film, but I really enjoyed it and regard it as a classic cult movie. Overall Rating: 8.3/10.",Napoleon Dynamite
94,willcundallreview,A good kind of oddness,7,10 October 2015,"What an odd movie, is what everybody who ever see's this says whether it's in a good or bad way. Napoleon Dynamite is a comedy movie independently made by Jared Hess and is a real kind of unknown personnel kind of movie(well it was before it was released), it stars a bunch of people not really too known and made on a very low budget and yet still, this is a good movie. Now I can see why some people say they don't like it and why then some say they love it but I felt it was just likable, I mean it isn't perfect by a long shot but it's a fine little film and it deserves its cult status because it is odd and also oddly fun to watch too. The story takes us into the mind of a young nerdy man called well Napoleon Dynamite, a 16 year old high school student who is kind of unlikeable and doesn't like others really. The plot see's him meet new friends, develop feelings and create a dance (sounds very dull but it's really not) and all this makes him unlikeable and yet really likable as well.The movie is funny there is no doubt but it's not necessarily the writing from Jared Hess and Jerusha Hess that makes the laughs, the physical aspects are fantastic and although they may be easily done, they are effective. This movie is quirky and that's where it tries to draw in audiences and fans because some people want to love a movie that is different and this is very different indeed. It combines a kind of sweet plot with humour and although it maybe tries to use an old formula of movies, it gets every last drop out of that formula and adds the layer of oddness to make it feel and seem much more different.Jon Heder plays Napoleon and although maybe at first I felt he is not great, after a while you realise he completely owns the character and he is kind of incredible in the role, makes himself instantly memorable as Dynamite. Napoleons friend throughout is his ever trustful companion Pedro played by Efren Ramirez who plays his character in a nice way because he makes him one of the most strange but yet again, memorable characters. The characters are truly well chosen and The Hess's create people who aren't people you're likely to come across in real life but yet they feel weirdly familiar though.The movie is funny I think but it isn't always so, I felt the middle going toward the ending was not as good as the start and sometimes this movie does drag, but not enough at all for it to be boring. It's also at times odd for the sake of being odd, you know like it wants to be different but it's too plain to see, tries too hard if you will. Then again though I may sound like I am criticising it a lot but really I'm not, this is one movie where I agree with people who absolutely love it because I see why and plus the characters are easy to love and the story easy to follow yet it makes no sense at all sometimes, a quirky kind of affection for a movie. So Napoleon Dynamite, a cult favourite and a movie that is so successful given the budget but also given how random it is but to be fair as I said, easy to fall in love with. I commend Jared Hess for doing this because I think he showed independent movies can be this successful and it also makes the movie seem more personal because it's not some massive studio behind it, it's simple yet different and that I feel is what Napoleon Dynamite wants itself to be.",Napoleon Dynamite
95,Cinemaniac1984,How can anyone find this movie funny? Did this even have a plot?,1,1 May 2005,"This movie was very unfunny with no plot and a story that just did not connect. It was very hard to find a single humorous moment in this movie. The whole movie was just pointless. Not one bit of the movie made sense. Is there some point to this? I think that this movie just came hollow. I'm still scratching my head as to whether this movie has some significance. I thought the main character was someone with a mental disorder at first. How can anyone find this movie ""side-splittingly funny"". Anyone would think that this would be some direct-to-video junk. This movie has no appeal at all to anyone.

It was probably one of those movies that you saw because you had nothing else to do, but in the end you loved the movie. This movie seemed a little off and different the first time I saw it in the theater. The trailer made the movie look hilarious, so I went with my dad one night to check it out. As I said it was a little strange and different from most movies. I went a second time with my mom and my two second cousins just to let them see it. The second time around I found it even more hilarious and really enjoyed it. From then it became a personal favorite for me. We all got hyped for the DVD release later that year as well.

I highly recommend this movie to any insomniacs, this will put you in a snooze faster than any sleeping pill, thats for sure.1/10 They need to make a 0 because thats what this movie deserves",Napoleon Dynamite
98,diac228,Did I miss the instruction manual to enjoying this film? It was not funny at all,1,8 January 2005,"When the movie was over, I sat there in so much disbelief, I so wanted to return this movie and demand a refund. I sat there for over ten minutes and tried to figure it all out. How can such a boring movie make over 40 million dollars in the box office and also be praised by countless critics? Then again, 2004 was a crazy year, all the bad movies made money (Shrek 2 is the 3rd highest-grossing movie of all time and even Catwoman made over 40 million dollars). Either way, I could not believe just how popular this movie is, I could not figure out why people said it was so good. Was there an instruction manual to enjoying this film somewhere that I did not read prior to watching this? I want the 95 minutes and six seconds of my life back, seriously I do; I deserve something for sitting through the entire thing.Basically, my evening with the movie went like this: I started watching the movie with my dad and my brother; 15 minutes later they got sick of it, five minutes after that I got sick of it and put another movie on. After watching the other movie (Legend of Drunken Master), I decide to give this movie another chance and begin to watch the rest of the film. Halfway through the movie I was chewing at the remote control in anger, I almost fell asleep 20 minutes before the movie was over, and by the end of the film, I felt cheated, I felt like a massive part of my life was wasted away. Enough about my suffering, now its time to mention why this movie was so sour in my opinion, and why it does not deserve the 40 million dollars it has earned in the box office.This movie's boredom can be traced back to the fact that most of the characters in the film have no personality whatsoever. Pedro is the prime example of this. Pedro, (Efren Ramirez), has no personality whatsoever; he looked dead throughout the entire movie. I think the dying snails and slugs in my front yard have more personality and also are more alive than Pedro. Even worse was Napoleon and Pedro's friend Deb (Tina Majorino), who was so boring to watch and listen to. As a matter of fact, the only people that actually had a personality in the film are Napoleon Dynamite himself and his awkward family (Except for Kip). This isn't saying much though. Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder) is a nerd, no doubt about it, but that was about all we knew about him. He displayed no emotion throughout the entire film, you could not tell whether he was happy, sad, or was ready to ram his head against a brick wall. He just was not funny at all, he was boring, like the typical nerd. Besides the uncle (The only good performance in the movie, played by Jon Gries), everyone else and their talent-less skills displayed nothing during the 95 minutes; they were about as colorful as an early 1920s Mickey Mouse cartoon.Jared Hess seemed like he could not build a plot to save his life, so he throws a bunch of different sketches to see if that works instead. The movie runs like a very long Saturday Night Live episode, except funnier (Except for the old SNL episodes, of course), which is still not saying much. The movie was a massive amount of sketches cut so many times you lose track what day it is, what time it is, and it just makes the movie seem even longer. The conversations throughout the film are so boring, lacks emotion, motivation, and the only thing more boring than the conversations is the setting. Set in some place in Idaho, the setting only makes the movie even blander, which probably was made that way as a joke (*insert sarcastic laughter*). Jared Hess also wrote the movie (Alongside his wife Jerusha Hess) and all that was left was for him to play the role of Napoleon. After all, anyone that can memorize lines, dance awkwardly and have a hideous face can become Napoleon. Yes, it requires that much talent. I did not laugh a single time in the movie until the very end, 85 minutes into the film.Bottom Line: Boring, too long, not entertaining at all. I could go on about just how weak this film really is, but I'll just cut this review short because I get a sick feeling in my stomach just talking about it. Napoleon Dynamite is sure to be a cult hit, it already has a cult following, t-shirts with ""Vote for Pedro"" on them are being sold nationwide. Unlike what other critics have thought, this movie is not racist, its just flat-out pathetic. It was an original idea, something that Hollywood has not seen before, but it was poorly written, poorly acted, poorly edited, and poorly done in total. I don't get the big joke of this film; I just don't get it. Napoleon Dynamite: You are whether going to love this movie, or just hate it with a passion.My Score: 0/10",Napoleon Dynamite
99,ttapola,The 1404th Review,3,10 July 2010,"Wow, this movie has almost as many reviews as The Godfather! But I'm reviewing this film as my civic duty, in the slight hope that somebody, somewhere, might read this and decide *not* to see this film. When this came out in 2004, all the promotional material and trailers suggested that this was some weird American success that we Finns would not find amusing at all. So I decided to wait until the day I'd see it for free on TV and today is the day.I missed maybe five minutes from the beginning, but based on the overall pacing and character ""development"", I'm pretty confident I did not miss anything important. I soon found the film an endurance test not unlike the films of Aki Kaurismäki, who is a Finn and enjoys a notable amount of respect in the art-house film circles and is somewhat of a national treasure in Finland. This is funny since most Finns like his films and, on surface, Napoleon Dynamite is somewhat similar in its sluggish pace and minimalism (I'm not a film science student so if I misuse some term, sue me). BUT - I'll have to agree with Roger Ebert's comment that this film ""makes no attempt to make Napoleon likable"" and tries to pass stupidity off as humor, something that the films of Kaurismäki do *not*.Good actors like Jon Grier and Diedrich Bader are completely wasted here and even they failed to make me laugh. I wondered how a film this bad has a relatively good rating, so I took a look at the breakdown. Surprise: the highest average rating (7.3) comes from voters in the ""Aged under 18"" group and the lowest average rating (6.4) comes from the ""Top 1000 voters"" group. Connect the dots. This was a torment, but I endured it to the end, only to be able to say that I judged the film as a whole to be worthy of 3/10.",Napoleon Dynamite
100,theshadow908,"Not bad, but pointless.",6,24 June 2006,"Napoleon Dynamite tells the story of a slow but confident nerd's life in high school and at home with his brother and uncle. He spends his time trying to get people to vote the foreign exchange student into the school council as well as trying to get a date to the school dance. With the hype that surrounds this movie, you'd expect it to be a laugh out loud comedy, but in truth it's not that great, and it only got a moderate chuckle out of me.Napoleon Dynamite is basically a pointless film. It's like Seinfeld in the sense that it's about nothing. This isn't the hilarious comedy that people make it out to be, but that's because the plot isn't funny at all. It's basically just the character that gets the laughs. He says things that are so stupid and random that you can't help but laugh. Nothing that happens in the movie connects to anything else, and it makes the movie seem draggy. However, I did enjoy the social commentary made throughout the film.The acting was alright. Jon Heder was amusing as Dynamite, but all the other characters in the movie were just kind of the same, so the acting wasn't really a stretch.Overall, this movie has an intelligent undertone as well as a few funny moments, but overall it's not as amazing as you've heard.6/10",Napoleon Dynamite

103,NoArrow,"A fresh, terrific film like none before it",10,11 July 2004,"My jaw and my stomach are both in pain, because I just came home from seeing 'Napoleon Dynamite' with some friends. I was surprised that they wanted to see a small, little-known movie with no star in it (other than a short appearance from Diedrich Bader, if you count him as a star), but I guess that just shows how this movie can appeal to anyonewell, anyone who's not anal and has a sense of humor.The plotwell, there is no plot. 'Dynamite' is basically a propaganda film for nerds. Jon Heder plays the title character, a tall, gawky high school student with absolutely nothing on his mind except for his own interests: sketching cartoon animals and playing tetherball with himself. It's not that he's greedy or self absorbed, it's just that he can't really think of anything else to do. He also likes acting rebellious around people, telling them off if they ask him a question.He finds something else to do when a new kid moves to town, Pedro (Efren Ramirez). Pedro is also a nerd, but doesn't really realize it. Napoleon asks him if he's gonna ask anyone to the school dance, he points to Summer (Haylie Duff), the school's most popular girl. He's turned down and Napoleon tells him to ask out another girl, he points to Deb (Tina Majorino), the dorky girl who Napoleon sort of has a crush on. This doesn't create a love triangle, no; Napoleon accepts it because he thinks he's as repulsive as the popular kids think.People have called the character of Napoleon a bad, cruel person. He's not.He's just angry, and he has reason to be. He lives with his brother (Aaron Ruell) who finds dates through chat rooms and his Uncle Rico (Jon Gries), who reminisces of the high school football days, and even tries to buy a time machine off the Internet to transport him back to '82 to win the big game. It's understandable why Napoleon is angry: he thinks his life is inescapably depressing, like there's.He wants it to be happier though, he dreams of finding a girl, and man, does he try. He sketches a picture of a popular girl and sends it to her ('I spent three hours shading your upper lip') and asks Deb to dance. The difference between these girls is that the first is horrified by the thought of going out with Napoleon and the second is insecure enough to like him.Meanwhile Napoleon's brother Kip and Uncle Rico work on get rich quick schemes, Pedro runs for school president (leading to the film's hilarious climax) and a few other things happen, but in truth, the film is a celebration of nerds. It's not necessarily saying that they're better people than the popular ones, it's just showing us how interesting, sweet, and just plain wacky these people are. I thought a happy ending was stretching it a little, but it's dealt with in a way that just seems natural.The acting is great, it's terrific. Each actor is perfect for their character. Heder is joyously monotone as Dynamite; he nails the character on the head. Ramirez, Gries, Ruell and Majorino all reach oddball greatness in their parts. I was even impressed with Haylie Duff, who is brave enough to play a snotty, bad character, something her sister would never, ever do.I've not even mentioned how funny the film was. It was funny. I loved how funny it was, I loved it. I loved how Napoleon stood, I loved how Napoleon talked, I loved how Napoleon ran, I loved how Napoleon dressed, I loved how Napoleon reacted to things, I loved how he drank juice, I loved how upset he got over the littlest things, I loved how he shopped at a thrift store, I loved how he hates his sibling and Uncle because of how pathetic they were, I love how he knows he too is pathetic but doesn't let anyone see it. I also loved how Pedro's facial expression and tone of voice never changed, I loved how Deb did her hair, I loved how Uncle Rico sells Tupperware to get rich to buy a time machine, I loved how no one except Rico showed any emotion, I loved how Pedro shaved his head because his hair was hot, I loved how Napoleon got a job at a hen farm and then got upset that he only gained six dollars, and I loved much, much more. But what I loved most was how every frame of this movie is funny, from the opening credits to the pan out at the end.This movie is terrific, much, much better than ninety-five percent of what's out there now. Don't listen to IMDb on this one, it's so much better than a 6.7. An oddball classic, I give it a well-earned 8/10.",Napoleon Dynamite
104,AishFan,I can't believe I like this movie!,8,19 May 2005,"So I hear every single person raving about this new movie called ""Napoleon Dynamite,"" and I finally go and check it out. The first time I saw this movie, I must admit, I thought it was pretty dumb. Though, everyone is still praising the movie like there's no tomorrow. They all say that it's not that great the first time, but it's awesome after that. So the next logical step obviously is to watch the same movie again. I had such a fantastic time! The whole time I was laughing non-stop with my eyes watering. The humor in this movie is still inexplicable. The random occurrences, as subtle as they are, the unexpectedly long-drawn scenes/one-line dialogues, and just an overall lack of plot, emotions, drama, action, romance, sex, etc. make this a freakin' awesome movie and a laughing riot! Yesssss!",Napoleon Dynamite
105,nobbytatoes,Just Brilliant,10,11 May 2005,"i was abit apprehensive when hiring this movie out but people were saying this movie is just awesome; i have to agree with them. The thing that stuck out from this movie that i thought made it stand out is that its not a movie about a geek or a nerd. during the whole movie did i get a feeling that he was smart; he just looks geeky. In fact he's just a misfit who has hypochondria.This isn't really a movie that pulls out big laughs by doing huge scenes of stupidity. It runs the laughs of small things that roll at a constant pace so you are always laughing, instead of laughing then waiting for the next laugh. If you don't fall to the floor during his dance scene like I did, then there's something wrong with you.In all, you must see this movie, it is just awesome and the funniest movie to come in a long time.If you don't like it, ""Your all a bunch of IDIOTS!""",Napoleon Dynamite

Horrible script and not funny in any sense of the word, Napoleon Dynamite tells the idiotic tale of a young student named Napoleon with no values whatsoever in life. John Heder is beyond dreadful in the role, and the supporting actors aren't much better. From Napoleon's retarded brother to his annoying uncle to his half-retarded aunt, no one in this film is any good at all. This movie has no saving grace, no good points - this film doesn't even have a plot! By all means, stay away from this hideous wreck at all costs.

Yes that was me. Clueless, and Cliché.This is one for the vaults, next to my DVD of Donnie Darko, and Dazed and Confused. I loved this movie, and laughed at every turn.

They kept telling me it was the bomb and that it was the best thing ever, so, powerless, I watched it.The film fails at every aspect. The acting is boring, the jokes are so dry they make the Atacama desert look moist, the soundtrack sucks, there's no plot and the only reason you keep watching is because you think there will ACTUALLY BE AN ENDING, strange considering the film's basically non-opening scene.HAHAHA he mentioned something about lions or tigers or HAHAHA he says ""Sweet"" every 5 seconds or HAHAHA ""Kase-a-dill-a"" or HAHAHA he has some sort of funky dance number. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA THAT'S SOOOOOO FUNNY GET IT!!!!!! This mentioned pattern goes on and on throughout the whole movie and it's just depressing and unfunny. Add to that the annoying keyboard score that manages to make the keyboard on ""Wonderful Christmastime"" by Paul McCartney sound listenable and the annoying ""Vote For Pedro"" fad that has evolved out of this is just embarrassing.This movie is about as funny as that Date/Epic/Spartan/Disaster Movie series (which is not very funny at all) and is just an empty and depressing bore for skinny white boys who a) have thick glasses/beards b) has a music taste that correlates with Pitchfork media c) is in his 20s and owns a fedora as well as considers Tyler Durden his god d) all of the above.

111,jldmp1,Time Machine,7,15 January 2007,"When a filmmaker uses the backdrop of high school, it's clear as to what he's after; going for broad appeal, rather than depth. After all, 90% of us will agree that we hated the four years we put in just as much as Hess did. And it's easy to map the shortcuts to film with shallow stereotypical characters. Music, clothes, hair...shortcuts in time we can all take back to a collective experience.This plainly borrows from ""Revenge of the Nerds"", with only a modicum of the schmaltzy sentiment. The local Idaho bumpkins suggest 'Raising Arizona'. And the central idea of using 'performance' to transform the geek is entirely in line with such period stuff as ""Can't Buy Me Love"", or just about anything by John Hughes.Yes, this is funny, but I can't pronounce it a great -movie-. What's missing is the layer of a 'performance' between us and the movie reality; something so well exploited in, say, ""Better Off Dead"". That movie was so goshdarn funny because of the multiple dissonant perspectives. Here, Napoleon's movie 'reality' is treated as one objective reality; it just happens to be full of hyperbole and exaggeration.",Napoleon Dynamite
112,flingebunt,It's funny because it is true,7,23 February 2005,"Nerd and loser coming of age films have been a staple of American movies since, let's see, Porkies. But these have always been ""hollywood nerds"" and not the real losers we know or are.Napoleon Dynamite wears clothes that are wrong in the way only a real loser could wear. It isn't that what he is wearing is wrong, but on him it sometimes doesn't look quite right.OK, so he is a loser, but unlike other loser movies he doesn't want to stop being a loser. He wants a girl, he wants people to stop destroying his life and he wants someone to play tether ball with him (surely this is the greatest metaphor for the search for a soul mate I have ever seen).Nothing is ever over done in this movie. There are bullies, but they are just like the typical bullies at school. They don't do anything amazingly innovative in their bullying, just like real bullies.The town is dull, sometimes boring, sometimes ugly, sometimes beautiful, just like any real town.His journey is nothing special. He likes a girl, can he get her to go out with him. His friend needs his help, can he help him. His uncle is ruining his life, can he survive until his uncle leaves.The movie is made in the style of student movies, not art house. The characters, the opening and the direction is common in student short films. There is nothing pretentious in the way it is done.It rises above this by the attention to detail. It is that Napoleon and those who surround him do normal things in a loser way (including those snow boots, which is the hottest fashion in China where I live, even in southern China where it is 20 degrees in winter....aaahhhh).What makes the characters so likable is that they are themselves and it is a celebration of being yourself. When they succeed, they succeed as themselves, and where they fail they are not being themselves.At the end of the day it is a nice little film and enjoyable for anyone who can get into the characters.",Napoleon Dynamite
113,I_Am_The_Taylrus,"Wow, What A Nice Surprise (SPOILERS)",9,6 June 2007,"SPOILERS I really had no interest into seeing Napoleon Dynamite, but my friends kept on saying it is terrific and funny so I finally so it. Well, my friends were right! This is a great movie. Strange, original, weird, and I loved it. Napoleon is also probably one of the most original characters I have seen in years. The only major concern I have about this movie is the PG rating. It was way too risqué at times to be PG. It should have been PG-13. I mean, one of the prime examples is Bust Must. I think that kind of pushed the limit.Here is the plot. Napoleon Dynamite is a sarcastic, geeky teen living in Idaho. He has a strange family. His uncle a steak-eating guy who tries to make money selling pointless items, his brother Kip has a cyber-girlfriend, and his grandma is a dare devil that broke her coccyx. Napoleon then meets Pedro Sanchez, and Deb. The school dance is coming closer and Pedro and Napoleon have to find dates. Pedro goes with Deb, and Napoleon goes with Trisha Stevens, a girl who ditches him right after the dance starts. Pedro then decides to run for student body president, but the odds of winning are limited because Summer, a popular ditzy blond girl, is also running. Napoleon helps Pedro run, Then, the day of the speeches, Summer is a crowd pleaser, suggesting soda machines. Pedro does not do too well. Then Napoleon dances for everyone. Everyone bursts in applause and Pedro wins.Overall, this is a fun, strange, and an original film to watch. It gets boring and over-the-top at times but there are some many funny moments that I just could not give this film an eight, yet I can not give it a ten, so a nine is great. Oh, and by the way, stick after the credits for an additional scene. If you can not wait that long, it involves Kip and his cyber-girlfriend getting married. Anyway, this is a silly, funny, and good film to watch if you are in the need for a good chuckle.9/10Recommended Films: The Breakfast Club.",Napoleon Dynamite
114,Greatornot,Rises to Great Heights,9,24 August 2009,"This is a low budget film that truly gets it. It does not take a zillion dollar budget to make a fantastic film, nor does it take megastars. What it takes is determination,hard work and plenty of creativity. Like the baseball team that has the state of the art stadium, glitz but no heart, this is the small market team or the little league team that does it for the love of the game so to speak. This movie, was a movie written for the love of cinema art. On the surface, I thought I would be getting a typical , silly HS flick, and that would have been OK. You know what I am talking about. A film with plenty of slapstick humor, silly pranks, plenty of f-bombs and of course those few scenes of gratuitous nudity of a 'legal' age girl playing a teen. I did not get that and I was not even disappointed. I got a coming of age film of awkward teens that were outcasts that somehow managed to bond together while battling the antics of their dysfunctional,somewhat poverty stricken family structure. This was a movie of rising above it all and experiencing the impossible. Middle town rural America exposed as a lifeline for all sorts of emotions and impossibilities. Every character was likable. Even the so called bad characters were truly not that bad, and the good characters had a certain amount of superiority and smugness that we can come to love,and even laugh at including Mr. Napoleon Dynamite. Perhaps the most monotone character to ever be interesting in a flick filled with monotone characters. Robots in action, but it worked. Granma , Cousin Rico,LaFawnda just added to the fraternity of a movie filled with misfits... but lovable misfits.Napoleons older brother seemed to be the only one that took advantage of modern technologies. Otherwise I would not know the year. A Social internet geek but socially retarded, just another interesting character to fill out this film. Never count anyone out of life. That is the moral I got out of this wonderful flick. This is true cinematic art. Everyone gave their heart and soul to this project and it worked by being different. I Vote for everyone, not just Pedro, that was involved with this film.",Napoleon Dynamite
115,refresh_daemon,A cute little film,7,26 September 2006,"I've heard a lot of praise for this film and a lot of people telling me that it's a love-it-or-hate-it sorta movie. Well, I have to say that I like it. I don't love it, but I definitely like it.This is one absurd film. It takes the high school outcast comedy and ratchets up the quirkiness a couple notches. The story is simple and not particularly potent, but serves its purpose in propelling the film and allowing for an endless stream of gags and comedic dialogue.From the very start of the film, using The White Stripes' ""We Are Going To Be Friends"" shot against food imagery utilizing the best in late 70's early 80's decor, you can tell that this is going to be a different kind of film. And throughout the film, everything is kept simple. A lot of the comedy comes at the expense of all the films quirky characters and their antics. From Napoleon's nerdy internet-chat-rooming older brother to his naive new best friend Pedro, Napoleon's world is blanketed by characters that take the traits of the socially inept high school student and move it up a level for comedic effect.And the effect is cute. It's not laugh out loud funny, but smirk inducing. Most of the gags and jokes work well and are memorable enough that they stay in your head afterward. (Especially a mindblowingly well choreographed dance sequence that just looks off enough that it's also funny.) But this is not an epic film. This is not a belly busting comedy. This is not supposed to be a film that will remain as a cinematic masterpiece of filmic humor. This is Napoleon Dynamite. A cute little film about a handful of kids in Idaho and their lives. I don't like how the film quickly wraps up all the different characters' story lines and allows for development (for most of the supporting characters) without a whole lot of conflict. I do wish that the story concentrated more on who Napoleon is rather than what he does. But these are little quibbles on a movie that's fairly effective.So, Napoleon Dynamite is a watchable film, as long as your expectations are set appropriately small. It might even be funny. And that's the way I like it. 7/10.",Napoleon Dynamite
116,luke-a-mcgowan,Beloved cult film,10,21 February 2016,"Napoleon Dynamite will never age thanks to its early-2000s setting and delightfully retro costumes and props. Everything from Napoleon's brown three piece suit to Deb's homemade clothes to the daggy school uniform screams old-fashioned and just makes everything so funny to look at. Everything in Napoloeon Dynamite just adds up to make the whole product funnier, to the extent that I don't believe anyone involved intended it to be that way.Case and point, the performances in Napoleon Dynamite simultaneously require the most and least effort required of any cast. Many of the actors simply sit and wait for their turn to be the focal point of a scene. In any other movie, it would stand out as a flaw. Because of the personalities of the characters, their vacant expressions in the background make everything even funnier. John Heder's performance as Napoleon is absolutely classic - Napoleon's inability to pick up on social cues (both good and bad) makes his social isolation easy to absorb. We are never busy feeling sorry for Napoleon but we are utterly delighted by his successes. Every single character in the entire film is flawlessly acted and cast (from the beautifully sweet outcasts Deb and Pedro to the popular kids Summer and Don to Napoleon's wacky family). Deb is utterly adorable, a perfect foil for Napoleon. Rico is one of the sleaziest characters ever put to the big screen. The screenplay by the Hess brothers is absolutely hilarious, with no real overarching story but rather a series of hilarious skits. A lot of the movie's payoff comes from small plot elements introduced only slightly beforehand. The screenplay is full of so many quotable lines, and with dry delivery from every single character, the lines are even funnier. Jared Hess makes some great artistic decisions, like showing the unpopular kids during Summer's self- indulgent speech. The music reinforces the film's mood with its tacky synthesised organ sounds.I utterly love this movie for everything it does and represents. It provides me a great deal of faith in Hollywood, knowing that films that are good will eventually be seen because word of mouth is a powerful thing.",Napoleon Dynamite
117,OldAle1,Being nerdy and weird is so cool.....or is it?,5,20 September 2007,"OK, first of all, this is got heavily compared to the films of Wes Anderson, especially his little-seen first film, ""Bottle Rocket"". Fair enough, I guess, though the losers and nerds in this film don't seem to have (or strive to have) anything like the charisma that Anderson's have, and the plot is of far less significance than ""Bottle Rocket""'s.So what? I have to say off the bat I'm not the biggest Wes Anderson fan in the world...I've liked all of his films, especially ""Rushmore"", but they all seem to me in some ways to thrive on their own insignificance; it's one thing to focus on the small conversations and the weird, colorful people in life, it's another to build whole films about it. Worked for Seinfeld on TV in 22-minute intervals, but I'm not sure it does in film. Anderson does transcend that geek-worship to a certain extent. Harris, in his first feature, does not.I've had enough of the lovable geeks and spazzes I must tell you. In fact, this is a hard film for me to critique in any ""objective"" way (as if criticism should strive for objectivity), because I was a geek in high school, college, and...well I still am. But I wasn't the outrageous, nutso, generally unselfconscious loon like Napoleon (Jon Heder); rather I was one of the many faceless weaklings that get pushed into lockers or half-nelsoned into giving up their lunch money. And it changed me, soured me about much of life, something which hasn't changed all that much. The pretty boys and the cool kids get all the girls and the glamour; the smart kids and the weirdos get laughed at and mostly are alone. That's the reality, for most of us. So it's tough for me to really appreciate films like this that in some way glamorize the geek experience and involve improbable happy endings (old brother Kip meeting ghetto glam queen LaFawnduh on the 'Net and finding true love). It just all seems unreal and phoney to me, and I suppose the argument ""but it's a movie"" just doesn't hold water anymore.It would help if the pacing weren't at times glacially slow, if there was more inventive use of technique...but I think the filmmakers aren't interested in that, it's a distraction from their characters' lonely lives. There's no camera movement at all, and many shots involve a single character in a lonely, forlorn setting of wide plains with far-away mountains (the film was shot in Idaho). Though this is an interesting conceit at first (stasis and loneliness), it gets a little boring and obvious by the end.Why talk about the plot? You've seen it a million times; weird spazzy kid tries to gain acceptance despite uncompromising outsider status, finally does so through improbable friendships and odd turns of events ... stereotypes are generally obvious and hackneyed, and much of the weirdness is played for it's own sake; there aren't many real characters here.And yet, I liked Jon Gries' Uncle Rico quite a bit, though he's as typical (ex-football star living in the past, coming up with crazy money-making schemes) as most, and some of Napoleon's dialogue is so over-the-top angry at his world that I found myself at times identifying in spite of myself. And that dance sequence after his friend Pedro's awkward speech at the class president nomination...brilliant. So it's not all bad. I think it was just too close to home, and I just wasn't in the right mood for it. Which is why this review is a little too personal, a little too scattered, and probably not very meaningful.",Napoleon Dynamite

Am I the only one who thought this or was it just because Napoleon's brother was so wimpy that even a woman seemed more masculine than him? Maybe it's just because I'm not used to the actress involved, but to me that added another layer of humor to the movie imagining what that honeymoon would be like!! Kind of made me think of the ending in Some Like It Hot...Joe E. Brown didn't seem to mind and maybe neither would this guy!

121,revival05,Another step in the wrong direction,6,2 March 2006,"This has got to stop. If the future of American, independent cinema will continue as it has during the last five-ten years, we are looking at the judgment day of substance and, forgive me for using the term but, quality. NAPOLEON DYNIMATE has been talked about by virtually everybody I have come into contact with and after reading reviews and seeing some photos from it I just went 'sigh'. I am fed up with shallow, hyped up and pretentious films labeled as ""independent"" and with the exception of directors Alexander Payne and, maybe, Todd Solondz (though by STORYTELLING and PALINDROMES, I started to feel like I was watching the same movie over again) and the mega-hyped-up LOST IN TRANSLATION (by the oh-so-independent daddy's girl Sofia) I can't stand the climate of the realm where Hollywood cannot reach. I have even avoided every chance to see GARDEN STATE because I know how empty it will be.Now, it might seem stupid to compare Jared Hess to Todd Solondz. Fair enough. Nevertheless, they are part of the same wave of independent films and Hess and his likes are the more and the lesser. ""Napoleon"" has hurled two voices. The public opinion seems to be, and I quote another speaker, that the film is ""quirky for the sake of being quirky"". Then we have the people who enjoy the humor, the students, and have no problem with this, and furthermore we have the people who see no steps away from Adam Sandler, which have to be the academics. Personally, I feel that all of these films (from GHOST WORLD to DONNIE DARKO and even ""bigger"" films like American BEAUTY) show sharp satire towards the idea of the ""American dream"". ""Napoleon"" is full of people with big dreams that have got them nowhere and their environment is full of quacks that have zero intellect but are socially immune and more or less ""sucessfull"". I won't talk of that aspect for the sake of nothing though, since ""Napoleon"", in that aspect, is even tiresome in it's obvious portrayal of the white trash geek-community. Instead I'll just say that I laughed pretty much for the first 20 minutes, got a bit bored in the middle, and liked the characters enough to smile towards the end. Fine.Still, I can't help but compare this film to the film I watched prior to it, which was Wes Craven's 1972 zero-budget, horror(terror)-film debut LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT. It is really hasn't got anything in common with Jared Hess' film and in addition it has been called a whole bunch of things, I will not take that debate here, but it was shocking, had an edge with the intent of breaking the convenient norms and it hammered in as a wild force of youth and originality into the film arena. And the fact remains, you can't say the same for NAPOLEON DYNAMITE.",Napoleon Dynamite
122,anhedonia,Mostly unfunny,1,12 September 2004,"After reading rave reviews on this site, I expected ""Napoleon Dynamite"" to be a side-splittingly funny movie about social misfits and teen alienation. What I found instead was a sporadically mildly amusing film with too many forced moments that don't add up to much.Writers Jared Hess (who also directed) and Jerusha Hess obviously found inspiration in the films of Todd Solondz and Wes Anderson. But here's the difference between their films and the Hesses' work - Anderson and Solondz are better storytellers and, more often than not, create unique characters, original moments and funny dialogue. The Hesses strain too much to be quirky and nothing much works in their film.The film occasionally elicits a few smiles rather than constant laughs. No one laughed during the screening I attended. The problem is the characters' eccentricities all seem like affectations; nothing seems original or natural. It's as if the Hesses are saying their characters are funny simply because they're quirky. Rural Idahoans couldn't possibly be this uninteresting.I love droll, deadpan stuff. But there needs to be something funny, some wit that comes along with that. And the characters need to be interesting. Simply making someone an oddball doesn't necessarily make him funny. Honestly, there's no one in this film we haven't seen in one form or another in countless other (funnier) high school films. Jon Heder's titular character turns rather unbearable as the film wears on. It's not Heder's fault he's given a dreadfully one-dimensional person to play. Asking him to speak intolerably mundane lines in a dreary monotone doesn't make him funnier.Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) quickly grows tiresome as he keeps repeating the same shtick. It wasn't all that amusing to begin with and loses any appeal within minutes. Even Kip's (Aaron Ruell) metamorphosis, which should be funny, isn't explored with any clever comedic skill.""Napoleon Dynamite"" has an occasional chuckle or two - Kip rollerblading and Uncle Rico's online purchase. But the laughs are infrequent. However, it's refreshing to see a high school comedy not relying on bodily functions for jokes. If you want to see a truly funny film about social misfits, rent last year's ""American Splendor."" And for quintessential droll wit, watch the Ealing comedies, ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"" and Alexander Mackendrick's ""The Ladykillers.""""Napoleon Dynamite"" joins ""Connie and Carla,"" ""Along Came Polly"" and the Coens' ""The Ladykillers"" as one of the dumbest and least funniest comedies of the year.",Napoleon Dynamite
123,tributarystu,"One from the heart, I s'ppose",6,16 July 2005,"It's hard to be fair with movies as bizarre as this one. After the first twenty minutes I was convinced I had wasted some serious seconds of life, actually three hundred more than during the weekly football matches. I wouldn't want to say it was ""lucky"" that I went on with the film, because it was bound to happen one way or the other. Don't ask why. The great thing is, I was actually glad to do it. At least a bit...So my problem is rather simple to pinpoint: in trying to portray the total loser ""Napoleon Dynamite"", the film is so borderline to the pathetic and the absurd that it nearly becomes unbearable. However, soon enough, a rather enjoyable character pops up - Uncle Rico - which simply pulsates with life and a certain ""normality"". What I believe struck me as pleasant was the fact that I could finally see a believable, somewhat traditional, character. Someone to whom I could relate the other guys, because they seemed so other-worldly.Once Rico takes his place into the world, you can actually put the plot into some perspective. It all makes sense, although Napoleon, Pedro, Deb and the other terribly weird characters seem a bit exaggerated. Ultimately, there is something to get, which is really good and important. Everyone has his place in the world and no matter how strange you may seem, there's probably (definitely) someone for you...somewhere. Of course, chance was the appropriate people were around each other, which isn't necessarily valid for the real world, but even in such cases...you've got the wondrous internet, how amusing!""Napoleon Dynamite"" is, in a nutshell, a film about people who are different fitting into this ""normal"" world. And Napoleon is so great because he proves that everything is possible when there aren't any inhibitions, when you just do what your heart wants you to. That's a sweet way to see it and you can't look beyond the cheerful optimism. It's healthy to see joyful and honest films.",Napoleon Dynamite
124,mirosuionitsaki2,"Funny, Unique, Not A Low Budget!",8,23 July 2007,"Got tired of this movie, but I liked it before. So I won't give it a bad rating. This movie was funny, random, and just really.. strange. The style of this movie is just so unique. You can't really find this in other movies. It seems like it was a low budget movie when actually this movie cost millions. But that doesn't mean I'm saying the movie is bad.Napoleon Dynamite meets someone named Pedro. Pedro wants to run for school president. He cant because no one likes him and no one really knows him. Then he has to have a dance after his speech or something. Napoleon decides to do that dance you all know and love and then run away. People go crazy and cheers! Napoleon's uncle or brother or both start selling kitchen items for money so Napoleon's brother can bring his online girlfriend down to where they live. They did and they get married. It's wonderful.I recommend this movie for everyone, well, 13 and up.",Napoleon Dynamite
125,paudie,Funny but not much of a story,7,19 January 2009,"This film is undoubtedly funny. There are some very funny scenes and lines it. However the fact that there is no plot to speak of made me enjoy it a bit less.Examples of the good scenes- Napoleon towing the ""rollerblading"" Kip into town with his bike- Trisha's reaction as she opens Napoleon's portrait of her- Uncle Rico's quarterback videos and many more. Plenty of funny characters as well - Napoleon (good at heart but perhaps his own worst enemy as well) Kip and Rico (both a bit sad),Grandma etc.Overall the film like a series of almost unrelated funny events. It seems the writers couldn't or wouldn't take the time to construct a coherent plot to join the funny scenes together. Films like Superbad (and even American Pie) also had unlikely scenes played purely for laughs and goofy characters but were also backed by a decent storyline.Final verdict - good not as funny as it could have been.",Napoleon Dynamite
126,rparham,Odd but funny,8,29 September 2004,"Lovers of cinematic oddities, unite and worship at the feet of Napoleon Dynamite. The film that received raves at Sundance is now available for general public consumption, and it's quite the odd meal, let me tell you. But, despite being odd, it is riotously funny at times, so while you might find yourself occasionally scratching your head, you'll often be laughing while you do it.Napoleon Dynamite is not only the title of the film, but also the name of it's central character, played by Jon Heder. Napoleon is like the prototype for the American teen nerd. Tall, lanky, with a shock of curly hair, over-sized glasses, and a perpetual open mouth, Napoleon follows the beat of a different drummer, that's for sure. He keeps mostly to himself and when asked a question, will often respond with a statement of resentment for those asking the question, followed by a long, deep sigh. Napoleon lives with the oddest assortment of individuals I have ever seen assembled for a film that is supposed to exist in the 'real world.' His brother Kip (Aaron Ruell) is even more a social outcast than Napoleon, spending his days chatting with a long-distance girlfriend online and studying to be a cage fighter, despite an outward appearance that suggests that he wouldn't last more than about 0.01 milliseconds in the ring with even the most inept professional fighter. Napoleon and Kip live with their grandmother, who early in the film is felled while riding on a dune buggy and are left in the care of their Uncle Rico (Jon Gries). Rico is perpetually stuck, mentally, in 1982 and his senior year of high school, where his possible football career path went awry, and he now spends his free time tossing footballs while recording himself with a video camera. Rico has decided to earn big money by selling multi-piece Tupperware sets to the locals, moving on later to breast enhancement products. Meanwhile, Napoleon has befriended a new arrival at the school, Pedro (Efren Ramierez), who appears to be about as closed up as Napoleon, but makes a few strides towards ingratiating himself with his classmates, by asking a popular girl to the school dance and running for class president. He eventually asks out Deb (Tina Majorino) to the dance, who seems to have eyes for Napoleon, though, and the two spend time dancing together. If the above plot description seems rather slim, it's because Napoleon Dynamite isn't much of a plot driven film. It seems to exists primarily to feature vignettes of Napoleon going through his daily grind: he drags action figures tied to a string behind the bus on the way to school, he gets abused by the more popular students, feeds his Grandmother's pet lama, studies the latest dance moves from an instructional videotape and generally survives whatever fate throws in front of him. You could call Napoleon Dynamite a teen angst comedy, and if that is so, then Napoleon is the angstiest teen I have ever seen. He seems to live in his own little world, drawing fantasy creatures on his notebook and describing their uses for magic to anyone who listens. He appears oblivious to the world around him, and his place in it.In fact, most of the characters in Napoleon Dynamite seem to be from another plane of reality. They all gaze with an empty stare, mouths open, until they issue another line of dialogue in a relatively flat, monotone voice. Rico is a little more energetic, but he exudes the charm of a sleeze on the make, and the supporting characters are barely on screen enough to register.The main characters, Napoleon and Pedro, are borderline dim-bulbs who seem to be inept at the basic social skills, but not inept in realistic ways. As written by Jared and Jerusha Hess, their choices are exercises in puzzlement. I will admit I have no clue how to approach women either, but whatever ideas I might cook up seem more likely to work than the half-brained schemes these two hatch.Despite seeming based on characters from an alternate reality, Napoleon Dynamite is nothing if not funny. Most of the humor is derived from Napoleon's antics; his very basic mannerisms and voice are at times hilarious. He sometimes starts sentences quick as lightning (One character asks him a question, to which his response is 'HECK YES!') before returning to his glaze-eyed stance, and his dialogue is often riotous (Pedro asks Napoleon what would make him a good president, and after telling him, relates why he himself doesn't have what it takes 'I don't have good skills.Like nun-chuck skills, bow-hunting skills, hacking skills.'). Napoleon Dynamite also has a core of sweetness at it's center. It's obvious that Deb has feelings for Napoleon, despite his complete lack of awareness, Kip and his long-distance girlfriend are very much in love even with both geographic and race differences, and even Rico makes some inroads with a potential client. It may not exist in the real world, but it isn't without it's charms. If you enjoy films that are a little left of field or that are not afraid to break the boundaries of average cinema, and you are looking for a good laugh, then Napoleon Dynamite should be your cup of tea.",Napoleon Dynamite
127,brianberta,Very forgettable and unfunny,2,4 February 2015,"I never saw it at the theater. My school was going to show it though and considering what my friends thought of it, I was highly excited. It didn't deliver on its promise. I don't get the hype over this movie. People keep praising how funny it is but none of the jokes stuck at all and they all fell flat. Most of its comedy is shock value which can be funny at some times but that's all this film consists of. The plot is unoriginal and it's nothing special. It didn't interest me at all. I just found it to be a clichéd school drama with bits of unoriginal forced comedy thrown in. It had poor camera-work and the acting was too bland. When I saw it that day, there was this scene where Napolean slapped someone in the face and he ran to a door because someone rung the doorbell. Simply slapping someone is not creative in the slightest in terms of comedy aspects but everyone started laughing. All I can praise it for is that it'll likely appeal to most younger kids. I found this to be a forgettable comedy movie and it left no impact on me.",Napoleon Dynamite
128,ScottDMenzel,"A funny, original film loaded with a lot of laughs, originality, and most important weirdness.",8,21 June 2004,"There comes a time, usually once a year when a film is released that really surprises the crap out of me without me being aware of it. What I mean by that is seeing a film that I didn't really think was going to be that good but ended up loving it! This year so far that film is Napoleon Dynamite.Napoleon Dynamite is a movie mainly about characters. The movie stars newcomer Jon Heder (Napoleon), who is the weirdest kid in Idaho, and each year as Napoleon goes to school he hates it more and more because he is different from everyone else. Napoleon's entire family is also weird. Napoleon lives with his Grandma (Sandy Martin) who loves to go dirt bike racing and loves her pet llama. Napoleon's brother Kip (Aaron Ruell), is a 31 year old, who does nothing more than spend endless about of time on the Internet talking to his girlfriend LaFawnduh. With no support at home, Napoleon becomes friends with Pedro (Efren Ramirez) who is a new foreign exchange student at the school. Napoleon and Pedro becomes friends because they are both outcasts. They also team up with Deb (Tina Majorino) who is the female outcast at the school and together they form a unique friendship. The movie only gets better as it goes along as Pedro decides he wants to run for president of the school against the popular cheerleader Summer (Haylie Duff, yes Hilary Duff's sister). A lot of laughs, weird moments, and originality ensue as Napoleon Dynamite continues its 85-minute running time.The casting in Napoleon Dynamite was just terrific. Newcomers played all the main roles and once again this film proves that you don't always need million dollar budgets and a ton of big name stars to create a good movie. Jon Heder was great as Napoleon. I loved the character Napoleon, I felt for him, he was an outcast but was very unique. I loved how he lived in this fantasy world creating these things that only he knew about like his drawings of the liger, which is a mix of tiger and a lion. Napoleon was a mix of Max Fisher from Rushmore and any oddball outcast character from the normal teen movies. Efren Ramirez was also a great pleasure to watch on screen as Pedro. It was so funny watching him and Napoleon struggle with fitting in at school and being different. The character really fit in with the rest of the oddball cast. Aaron Ruell who played the brother was also very funny in his role. He fit the mole of the perfect loser 31 years old virgin who does nothing more than spend hours upon hours on the Internet. His character reminded me a lot of Andy Dick's character on the TV show 'Newsradio'. Tina Majorino was also very good as Deb, the film's only female outcast. She fit in with Napoleon and Pedro as this whole bizarre group of friends. The film was written and directed by Jared Hess. This newbie director/writer knows something about creating a film that is unique and original. His vision of the World of Napoleon Dynamite was one in which I was very amused with. His idea of making the film in the late 80's to early 90's setting fit in with the weirdness of these characters. The angles in which he shot the film were interesting to say the least. The location of the film, shot entirely in Idaho was brilliant. Who the hell shoots a film in Idaho? No one. I think the location worked out for the film, it was like this farm town where the people seemed to be behind in the times. The script was great although there wasn't much of a plot but it was mainly about characters and developing them. Which was done flawlessly, I must add. I think the dialogue on this film was terrific with a lot of memorable quotes and scenes. One of my favorite scenes in the film was where Pedro and Napoleon first met and Napoleon asks Pedro about his bike. 'It's a sledge hammer,' Pedro responds and then it flashes to a scene where Napoleon and Pedro are taking turns riding the bike off Sweet Jumps as Napoleon states. There are a lot of really funny scenes in this film all of which that are rather unique or original in there own way.I really loved Napoleon Dynamite, which was a surprise to me. I was hooked on the film from the opening credits to the end. I loved the opening credits sequence. How many films can you actually say that you enjoyed watching the credits roll by at the beginning, not too many! Well this film was a hit at Sundance because of the more sophisticated audience that enjoys creativity. The theater at which I seen the film was a theater I normally hate however the audience seemed to rather enjoy it. I see this film becoming a success like Saved! the only other film I have seen this year and really loved. I think it will expand in more theaters soon but I am sure like Saved! has done to some will go right over the heads of a normal theater going audience. Napoleon Dynamite is a funny film with weirdo characters but if your some one like me who enjoys these weird characters like Napoleon Dynamite, Max Fisher from Rushmore, and several other outcast characters then you will probably love this film as well. Just don't go into the film expecting a lot of thought provoking moments and a well-developed plot because that isn't what this movie is about, this movie is about characters and that's pretty much the bottom line. My rating for Napoleon Dynamite is an 8/10.",Napoleon Dynamite
129,Hancock_the_Superb,What's So Great About This Movie?,4,6 September 2005,"Since it came out last summer, ""Napoleon Dynamite"" has become something of the latest cult movie, gaining a loyal and very vocal/visible cult following among the usually-tasteless Goth/punk set. It seems that, even now, over a year after its release, you can't go one day without seeing a ""Vote For Pedro"" shirt or hearing an idiotic Napoleon impersonation.This is definitely a love-or-hate movie, and I will say that I do not HATE it - I simply don't like it. I didn't think this movie was at all funny, which may be surprising considering that I am quite a Napoleon-esquire nerd myself. But I don't hate the movie itself - I hate the obnoxious fan base.I would give a detailed review of this not-so-hilarious film, but I'd be wasting my - and your - time. So let's give this misbegotten fad a generous four stars and be done with it.",Napoleon Dynamite

No suspense or any other reason to watch these pathetic characters. No story or plot. What it HAS is despicable characters, retarded situations, and a repulsiveness far beyond imagination.This movie is like a piece of snot hanging from a wino's nose; sickening to view, almost as sickening to think of even after you've looked away.

131,ArizWldcat,Grandma called...she said you're ruining everyone's life...,7,3 July 2004,"I am so glad ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is out in theaters now--we couldn't get tickets at Sundance, and I wanted to see it then! I've read comments saying that the younger the audience, the more appreciative. Hmmm...I am 40 something, and I took my 16 and 9 year old daughters. There were people of ALL ages in the theater, and I heard many many people laughing their heads off. Maybe part of its appeal was that it's set in Southern Idaho, which might as well be Utah. (We live in Utah and are NOT part of the dominant religion here..but we've grown to love our neighbors!) Part of the film's charm for me was understanding the quirkiness of some people who live here. I've read comments from people who are confused about WHEN the film takes place...there's an old saying by those of us who live in Utah (and Idaho might as well be part of Utah) ""Welcome to Utah, now set your clock back 10 years""...it indeed does take things a few years to make it up here to the sticks!! And the uncle who was stuck in '82 was SUCH a hoot! What a smarmy creep he was! There were so many laughs in this movie, I don't know which part I liked best. I've read reviews from people like Roger Ebert who say that we are laughing AT Napoleon, Deb, and Pedro because we feel superior to them, and therefore, that's why people enjoy this film. I disagree with that. I found Napoleon and his friends to be likable underneath their nerdiness, and I was rooting for them the whole time. I do believe there's a valid comparison of this movie with ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"". Funny, I don't remember the oh-so-intellectual reviewers having a problem with THAT movie having a supposed lack of storyline (For the record, I saw WTTD, and enjoyed it...but I thought THIS movie was actually better...it was more uplifting, while ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" was rather dark and more than a bit sadistic.) And as far as that goes, I don't think this movie lacked a storyline, as the director allowed for good things to happen to Napoleon at the end of the film. I found it to be heartwarming. I'll agree that this isn't for everyone, but it was very funny and I think it deserves a look.",Napoleon Dynamite
132,kyle-cruse,"Funny, unique movie",9,28 August 2008,"""Napoleon Dynamite"" is simply a film you will either love or hate. I rarely see anyone who is in-between. Personally, I happen to be someone who loves this film, but I really can't blame anyone who doesn't like it. The film is not for everyone, but I'll do my best to explain why I find it funny. For one thing, this film has what all great comedy needs: timing. All of the scenes at this movie come at just the right time, and the characters wait just long enough to act or react in order to give the element of surprise and get the most laughs out of the audience. The film may seem very random to the audience at first (which does provide many of the laughs, with unexpected material being placed in the film for no other reason than to make us laugh). However, several viewings will prove that everything does have somewhat of a purpose in the film, no matter how small. The film is really not trying to convey any type of message. This is strictly a just-for-fun type of movie. I personally know many kids, teens, and adults who are fond of this film, so it is not necessarily for any particular audience. ""Napoleon Dynamite"" does not try to stick to any format that other films have used, which makes it so unique. Audiences should not find this film predictable. It's not for everyone, but it must be seen at least once to find out if it's for you.***1/2 out of ****",Napoleon Dynamite

134,gilligan1965,"Funny as hell, and...hits close to home! :)",8,29 March 2016,"I grew up in a small, agricultural/farming town, and, much of this movie, although a comedy, reminds me of my hometown...and, much of it is very believable.I knew many kids in my high school days who, if were all combined in the correct mixture into one kid, that kid would be Napoleon Dynamite.High school is always funny after you graduate, but, while there, it's quite serious.Napoleon Dynamite's school and town has everything most country towns have - a grandma who's silly and eccentric; an uncle who lives in the past and has crazy ideas; a strange pet that children don't like to feed; a local tough-guy who no one likes; crazy farmers who 'double' as someone else (a pastor); jocks and hot chicks and their clicks; someone after high school who still lives at home and in chat rooms and online games; the new kid who makes an impression; the sweet and ambitious girl who no one will date, but, should; and, the high school misfit who has more sci-fi action figures than friends and lives day by day.Although in different doses and at different times, this is typical.However, this movie, ""Napoleon Dynamite,"" expresses this well...and, in a very funny manner. Detail is especially paid towards teenage angst with -*telling tall-tales in the locker room;*getting annoyed when asked a simple question;*difficulty in getting close to a member of the opposite sex;*saying the wrong thing to a member of the opposite sex;*becoming upset when your custodial grandma is hospitalized and your hated uncle comes to supervise...and, he's also a leech;*hating the thought that girls don't like you - and, everyone else doesn't like you;*and, all else that comes with everyone's high school years.The best part of this movie is that the strange kid, Napoleon, meets a new kid, from 'way' out of town, who is as 'different' as he is; and, a symbiotic friendship is born.This is really a great movie depicting much of what happens in the teen years of a high school misfit who found where he actually does fit in.I recommend this movie to everyone. :)",Napoleon Dynamite

It was clever, funny, and original (Avoiding most of the annoying clichés that appear in most of the movies about teenagers), and it also had lots of heartwarming moments (Specially the ending) It is for that qualities that I liked this movie so much.This is not you average teen movie about teens, this is much more than that.",Napoleon Dynamite
136,Tiger_Mark,DYNAMITE!!!,10,3 July 2004,"What a truly great film! I have not laughed more loudly at a film since I saw ""The Big Lebowski."" What is so refreshing about this film, is that it is physical humor, not silly gags. Napolean Dynamite is a bit of a mess as a person. He is not cool, even though he thinks he is. He does not have any friends, until Pedro shows up. His family defines the term ""losers."" His lone hobbies are drawing (badly) and playing teatherball. Moreover, Napolean's failures in life make him a constant target from other bullies, which leads to Napolean taking a very hostile approach to many things. The movie opens with a young kid asking Napolean ""what are you going to do today?"" Napolean's response, ""whatever I feel like doing, Gosh!"" There is something about seeing movies about small town life in abstract places like Preston, Idaho. Moreover, there is something very special about seeing a film that takes so many detailed steps to providing the audience with both an enjoyable and sweet film. I laughed at Napolean, Pedro, Kip, Rico, Deb and Rex. I did not laugh at them because I thought they were dorks, but because I just found them interesting and amusing. This is good entertainment and goes to the top of my list for 2004.",Napoleon Dynamite
137,ryan_kuhn,"""Hey, you gonna eat your tots?""",7,15 July 2006,"The old Monty Python Flying Circus television show is a model of brilliance and frustration: hilarious skits about anything and everything, always ending before the skit came to its natural end. Sure, the punchline was delivered and just about everything funny about the subject had been performed, however, I always felt cheated by a quick cut, the line ""And now for something completely different,"" and then a new sketch would begin. I bring this up because the opening parts of Napoleon Dynamite reminded me of Flying Circus and their painfully unfinished sketches. There is humor still in these opening scenes, waiting to be mined, but instead, we are whipped ahead to the next scene, going through the same process again. Take, for instance, the scene where Napoleon (Jon Heder) first meets a Mexican immigrant, Pedro (Efren Ramirez), at his first day of school. Napoleon is impressed by Pedro's bike, leading to the two new friends to try ""sick"" tricks with the bike. Pedro leaps off a ramp and gets ""like 3 feet of air, or something"" (in actuality, it was about 3 inches, but Napoleon was duly impressed), then Napoleon crashes and burns trying to do the same thing. Suddenly, we've moved on to the next scene in their lives. I would have preferred just a bit more of that scene. If just felt like we moved on before the joke was over. Maybe I'm nitpicking. Or maybe my disappointment is in the fact that there was plenty of potential comedy here to find, and only a fraction of it comes through the film. The movie itself is harmless, occasionally hilarious (the scene where the farmer shoots a cow got the biggest laugh from me), and potentially insightful into the high school community. I'm not really sure what the final analysis was of high school (was it a good thing that Napoleon finally found acceptance from his peers by doing a dance that is supposed to make the movie audience laugh at him?), but the movie does show the outcasts in school and how they go through life. The best performance in the film is by Tina Majorino, who plays the shy and plain Deb. She does a great job of playing a reserved and awkward high school coed who does of feelings for one of the movie's characters. Her emotions come through the picture easily. The motives and feelings of the other characters are sometimes harder to figure. The Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) and Kip (Aaron Ruell) characters are more problematic. Uncle Rico is living in the past, and Kip is living online. They both are socially awkward, more so than even Napoleon, yet at the end of the film, they kind of get what they want, even if it means forgetting where they came from. This movie shows life in Idaho and has its roots in followers of the Morman Church, and is perfectly safe for families to watch, though Kip's online conversations would be more than PG if we could only look at that computer screen. Or if your family is a fan of cows, as there's a whole lot of steak in this film.",Napoleon Dynamite
138,patrick_dunne,Cult Humor,5,20 October 2005,"Napolean Dynamite is a movie about a nerd who says random things like ""Freaking Idiot!"" and that's pretty much it. He does encounter some problems, but none too dramatic. It is pretty funny, but not too funny. Most people who love it seem to find humor in the strange lines and the complete randomness, which for some reason, I don't find funny. For example, my friend said that the funniest part of the movie was when he throws an action figure tied to a string out the window of a bus. I was thinking ""How is this funny?"" There were funnier parts and much more satisfying, parts though. Lucky for you, I won't ruin any of the mildly funny parts for you movie-goers. Many of the scenes are just made for that. They have a couple of scenes and end up with something like ""Gosh! Idiot!"" The movie is unique and a bit funny, but also disappointing. I expected it to be a lot funnier.

His performance, much like the movie itself, is unlike anything you've ever seen. Heder tackles his role as the asocial ultra-nerd Napoleon with conviction and skill and is entirely convincing. If you'll find the character appealing or not is another matter... and this will ultimately either make you love or hate the film. I'm not sure if I'd call this one of my favourite films, but it's certainly original and worth seeing for its performances, over-the-top dorky characters, and bizarre, dry atmosphere. If you'll laugh or not depends very much on what kind of person you are. I love bizarre and absurd comedy and enjoyed the film even if I didn't laugh out loud more than a few times. Napoleon Dynamite is wildly uneven with segments that are just dull and bits and pieces that are hilarious or at least giggle-worthy, but overall I liked it. My favourite scene is Napoleon's dance number towards the end. That guy can bust a move!

The Dynamite family's mix-and-match up-to-dateness, in terms of cultural signifier, feels just right: the family is hip enough to have Internet dial-up and a pet llama, yet they don't possess a cell phone or, apparently, a car. The director then expands his merciless eye to encompass the community of Preston, Idaho: the bleak expanses of the plains sliced by dirt roads; the randomly accumulated detritus of the Mormon-run thrift shops; the cavernous interior of a poultry plant where a million chickens squat in individual tiny cages that are stacked and lined up with hellish meticulousness.Into this depressing environment enter Napoleon Dynamite, played by newcomer Jon Heder. This character is perhaps cinema's most extreme exaggeration of Adolescent Awkwardness Personified. He's a tall bundle of slouching posture, gangling limbs, gigantic eyeglasses, and frizzy hair. He breathes with his mouth under a massive hooked nose. He's not very realistic. I'm not sure it was entirely necessary to make Napoleon act like a kid six or seven years younger than his own age. When embarrassed by something, he lurches away ungainly with his head ducked in shame, and his discourse is punctuated with too many exclamations along the lines of ""Gosh!"", ""Duh!"", and the like. (We keep waiting for him to say, ""I-know-you-are-but-what-am-I?""or something like it.) In other words, it's a bit too easy -- and unfair -- to make Napoleon border-line mentally retarded. However, this is mitigated by the character's teenaged sullenness and anger. He resents the family that embarrasses him on a daily basis and resents the larger world that fails to appreciate his unique ""skills"". This goes to the very heart of adolescence, and Hess is to be commended for not only grasping the idea but stubbornly insisting on it throughout the film. Hess is also to be commended for not permitting our hero to ultimately conform to the standard of what would be considered ""normal"" behavior by his peer-group, let alone be suddenly adored by the cheerleader-clique by movie's end. Most Hollywood films on this subject pay lip-service to individuality, but cop out at the end when their quirky heroes achieve the social success they have otherwise scorned (with the subtle idea that they'll grow up to be good consumers like everybody else -- after all, an individual person with individual taste might not buy a 48-oz Coke at the theater's concession stand). This movie, while insisting on a feel-good ending, doesn't sacrifice Napoleon's fierce individuality in the process.I've perhaps been too kind to *Napoleon Dynamite*, but in an era of terrible movies, anything unique is cause for some excitement, if not outright praise. The film has its problems: the quirkiness is so relentless in the first 15 minutes -- one freakazoid appearing after another -- that it takes perhaps too much time for us to acclimate. The narrative incidents are sparse, and those that occur are often not realistic enough to match the realism of the setting. Also, I think, we could've done without the fetishism for the early Eighties, which seems to serve no clear function other than gratifying the director's own sense of nostalgia. I mean, I doubt that high school girls still have Big Hair in 2004, even in Idaho. Finally, the style of direction is perhaps too derivative of the aforementioned Coens, Wes Anderson (think *Bottle Rocket*), and Alexander Payne (think *Election* and *About Schmidt*), especially in terms of the tone created by visual composition. Hess sets up a static shot of some dreary mundanely or landscape and holds it for too long, giving the satire an unwarranted contemptuousness.But, after weighing its faults against its virtues, I recommend *Napoleon Dynamite*. 6 stars out of 10.",Napoleon Dynamite
144,emilie8605,it's about time!!!,10,13 March 2005,"napoleon dynamite is a breath of fresh air. being called a cult classic already, napoleon is an unusual character being picked on the popular kids(common characteristic by these types of movies)that overcomes obstacles reachable only those supposedly in Idaho that are pretty! i find it odd however, that pedro and the girl selling the bracelets were able to tolerate his attitude. the movie has twists and turns with unforgettable catch phrases that are able to seen on t-shirts in hot topic for twenty bucks! i think though, that these catch phrases will fade eventually until the second movie movie comes out to release. summer wheatley was a big letdown, since she is hilary duff older or younger sister. what a shame that you need your sister to be recognized to play a 15 min role that has you shaming napoleon. i never could understand that. but don't worry there is a moral to the story however, in the words of Kip, napoleons older brother obsessed with time travel and soulmates on the internet, ""There is a babe out there for you Napoleon"". this movie probably isn't for the adult generation, since napoleon wasn't heavily tolerated by my parental units. so losers everywhere, which we are all around, watch a movie that lets you realize that you aren't that bad off, that life does make a switch around for those in need.",Napoleon Dynamite
145,FrankBooth_DeLarge,"A very unique comedy, I loved it",8,5 April 2005,"Napoleon Dynamite was a big success at film festivals during its release in summer 2004. Despite all of the hype, I was never interested in seeing it until everyone at my school said it was great. This is a very funny and very unique type of comedy. It is one of those movies that is so unique that once you start watching, you don't want to stop.Despite only having a PG rating, this film was a big hit amongst teens. I'm glad it was entertaining and funny because some PG movies can be so lame and unfunny that you wonder why you are even watching them.The star of the movie is a geeky Midwestern high school student. The movie follows how he deals with his very bizarre family, and how he helps his best friend, Pedro, with a student president election against a snobby, uptight girl named Summer. There are plenty of funny moments in this. The script is very original and Napoleon has some clever, gut bustingly hilarious lines. In real life high school, most of the students use the f-word as well as many other swears. Whats funny about the script in Napoleon Dynamite is that just about every time a normal high school student would say the f-word, he says flippin' or freaking or something along those lines. Generally, I like high school movies like Carrie and Christine where the high school loser gets their revenge on the bullies. I also like high school movies like Risky Business where the plot line is every teen's fantasy. Napoleon Dynamite is nothing like those movies, but it is still very enjoyable.Napoleon Dynamite is a very unique movie experience. Everybody should see it once. You may love it or hate it, either way, it's worth watching at least once.",Napoleon Dynamite

Yeah, everything was so utterly unfunny and numbing that as time went by I couldn't help but to like it. There was something simple and sincere about this movie. It does not have the bells and whistles and fast action as most, but its nonetheless a good movie. I loved Napoleons dance number. Was is just me or did this movie also have the same lulling effect on you?

150,bburns,"Hit & Miss, But When it Hits, it Hits Hard",7,17 September 2004,"""Napoleon Dynamite"" is an independent film from a first-time director (Jared Hess), which means it has all the typical strengths and flaws of independent films from first-time directors (See ""Slacker"", ""Clerks"", ""Blair Witch Project"").First the weaknesses: The acting is uniformly awful. I don't know if this was deliberate or not (since every frame of the film is infused with enough irony to choke a horse), but ""wooden"" does not do justice to just how bland the performances are. And the cinematography and editing are horribly amateurish. I suppose we should be thankful they shot the movie on 16mm film instead of color-sapping digital video, but all the shots are static and poorly set up, and are typically just a second or two too long. And roughly a third of the scenes simply do not work, especially in the first part of the movie (e.g. the cameo by Diedrich Bader as a martial arts teacher & the part where Napoleon takes a job at a chicken farm).But--like ""Clerks""--the humor and genial nature of the material more than offset the weaknesses. Essentially, the humor of the movie is two-fold: First, it lampoons the conventions of the average movie or TV show set in a high school (i.e. jocks & mean girls pick on the nerds in escalation up until the big dance, but the head nerd gets his revenge by falling in love and making an inspirational speech in front of the student body). Second, it makes fun of the obviously self-delusional garbage that not-so-bright people in unhappy situations so often tell themselves--and others--in order not to feel completely worthless.The movie is not particularly plot-driven. Roughly half the film is dedicated to introducing us to the characters.First--of course--is Napoleon himself (Jon Heder). He lives in the rural community of Preston, Idaho. The kids at school all laugh at him because he is the only kid there who takes the bus (shared with the elementary school kids), as well as his penchant for (badly) drawing animals. Napoleon is not exactly the sharpest knife in the drawer. The first major speech he has in the film is a scene where his teacher asks him to read a current-events report, and he tells the class about wizards protecting the Loch Ness monster from Japanese atomic scientists. He also expects people to believe that gangs are trying to recruit him for his cross-bow prowess in D&D, and does not understand that chapped lips are not a valid reason to go home sick.Napoleon lives at his grandmother's llama ranch with his older brother Kip (Aaron Ruell, who bears a disturbing resemblance to my late uncle Malcolm). Kip spends hours each day in an Internet chat room searching for his soul-mate, and fancies himself a trained cage-fighter (in reality, he can't even bear to be sissy-slapped).One of their neighbors is Deb (Tina Majorino), one of Napoleon's classmates and his sort-of love interest. Deb is a fashion-challenged girl who is trying to earn money for college by door-to-door selling home-made key-rings & making appointments for the Glamor Shots photography studio she works at.When Napoleon's grandmother gets injured (saying how would be to spoil a great joke), his uncle Rico (Jon Gries) moves in. Rico's clothes, hairstyle and customized burnt-orange 1971 Dodge van all were cool for a high school senior in 1982, but are just sad for a forty-year-old man in 2004. But Rico still can't seem to get past his notion that if coach had only put him in during the final play of the final game of the 1982 season, he would have been the hero, gone to college on a football scholarship, gone pro, and enjoy retirement being wealthy & married to the woman of his dreams. As it is, he makes his living with door-to-door sales of Tupperware and breast augmentation pills, and tapes himself throwing a football in his spare time.Finally, there is Napoleon's best (i.e. only) friend at school, Pedro (Efren Ramirez), a recent immigrant from Mexico. After only his first day at school, Pedro comes to believe he is a ladies' man, and that he is one of the most popular kids in school even though he only hangs out with Deb and Napoleon. And the worst part is that he and Napoleon come to believe each other's delusions.Beyond giving brief sketches of the main characters, I don't think it would be fair to say anything more about this movie except to say that although the first half of the film is a bit stilted, the second half is incredibly funny. This is not a great film and probably will not make the careers of anyone involved (except perhaps Jon Heder), but it is enjoyable none-the-less. 7 out of 10.",Napoleon Dynamite
151,colonel_green,Perhaps the most enjoyably pointless film ever.,8,1 January 2005,"""Napoleon Dynamite"" tells the story of a group of misfit teenagers who blunder through life in Preston, Ohio. It is an entirely plot less exercise, leavened with a lot of humour. Director Jared Hess may be the new Wes Anderson, having created a quirky world where little happens. The film is carried by Jon Heder as the title character, the ultimate antisocial nerd. There are a couple of would-be plots, including Napoleon's crush on a girl named Deb, Pedro's bid for the student council presidency, and Kip's internet chatroom girlfriend, but none can really be called a plot. Perhaps that's the point of it all. There's little else to say about it. I give it an 8/10.",Napoleon Dynamite
152,frankwhat,Dumbfounded,3,14 September 2004,"This movie was retarded. The only reason I gave it a couple points was that there were 2-3 somewhat funny parts. Other than that it was dull, I mean it's one of the only movies that's less than an hour and a half and still seemed to be longer than a 3 hour epic. The whole movie moves way too slow for a comedy and most parts were just outright stupid. The acting was horrible as was the script and unfortunately they didn't cancel each other out. Do not listen to the critics! This isn't what an independent film is supposed to be at all. It's just another crap MTV production to add to their long list of toilet water that they call movies.Final Bashing:Movies : Was such a waste!DVD Purchase : No way in hell.Rental : Even then it's a waste but you probably won't believe it 'til you see it.",Napoleon Dynamite
153,Derek237,Nerd. Outcast. Social retard. HERO.,7,9 October 2005,"Last night I tuned into Saturday Night Live and noticed that John Heder was the host. I thought, why the hell is he hosting? I doubt it had much to do with his role in Just Like Heaven, but obviously because of the huge popularity he's gained through the role of Napoleon Dynamite. Everyone knows Napoleon Dynamite. You can't even call it a cult film anymore, it's made its way into the mainstream- with those VOTE FOR PEDRO shirts popping up everywhere, fans quoting the film left and right, and now John Heder's appearance on SNL. I honestly don't know if Heder would be able to live down this role. It seems like he's become a one-hit-wonder. He did one Napoleon impression throughout the entire show and the audience went nuts. Too nuts. For his good, at least.But here I am talking about John Heder when I should be talking about the actual movie. I liked it. Was it the greatest, most original indie creation ever to grace the screen? No, but it certainly was amusing. Memorable characters and lines...not much of a plot, but it's not about plot, altogether an oddball film with some good laughs. Everyone seems to love the title character, they find him...interesting in some way. He is interesting alright, but I don't think I'd want to be this guy's friend. Maybe that's the point. Either way, Napoleon Dynamite is now a widely recognized character in our pop culture.I don't know if this movie tries to make any statement about anything, but I guess it doesn't matter. Maybe it's just that Idaho sucks. That's the impression I got.My rating: 7/10",Napoleon Dynamite
154,Michael Kenmore,Worst movie of 2004,1,24 December 2004,"I was looking forward to seeing this alleged comedy since its sold-out debut at Sundance Film Festival in January 2004. Every local critic, including insufferably self-important Salt Lake City Weekly critic Scott Renshaw and cheerfully sycophantic independent film reviewer Eric D. Snider, gushed and lavished praises on this movie as if it's the next best thing to come along in comedy genre in years.Relatives and friends had good words to say about Napoleon Dynamite. The movie was sold out the day it was released on DVD everywhere in Utah, which is an impressive accomplishment for a locally produced movie (developed in Utah, shot entirely on location in Idaho). I paid 3.49 to rent this movie on DVD, expecting a shining bright comedy gem.I have not seen the movie equivalent of The Emperor's New Clothes until Napoleon Dynamite come along to share the designation with Lost in Translation and that's saying a lot. I loathe the movie with every fibre of my being. Napoleon Dynamite is incredibly contrived, unapologetically stupid, tediously paced (I say this as a Terrence Malick fan who enjoys long, slow-paced films) and woefully unfunny. This is one of the most unfunny movies I've ever seen and I've seen movies starring former SNL cast members (Adam Sandler, David Spade, Chris Farley, Will Farrell) that I never laughed at once.Napoleon Dynamite is one of these movies for which first-time viewing may be marginally improved if you sit with the audience at a theatre because you can hear them laugh and you laugh in kind at particular scenes that may be funny (or unintentionally funny in bad movies with camp value, like Cool As Ice and Glitter). Watching it alone, with minimal distraction and no accomplices, was a dreary experience to keep watching the movie that bump, stumble and trip over in trying too hard to be funny with gags and character quirks without dozing off or turning off the movie which I seldomly do. I sat through the movie to the second ending and it's still a gigantic waste of time and money to see this movie that tries to pass itself off as a comedy that pokes fun of itself for the sake of silliness that seem to be really funny for the cast and crew to pull off but maybe not funny enough for some viewers.I know a former friend who went to BYU with Jared Hess as film students. I tried hard to like Napoleon Dynamite for its mildly amusing dialogue and sporadic character development, but it's just too dumb beyond belief and dreadfully unfunny. I can only give the movie two points for originality (kind of) and nice cinematography and that's it.I hope Jared Hess improve his directing (comedy scriptwriting and comic timing skills) with the second feature, and it better be funny (in smart direction like Wes Anderson of Rushmore & The Royal Tenenbaums) if it's destined to be a quality comedy that isn't alienating in dull and idiotically droll humor. My kind of taste in comedy is quirky character movies. Napoleon Dynamite is not one of them.I don't have high expectation when I go to the movies and rent videos unless I see a great movie that's worth a recommendation. With that in mind, I was flabbergasted and disappointed by the hype for the stupid kind of this movie that share a common trait with Hollywood in being pandering and condescending to not only the characters in Napoleon Dynamite but also the audience who paid hard-earned money to see low-brow unfunny trash. Todd Solondz's 1996 dark comedy Welcome to the Dollhouse is more realistic and slightly funnier as a sharply pointed satire than Napoleon Dynamite aspire to be. Even Ghost World is several times better despite its hit-or-miss humor.Zero out of four stars",Napoleon Dynamite
155,byson5186,10 Years Since The Napoleon Dynamite Era,3,1 October 2014,"I haven't seen this movie the full way through since 2006. I'm not sure if I'd see it unless I was watching it with friends. Maybe to try to remember what happens in the movie, I'm sure most of us who have seen this movie can remember what it's about and the characters. I'll tell you, I remember when this movie was VERY POPULAR. I mean, I didn't see it until early 2005, although this movie came out in 2004. To people who think this movie is supposed to be set in the '80s, if I can remember correctly Napoleon's ID said 2004-2005 school year. I'll tell you, I seriously can't believe how long it's been since 2005. It will be 10 years, 3 months from now. During that time this movie seemed like society's obsession. It seemed like everybody saw this movie back then, and it almost seemed like everybody liked it. If you went on to boards like IMDb back then which a lot of the reviews on here are from that time period during the Napoleon Dynamite Era, you'll see some people who were disgusted with this movie. But, seriously during that time in 2005, you used to hear this movie frequently being referenced in Pop Culture, you would hear a lot of people talking about it referring to almost any scene in the movie, you'd hear people frequently quote this movie, lots of stores had Napoleon Dynamite franchise including ""Vote For Pedro"" shirts. Since that time period, the movie has seemed to lose it's popularity. I mean, I don't hear many people talk about Napoleon Dynamite anymore. I went to a college living with house mates for 2 years, and not once did I see any of them watching Napoleon Dynamite. I only once saw a student dressed as Napoleon Dynamite at a dance and did the dance we remember at the end of the movie. You also would not be able to go into any store and see Napoleon Dynamite Franchise being sold like stickers about the tots or drinking the 1% milk, you could find that stuff online but not merchandise a store would sell. So, it seems like the movie was very popular during the Napoleon Dynamite Era 10 years ago, but has gotten old and if people talk about this movie, they'll be thinking more of that Napoleon Dynamite Era when they watched it and it used to be popular. To describe the movie, I remember seeing it in 2005 when it was very popular, but the movie never really appealed to me. I tried to get into it, as it seemed like almost everybody else was into it, and I would watch some scenes from time to time. But, noticing then and looking back at the movie. The humor in the movie is quite subtle, I mean it's not something that will automatically make you laugh, like humor in a lot of other movies. If you have a sense of humor and like quiet humor then you will probably laugh. I mean, basically the whole movie is a quiet slow paced movie where we hear every once in awhile the Napoleon Dynamite theme. The movie has a lot of pauses, and show characters look in the camera with blank expressions on their face. Basically, nobody in this movie is a likable character or attractive. A lot of people consider Napoleon more than a nerd and his character standing out more than any other nerd. I usually think of nerds as smart people with glasses, but Napoleon doesn't seem like too smart of a guy. We can call him a geek, he's alienated, he speaks in a monotonic annoying voice in the movie. He gets annoyed at things very easily, and can be downright rude, so he is not a good role model. His brother Kip is even more of a geek than Napoleon, and his Uncle Rico isn't a likable character. Most of the people seemed to like this movie considering it something out of the ordinary, though they would have to admit it's slow and the humor is subtle. People still seem to remember a lot of the movie lines years later, as a lot of the lines from the movie come from Napoleon. Basically, the whole movie tries to be funny showing how an alienated character, a high school student lives his life in Idaho along with the people who are also geeky. It's nice how this movie isn't talked about so much anymore, that it had it's time 10 years ago, but people got tired of it. I personally think watching this movie would be more of a waste of my time which I can't get back. On a scale of 1/10 I give this movie a 3 as that would still be a failing grade in school, because I did find some things in the movie entertaining, but this isn't a favorite movie and it was annoying when people seemed obsessed with this movie back then.",Napoleon Dynamite
156,JimD73,Napoleon Dynamite Just Doesn't Click,4,14 February 2005,"OK, since I have had enough of everyone quoting this goddamn movie at school, I guess it was my civic duty to see it. It didn't seem like much of a premise, just a guy saying ""God, freaking idiots"" the whole time. Sounds interesting. OK, sounds lame, but what else am I going to do, go outside? No, such is blasphemy for the online critic. So is Napoleon Dynamite actually quotable, or are all these people just freaking idiots.Plot: 5/25: Plot? What is this plot you speak of? This is Napoleon Dynamite and it thinks it's too good to have a plot. What you want a summary? Fine, freaking idiot.Basically, Napoleon Dynamite (Heder) is a high-school nerd. He sits around and draws stuff and breathes heavy. He has a friend in the new kid, mustachioed Pedro (Ramirez) and quiet photographer Deb (Majorino). He lives with his Grandma (Martin) and his 30+ year old brother Kip (Ruell), who spends his days chatting online. When his Grandma is involved in a dirtbike accident and breaks her coccyx, Uncle Rico (Gries) moves in for a while. Rico was a former football player who wants to go back in time, but right now, decides to start up a business with Kip by selling Tupperware. Also, Pedro, Deb and Napoleon go through a few things, such as the school dance and campaigning to make Pedro student president. All in all, things are pretty uneventful, save for some conflict between Rico and Napoleon. This is one of those movies that doesn't really try to have a plot. So sad, I'm really not going to try to give it many points for plot. I will give it a few, though, as it obviously isn't a plot movie.Comedy: 14/25: I'd be lying if I said Napoleon Dynamite was never funny. I was watching it with three people who didn't laugh once, but I laughed a fair share at the sheer stupidity of some of the lines. There are some genuinely funny parts involving a cow execution and a time machine, and the rest is left to some really dumb line that are, unfortunately, very quotable. I've heard enough ""freaking idiots"" in the past few days to make my head spin. It just isn't funny. I hate to say it, but most of this crap is just stupid, not funny. I did chuckle to the stuff throughout the movie, but it wasn't at Napoleon. My laughter was aimed mostly at Uncle Rico. The comedy here proved that deadpans work well when they are mixed with non-deadpans, but left to their own, it's just boring. When Napoleon was with Rico or the wrestler, it was funny. When Napoleon was with 50 other characters who are basically Napoleon without quite the nerdity and the heavy breathing, it just doesn't work. I'm giving it more credit than I should, but I did get a good chuckle out of it, so I'll let it slide.Acting: 20/25: Basically, Jon Heder is now going to be known as Napoleon wherever he goes. It is now his curse he has to live with. He gets the personality down pact for Napoleon, right down to the heavy breathing. Another notable mention is Gries, who I really liked as Uncle Rico. Everyone else is fairly par, but I did enjoy the cameo by Diedrich Bader, who was Oswald on the Drew Carey Show.Entertainment: 9/25: This movie isn't really entertaining. It funny to some people, but other than that, it's pretty boring. I was laughing and bored and the same time, which I'm pretty sure is a first. It has the funny, but it doesn't have much interest.Bonus -2 for after the credits: OK, this kinda ruined the movie. It was just painfully bad. Save yourself and stop before the tape gets to this crap.Total: 46%: Napoleon just didn't do it for me. I don't know why. I was laughing, but I just never clicked with the movie. I just really want to stop hearing quotes from this movie before my head explodes all over these freaking idiots.",Napoleon Dynamite
157,luludavis,"Perfect ""Outsiders'"" Film",10,10 August 2005,"Jared and Jerushka Hess have created a film that is in the traditional of all films about outsiders. This film joins Edward Scissorhands, Freaks and Geeks, Eraserhead, Raising Arizona and a host of others in its ability to draw the audience into a world that is unique and complete. The characters' personalities are painted in broad brush strokes but I bought into them hook, line and sinker because the actors went all at their tasks with 100% commitment. Tina Majorino was a pleasure to watch in her role as Deb. It's wonderful to see that this actress has grown out of her earlier film roles playing opposite performing seals. Jon Heder in the lead role is hysterical as the mouth-breathing, bad dressing, moist-at-the corners-of-the-mouth loser. You got to love this guy because he tries so hard to rise above his hostile surrounding. Jon Gries is downright diabolical as the smarmy uncle. Haylie Duff did surprisingly well as the queen bitch, Summer. The vastness of the landscape, the dull primary colors of the hallway lockers, the slick wood paneling of the basement were depicted with such detail that I could feel the falseness and desperation of the 70's. The actress named Shondrella was a pleasant surprise as well as the guy plays Pedro in that they added racial diversity to an otherwise white world. Good job done by all involved.",Napoleon Dynamite
158,kneiss1,One of the most annoying movies of all times,2,3 October 2010,"This movie was pure boredom for me. Everyone was being a cliché, acting slow, talking slow and being utterly stupid. I was sitting in front of my screen, begging that this people start to do something... but the whole movie, pretty much nothing happened. I am guessing this movie is for people that find it funny to watch odd characters. To me the people in the movie made a more retarded impression than an odd; and if I would have laughed, I would have felt like making fun of people. So I could barely laugh. - Not really my kind of humor.I am usually a fan of odd humor, but this movie was plain bad in my opinion. The acting was bad, especially the main actor did not play convincing. - I have never seen a character that absurd and unrealistic. For me it was even too unrealistic for comedy. The cuts have been rare, which is cool for a melancholic beautiful movie. But not for a comedy movie! This only added towards the sleepy characters to create an even more boring experience. There have been 2 really cool gags in this movie, and I actually found the uncle quite funny. That is why I gave this movie 2 points. Objectively, this movie deserves a little more points. But for me personally, it was way simply too annoying and boring. No way to give it more than 2 points.",Napoleon Dynamite

Juno succeeded, but this movie just fail flat to me. Napoleon himself was intentionally lifeless and boring. They could have done something with Pedro, but he was pretty much Napoleon's clone, just as lifeless. The bully jock was as stereotypical as they come, same with Summer. Overall, most of the characters looked unique but had no real personality to speak of. I think if the movie was just thirty minutes, it would've ran smoother. It just seemed to drag on and on due to the dry acting. It needed an actually funny character in the story to make up for all the dark and deadpan humor.

There isn't much here for anyone who doesn't feel like snickering at the title character's appearance for two hours (and Hess doesn't have much comic firepower, just a bunch of gazing at the 4th wall as the flies gather overhead) or the risible conceit of an Idaho backwater town still stuck in the year 1982. I mostly feel bad for Tina Majorino (Corrina, Corrina) who made her comeback for this film, only to be made the filmmakers' pet for various humiliations: look at her outfits, or the way a large gob of PB & J sticks to her cheek long after it should be obvious to her peers. A few laughs sneak in (there was one scene near the end that made up for a lot of crap), but this is nothing more than a smear piece that has little of value to say about teens or of growing up in small towns.",Napoleon Dynamite
161,Phantasm01,God awful movie!,1,8 June 2006,"I would not recommend this movie to anyone! This was the most boring movie I have ever seen.The plot: An outsider meets the new kid at school and decides to help him run for class president.You wait for something to actually happen, but honestly, nothing ever does. The dialogue is terrible, the acting is terrible. Only watch this movie if you have a couple of hours that you want to waste, and can't think of anything else that would be more entertaining such as this.This is a movie that has always sucked, not before every American teenager decided to quote it, or after everyone knew where the line ""GIMME SOME OF YOUR TATER TOTS!!!!!!"" originated from. Not because it has been over-quoted big-time, but because it has no plot or interesting dialogue whatsoever. The movie has no point, except maybe to top Pulp Fiction in being the most misquoted movie ever. The difference is, Pulp Fiction doesn't suck.For some reason, all of the 'goth' and 'emo' kids like this movie and idolize it. Not because they thought it was funny, but because their friend thought it was funny.I'd like someone to explain to me what the hell is so funny about some kid who talks like he's someone's bitch? And even if it were funny, why would it be funny when you say it? Well, its not. Almost every review I've read that is for Napoleon Dynamite includes the words ""frickin'"" ""gosh"", or ""sweet!"". I would rather be blasted in the face with a shotgun loaded with Al Gore's semen than listen to another one of these horrible renditions of this shitty movie.Oh look, the guy needs chapstick! Call everyone! This movie needs to be seen over and over and over! Why don't you obsessed fans just break down and stalk the mediocre actor who played Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder is his name!) so you can ask him to do the lines over and over for you so you don't have to blather it off to everyone you meet? Seriously, this sh*t needs to end. I'm so sick of this movie. Shi*ty only half describes it. Take sh*t, add a baboon's ass, and multiply by Michael Moore's weight, and the product is Napoleon Dynamite.Kid1: Hey! Guess what I got? The Napoleon Dynamite DVD with 12 hours of extra footage of him saying ""IDIOT!""!!! Kid2: GOSH!! THAT IS LIKE THE BEST MOVIE EVER! LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL!!!! Kid1: ""Your mom went to the college.""

LETS ANNOY EVERYONE ELSE WITH OUR LAME OBSESSION"" Kid2: ""WHAT A GREAT IDEA! GOSH!"" You will not be entertained. You will not be uplifted. You will not be engaged in the storyline as it does not have one. You will not be inspired. People will tell you that it has a bunch of great quotes. It doesn't. The quotes aren't great, they're just easy to remember, so anyone can pick up on them and recognize them when they come out of someone's mouth. ""Maybe I will! Gosh!"" Hardy har.",Napoleon Dynamite
162,famelovingboy68,Who wouldn't like this,9,8 March 2005,"One person I can think of who doesn't like it is Ebert. Everyone liked it but him. Well not literally everyone. This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. But when I saw previews for this I didn't have any idea what the movie was about and thought it looked dumb and annoying. Naplolean is a tall, skinny high school senior with a fro, moon boots, and big glasses, and he seems to always squint. He's the kind of guy that there is just one of in every high school. He draws pictures of beasts, animals and warriors and practices dancing. He lives in Preston, Idaho with his even nerdier 32-year-old brother, Kip, a scrawny wimp with the funniest voice. He chats on-line with babes all the time, and says things are getting pretty serious with one babe, La Fawnduh, and trains to become a cagefighter aka. ninja. He practices his moves by telling Napolean to try and hit him and evades his moves but when he cheats and slaps him he holds his cheek followed by a wimpy ""geeez"". One of the funniest things in the movie but he doesn't try for long. Napolean's new best friend is Pedro,a recent immigrant from Mexico and the only guy at school with a mustache, who's soft-spoken and never mean. Summer is an annoying stuck-up blonde. Her boyfriend is a high school jock named, Don who smirks and makes these patronizing faces at Napolean, but isn't a total dickhead like Randy, a fat bully. There's Deb, a shy but very likable new girl at school played by Tina Majorino, who has been in a lot of movies including Andre and Waterworld. Then there's Napolean's scheming, narcissistic uncle Rico who lives with him and Kip while their grandma is in the hospital. For no apparent reason because of their ages. The one thing I don't like about this film is how we never see the Dynamite's parents. We figure they don't live there because Kip's long grown up. Plus the grandma looked way too young. The completely original and hilarious script has many memorable lines that I started saying in conversations for laughs: Like the part where Napolean, Kip and Rico are watching Rico's pointless, boring movie of him throwing a football and Kip says it's ""pretty cool I guess"" and Napolean says how it's the worst video ever made and Kip replies "" like any one can even know that"" when Kip says ""easy, I've already looked into it myself"" when Rico asks him if he knows anything about time travel, because he is obsessed with football and going back in time to '82 to become a rich sports star, Pedro asking if Napolean's made up girl friend is ""hot"" Napolean feeding the llama that isn't even overweight, he raises his voice saying ""Tina you fat lard come get some dinner"" then he yells ""eat the food"" cause she won't eat it and throws it over the fence. Probably the funniest is when Napolean, after Deb says she'll go to the dance with Pedro, and he's jealous, says ""girls only want boyfriends that have great skills. You know, like bow hunting skills, nanchauck, computer hacking skills."" So Napolean drew a picture of Trishia, Summer's close friend also not very nice. It took like three ""frickin"" hours to finish the shadding on her upper lip. Her mom makes her go with him but ditches him at the dance so Pedro lets him dance with Deb for a little bit. Kip meets La Fawnduh, who comes in from Detroit who is super tall, and they get really serious and fall in love. During the dance Pedro decides to run for class president. Pedro asks Napolean if people would vote for him then he asks his skills and he says things that aren't even skills like having his sweet bike, having a mustache in high school, and being great at hooking up with chicks, not exactly something to say on a job application!!!! He, Napolean, and Deb then launch a big campaign to elect him president, causing a stiff competition against stuck-up summer. Uncle Rico pulls scams to ruin people's lives. He sends out fliers to the girls at school and women. including Deb, in a fairly creepy scene at her photo studio where he looks like he's going to seduce her but he just pulls the flier out and gives it to her. Deb then thinks Napolean is shallow and she tells him so, which makes them temporarily not friends. But soon he is trying to sell some to the karate master's wife and he comes home in the evening while he's there as he puts pans on her breasts to show how big they could be, and he gets beat up and runs back home, no longer to ruin his nephew's life. Pedro has to prepare and speech and a skit to give in the school auditorium to run for president. Summer's speech and skit is so outstanding, it seems unbeatable and Pedro gets scared and gives up hope. So Pedro's frighteningly gives a short speech. Now Napolean has to unleash his secret weapon for his friend to win. He puts his pastime, dancing to the test and the audience soon goes from seeing him as a freak to watching in awe and then roaring with applause and clapping. That's the profound message of the movie, for Napolean used a persona that made kids at school think he was a freak and he got shoved into his lockers every day, but when he showed people who his real self he won respect and as much admiration s this movie has gotten, and Pedro wins the election. Watch after the closing credits for the scene where Kip marries La Fawnduh, and Uncle Rico is there but he's nicer, and another one of my favorite moments is what La fawnduh's brother or cousin does after she says ""I do"".",Napoleon Dynamite

I really have no clue. Napoleon is one of the most un-likable protagonists I've ever seen in a movie. Heder tries to act too much like a loser, and has a terrible, flat, boring voice. In short, he overacts, just like everyone else in this movie. Pedro tries too hard to be an immigrant, Uncle Rico tries too hard to be the self-absorbed uncle, etc. The jokes are stale and dry, because this is a movie that tries way too hard to be funny. Though, granted, there are one or two jokes I enjoyed, for the most part, this was a really disappointing movie that dares to call itself a comedy. The dance scene at the end is perhaps one of the most pointless scenes I've ever had to endure watching. I wouldn't sit through this movie again...",Napoleon Dynamite

I went in to the ""Napolean Dynamite"" experience with an appreciation for this kind of comedy, such as it is.Still I found it very hard to digest this movie. It just didn't hit many funny notes and I almost fell asleep TWICE. Heder's portrayal of the matter-of-fact loser Napolean is so deliberately, if not self-consciously, idiosyncratic, ND ends up as caricature.That is probably ND's whole problem--everyone is a caricature of someone we know. Napolean's brother; his uncle; his brother's fiancé, a large black woman; Pedro who is, like Napolean, a slack-jawed clueless gimp. Though they are understated, they are still ridiculous.I wanted to like this movie, given all the buzz, but I really failed to get its humor. I think the only thing I found genuinely funny was when Napolean's brother dressed up as a gangsta rapper and showed off his bling bling.Otherwise, this movie falls flat for me.

Like watching fail compilations in YouTube. But what I got.. oh boy, I was left in ruins. There were only few sentences which were a bit humorous. I mean, the whole film was comical and full of satire. But it wasn't funny. It was silly. Really silly. I didn't see any normal or intelligent character on-screen. There were retards. People who were 20-30, but acted like a 10-14-year olds. I didn't get the jokes they made. It was lame. There was no plot at all. One theory is that it's funny because of how pointless it is, but I don't buy that one.I like some foolish comedies like Hot Rod, but in this one, I found it very hard to laugh at people with fixation. I suggest you think carefully before seeing this one. It makes good to you if you skip it.",Napoleon Dynamite
167,RARubin,Ultimate Triumph of Retarded Teens,8,29 April 2005,"This one started with a semi-retarded teen and I groaned because there has been a spate of retarded comedy characters of late. I'm thinking of What's Eating Gilbert Grape and Punch Drunk Love. In the last twenty years, you can throw in fifty or sixty teen outcast comedies with interchangeable casts. The pariah could be an ugly duckling teen girl as in She's All That or a whole cast of teen misfits of both sex's as in Things I like About You. Napoleon Dynamite takes these concepts to their logical conclusion thereby closing out any possibility that future teen saga's could be original. Are there mentally challenged adolescents in modern civilization like Napoleon or his dim internet-dating brother? I always asked that question about the Three Stooges. I need to get over my desire for sophisticated, reality based comedy, and I must accept the quirky world of Indie farce. Once over this hurdle, I settle down into the underdog theater of teen losers and enjoy their ultimate triumph. I recommend Napoleon Dynamite and give it four stars.",Napoleon Dynamite

I only saw maybe 45 minutes of the film and the rest, I slept through it. The movie was so bad that I just could not stay awake. The story is about a weird socially dysfunctional teenager who lives with his brother and his grandmother. The grandmother goes on a vacation and their uncle comes to live with them. The uncle is some loser who craves for his high school days when he was some sort of high school football quarterback. The main character and his brother are both nerds. The main character has two friends in high school, both nerds. The nerds in this movie are just pathetic. They are not funny and they just aggravate you. In sum, this movie sucks.

It's not one of those horrid quick-cut-montage-over-bouncy-music high school films. It's the story of a mundane dweeb living a mundane life. I suppose we're supposed to identify with that or somehow find it entertaining, but I was never drawn in.The actors all do a terrific job, and if you're into the idea of a sweet little tale of awkward high school life, this is likely the picture for you.

Napoleon Dynamite is that kind of film.Just about every main character we meet in the film can be classified as a loser. Male or female, English or Latino, in school or long graduated, these are folks who just don't fit in ... even in a small town in Idaho. That doesn't make them less watchable. In fact, decoding what exactly is off about each character is half the fun of this film. The characters themselves are not necessarily sad or upset they don't fit in. They seem aware of it, but don't take steps to address it.The film takes a while before it gets to any sort of plot. Just when I started to wonder if there was one, something came along. And the plot is thin, but does tie in to who the main characters are.My major issue with Napoleon Dynamite was the ending. It made no sense. Avoiding spoilers here ... what the main character does inexplicably seems to make a difference. Why it isn't viewed as something as weird as anything else he does, I don't know. And when the film ended, I was left wondering if there was a message I wasn't getting. Maybe there is, but if so, it is pretty esoteric. I gave ND a 6.",Napoleon Dynamite

Let's face it, there is absolutely NOTHING good about this awful film.Flat story, characters you can't care about (even if you tried), stupid jokes that were not funny, obnoxious dialog, repetitive scenes, and an overall disaster!-Allow me to elaborate on the list of things I explained above-Flat Story: The plot itself was drawn out and there were times when I was waiting for the story to move forward. Often, it just felt stalled and would easily get myself and the audience impatient.Characters: How can you care about a pathetic dork who has nothing to offer us, as an audience member, casually watching this? Not just the main loser, who is this ""protagonist"", but the fact that the characters weren't believable and the majority of them I disregarded without sympathy.Stupid Jokes: Anyone who thinks this horrendous piece of crap is funny, either has a bad sense of humor or just doesn't have a fully functioning brain, for that manner. The humor is so dry, that you'll be watching it (without any laughter), and ask yourself repeatedly ""Was that supposed to be funny?"".Dialogue: It was so obnoxious and at times, I wanted to punch some of the people, in this movie, through the screen. Zero character development through dialog and it made the movie even MORE tedious.Repetitive Scenes: Since the people who wrote this obviously ran out of ideas, while writing their horrible script, they probably thought it would be okay to repeat the same (or similar) scenes over and OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN constantly. Overall Disaster: Don't get me wrong, I like a lot of indie films and I personally thought that ""Nacho Libre"" was decent enough to watch, but ""Napoleon Dynamite"" was such an epic failure to cinema.

173,Bungle-9,Likable,7,11 November 2005,"Slow and dry like the desert, Napoleon Dynamite isn't really a laugh out loud comedy but more of a quirky, Coen-esquire, character driven, almost minimalist movie with not a lot of real point to it (not that it matters). We follow the adventures of alienated uber-nerd Napoleon Dynamite through a brief stretch of his teenage years with typical woes - getting a job, girls, friends etc. It's probably better to watch it yourself to get the idea because it's fairly thin.The characters in the movie are what give it a sense of individuality amongst the mediocre. Napoleon himself is of course very memorable and quotable. His best friend Pedro keeps a quiet presence by his side but we never forget him. When I saw Deb (Napoleon's interest) I knew she I recognised her before than I realised she was the girl in Waterworld. She has fairly grown up! The characters in general seem to be a little ""intellectually challenged"" and slowly, plainly spoken, though Hess never seems to use this to play on our sympathies much.Anyway, all in all this is an easy, laid back watch anyone can enjoy, though I wouldn't say it was anything special. Some definite quotability there though. Some funny moments and a great soundtrack are present. Interesting to see that there was no swearing in the movie (although I think there was a ""crap"" once, does that count?).

This is a beautiful film, and probably the funniest comedy I've seen. Unlike some harsh reviewers, I found masterful work in every single frame of the movie. The cinematography is excellent. The music is hilariously catchy and funny. The performances are great. The characters are even better. And the script is actually flawless. Every single line is a potential quote. ""Whatever I feel like I want to do, Gosh!"" ""Eat the food!"", ""Is she hot?"", ""Gross! Freakin' Idiot!"", ""It's a time machine, Napoleon. He bought it online"", and a whole lot more.I don't know why do people think there's no deepness in this story. It's a fantastic, yet domestic, tale of friendship, support, courage, perseverance and love, as it is supposed to be.Napoleon is a form of loser who doesn't really accept it, and acts as if he wasn't such. He's alienated from school and his only real good friend is a Mexican immigrant, also alienated from school. It's this friendship what acts as an engine for both characters successes. Pedro enlists as school president, against the ever-so-popular Summer. After fearing defeat, Napoleon chooses to aid his friend by dancing a recently learned hi routine, casting away his insecurity and rejection from his classmates. This in turn, makes Pedro win the elections and Deb and Napoleon's reconciliation (which lovable yet impertinent uncle Rico almost wrecked).An amazing, yet simple, film, this deserves far more than cult following. Unlike other comedy movies, which turn desperately to gross out humor and dick jokes to make you laugh, this is a real funny comedy that anyone can watch without fearing inappropriate content. This is definitely a must-see. From it's original opening credits to it's simple yet meaningful conclusion with an epilogue, the film is a modern masterpiece for a new generation.

And here's something remarkable: The usher in the theater, a squat little rumpled lady, came walking down the aisle after the lights came on, singing the praises of this film; she said she'd seen it piecemeal for the past couple of weeks and it simply made her feel good... unlike most of the trashy, violent, inhuman movies filling the multiplexes this summer.

My only drive is that my slick dance moves got my friend Pedro his presidential gig.After checking this out again with two of my friends... fine, my only real friends, I got so sick at how uptight everyone around me is. Gosh! I get it--we are all trying to be losers, but this is more awkward than funny. My stupid brother Kip (Aaron Ruell) keeps telling me off simply because he chats with a girl online. I could chat with a girl online if I wanted too, but I don't. Pedro (Efren Ramirez) is such a bore. He is as funny as he is American, and somehow still got a date for prom earlier than I did! That is not surprising, though. His date is the weird Deb (Tina Majorino). You can tell she is weird because her ponytail is sideways. What the heck?No worries, though. I also got a date for prom--and a hot one at that. Trisha (Emily Dunn), one of the most attractive girls at my school. She loved the portrait I did of her. Took me three hours just to do the shading on her upper lip. What can I say, I am an artist. I maybe could've gotten closer to her on the ride to prom, but I had no car so Pedro's gangsta' friends drove us--nothing is more romantic than Latino hip-hop. Over at prom, she quickly left my side, probably because she got nervous in my presence. It's fine. Girls turn away from me when I'm not looking all the time--it's kinda my thing.But anyway, gosh! Who am I kidding? My life could've been so awesome if it wasn't for my Uncle Rico (Jon Gries). He thinks he's made just because he lives alone in a van and films himself while playing football. There is more to life than that, duh! There is more to my life, in particular. But ever since my grandma broke her coccyx while on date with her boyfriend, he's been constantly ruining my life. Like, every day, he is ruining it.So, what if he's funny? He is so cheap, so hopeless, so effortless, like this whole movie! These guys are such losers that they don't even want to be appreciated.

The characters were developed and nuanced and give an example of what much of small town America looks like. One critic said the representation of Idaho citizens was insulting, but it was also dead-on. I think the characters were imparted with more dignity than was subtracted. Jon Heder was superb as the title character Napoleon Dynamite and (spoiler) does a great dance scene. This scene probably cost more to choreograph than the entire movie took to make.

Everyone has their own laugh level. You can count yourself fortunate if Napoleon is what you like. This movie runs and works on the detailed personalities of it's characters and their world. The world they live in is not just Idaho - it is America as a whole. It uses slapstick and the absurd to present the daily life of a kid who looks surprisingly familiar. You know him or you are him. This movie avoids a lot of the hatred and fear that make up much of America today and instead focuses on the story of someone before he has joined that herd. I saw ""Dodgeball"" in the same weekend and the differences between them is clear. Napoleon was done on a shoestring and let the humor flow from character development. Dodgeball was done for 50 million (it has earned twice that)and the humor was manufactured with the help of special effects and one-liners. Napoleon has to-date earned roughly 10 times what it took to make it. I'm giving it a 10 because films like this are just so rare. Enjoy.",Napoleon Dynamite

And when you meet 80s throwback pseudo fashionista Deb (Tina Majorino) and her pastel pink stirrup pants, you sense that Napoleon mightn't always be unlucky in love.Writer/director Jared Hess (whose wife Jerusha co-scripted) have created a cult hit and shot the film's gangly lead, Jon Heder, to relative stardom. But despite the eccentricity and occasional hilarity of this film, there's no emotional core. Like Bad Santa, Napoleon Dynamite's peopled with characters you'd cross the street to avoid, but they're presented as zoo exhibits, rather than real people. And while it's daring not to play for laughs, this gamble doesn't entirely pay off  making Napoleon Dynamite slightly flat and slow moving. That it's original, however, you can't deny.Watch out for Hilary Duff's little sister Haylie as teen queen Summer.",Napoleon Dynamite

This was Heder's first full movie, he previously acted in the short film, Peluca, which he directed and acted in. Napoleon Dynamite is about a grandmother (Sandy Martin) and her two sons Kip (Aaron Ruell) and Napoleon. Kip is a 32 year old bachelor living at home who spends most of his waking time chatting on internet chat rooms with women. Kip is also training to be a cage fighter and pairs up with Uncle Rico (Jon Gries), who lives in a van, to sell products door to door. Kip needs money to visit his online girlfriend and Rico is living in his past. (Aren't we all?) Napoleon is bullied in school and escapes to a daydream world of doodling fantasy genre. He meets two friends at school; Deb and Pedro, that are like him and not part of the in-crowd. Napoleon helps Pedro run for class president against popular girl Summer (Haylie Duff). Napoleon Dynamite beginning's were at the Sundance Film Festival found by Paramount Pictures and Fox Searchlight Pictures in association with MTV. It has achieved a cult following of fans.

The character of Napoleon could be more... could be funny, but is another stereotype of the dork and nerd that don't make laugh. I don't now in the name of God, how the director shot ""The Wedding of Pedro"" What was he thinking??? That Mexican actor deserves the Razzie Award for Worst Worst World Wide Actor...

That's not what I was expecting from it or what I wanted from it. After hearing some people say that the humor is in the tone of the dialog and not the dialog itself, I -- being a film masochist, I guess -- watched it again hoping to gain newfound understanding of the content. Upon second viewing, I didn't laugh or chuckle. If anything the movie is depressing. It revolves around a group of throughly unlikable characters in not-so-believable situations. It also attempts some ""white people acting black jokes"" like they haven't been done before. Retreading such cliché material seriously undermines the ""hip"" style and angle that the movie, to a fault, seemed to be reaching for.

190,Medacakathareal,Best Comedy of 2004,10,23 December 2004,"Out of all the movies of 2004 none of them sticks out in my mind more than Napoleon Dynamite, one of the best comedies ever made. I would like to first of all say that this film is most certainly set in the 90's/2000s (although i'd put my bet on the 90's) because Kip is on an online Chat talking to Lawfawnduh and the internet was not used by too many civilians in the 80's. The movie is ridiculously funny and is about a bunch of misfit characters somehow living through their droll lives in a small desert town. I'd have to say that besides Napoleon himself my favorite character has to be Rex master of his own Rex Quon Do... the funniest part of the film for me is when Rex says. ""You think anyone wants a roundhouse kick to the face when i'm wearing these babies."" (gestures to his American Flag pants). This movie is an automatic 8 out of 10 and the best comedy I've seen this year and definitely the weirdest.

191,ravsten428,"Worst day of my life, what do you think?",8,24 August 2011,"There are two kinds of people in this world. People who love Napoleon Dynamite and people who hate it. I happen to be one of those that loves it.Napoleon Dynamite was made with a small budget but still manages to make a good movie. This movie was filmed in the small town of Preston, Idaho. The story revolves around the life of high school student Napoleon Dynamite and his daily torments from other classmates who find him strange, especially so after he gives his current event about Nessie being blown out of the water and his hunting escapade with wolverines.Over the course of the movie Napoleon meets new students and makes friends with them. One of his friends Pedro runs for School President and ends up beating the snobby Summer Wheatley after Napoleon saves his skit after Pedro's speech. One of the funniest parts of the film is where Pedro has a piñata that looks just like Summer and he and some other students beat it. Of course this lands Pedro in the principals office but he isn't disqualified but is told to watch what he is doing during the rest of the campaign. Napoleon also befriends a girl named Deb who is kind of shy and reserved but we all know that they will end up together at the end of the film.To sum it up. Napoleon Dynamite isn't for everybody. It isn't an action packed film with big special effects but rather a story about a bunch of friends making it through the purgatory known as high school. Most everybody I know in my family and also my friends loved this film. The only person who didn't like it ended up being a former boyfriend who wasn't worth my time. Go figure.Napoleon Dynamite is a good film. Not a classic but still very enjoyable.",Napoleon Dynamite
192,Knuckle,Tedious,1,22 November 2006,"How do you make a movie like Napoleon Dynamite? First, steal a name, preferably a cool one from a source that you HOPE is obscure enough that no one will notice. Second, take a shtick, let's say a mumbling, whining stereotypical geek, and stretch that one-note gag to the absolute limits of your audience's endurance. Third, tune your marketing to capture the limited imaginations of gullible twenty-somethings and voilà - You have one of the world's most overrated movies ever! John Heder fronts this cinematic car accident as the title character Elvis Costello, oops, I mean, Napoleon Dynamite (""We didn't know!"" Suuurre...) and hems and haws his lines in an attempt to make us believe he's acting. He dances badly in a scene that goes on way too long and then throws in a nod to Eric Anderson's childlike illustrations and Ghostworld with drawings of his own! See? He's hip! He can swipe from the cool kids, too! Jared Hess is the vacuous mental midget responsible for writing and directing this, although I can see evidence of neither in the finished product. Shots are poorly framed, actors ramble their lines off badly, and what lines appear to be intentional are so bad as to give a black eye to the English language as a whole.All in all, it's hardly worth the time to ignore and certainly not at all worth the time to watch.1 out of 10",Napoleon Dynamite

194,joeravioli,Dynamite,10,25 July 2016,"In order to truly understand the nature of this film, one must examine its title. Napoleon Dynamite is just that: Dynamite. The film is a wonderful collection of strange, zany pockets of narrative explosive, each brimming with a tantalizing anarchism that somehow manages to remain grounded in reality. The hero -- who has by now become my hero -- is a ruthlessly lethargic nerd, his hair a curly red mess and his face the portrait of lassitude. And yet, despite the distaste one would expect for such an ugly fellow, it is almost impossible not to fall in love with his glorious little quirks.Napoleon Dynamite revolves around its titular character, and his strange and comical interactions with the people and world around him. It follows a thin narrative that isn't so much a narrative as an excuse to propel each hilarious moment forward in a logical manner. In truth, the film is composed of moments, not plot. There are a few aspects that serve as a sort of makeshift narrative, including Napoleon's interactions with Pedro, Deb, and Uncle Rico, but it seems as if this is done solely out of necessity. This doesn't mean that there isn't any sense of progression, because there is. It's just not that important when stacked up against the film's wonderful free spirit.However, the film isn't a masterpiece until the credits have finished rolling and you return to the DVD's menu screen. It is only then that you realize what the director has done, which is this: He has gathered together a troop of extremely strange and vulnerable characters, and has done the unthinkable: Let them alone. Despite each character's obvious ridiculousness, they are never taken advantage of, subject to cruelty or humiliated. They are never, ever shaken from their idyllic little existences, even though doing so would be simple and likely quite funny. And best of all, Hess does what Jon Hughes could not do: he doesn't force his characters to change. By the end of the film, everyone is the same as they were at the beginning, except (perhaps) a little older. And that is where the beauty of the film resides. It has a terrifying capacity for cruelty, but never succumbs to it, demonstrating a beautiful tenderness that is quite rare in modern cinema. Hess foregoes profundity, meaning, and progression all in the name of compassion.And that is why, with no hesitation at all, I can say with confidence that Napoleon Dynamite is the greatest film I have ever seen.",Napoleon Dynamite

196,segratz,A love/hate relationship,10,21 June 2004,"When I was watching Napoleon Dynamite I hated it at first - but as the movie climaxed in a weird and surreal sequence I have to say that I suddenly liked it. I have thought about so many aspects of the story, and my family and I have quoted Napoleon over and over. There is something about Napoleon that sticks with you . It is definitely is an independent, and it is less of a movie than small skits all put together for an overall picture of strange rural peoples' lives. It seems to end with quick closure as if they had to put it all the together somehow, but I didn't mind that so much. So how will you know if you will like this movie? If you like short skits with bizarre characters who deliver weird and hilarious lines with deadpan faces. Don't expect a lot of action or a complete story. It's a character piece on Napoleon for sure - and you may end up hating his persona. Or, loving it. I'm still having a love/hate relationship with the whole thing.",Napoleon Dynamite

Roger Ebert also compared it to Welcome to the Dollhouse and was convicted in his conviction that Napoleon Dynamite didn't show the ""anger"" of the former.Drama over here. Comedy over there. We can't expect the same depth and analysis from our comedies that we expect from dramas. That's why they are comedies. Laugher is never that deep especially on the screen. It usually has one point to make, and keeps making it. I am not a great fan of comedies, how many great comedies are there really? But Napoleon Dynamite is a great endearing film, with interesting characters and a whole lot of textured nostalgia. If its goodness escapes you, you have either lived too long, or aged in the wrong way. If you are a teenager and you don't like it, then go find a drama to watch somewhere because you will be hard-pressed to find a better comedy anywhere else. I only hold back the last star because of the ""Forced indie quirkiness"" which is essentially the editing of this film, which I think is a mistake. Why not edit it straight and let us enjoy the scenes without calling attention to themselves? I think the film suffers a little more than a little for this. People don't like this film for mostly one of two reasons: They criticize the plot or lack of character development. There are two solutions to this bogus opinion: Change your thinking regarding expectations for comedies or get a detox, you've lived too long.",Napoleon Dynamite

He's this ""geeky"" kid who doesn't care what anybody thinks about him. He has an uncle that comes and visits him for awhile and uses Napoleon and his brother for a place to stay. Napoleon also meets Pedro in school who pretty much doesn't have any friends except for Napoleon.

As a disclaimer, I would definitely say that it's not for everyone. It's basically a really goofy comedy that tries to immerse the viewer in its odd little world, and plays the ridiculous characters off of the straight-man background.Napoleon Dynamite has undeniable staying power, and its fans will keep coming back to it year after year. That's what sets this movie apart for me: it resonates with its audience. Forget its quotability, its fun, and its enjoyment, Napoleon Dynamite tapped into the soul of its audience, both the losers and the popular kids, but especially those who felt like they didn't have any clue what they were doing with their young lives as well as those who felt that way growing up. If you go into thinking that it's a character study who is going to make a journey or this, that, or the other thing, you're going to be disappointed.

I flippantly said ""sure"" took the dvd home when he gave it to me and proceeded never to watch it. My wife, having nothing to watch one day watched it and said it was surprisingly funny so I finally yielded and watched it. It was instantly one of my favorite comedies of all time. Quirky, odd, irreverent and completely offbeat but in such a warmhearted and good natured way.

It is a quirky, odd movie with quirky, odd characters with funny moments, but the plot line is a little weak which basically consists of Napolean trying to get a date to the prom and Pedro running for class president, with a subplot of Napolean's uncle & brother trying to make money. So I'll understand why some people will love this movie and why some will hate it. I've seen it several times now, and while the funny parts do make me laugh (like the scene were Kip tries to run over the Tupperware bowl and the scene where they try out the time machine), it's not a constant laugh fest and the plot is still a bit weak.

The acting was bad, but I will be a little less hard on that issue since this is a low budget movie. But, one thing you can do without counting on some big money, is actually work on the script.

203,mrtimlarabee,"Great idea, but...",3,9 May 2006,"Watching Napoleon Dynamite was a rather odd experience. On one end, I like the idea of a lovable loser - someone who doesn't really fit in, adheres to the social misfit stereotype, and really doesn't complain. I've written things about this type of character - and even lived a bit of it myself. For that reason, this seems like the type of movie I would enjoy.However, Napoleon Dynamite never extends beyond being a ""lovable loser"" and seems quite flat. Maybe it's that I felt that my high school struggles of being a misfit were poorly portrayed or maybe it's that I felt that this character wasn't really someone I cared for all that much.This is what makes the film work and not work. The film doesn't have a plot and relies on this chief character and all these other characters to make the film interesting. The fact that there is no real plot doesn't matter to me that much. I love that stuff. Jarmusch does it, and he's great. Linklater does it even better. What doesn't work is that these characters, save some ubiquitous catchphrases, are rather flat. I walked away from the film, without a smile, not caring about a single one of the characters.A movie without a plot works only if the characters work or there is a greater use and execution of dialog. I didn't feel there was any of this. I liked the idea of focusing on someone who doesn't fit in and doesn't exactly succeed in the end at anything, except in being himself. If we don't like that person, however, does that even matter? Someone I worked with was remarking how they bought a Napoleon Dynamite quote book, because they liked the quotes so much. I told them I found the movie kind of stupid. This person agreed, only saying that it had some really funny quotes though.

205,cpbadgeman,I hated this film so much.,1,8 April 2007,"This film is just terrible. It is completely unfunny and deathly dull. What passes for a plot is centered around the title character, a high-school uber-loser from a family of oddballs. His life revolves around petty squabbles with his uncle and brother, unfulfilled yearnings for various girls, and his best friend Pedro's campaign to get elected school president (though this part only gets going after what feels like an eternity). All of this could have been made into a really quirky, funny offbeat comedy like 'Rushmore' or 'Election'. It so doesn't turn out that way.John Heder does a good job of portraying the eponymous Napoleon but his character is just so unlikeable. Loser-heroes in this kind of film always have some quality which makes it clear that they are really winners in disguise and Mr Dynamite doesn't have this. He is not only a failure, but a bland and boring failure who is just annoying. It's impossible to feel any empathy for him always getting the short end of the stick because, well, losers lose. The rest of the cast depict played-out stereotypes (the jock bully, the Queen Bitch cheerleader) or witless caricatures. The only character I felt anything for was Deb, poignantly portrayed by Tina Majorino.A couple of moments do strike a genuine emotional chord (the High School dance scene in particular) and it's nice to hear a few obscure New Wave classics on the soundtrack. But the 'humor' in this movie is so subtle as to be non-existent. I had the idea that this was one of those under-the-radar gems that was shunned by an ignorant mass audience but adored by everyone who saw it. I couldn't have been more wrong. This film is a complete and utter waste of time. It is the worst film, bar none, that I have seen in years.",Napoleon Dynamite

One gets the feeling that the script wasn't labored over as much as it was probably schemed up one night over a case of beer and a couple of writers saying, ""remember the time..."", a whole lot. It nails down teenage awkwardness to some degree, but really doesn't have anything substantive to say about it. The most glaring anachronisms appear when a cell phone rings or people make mention of the internet, even though the whole movie appears to take place sometime in the mid-80s (and this is not just the central character, since all the music, costumes, etc of all the characters scream Reagan-era). In the end, this would've made a great short, but here it runs about an hour too long.

This movie draws us into his odd collection of friends and relatives who are just as f-ed up as he is. Jon Gries-the twitchy, bug-eyed character actor,plays his alienated uncle who lives in a van on a lonely road. Tina Majorino plays Napoleon's ""love interest""-if Napoleon could ever get up the courage to tongue-kiss her into submission. Pedro is his English-challenged Spanish-speaking friend who befriends him, even though Napoleon, and Pedro, are social-anathema to the groovy upwardly mobile girls such as ""Summer"". Napoleon of course is the ""most grooviest"" guy in this upside-down character study, which relentlessly champions the weirdness of the outsiders, in a farm town in Idaho. Napoleon's brother Kip, a stringy, slim, and pathetically pale creature lives on the Internet with his gilrfriend, a hot babe from some faroff place. This movie follows Napoleon, his brother and uncle down their very weird path to success. Think Tupperware. The plastic food container of the future. This movie is not about plot but about the weird reality of rural life. A rural life which shines with intense and joyful glory. It's about a boy who tries to be a man. This movie is a poem.

It's sort of the typical geeks overcome movie, like Revenge of the Nerds (1984), Weird Science (1985), The Breakfast Club (1985), and the excellent Better Off Dead (1985). But it's different enough and that it's an interesting story with eccentric characters helping to overcome the similarities.I think the Napoleon character is one most people can relate too. Sort of the dork, fish out of water, nerd geek who's not really defenseless but just unsure of himself. Pedro, the new misfit to the school, is befriended by Napoleon and welcomed into his very small group of friends. Together, they spawn a few various adventures of obtaining dates for prom and overcoming bullies.The other characters are a little less realistic, for example Grandma, Kip, and Uncle Rico. They're all interesting, but strange to the point of not really being believable. Uncle Rico reminds me a lot of a mix between David from Dazed and Confused (1993) and Kasey Kelso from ""That 70's Show"". He plays the older guy that hangs around the younger characters and tries to dominate them.The only real let down is the end of the story, which has Napoleon getting the girl, the new misfit being elected class President, and generally everything working out for Napoleon. It's very reminiscent of Revenge of the Nerds (1984), where the nerds become the head of the Greek Counsel, the nerds get the girls, and etc. It's not that it's bad or ruins the movie, it was just sort of what was expected. I guess the movie was different enough, that I expected the ending would be different too. The entire story echoes Better Off Dead (1985) as well.A great flick, very enjoyable, very funny. Make sure to let the movie finish playing after the credits. If you enjoyed this movie, you should watch the other's I've referenced.8/10",Napoleon Dynamite

215,horsegoggles,Hooked on this movie!,10,3 October 2006,"I think this is the most creative film I have seen in years. I'm in my 60s and I heard this was a kid's movie, so I decided to give it a try just to check out my ageOmeter. The first 5 minutes took me off guard, and I assumed I pegged the meter. When I reset my thinking processes to preteen, or second childhood, I'm not sure which, I started cracking up. Off the wall, simple, unpredictable, but mostly just plain funny. The characters were insane, but grounded in a small town reality. I'm not sure how to describe the humor, it had a freshness to it that I would like to see catch on. It was probably the cleanest film made in the last 20 years, and obviously on purpose. I can't think of anything bad to say about it, so I won't try.",Napoleon Dynamite
216,silva-w-pius,Vote for Pedro,7,28 March 2014,"If by now you still don't know where the quote 'Vote for Pedro' means on the shirt of every hipster in the history of mustache sporting, ironic tee wearing and obscure band that no one's has ever heard of listening hipster. Or if you still mistake the name Napoleon for a 4ft French guy, then you my friend have not lived life. So instead of you thinking of going out; sky diving, riding on the back of an elephant or falling in love, I strongly suggest to place watching Napoleon dynamite as number one on your bucket list or things to do before you die list. And if you don't immerse yourself in this Wes Anderson fused with David Lynch dysfunctional misfits paradise; your missing out on laughs galore, immensely cringe moments, catchy dialogue and the most impressive dance number in history of film, like ever; Flash Dance and Footloose you should be ashamed! Growing up can be a very awkward and difficult experience, combine with this you have to navigate yourself through the superficial merciless social jungle that is high school, where around every corner a pimple, the school bully or a rejection from the popular girl in school threaten destroy the very last thread of cool you have any hopes of clinging on too for dear life; being a teenager can be hell at times! Then you have Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder) who is so uncool even to the extent he is oblivious to everyone's meaning of cool, he almost seems cool. Actually the guy likes Lamar's, eats tater tots from his pocket and draws Ligers all day long, on second thoughts just forget what I said. But unlike American pie or the Big bang theory, to him he is the coolest guy on earth, and it's the cluelessness which makes him and his band of weirdo's such cult icons, hanging out with them would be like hanging out with a cross between living with the Adams family and the Simpsons; you have Debbie a painfully awkward teenage girl with an obsession with Napoleon, Pedro a new student from Mexico, whose thick bushy mustache makes him look more like a teacher than a student, Kip who has a love affair with a girl he meet online and then you have uncle Rico who will take any opportunity to turn useless junk into a money making scheme; a time machine made of tin foil? Yeah right! Upon release, Napoleon Dynamite was monster hit, a modern day Rocky; made on just $400,000 but despite this modest budget, went on to gross well over $40 million dollars. Inspiring stories like this goes to show that the little guy might still have a chance of coming out on top in this multi million dollar blockbuster world. All of this in the hands of first time directors Jared and Jerusha Hess fresh out of university. Just like film like Ghost World, Clerks and Royal Tenenbaums the characters are off the wall crazy, and the jokes are weird and strange, but it's this cult magic that never fails to put a smile on my face.",Napoleon Dynamite
217,Jakethemuss,A touching spectacle,8,29 September 2007,"I cannot really say this film has a plot, or has a message to get across. It is a lazy, easy going film perfect for chilling out too. As for the comedy, it is not forced or OTT, never loud or down right crude, but charming and sometimes subtle as it doesn't try too hard. It is a mixture of wacky ideas, amusing characters, unforgettable dance scenes and much more.Napoleon Dynamite is the name of the film's...errmm...hero? A fuzzy haired, dopey faced high school student who lives with his nerdy looking brother Kip in what seems to be a fairly sparse rural town somewhere in Idaho. The film focuses mainly on the cute relationships he forms with those he comes into contact with. There is the equally dopey faced Pedro, a Mexican student, in fact the only non-white person at the school, and Deb, a slightly mysterious girl with an interest in fashion. Then there is the wannabe business man Uncle Rico, who comes to 'supervise' the 2 Dynamite boys in their Grandma's absence. Rico is living in the past, and is reduced to filming himself throwing a football into empty air and watching it for kicks, after failing to become the football star he hoped to be.The relationship between Napoleon and Pedro is priceless, right down to the facial expressions and bodily movements. It is almost like Napoleon and Pedro are on a different level to the rest of the school populous. It is amazing what can be accomplished when 2 nerds combine and get the cogs turning.There are plenty of 80's/early 90's cultural references to be enjoyed as well, such as some of the debatable fashion on show, skinny white boys in gaudy jewellery body popping and Mexican's bouncing around in shiny souped up low riders amongst other things.Seriously, it is hard not to like this film.",Napoleon Dynamite

I am 48 and thought it was possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. I walked out after about 40 minutes (caught the rest of 2nd Bourne movie (hadn't seen the first)). I used rottentomatoes.com to check the reviews, and most of them liked it, so I went. I now realize that I can never go by the reviewers' opinions, especially if most of them like a movie. I kept waiting for the humor to start, and it never did. It is difficult for me to like most movies now, since I've been watching them for ~40 years, and there isn't much I haven't seen before.",Napoleon Dynamite
219,schmimic,This movie gives me a serious case of the jibblies from how horrible it is.,3,23 April 2005,"Starring: Jon Heder I watched this movie around Christmas with my mom. I'm pretty sure it said somewhere on the case that it was supposed to be a comedy, but I really didn't see much comedy in it anywhere. I think I smirked twice throughout the movie. Mainly at the milk pickup line for those who don't know what it is ""Hey. I see you're drinking 1%. Is that cuz you think you're fat? Cuz you're not. You could drink whole milk."" Yeah, I'll have to use that one someday. But back to the matter at hand. This movie defies all genres. There is no genre for total and absolute crap that has no point. If there was, this would be the defining movie of that genre.Basically it's about one nerd's struggle (Heder) to find a place in the society of high school. Along the way he makes friends with a Mexican kid named Pedro who can grow a 'stash. And there's a girl. Or two. But yeah. I mean, it's a movie celebrating what it's like to be a nerd. There is no point. It's just painful to watch. It's just man, it's indescribable. This movie is like no other movie out there. This is the Seinfeld of the cinematic world, only not in the least bit funny. Oh look, he has a nasty fro. Ha ha. He has ugly glasses. Ha ha. His brother is a thirty some odd year old nerd who spends all his time online. Ha ha. (rolls eyes) I'm going to keep this at a short review because it's not worth me wasting time and effort putting words to it.I wouldn't wipe my crack with this movie.Bottom Line: 1.5 out of 4 (maybe if you're really really drunk)",Napoleon Dynamite

221,AW_McGOWAN,"""Napoleon Dynamite"" Not Just A Comedy",6,27 November 2020,"Every time I watch ""Napoleon Dynamite,"" I am struck by its humanity. For most of the film, everything feels inconsequential, even dumb. But come the final scene, I am reminded of the subtle, yet strong message at hand, and realize how deeply I've come to know the characters.""Napoleon Dynamite"" is about people that most of the world would call losers. The titular protagonist is a beyond-awkward high schooler with surreal aesthetics and interests. His pal Pedro is a quiet newcomer to the school with no friends. Brother Kip Dynamite is a grown man who still lives with his grandmother and searches the Internet for his soul mate. Even the antagonist, Uncle Rico, is an ambitious man crutched by aching nostalgia and a desire to find love.The film follows these one-of-a-kind characters as their worlds collide in what seems to be the most boring part of Idaho. Filmed entirely on-location, it almost feels like director Jared Hess puts a magnifying glass on a fly-over part of the country, showing that people actually live in these remote areas and although their lives area little different, their hearts beat all the same.Filmically, ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is a very simple piece of work. Its independent spirit is reminiscent of Kevin Smith's ""Clerks"" or Richard Linklater's ""Slacker."" The camera hardly ever moves and the editing remains functional throughout. Quite frankly, it's the kind of movie that any amateur filmmaker could put together.Thus, what distinguishes ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is the script. Written by Jared and his wife Jerusha, the story is charmingly episodic, and the characters are unforgettable. Each on-screen person is utterly unique, and they offer some of the most quotable lines in comedy-movie history.Jon Heder, of course, has the best one-liners. His performance as Napoleon is quite underrated, as he essentially created a new archetype here. It's hard to imagine being told to play Napoleon Dynamite before Napoleon Dynamite existed, but Heder nails it. I'm convinced that nobody else - not even the most accomplished thespian - could have done Napoleon better than Heder.As seemingly pointless as ""Napoleon Dynamite"" can feel throughout, there is a quiet redemption for all the characters in the end, which leaves the audience feeling good. It demonstrates that even these painfully strange, lowest-brow figures can find happiness.Honestly, I didn't understand this movie when I first watched it - I found the humor stupid and the story meaningless- but as I've become more versed in independent cinema, I've come to realize it as more than just a comedy. Every time I return to the film, I not only find it funnier, but I also find it more touching. Even if the awkward humor or flat storyline isn't for everyone, there is still something to be appreciated in ""Napoleon Dynamite"" - even if it's just the (undervalued) soundtrack.",Napoleon Dynamite
222,el_nickster,Unflattering but sweet look at high school in America.,10,31 March 2005,"I loved this movie for its unglamorized but affectionate portrayal of high school, and particularly the socially-maladjusted high school student. The film is about Napolean, a dork of limited means and no social graces, as he learns from his buddy Pedro to be more confident and more considerate. At the same time, he is cutting his teeth against his domineering uncle. This is the real social deficiency people have growing up that Hollywood generally ignores: we like to think of kids as sweet and caring, but growing up really means shedding your self-centered tendencies and learning to care about those around you. Napolean is not Hollywood nerd who builds crazy inventions or who is overbrimming with creative projects. He is the kind we all actually know: he won't make eye contact, he is too nervous to make conversation, he assumes that people won't like him, and he makes up stories about himself, because he thinks the truth is inadequate. If you see a lot of ""10s"" on the graph, it is the genuine nature of the characters that people are voting on.",Napoleon Dynamite

It was not exactly what I expected it to be. It seems to me that the meaning of the film is not just to amuse it's audience by every line that is said but also to relate the audience strongly to the odd characters in it.I like this film because it sets a great message. It just makes you realize that the people around you are far from perfect and that you don't have to compete with everyone so strongly.However some people will pretty much hate this film.I must admit I also found the characters annoying at some point but at least the creators of this film know when enough is enough and throw in a new character or slowly start to change the course of the action....... +3/5 ......,Napoleon Dynamite

He befriends a new kid Pedro, who is Mexican and has an amazing bike and a mustache. They both befriend a hardworking girl called Deb, together they seemed like misfits to the school. The first half of the movie is about going to the movie and the second half is about Pedro trying to be the Class President, these arcs give us this amazing witted comedy with a perfect ending.The casting was just spot on, the acting was just the best, the music was spectacular, just brilliant.

I wasn't looking for a socially redeeming moral and what I found instead was a really good movie about socially inept friends sticking together. I enjoy dry humor and this movie was full of it. The facial expressions, or rather the lack of expressions only added to the movie. Kip and LaFawnduh were hilarious as was Uncle Rico. It was the correct blend of cast and story and they pulled it off. I would be careful about recommending this movie. The viewer needs to have an off-beat sense of humor and enjoy Coen brother films. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to anyone with the afore mentioned sense of humor, and to anyone wishing to escape for a few minutes and live the nightmarish existence of a true nerd.

229,PenOutOfTime,"A cultural and character template, not a strongly plotted event comedy",8,11 January 2007,"A filmmaker normally sets out to tell a story, and tell that story effectively. This seems an obvious point, but in telling their stories effectively, Hollywood filmmakers have developed conventions and cinematic tropes that separate the world of film from reality. These storytelling tropes are placed in an artificial environment painted in broad strokes that fail somehow to capture the fine grain of life or the details of an era.Napoleon Dynamite falls neatly in place to bridge the gap between Hollywood and reality, and this is its charm. The awkward silences or ill stated remarks in everyday speech, the fads, minor obsessions, and slang of a given era, and the texture and style of the world that people really live in are all brought to the front in this film, rather than being airbrushed into the background.This film is something of a 'period piece' or a 'costume drama' set in the 80's with its lovingly detailed paraphernalia and clothing, and this combines with the small scale of events and naturalistically choppy and truncated dialogue to make the film an intensely nostalgic experience for someone who was young in that decade. In fact, while just as in real life, the date, and currentness are extremely important in shaping that moment, the fact that Napoleon Dynamite displays a side of American life that is little shown on screen makes this film seem to be in some ways intensely realistic across eras, even in the face of fairly broad parody. On a cultural level, Napoleon Dynamite is a truly great film, and there is little like it.There is a flip side to this however. Great strength in one area is often matched by weakness in another, and Napoleon Dynamite has an inconsequential plot, with elements that do not always bear close scrutiny. A sound and interesting plot is rightly held to be of enormous importance in a film, and to enjoy Napoleon Dynamite, you have to be able to appreciate it on another level, being socially sensitive, and in tune with the era, for while this film is socially one of the most realistic you will ever see, the characters both do not wear their emotions on their sleeves for display, and do wear the most parodiable garments for display. The dialogue is distinctive for its accuracy in tone and term, but this means that characters often communicate poorly, and indeed much of the humor in this film is in that fact.To sum up, this is a film that appeals to people almost as much by permitting them to see the humor in their own lives as it makes them laugh at the events on screen. If you are looking to laugh uproariously at what you SEE, and right away, you would be better off finding a different film. Napoleon Dynamite relies upon your own past memories, and can serve as a cultural and character template for future events, but is not a strongly plotted event comedy.",Napoleon Dynamite

I've heard people going on and on about ""oh, it's a great character piece"" but what happens when I don't like any of the characters on the screen?

It is really odd and different from what I expected from comedies that have come out lately. I don't think it's because of it's lack of crude humor either. All the characters are really odd and deadpan. Maybe that's why, cause everyone is so deadpan, and it reminds me a bit of Buster Keaton's film characters (ok it's a bit of a stretch)The simple fact is that I enjoyed it.

232,sublime501,Hilarious stupid humor.,8,18 July 2004,"NAPOLEON DYNAMITE is the charming story of a small-town boy of the same name (Jon Heder), who is, by definition, a bonafide geek. He doesn't have any real friends and his schoolmates enjoy laughing at him. One day he meets a new student named Pedro (Efren Ramirez), and the two become friends. Napoleon and Pedro go on many adventures, including trying to go after the same girl, Deb (Tina Majorino), and trying to help Pedro win the title of Class President against the popular Summer (Haylie Duff). The two form a great friendship and an inseparable bond.Okay, so the last part is exaggerated. But NAPOLEON DYNAMITE is a very enjoyable, feel-good comedy that is just jam-packed with laughs. Of course it's incredibly silly, and it's not trying to be a great film. It's meant to be one of those films that you can just sit back and enjoy, not having to think much. And it's one of the best of those kind. It's so silly, but with a very sweet undertone.Almost all of the jokes are hilarious, and it's cast perfectly. Jon Heder is perfect in his role as the geeky, awkward title character--halfway through the film, you won't be able to even look at him without cracking up. You also won't be able to picture anyone else in his role--he captures it perfectly. Aaron Ruell is also hilarious in the same way as Napoleon's brother Kip, whose only source to the outside world is the chatrooms he visits daily. Jon Gries is okay as Uncle Rico--not really funny, but more pedophilically creepy. Efren Ramirez and Tina Majorino do very well as Napoleon's friends as well.NAPOLEON DYNAMITE is a very silly movie, but very funny and very enjoyable as well.

Jon Heder should never, ever step in front of the camera again. His lack of talent and skill is overly apparent in this film. The plot is as thin as Lara Flynn Boyle. This movie reminded me of what happens when bored teenagers get together and there are no parents around to stop them from doing absolutely ridiculous things. This is how the script must have come about, there were several bored people in a room with a notebook and a pen.I can't believe this movie became a hit. Why people would want to watch this is beyond me. I didn't even finish the movie because it annoyed me so badly.

John Heder's performance as the central character is amazing (look at the way he runs). His awkwardness with others, and the awkwardness of a girl who is obviously attracted to him, ring true. There were many extremely funny moments (I particularly liked the way the bully was scared off), and the subplot with Napoleon's even more nerdy brother was entertaining, especially his interaction with Uncle Rico, the nitwit ex-jock forever wanting to get back to 1982 (a good gag here which I won't reveal).

238,highkite,One of the funniest movies ever created.. with some of the best one-liners!,9,31 July 2006,"This is a movie that really takes a risk in comedy film-making. It's one that you either love or hate. Moreso hate if you're a pompous prick who can't handle anything other than classical Asian cinema and anything by Bergman and Fellini. ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is just what the name implies, a movie about a guy. Not really a normal guy, that wouldn't be funny at all. But not really an interesting guy either. Had I only thought about this idea, I'd have pictured a movie set in the 1920s where people weren't interesting at all compared to today, but still fun to watch and compare just how ridiculously boring they all were. In this case it's totally different. Napoleon (Jon Heder) is either living in the 80s or it's actually set in the 80s. We can't tell and it makes it all the more bizarre. He walks around, throws action figures out the window of a moving bus, doodles little creatures in his book, holds nonsense presentations in class and almost subconsciously lies about irrelevant things ('I told you! I was in Alaska with my uncle hunting wolverines!').This is a story about your typical.. err, plain adolescent life in high school. Napoleon's grandmother breaks a bone and his self-centered uncle shows up, eats all of their stakes and makes Napoleon look like ""A friggin' IDIOT!"" The rest of the cast is also unaware of their own existence. As you sit there watching Pedro (Efren Ramirez) mumbling his words and shaving his head because he's hot, you soon realize that this is just as hilarious as it is unique. Napoleon's brother Kip (Aaron Ruell) chats online with ""babes... all day long"" and does nothing around the house, even though he's 32 and lives with his grandmother. Nothing these characters do has anything to offer in advancing the plot, but it still works. We still want to watch and observe these alien-like creatures.I could write a whole paper on just how funny some of the quotes are from the movie, my favorite being ""What the heck are you even talking about!"" But to do so would be more fun for me and less fun for anybody else. What this movie has going for it isn't the depth of the plot, or direction or even the screenplay. It's the amazing and unforgettable performance from not just Jon Heder (though he may be the most memorable one), but also Aaron Ruell, Jon Gries as Uncle Rico, Efren Ramirez and Tina Majorino. This ensemble cast morph into their characters and play them as if they've lived them all their lives.For many this is a movie that makes no sense. To me, it's a movie that makes perfect sense: we live under constant fear, and we need some sort of bizarre random humor to take our minds off everything from 9/11 to the end of the world! It's smart not to get too deep into this movie because you'll get so lost it would make your head spin. Instead, enjoy it as it is. A goofy comedy that offers some quotes that you can throw back and forth with your friends, and compete to see who can remember more. In the end, this isn't really a movie as much as it is an experience. You watch it and you talk to your friends about it for hours. That's what I call a talentless masterpiece.",Napoleon Dynamite
239,Tikanjiah,A brat-pack without the brats,8,17 September 2005,"Just like any Sunday afternoon nothing-else-to-do movies, you'll wonder why you'll like this movie so much - but you will.This movie reminded me of the reasons I loved such movies as The Breakfast Club. It's funny even though it's not funny, it's touching even though it's not touching, and it's refreshing even though it's not that original. But, it's not automatic that you'll like this one even if you liked the brat-pack movies.I waited a long time to see this movie, and after wondering why, I did realize that I had to be in the right mood to enjoy this movie. The characters are very compelling, and that's pretty much the only reason you should see the movie. It's the kind of movie you love to watch when you're so bored you don't know what to do with yourself. Either way, this movie doesn't disappoint simply because it has nothing to live up to but itself.",Napoleon Dynamite
240,aatx1154,Not as good as you think....,3,9 February 2005,"OK After weeks about hearing how funny and good this film was I finally watched it. It has to be one of the most overrated films of 2004. There was no plot, no cohesive elements, and the comedy was only sporadic at best. The film drags on endlessly at the mercy of the main character and his antics. The character of Napoleon Dynamite starts of funny only because he is a unique film character. After fifteen minutes the joke of Napoleon turns old. The other characters seem to be invented solely for trying to outdo the other ones based on over the topness. Yes this movie was original and different but not in a good way.Grade: D-",Napoleon Dynamite
241,toddrandall68,Its sweet...its awesome...........its..............incredible.,10,26 December 2005,"I never thought that a stupid movie could be as enjoyable and hilarious as ""Napoleon Dynamite."" It reminded me of ""Seinfeld."" It was about nothing! ""Napoleon's"" lack of a personality was so lovable. I had about given up on American comedies, then along comes ""Napoleon Dynamite."" I highly recommend it. It was so incredibly absurd, you got to see it to believe it. What better way to capture a ""complete zero"" like ""Napoleon"" than to write a ""complete zero"" script (and thats what was so great about it.) ""Napoleon"" is my hero, my sophomore year picture even looked like ""Napoleon"" down to the blue T-shirt he wore in the opening scene, less than perfect teeth, and afro. ""Napoleon"" and ""Pedro"" were hilarious (especially in the scene with them hanging up posters with the ""A-Team"" theme song). My wife (who didn't know me in high school) told me that when she saw this movie, she instantly thought of all the silly stories I told her about my ""complete zero"" high school days. And this is also a movie for everyone, I watched it several times with my 4 year old (she loves ""Pedro""). We even watched it in Spanish on DVD, and still rolled over with laughter. I better get going because I don't want you to get jealous that ""I have been chatting online with babes all day,"" and ""I'm going to do 'whatever I feel like I want to do.........gosh!'"" I was the inspiration for the character ""Napoleon Dynamite,"" and I will believe that until the day I die.",Napoleon Dynamite

Well **** you, I think you're sick.Napoleon Dynamite is much worse than a boring collection of half-baked character sketches. It's a cruel mockery of people with Autism spectrum disorders very cleverly packaged as a quirky indie comedy.The whole movie frames it as not just acceptable but a foregone conclusion that I enjoy laughing at people who happen to be socially maladjusted, and easy targets of ridicule.THAT'S what people like me don't ""get"" about this movie. Being a stupid dick.Napoleon's uncle being weak-willed, vaguely homosexual, and funny-sounding doesn't make me want to laugh at him to boost my self-esteem. It annoys me and makes me want to tell him to commit to a martial art or something to increase his confidence.Napoleon taste-testing milk isn't charmingly quirky or funny to me. It's the writer's clever way of saying that Napoleon willfully drinks a white fluid -- jizz -- for the pleasure of other men. He's calling Napoleon a faggot with this scene. That's not comedy to me. It's just mean-spirited and makes me think the writer is a spoiled brat who wouldn't know adversity if it slapped him in the face and introduced itself.The football-playing dude who tries to go back in time with a machine that electrocutes his balls -- I get it, huh huh huh kicking an unpopular person in the balls is supposed to be funny.

244,FMACDONALD,This is one of the most over-hyped and terrible movies I have ever seen!!!,1,13 June 2005,"Napolean Dynamite is nothing but dynamite. Unless Dynamite is the slang word for awful. Everybody I know who has seen this movie has told I need to see it telling me it was my sense of humor and that it was just hysterical. I have to admit I never had much interest in it to begin with. I thought it looked terrible from all the commercials I seen when it was in the theatres. So i passed. Then all the buzz started. The reviews were amazing. A lot of my friends saw it and said it was funny as hell. I was in a play at the time it was being released on DVD and the whole cast was telling me that i had to see it. It had my type of humor. Very dry. I love dry humor, when it's done right. Napolean Dynamite is not dry humor done right. In fact even if it wasn't dry humor it still is a movie that is not done right. I love movies. All kinds of movies. Sci-Fi, Action, Horror, Drama, comedy. You name it I like it. However if I'm going to watch a movie for the love of all mankind please have a point to the film, or at least a plot. I felt as though I was watching bad Saturday Night Live commercial skits. There is no point to this movie what so ever. If someone asked me what it was about I wouldn't really be able to tell them. I guess If I had to try it would be Naplean Dynamite is a kid who is a misfit & he doesn't realize he is one. He befriends a kid in school named Pedro. He convinces Pedro to run for Class president. That's it. sounds like the synopsis of a great comedy John Cusack would have done back in the '80's when he did great films like Better Off Dead & One Crazy Summer. Well like i said it's not a great movie. It's horrible. There is nothing funny about this film at all. If anyone out there wants to see a great dry humor film done right i strongly suggest The Princess Bride. Napolean Dynamite is not this great film everyone seems to think it is. Seeing as how IMDb says I have to at least give this film a 1 that's what I rank it. If it were up to me I'd give Napolean Dynamite a 0 out of 10.",Napoleon Dynamite
245,schultzclan6,I don't see what's so funny about this movie,6,28 February 2006,"I gave this movie a 6/10. I mean, it had good points and bad points. Let me start with bad points.1. Dull characterization Napoleon, Pedro, and Trisha all seemed so dull and lifeless, it was not funny that way.2. Story moved along story It is so much better to have the characters' decisions effect the story than having the story deciding for them, which is why the characters had little development.3. No background music I know that basically all comedies do not have background music, but it would have made the film more lively.4. Pointless scenes The first couple of scenes, like the first one, and the wolverine and Loch Ness were all pointless pieces of the film that did not need to be added.Good points:1. Uncle Rico This character had the most character development by far, and thus, made him my favorite character.2. Kip Although he was a bit like Napoleon, he had more character development and an actual history, unlike Pedro, Napoleon, Trisha, and Pedro.3. Funniest parts were hilarious This movie was pretty funny, and its funniest scenes were some of my favorite comedic moments.4. Each string was pulled carefully There were some parts of the movie that were early that effected the story later on, making it genius (Rex Kwon Do, Rico trying the Bust-Must, Rex using his Rex Kwon Do- priceless)So, this movie was good and bad. The beginning was boring, the middle was okay, and the end was satisfying. I recommend it if you just feel like watching an enjoyable film for an hour and a half.",Napoleon Dynamite
246,Crannicus_Maximus,Waste of Time,2,31 March 2006,"Unless you are willing to waste your time watching an incredibly pointless, mundane, and awful flick, do NOT, under any circumstances, pick up a copy of Napoleon Dynamite.While I am perfectly entertained by movies about nothing (an example of this would be Clerks), Napoleon Dynamite seemed like nothing more than a bunch of old, worn out clichés being applied in a single script, and ninety percent of the punch lines were little more than pinches.Perhaps the best moment of the film (if you could really apply the word ""best"" to such a horrid piece of work), would be the orange-on-the-window shield.2/10",Napoleon Dynamite
247,MikeK1987,"Not funny. Just sad, racist, and incredibly boring.",1,19 January 2011,"If this is what living in a small backwoods town is like, then I feel terribly sorry for you. It must be horrible living in a world where Ponzi schemes from would be door-to-door salesmen run rampant; people have no emotions; the home furnishings, clothing and technology are still stuck in the early 80's, and foreigners are complete stereotypes. But since this is the real world and not Hollywood, it's safe to assume that small-town life isn't really like that.Poorly written script, terribly acted, and some parts of this film come off as a bit racist towards Mexicans! But I'll touch on more of that last subject later on in this review.I don't find a single character in this film that I can possibly relate to in any way. Napoleon's constant exclamations of ""gosh"" and ""idiot"" which everybody just happens to love for some reason, just aren't funny. And what is the point of him riding on the school bus with little kids and dragging action figures behind the bus, or his constant need for Chap-Stik?. I'm quite convinced that Napoleon and his brother Kip are both mentally deficient, and their grandmother is just plain neglectful, as is their Uncle Rico who's called upon to look after them after the grandmother gets hurt. Uncle Rico, especially, is a sad case indeed. A perennial loser who lives in a big orange van, just got dumped by his girlfriend, because he's still SO convinced that he could've been a major player in the NFL if he had just gotten his shot to play at a certain game in high school, who also is obsessed with filming and watching himself throw the football. Well, guess what, it didn't happen, and it never will, so quit dwelling on it, and boring us with your sob story! He's so sad that he buys a ""time machine"" to try and take him back to that fateful day, only to have it shock his balls and make him appear even dumber, because nobody has discovered time travel yet you idiot!Anyway, again about the terrible actors, not one actor in this film gives a good performance. Jon Heder and Tina Majorino especially! The so-called ""angry exchange"" between them 2 over the telephone has to be one of the worst acted scenes in all of cinema history! And don't tell me that they meant to do it that way. Nobody in the real world is that bereft of emotion even if they're on major prescription medication!And about what I was saying earlier about racism, look no further than Pedro! The most blatant Mexican stereotype I've ever seen! Not to mention his ""cousins with the sweet hookups"", who are portrayed as Chicano low-riders. This is the mid west suburbs, not East LA! Or how about Napoleon offering a fellow nerd ""Pedro's protection"", like automatically because he's Mexican that he's in a gang or something. Also the references to poorly pronounced Spanish or the snide comment made by the girl Summer towards Pedro about ""making the school have to eat tostadas for lunch next year"" or whatever she said. What was the point of that other than racism? I mean, I was offended, and I don't get offended by almost anything, and I'm not even Mexican or of any Spanish or Central-South American descent, but I know blatant racism parading as racial humor when I see it, and this is nowhere near racial humor.And on top of that, this film is just plain boring! There's no real plot, there's no real struggle, it's just boring! Boring, boring, boring, boring, boring! And did I mention that it's boring? Because yeah, it's REALLY boring! Boring!",Napoleon Dynamite

250,davidallenxyz,This film is DREADFUL! Why have so few people realised this?,1,4 August 2007,"I won't bother to summarise the plot.Suffice to say absurdist comedy would need to have some root in reality to create the contrast between the expected and the unexpected that makes one laugh.This film is not even close to being rooted in reality. Characters are dead-eyed and tedious, situations witless and tiresome.If taken as a work of pure surrealism it does not have the imagination or energy to qualify.Nicely composed imagery though.Avoid this one.",Napoleon Dynamite
251,mullermike,Make sure you watch this while you're in a good mood,10,30 May 2005,"You, the reader, are currently asking yourself ""self, why should I watch this movie while I'm in a good mood?"" No worries, I'll provide the answer for you. You should watch this movie while in a good mood because as a whole, it passes at a rather deadening pace. If you're in a good mood, you're more apt to laugh at scenes that actually are chucklesome, like when Napolean feeds his lama and keeps saying ""eat the food."" Such scenes are not overabundant in their hilarity and may be slightly strange, but you can't help but laugh. If you're in a good mood, you'll notice what a complete anti-social jerk Napolean is and be howling in laughter at his poor social skills. If you're in a good mood, you'll realize that there actually are people out there that are this strange and thank the good Lord that you aren't one of them.Jon Heder is hysterical as Napolean, an outcast teenager with few friends, a screwy family life, and very little excitement. It helps when he meets the new kid Pedro, the two barely speak in their conversations, but become friends because all they really have is each other, at least until Deb (Tina Majorino) enters the fold. Adding to the absurdity is Uncle Rico, an aging ex-high school quarterback whose life would have been SO different if he'd just taken state. Too bad he didn't play in the 4th quarter of that game, and more importantly, too bad that game took place in 1982. Jon Gries is absolutely perfect as this middle aged burnout/sleazy salesman who not only comes to live with Napolean but also lives in the past and literally tries to get back there. As the tension escalates between him and Napolean, the movie gets funnier, as the two try to slime each others reputations. Even though Kip (Aaron Ruell) tends to side with Uncle Rico through the squabbles, he's more interested in ""chatting with babes"" online, what a pimp. Man, these people are offbeat.I also must point out the small role by Diedrich Bader as Rex, the martial arts instructor, his scene is nothing short of priceless. Like in Office Space, this guy has a knack for perfectly capturing way-out characters. I wonder how many times they had to re shoot this scene, I'm sure everyone was just dying when this was being filmed. Humanity may have regressed due to this character, but there's no doubt in my mind, Rex Kwon Do is the way to go.Overall, this movie is nothing spectacular. It's a simple tale about going to high school in a small town and the slow life that it breeds. No plot twists or anything, it's a rather straightforward story. Geeks, jocks, hotties, this high school is pretty typical. Not a wacky, over-the-top comedy but very amusing. I must say, though, that wherever Jon Heder (Napolean) took dance lessons, sign me up. I was laughing my rump off and thinking ""wow, that guy can really dance."" You know what, now that I think of it, this movie is better with repeated viewings. It may seem kind of banal and eldritch the first time around, but hopefully you'll see just how wacky these characters truly are. This movie may be geared towards younger audiences but anyone that is over the hill and over the fact that Bosom Buddies got canceled should find this movie worthwhile. I know plenty of you out there are only capable of laughing at something as over-the-top as a Farrelly brothers vehicle, but have a heart and go see this movie anyway. Just make sure you're in a good mood.",Napoleon Dynamite
252,mxracer157,she hasn't sent me a full body shot yet,8,12 February 2005,"very very offbeat humor. the style of writing makes this a movie any age group can enjoy. The writing uses phrases from the 80's, 90's and current times. time space exploration to dance techniques, reminds each of what we have seen. made bmy MTV, so suppose to be for teenagers, but I enjoyed it, and I am far from being a teen. you watch Napoleon and sometimes think what a nerd, then other times you cheer for him. I watched it, and his brother who moved to live with the black girl, was it a female, or was it a transvestite? the emu was fed many different foods, but none that it actually eats. at least I don't think of. was very cool to see grandmother go flying off the quad into the air though. would be nice to find that place and ride it myself. that one section, of the sand dunes made this movie rock for me. any off road racer will love this movie for that 15 second shot.",Napoleon Dynamite
253,lornloxor,Mind-numbingly annoying and awful,1,22 August 2013,"I had seen people reference and quote this movie ad nauseum on different message boards and so on so I thought I should finally check out what all the fuzz was about. Naturally I was expecting to have a great time watching this movie. Well, I couldn't have been more wrong on that. This is almost without a doubt the worst movie I've ever seen, it has absolutely no redeeming features. It's hard to describe how much I hated this movie but I'll give it a go. Napoleon is without a doubt the most boring, gross, annoying, idiotic and obnoxious character I've ever seen in a movie besides the rest of the characters in this film. Napoleon is someone even the most hardcorest of nerds would try to stay away from. Everyone makes fun of him and for good reason. His voice is like nails on a chalkboard and his brother's voice is maybe even worse if that's possible. The movie doesn't even try to show anything sympathetic or noble in his situation, we're just supposed to laugh at this moron because we're all better than him? It just seems mean. At no point do we get any deeper understanding of his motivations or personality. In fact, pretty much every character in this movie seems to be just so completely out of it that I wonder how they can even manage to survive day to day. It looks like they've all received a huge dose of heavy animal tranquilizers, that's how lethargic everyone looks!There is absolutely nothing funny or clever in this movie and there doesn't seem to be any message in it either. It was just thoroughly depressing and draining. I watched this movie with the deepest of frowns on my face. At times I just watched away from the screen with the most puzzled look imaginable and actually said ""What?"" out loud. The plot is completely inane and it was utterly uninteresting. It's just one mind-numbingly pointless scene after another pointless scene. Some people apparently love this movie and I don't understand why. I feel like the awfulness of this movie actually damaged my brain. Napoleon is so completely unlikable as a person, why anyone would find him interesting is a mystery to me. I simply can't grasp the appeal of this movie because it makes no sense. In the words of Napoleon Dynamite, ""This is pretty much the worst video ever made"". And I can know that.",Napoleon Dynamite
254,craigbenting,Much Better Than I Thought It Would Be,8,19 March 2006,"Maybe I just had low expectations for this movie, because I didn't want to buy it on DVD in case it was a complete bomb. Or maybe I can actually relate to it since I'm in my mid-30's and I grew up during the time when I think this takes place (it seems to take place in the 80's, but it's hard to tell since a lot of 70's and 80's culture are mixed together). I can especially relate to it because (I believe) it takes place in Idaho, which is like the rural midwest where I grew up.Either way, it seems that this movie represents how *most* of us felt in high school -- awkward and geeky. I say *most* of us, because some of us were popular or jocks, but most of us fit into the ""other"" groups.Of course all of us ended up changed after high school when we really grew up, and we don't feel the same way we did then.In a way, the extreme geekiness we see in Napoleon Dynamite in this movie shows how many teenagers see themselves. That poor self image is usually a part of growing up, and it's displayed in the extreme for ridicule in this movie. That's what makes this movie funny.Most of us grew up to lead normal lives with families that may include some of you reading this. Seeing Napoleon take his first steps from awkward geekiness to normal lives like ours is what makes this movie charming.In the end, this movie is funny to everyone who wasn't in the jock or popular groups in high school, and everyone who can laugh at themselves.",Napoleon Dynamite

That usually means it was awful (if it's a comedy), but those parts I did laugh at I found brilliant.Those comedic parts had nothing to do with the character Napoleon.  I found him exhausting and irritating to watch.  There was a long stretch in the movie where all I could think was ""Nothing's happening...nothing's happening...nothing's happening...""  And in fact, nothing was.Some of the outside characters would say or do something that I found absolutely hysterical, but for the most part, it just wasn't that funny to me.  Those few parts did stand out and were even funnier the next day, reciting them with the friends I had seen it with (two of whom loved every second of it, one who felt like I did).For me, it's a rental at best.",Napoleon Dynamite
256,pimponbro,Whew! made it through until the end,8,9 April 2005,"I laughed out loud at the very first funny part at the beginning of the movie. I chuckled 4 more times waiting for it to end. Once the first bit of humor is done, it's redone over and over again. There is absolutely nothing clever about the film. The actors all did a great job with the script they were given. The production was good, timing was good. Just that the story has been told better many times before. As a previous reviewer stated, there was no balance to the characters and no character development. I probably would think it was really funny if it was broken down into 20 segments as a MAD TV skit that you saw once a week. But as a feature comedy film? Didn't cut it for me. If I'm going to voyeur into a high school dorks life, I at least want someone in it to be remotely interesting. You're just stuck with this movie.

I don't know why I haven't seen it back in the day, probably cause everyone was so freaked out about it, in my experience when ordinary people love something, it's average at best. I saw this after watching blades of glory, and no surprise, this was average.There are no laugh out loud jokes, most of the jokes boil down to this character who looks completely unaware of the world, doing something cool.

258,baho2,A Most Memorable Film,9,1 February 2004,"This movie is fresh and alive with laugh-out-loud truths about growing up in general, and particularly growing up in small-town America.  First-time director Jared Hess is either loony, very gutsy, or (quite probably) both. Dumb and Dumber meets The Royal Tanenbaums.   Some scenes are priceless. And the sheer chutzpah of this ludicrous effort is enough to make you want to overlook the flaws.  Jon Heder is outstanding as Napoleon, and Efren Ramirez, Tina Majorino and Aaron Ruell manage to play their characters convincingly, crazily straight up.Here's the thing-somehow, through all their flaws, their handicaps and their pathological weirdness, these characters manage to rise above the fray with a nobility that we want to embrace.  There is a bedrock morality to each one.  They know something about friendship on an intuitive level, because they have lived their lives often without friends.  These characters are simple, but extraordinarily deep, and to me, that is the genius of this movie.I wasn't overwhelmed by the comedy.  Friends of mine who were more familiar with rural Western small towns thought it was hilariously on target. Plus, I think there's some generational humor that I didn't appreciate.  (I had a discussion about this with a friend.  He thought that Napoleon getting hit in the face by a thrown steak was hilarious.  I didn't.)  An older crowd might miss the humor entirely.  But one thing is certain: this movie isn't like anything you've ever seen before.  Napoleon Dynamite is an American original.",Napoleon Dynamite
259,ninjagaiden007,Hilarious movie. The only people who don't like it are those who wouldn't give it a chance.,10,6 January 2007,"Gosh! It's ""Napoleon Dynamite,"" a trashy Midwestern remake of ""Rushmore"" with lots of wry laughs, bad food, and a pet llama called Tina. Written and directed by the young husband-wife team Jared and Jerusha Hess, the film was an audience favorite at Sundance and won Best Feature at the US Comedy Arts Festival. The formula is almost identical to Wes Anderson's brilliant film: take an oddball outsider with lots of energy and bizarre ideas, give him a funny sidekick, a peculiar family, a geeky love interest, an immature adult antagonist, and plop him into a high school crawling with bullies, jocks, bad fashion, bad food, and all the other nostalgic detritus of American adolescence. Steep in deadpan humor and wry jokes, add just a pinch of truth, and you've got yourself a high school hit.At the film's center, Jon Heder plays the droopy-eyed hero of the title. But he's no Jason Schwartzmann, and Jon Gries as Uncle Rico can't compete with Bill Murray. Perhaps this comparison isn't quite fair either--""Napoleon Dynamite"" is much sillier than ""Rushmore,"" and some of the jokes are gutbustingly funny. While it doesn't add anything new to the formula, it's a genuinely hilarious comedy.I'm also disappointed that this film didn't remain a cult film. Cult film means ""Not Mianstream acceptance.""

I knew it was about this dorky kid that lived in Idaho, that was about it. Well, I am here to tell you, this is one of the funniest and most heart warming movies I have seen in some time and by far the best film I have seen this year.  Our hero Napolean lives with his grandmother and older brother somewhere in Idaho. He loves to draw unicorns and reckons himself a bit of a hip rebel. Well, he is not an artist and he is certainly not hip. His 32 year old brother spends all day on the computer, communicating with people via chat rooms. Napolean comes off like James Dean compared to his big bro. His grandmother is a little too hip for both of the two brothers, so she skips out to do some 4-wheeling in the dunes. Enter Uncle Rico, a man searching for a way to travel back in time to 1982, so he can play QB for his high school football team. Rico likes to set up a camera and tape himself throwing footballs. Uncle Rico wears a horrid toupee, lots of jewelry and makes Richard Nixon look classy. Well, the movie details a week or so in the life of Napolean and his buddy Pedro. We see Napolean's love life and maturity grow in a very short time, but don't worry, he does not mature that much. What makes this movie so great, beyond the incredible comedic writing and comedic performances, is the wonderful detail to images and subplots. This movie is finely tuned with every shot well thought out. The lead actor is just great and should be heard from for sometime. This movie has a Wes Anderson feel to it, but leans more on the comedy aspects. I gave it a 10 and encourage anybody looking for some comedic fun to check it out.",Napoleon Dynamite

I like books and movies with no point, because the entertainment happens around the characters, which is what a character-driven movie is as opposed to a plot or theme-driven. If you want to see a movie about kids in a small town with nothing to do and getting picked on, rent ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" which is one of the greatest underdog teen films ever made. The best thing about that movie is it's real; the underdog ugly duckling doesn't rise up and ""win"" at the end, like in this movie where the main character becomes popular, and how he becomes popular is by far the worst experience I've ever witnessed on film. This movie is just boring. It's not funny, and it's conceited in the sense that it doesn't have to even merit anything worthwhile, yet it still glides along as if it were majestic somehow. It isn't. It's awful. It's so horrible, and not even ""quirky"". It just flat-out stinks. It's one of those movies that is so purposely over-the-top oddball that fans will say ""If you don't like it you don't get it"", which thus makes it, in their eyes, infallible simply because it's different. But that's my point, it's no different than any underdog-wins-big/teenage coming-of-age tale that we've seen, or read, a hundred times before - and without anything redeeming about it and, most importantly, it's not funny. It's horrible. Horrible, horrible. And I'll put this out: ""If you do like it, then you just don't get what true originality is"". And what is a truly original underdog teenage cult film? ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"". Rent it; watch and learn. It's what this movie tries, and pretends, and fails, to be.",Napoleon Dynamite
262,ashleyallinson,Idiot,8,8 February 2005,"Jared Hess' Napoleon Dynamite is, without question, the sleeper comedy of the year. Influenced by Wes Anderson's ""Rushmore"" and Paul Feig's ""Freaks and Geeks"", Napoleon Dynamite is a study in isolation that clearly distances itself from the two. Napoleon, played by newcomer Jon Herder, is a quirky geek from rural Idaho who, like many before him within the genre, has problems relating to others. His obvious disregard for the way in which others view him, including the audience, isolates him further. The fact is that Napoleon Dynamite is a character study that never actually studies a character. It nestles itself within the genre of alienated teen comedy by taking 85 minutes to deliver and repeat a one liner. Situations present themselves whereby Napoleon is put on the spot. His obvious disregard for how others receive his words deliver the joke, as there are no consequences for his action. Things here stay stagnant, a journey that takes us nowhere except to the realization that we are laughing out loud, situation after situation. What distinguishes this film from others within the genre is that there is no revenge from this nerd; there isn't even any change in his disposition. Rather, Jared Hess takes us through a week in the life of a geek leading up to the prom. The anxiety pertaining to this, as seen in so many other films, is totally underdeveloped, which works. To suggest that Napoleon is comfortable with the way he handles himself is an understatement, but i guess that is fitting since this film is a total understatement. Despite being the center of attention, he does not allow a possible error in judgment to affect him. The audience laughs at him the same way his on screen peers laugh at him. Napoleon remains unshaken, it truly doesn't stir him. Napoleon Dynamite is a comedy that is quirky enough to keep you entertained from start to finish, even though you end up in exactly the same place.",Napoleon Dynamite
263,Caustic Pulp,Probably the most overrated comedy of the year.,2,9 December 2004,"Do you remember junior high and high school? You remember that annoying kid in your class that kept making up stories to try and make himself look good because he was such a raging dork? And his stories were too absurd to be believable, but not original enough to be entertaining?Welcome to his movie. You're going to get reacquainted with that kid reeeaaallll well.Independent film as of late has become a safe haven for thought-provoking, entertaining films that exist outside of the norm. They've been a haven for the really good stuff the studios are too afraid to make. They've allowed us to see incredible talent that would otherwise have gone undiscovered.This movie is none of those things. What it has - and I will grant it this - is a strong script. What I can't figure out is why the memorable quotes here are hilarious, but when seen in the film barely elicit a chuckle. But I have a few ideas.The direction by Jared Hess is wretched. As you watch the movie, you'll note that the camera almost never moves. Whether or not this is a style choice or incompetence remains to be seen, but it puts the irritation of the movie's visual style on par with Battlefield Earth and its relentless tilted shots. What results is a movie uncompromisingly dull to look at.Jon Heder gives a fine performance as Napoleon Dynamite; the problem is, he channels the character - and the guy you remember from school - so effectively that he screams ""give me a swirly."" You don't like him. Worse still, you never empathize with him when he gets picked on or harassed at school, because he's so gratingly irritating. And because the camera never moves, we have to sit and stare at this gawky, irritating sideshow. We have to spend 90 minutes with him. It'll feel like 120.This is one of those movies that becomes popular because it exists outside the norm, but has very little actual redeeming value to it. There are other independent films that were worth the hype - Donnie Darko immediately comes to mind - but this isn't one.Avoid.",Napoleon Dynamite

This would be closer to a negative forty five billion, six million, seven hundred and eighty five thousand, six hundred and twenty two; or worse. I hate it, I hate it, I hate it. I won't even explain the plot of this trash, it's that bad. It is so terrible that I took the disk out of the box, launched it from a catapult, and blew it out of the sky with a shotgun.

I came in having high expectations from what I had heard from my snowboarding buddies but they were totally wrong because they said that the movie contained tons of funny parts but really to be quite honest the only funny part was the dance scene. That is the only reason why I gave it a 2. Don't wast your time and money on this hunk of junk and go watch a real comedy with Jim Carrey in it or something.

266,slayer_of_the_jugga_phuk,Not Impressed.,2,7 February 2006,"I don't care what ANYONE says, if this film makes you laugh that's fine but please STOP QUOTING IT! It wasn't a good movie. I'm all for personal choice but the shirts, quoting, and general OBSESSION is KILLING ME! Like it if you wish but please stop quoting it. Anyhow, onto the review.My personal review: For a long time I avoided viewing this film because I believed it would be rather bad, but finally due to curiosity and boredom I watched it a few months ago. Honestly, I never thought a film could be this boring and pointless. I am a fan of films such as ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" and ""Not Another Teen Movie"", so I like pointless comedies, but this was just meaningless. It had little, if any plot and it wasn't funny. However, one scene did make me laugh, which is the only reason I gave an extra star. When Napoleon is riding his bike home and his (uncle?) throws the steak at him and hits him in the face, I did giggle a bit, and the dance was... interesting, but the rest was poor. I'm just glad I didn't expect anything great from this film otherwise I would be truly disappointed. Now, that's just my direct take on this production.General Review: Overall, this film is about a teenager in a small town struggling with popularity in high-school. He's an unusual student, even for the average outcast, and can come off sometimes as obnoxious, but it is obvious he tries. I believe the girl to be the average sympathetic but also unaccepted 'art geek' who is so common in teen movies and real life. The foreign student, Pedro, is perhaps the unusual kid who is misinterpreted and proves he is actually somewhat cool deep down. As for the brother, he seems to be the typical over zealous and grade-grubbing type, while in the process also being quite stubborn. The uncle is the typical 'strange' relative who often shows up at an awkward time and is never really wanted around, while at the same time coming off as maybe a deep-down intelligent person who is actually, in fact, a complete moron. The (grandma?) is the typical crazy grandparent who's age doesn't keep her down and is very young at heart while somehow still remaining old-fashioned.That's Napoleon Dynamite summed up the best I can without revealing too many of its rather boring points often called 'jokes'.",Napoleon Dynamite
267,Carl_Tait,"""Where's the Beef?""",4,8 January 2005,"No, that's not a comment on the movie, though it could be. It's a comment on the *style* of the film, which resembles a 90-minute commercial by Joe Sedelmaier. Joe was responsible for the well-known Wendy's ""Where's the Beef?"" ad and a host of similar ones in which people stood around with droopy, frozen-face expressions while ostensibly uproarious things happened to them. And yeah, this approach can be pretty funny the first couple of times you see it. But the one-joke humor wears pretty thin after awhile, especially when extended beyond the limits of a 30-second commercial.It seems paradoxical, but the self-conscious, calculated understatement of ""Napoleon Dynamite"" comes off as heavy handed *overstatement*. Okay, guys, we understand the blunted affect and terminal geekiness; next joke, please.Yes, there are a few (very few) funny bits in the movie: the cow killing, the 1% milk scene, and Napoleon's masterful drawing of his date. If only the film hadn't tried so hard to be ""so geeky it's cool,"" it would have been vastly improved.For a truly understated -- and greatly superior -- comedy about the endearing interaction between offbeat misfits, see ""The Station Agent.""",Napoleon Dynamite
268,saywardstudio,I love this movie! A true classic!,10,30 December 2005,"This movie was recommended to me by a friend,and I was hesitant to rent it, because it seemed so stupid. I had seen a commercial on the telly about it but I was coming out of the kitchen with some hot food so I was more or less listening to it rather than seeing it, but I saw at the very end of the commercial this goofy looking guy in a brown suit and thought, what the ??!?? Anyway, we rented it and I was intrigued by the opening music and credits, very arty! Then the whole story, which is sort of a mix of tiny plots, unravels before our eyes. It's a very lighthearted, funny, goofy movie, basically about a nerdy guy and his friends at school, how they help Pedro win the class presidency, getting the girl, Then there's Uncle Rico, Kip and Grandma. Oh, and Tina the llama. (""Tina! Come get some ham!""....classic!) All of this is brilliantly put together and it is very easy to follow. I was amazed to learn this was more of a student film rather than a big Hollywood production because I have seen' bigger ticket' films that were the pits. This one is a true classic, pure and simple. It is almost timeless, because even though set in modern times it has serious retro appeal. I have been in houses that look just like Napoleons, and I have known people just like the characters, so it was extra easy for me to relate to them. I think everyone has known someone like them, or has someone like them in their family. I like this movie because it was not vulgar in any way, whereas a lot of films these days rely on sexually directed humor, this one was funny because of the characters. Napoleon is a hoot- he's just there, and he doesn't care if anyone likes him or not. He's not trying to fit in or be cool, he's just himself. So are his other friends. I love it when they are moving the chickens- and he asks if the chickens have large talons. That is hilarious, coming from someone into Pegasus warrior mythical creatures. Then they show him putting two flapping chickens in the pens. That is funny!! Personally I think it shouldn't have a sequel, it could ruin what is great because sequels have to be better than the first one and I just don't know if you can top this! Napoleon is just a good kid trying to make his way through life. This movie takes a hilarious peek into a segment of it. Highly recommended!",Napoleon Dynamite
269,worship_HIM97,"Not exactly worth the Oscar, but still a decent blockbuster...",7,8 July 2005,"This movie is a rare breed that doesn't come along very often. Its simplicity and meaningless plot are both factors of why it's a good movie. I absolutely detest films that have too deep of a plot and its difficult to keep up with it. A movie shouldn't be confusing, and it shouldn't leave its viewers in bewilderment. Napoleon Dynamite is an exception to that, and that's cool.Napoleon is a confused and lonely high-school student who wishes that he could fit in (even though he doesn't try very hard with his afro, weird T-shirts, and random boots). He even finally asks a hot girl to the dance, and she reluctantly agrees. He does make a new friend named Pedro, and he is very similar to Napoleon as far as how pathetic and miserable he is. I was very impressed with Haylie Duff's role as Summer. This is probably the first role that she has had that you actually get to see her acting ability, and results showed that she is talented and bright just like another Duff that everyone knows of. All of the casting is excellent in this film, and even though the plot is kind of stupid, it's still so stupid that it will make you laugh. So in the name of a liger and the desire for tots, see this movie if you're in the mood for a good laugh. It features excellent casting, a fair (but pointless) storyline, and the ridiculous chronicles of an unfortunate being of miserable existence. 7/10",Napoleon Dynamite
270,jjjj,much less than the sum of its parts,3,15 June 2021,"A bunch of random clips - chicken wrangling, dune buggies, whatever - that might be held together if the central character were even a little bit interesting, but he's not.Nothing going on here.",Napoleon Dynamite
271,slofstra,I'll watch whatever I want - gosh,8,17 April 2005,"I like the reviews in which the authors wish to get back the 2 hours of their life spent watching this movie. There's actually a place in Florida where you can buy a machine that will do that for you. Of course, Napoleon Dynamite knows such a machine would never work, but he has to try it anyway. A tip in watching this movie: Watch it twice - at least. The first time, I didn't laugh a great deal; I was too worried that Napoleon would be embarrassed and ridiculed, as has happened in every nerd movie going back to Jerry Lewis. But it never happens. You expect Kip and ND to enroll and be humiliated in the Rex-Kwan-Do class, for example. But Kip and ND recognize it for the rip-off it is. (And besides, they don't have the 300 bucks the course costs). Napoleon breaks the mould. I think this movie is a triumph of the emerging identity. Of becoming yourself. It doesn't so much celebrate eccentrics, as it celebrates the eccentricities of ordinary people such as you and I. Watch the movie a second time, and you'll notice that Napoleon never knuckles under. He always has a comeback, even if its clumsiness is unsurpassed (and always hilarious). And he displays no trace of affectation, of trying to fit in, or trying to be cool. This is apparent in scenes such as ND's hand pantomime with the Happy Hands Club. What guy would do that! The great thing is that he doesn't care. How about when he buys a suit: Awesome! With all the funny, bizarre lines in the movie, the deadpan style of the movie as a whole, and the lack of transitions and foreshadowings, the movie bears watching several times before its ethos really sinks in. At this point, you may notice Napoleon's most important line in the movie: ""I do whatever is in my heart"". Gosh!",Napoleon Dynamite
272,Keatonics,Beautifully Quirky,9,31 July 2005,"The first thing I have to ask is ""Can anybody really be that nerdy?"" Once I accepted the fact that the characters are way over the top stereotypes, and suspended my disbelief, I found the film very funny and quite cute.We always want to root for the underdog, and this cast is full of them from top to bottom. Do we see something of ourselves in them? Maybe. Even the oddest or the grossest characters come off somehow lovable. It is especially good to know that even the strangest boy can still get even the oddest girl--after all it is a love story, isn't it?I'm sure the people of Preston, Idaho take issue with the portrayal of their little town as full of oddballs, but I understand that they have actually come to embrace the notoriety the film has brought them and held a Napoleon Dynamite festival this past spring.Well acted, well written, and well directed, not to mention beautiful cinematography.My son made me watch this movie with him--and I'm glad he did!",Napoleon Dynamite

I saw a lot of those kinds of kids in Junior High and High School. For a few moments it felt like the 80's/early 90's all over again, especially the way some of the characters dressed. I swear that Napoleon was ripped right out of my Junior High. I knew of a kid that used to wear moon boots all the time. I liked the movie and it was another nice movie to watch with the family.

It's more like a pathetic parade of stereotypical nerds, geeks and losers who you can only feel sorry for and hope that everything will work out for them in the end despite all their trials. You can't really care about them either because they're so pathetic, either that or you relate to them because at one point you considered yourself to be the same way.Some people think this is funny, and some don't care because it's so pathetic.

276,scs0,"The very definition of ""Overrated""",3,13 September 2006,"This movie is quite possibly the most overrated movie I've seen since the painfully boring English Patient. First of all, the production quality of the movie seems as bland as the characters. The movie just seems cheap. The only positive about this movie's production values is that it didn't get suckered into the tired trend of using ""artistic"" wobbly camera work.The next problem is that the movie's characters are mostly nerds and nerds are, well, boring. Another problem is that Napolean borders on being a mean nerd. I tend to dislike movies where the main characters are just not likable. We were supposed to be sympathetic to the Napolean character, but his personality got close to the point where you just don't care what happens to him. The only character that had any sort of energy was the internet girlfriend of Napolean's brother.The killer problem with the movie was its almost complete lack of a plot. It's almost laughable that I placed a spoiler warning on this review considering that the movie doesn't have a plot to spoil, but I had to mention what happens at the very end: nothing! Apparently the director ran out of tape and just cut off the movie. This movie probably has one of the most abrupt endings I've ever seen. Here's the plot of the movie: ""Napolean bumbles into some equally dysfunctional nerds, his uncle moves in, Napolean says 'Gosh' a few dozen times. He dances. Director sees that the movie reached a length long enough to be considered a movie. The end."" I was warned about this and even I was surprised by the lack of story in this movie. Seinfeld this ain't; yea it's a movie about nothing but it has no spark of life.If I had paid to see this movie I wouldn't quite place it into the category of holding a lifelong grudge against being suckered out of the money (For me that's just a one movie group, The Blair Witch Project. I'm literally still angry over losing 8 dollars to that turd. Those people were laughing all the way to the bank.), but Napolean Dynamite definitely falls into the category of being a hype and marketing driven movie.",Napoleon Dynamite
277,waltcosmos,the REAL appeal of the movie,10,28 July 2006,"Warning: No matter how this review starts out, it's not what you think.When we are growing up, when we're little kids, we go along with what the grown-ups tell us to do, no matter what culture we grow up in. We go to school, we eat what is put on our plate, we learn children's songs, anthems, pledges, proverbs, we dress in a certain type of clothing, relate to animals in one way or another, relate to siblings, older relatives, strangers, others in a predefined way and we never question it. At least, not while we're still little kids.So we think all the things we do are THE WAY THINGS ARE DONE. We've seen our friends and our family also DOING THESE THINGS, so it's been reinforced all our lives, that the way things are are the way THEY SHOULD BE. And we shape our life, our opinions, our personality around this idea of how things should be, we EMBELLISH those things, even if it's all b-u-l-l-s-h-i-t.So now we get to Napoleon Dynamite. Napoleon is an ARCHETYPE. He is an absolutely clueless true believer in the fluff and noise, the buzz and the hype all around him. Yet in the movie, it's an extreme form of this true-believer status that allows us to keep him at arms length from ourselves. We SEE the things he does, we understand the origins of his behavior and manage to convince ourselves that we are infinitely more prescient than Napoleon is but STILL we tend to laugh at him...in the same way that children or even our pets do things that make us laugh. We see beyond what they are seeing but still we understand what they are seeing.The perception of the world that Napoleon lives in is just SLIGHTLY more unrealistic than the world WE live in. We get up and have our cereal, then it's off to work where we interact in various ways with our co-workers, we design boards for switching off a thermal scan at certain temperatures, or we anticipate how many snow tires we need to order for the coming winter, or we pore over the financial statements of our company looking for a way to trim costs. We come home, watch TV, kick it on the weekend, visit with people we know and then it's back to work, another week, another month, another decade...and the machine never stops because we never examine it or ourselves. Like Napoleon.The reason the movie took so long to take off was because the initial reaction was of people who still believe in their OWN b-u-l-l-s-h-i-t. And Napoleon's universe hit a little too close to home. These are the people who hated this movie. The ones who came around to liking it or liked it immediately have already begun to assess the glorified sameness we have been herded into.

Come on people, you have to have laughed at at least one part, like when the farmer shoots the cow and all the kids on the bus scream. Every one of the actors did a superb job, and this film was completely ignored by the Academy. The jokes were classic (""Your mom goes to college"", ""Tina, you fat lard, come get your dinner"")and had you constantly rolling on the floor, laughing. It's classic American humor the whole time through, and it doesn't have the strongest plot in the world, but who really cares? It redeemed itself with the jokes.

Yes it is a 'high school' movie, but its the most non high school high school movie you'll ever see. 90 minute of near perfection letter, you'll want to immediately rewind that VHS back up and watch it again.ND sports a comedy trio like no other. Napoleon himself, as well as his brother Kip and THE Uncle Rico, combine to make one of the most hilarious trios all time (up there with Three Amigos). Each line they give is so well delivered and quotable, they are singlehandedly more quotable than all of Seinfeld put together. Plus, Napoleon doesn't even close his mouth for the entire movie! Many movies with big time comedy stars (Adam Sandler, Will Farrell) rely only on the main actor to deliver the laughs. This could not be more false for ND. Even the most obscure characters, from some random kid on the bus (seriously, why does Napoleon even ride the bus with elementary schoolers) to a school bully (goshhhhhh) is capable of making you laugh your tail off. Even the Llama will bring tears to your eyes, which may have 15 seconds of screen time.To summarize, Napoleon Dynamite is a movie that can be re-watched dozens of times, getting better after each viewing. It may not be for everyone, but considering that it is not even that old, it has already been labeled a 'classic' by so many viewers.

The movie is so full of little things, I really don't understand how anyone could ever call this movie ""slow"". I re-winded parts of it during first watch. Those who don't get it are probably too lazy to see it, or too selfish to try things outside of their little box perhaps? I was age 37 when I first saw this movie, and there is no reason why people my age should not like it. The music is very eighties, the entire scenery is eighties-based. The use of colors is so 'off' it looks like Barbie camping in a candy store.It's not even that much of a comedy, it's just very confronting and out there. Many aspects of the story are more real than anything I've seen done before in movies like this; ""Welcome to the Dolhouse"", ""Can't Buy Me Love"" and ""Bottle Rocket"" come to mind, but are average compared to the originality of this film. Most of the story is rather sad, because it is so true how all of our lives are never as simple as they often seem, so true we all have weird habits. Living in a spoiled rich society, Napoleon is showing us just how far gone it actually is. Glad to finally see a movie where we see people consume some of the crappy food we know! The references to the meat-industry, and the milk-tasting test, all this is absolutely fabulous stuff.If you haven't consciously seen this movie, you have missed something in your life. The music score is fascinating, and who would have thought to ever hear When In Rome's ""The Promise"" being used at such a wonderful moment in the film?

There isn't much of a plot either, but that isn't a problem for this film, the director allows the viewer to simply follow Napolean and his brother around their quaint and pretty basic Idaho town.It's very unique, brilliantly written and resourceful.I hope the whole cast go onto big things.

I think if you are looking for a side slapping comedy, this isn't that kind of movie, and there is nothing deep and meaningful about it. I have watched it twice and still enjoy it. This is one of those movies that you either like or hate and probably nothing in between. It is not a fast paced movie, it just moves along slowly.

But then you see the ""victims"" emerge from the ""car-wreck"" and they're okay, just a little bruised. And you feel quietly uplifted that things can work out even if your life looks pathetic and hopeless. With lowered laugh expectations, I think this movie can be very satisfying. The problem for me was the marketing of ""funniest movie of the year"" or some such. It isn't.",Napoleon Dynamite
285,hcreeve24,I have seen funnier episodes of cops,1,8 December 2005,"I would go zero if I could, what the hell is so funny about this dumb @ss movie? I mean my god the characters are all morons on some level, and they are all totally unlikable. I could do without the lead Napoleon because he is a whiny, annoying, jerkweed, that I quite frankly wanted to jump in the TV and hit, and I am a pacifist! The brother is a freakoid loser that has a girlfriend that is out of state and that he says loves him. Anyways I can't comment any further because 40 minutes into this mess I gave up and switched it off. This unfunny movie is just plain annoying, and the next time these people write another movie tell them not to get their quirky characters off an obvious template. What a disgrace.",Napoleon Dynamite
286,bradleyadita,TNT n',9,24 August 2004,"***Spoilers***My friend Dave train hopped to chicago and convinced my mom and myself to go watch this movie last night at the theater in the Glen. What we have here is an exciting experiment in the creation of strong characters. Many commentors have noticed and commented on the angry side of ND and this might be the sparking motivational pivot of his character. He is definitely the most angry ""dork"" character we have seen on the silver screen. An emotion which is definitely consistent with the character. Side note... his anger is also somewhat benign but still genuine... he doesn't swear, but there is almost always a scowl on his face, an unwaving clenching of forehead and eyebrows. This movie takes another step for mankind on the lunar surface of the subject of banal environments. A timely enterprise considering the recent success of many ""reality"" TV shows. It is interesting to see America coming to terms with certain parts of itself. Tell me what do you know about Idaho? - or for that matter, most of the other states of this country Americans share? - The comedy emanates not only from Heder's character, but also from the quirky environment he must navigate. It seems as though ""retro"" is always approximately 20 years in the past, (and antique is about 50 years in the past) what is wonderful about ND is this Idaho landscape which is rife with 80's (hence retro) culture, but which is actually current for the time 2004-2005 (the time setting for the movie).... THE COMEDY in this is the TRUISM that much of ""brand spanking new"" cultural artifacts usually take about 20 years for them to reach this lessor traveled / lessor lived in parts of the USA. (As someone who spent 6 years living in Iowa (Iowa City) I can attest to this phenomenon.) - SO what comes across as being current and hip (in the recent ""celebration"" of retro culture) - (i.e. VH1's I Love The 80's, Artforum 40th Annivesary double issue (March/April 2003) focusing on the 80's) these are just a few note-able examples.))) ... IS in actuality the way places such as these more or less actually appear today in 2004. - This is fairly ingenious marketing and cultural cultivating. So for those of you who are confused about the time-setting of this film, hopefully this clears it up for you.We will always be fascinated to glimpse the past and re-live the now outdated society of the spectacle past. In 2020 will we be watching ""I Love The 00's"", and in the program they will reference ""I Love The 80's""??? - Computers and technology are increasing our ability to produce and archive much media, text, and ideas, and increasingly we are becoming a more reflexive society. With the recent successes of such middle American environs such as ""The Simple Life,"" ""X-games"" ""Jessica Simpson and the Newlyweds"" ""American-IDol"" more and more we see portrayal of ""everyday Americans"" culture which these days has become the source of much material for Television, Movies, entertainment, Jeff Foxworthy is coming back with a new sit-com. Etc.. This is the goldrush of the 2000s, digging into our own psychies, our own cultural traditions, environments. The Reality TV fascination. SOmehow ND- is perfectly nested in this current fashion. The opening credits roll over an assortment of fabric patterns (which is an surprising 2-Dimensional way of creating a sense of setting) - and the text of the credits is handed to us spelled out in food on plates, using mustard, etc... These sorta DIY (Do It Yourself) hands on, and also edible, credits ease the audience into the setting of the film, and also reflected I comment I made in the car on the way to the movie which was ""You are what you eat, you eat what you see,"" We see moves (consumption through viewing)... (Ask Dave... strangely enough who has also used similar crediting techniques in his own video/film project... search for ""Table Scraps"")Yo. SO dude, okay then we have this sort of dragging of the action figure behind the school bus, the line is something like, ""hey Napolean, what are you going to do today?"" - N: ""I'm gonna do whatever I darn feel like doing"" - or something (someone help me out here with the exact quote...) And that pretty much sums up what we see in the movie. What Napolean feels like doing, given his existence in this environment. Nature and Nuture are both convening on this young man in the most remarkable ways.There is some great comedy and the cutting of scene and jumping from one scene to the next used to good effect. some scenes are cut short and quickly while others are sort of drawn out to the last possible moment, characters never breaking... this contrast of quick cut, long cut, keeps your attention because it makes you pay attention to every detail, because you don't know if the scene is going to be a quick cut, or a long drawn out one. An example of the quick cut is the mini-narrative of the introduction of Pedro's bike, cut to the bike, cut to the ramp jump, cut to slapstick ND. bang bang bang bang. (film students take note)New things on film. Have we ever seen a tether ball in a movie?? maybe.. the main character in a thrift store?.. hmmm... The main character of a movie working in a huge ""industrial?"" chicken coup? Comparisons to Revenge of the Nerds, Rushmore, are a given. But this movie is striving for everyday-ness... a possible connection with Spellbound, without the national spelling bee attention and possible recognition or ""Spelling Skills"" as Dynamite would put it. Not as dark as Gummo.I like a movie that gives me some new ideas to play with. I am not sure what these are in particular with ND, but i think that there are some there. Something to do with the motivation for N's anger?- Maybe not so important, yes this movie claims ""he's out to prove he's got nothing to prove."" Sounds like Seinfeld. - question is does he prove nothing??? I they failed... Napolean Dynamite (Jon Heder) & Jared Hess have definitely proved something.I give this movie 8.25 out of ten. further: if you liked this movie that i would recommend seeing America's Funniest American by little known actor director genius PAUL RUST.",Napoleon Dynamite
287,emwolf,This year's best,8,26 January 2005,"I rated this my the year's best. No, I'm not stupid, and no I don't believe everyone will enjoy this the way I did. In fact, once I bought the DVD I've warned people up-front they will love it or hate it. But I think great movies always inspire that type of reaction. Blue Velvet is also one of my favorite movies, but critics like Ebert and Maltin rate it abysmally. I found Last Year at Marienbad pretentious and silly, but there are those who find it to be one of the all-time greats.ND transported me to a world I'd never seen on film. I have known people who look like Napoleon and I related to the character on a very personal level. ND also injected a sense of love into all its humor that made it difficult for me to look at any of these characters with disdain, or pity.Yes, I liked Ray, Aviator, and all the other high-profile movies of 2004, but my enjoyment hasn't flagged after 5 repeat viewings (I saw it on the big screen too).Be sure to keep watching after the credits finish.",Napoleon Dynamite
288,kendallphoenix,We All Know a Napoleon,10,15 March 2005,"This isn't a cinematic masterpiece. This isn't the most groundbreaking film of all time. Napolean Dynamite is simply real-life. Let's face it...we all know a Napoleon Dynamite. If you don't, you ARE Napoleon Dynamite. What makes this film great is that most people can relate to it. Those that didn't like it, didn't like it because they live in bubbles. The same circle of friends and never venturing outside of that circle. They are your Summer's and Don's and Trisha's. Those people who live on planet Earth can actually relate to this film. Everyone has a Rico and a Kip and a Grandma. Everyone has a Deb and a Pedro. This film isn't a cinematic masterpiece.

289,tandc-53810,ABSOLUTE GENIUS -- WRITING AND ACTING HILARIOUS,10,3 March 2018,"This has become a CLASSIC for very good reasons:1. THE WRITING is absolutely spot-on, reflecting the angst of teenagers who (like Charlie Brown of ""Peanuts"") are loners and losers. If you aren't entertained by examining what it is like to be a loser or outcast, you won't like this movie. I found myself constantly saying OMG as the writers introduced yet another character of hilarious (and losing) proportions. If you have a relative who wants you to sell Amway or Tupperware and become a millionaire in the process, you""ll ""get it"" when you see Napoleon's uncle. If you have a male relative who has fallen in love with a girl who is ""inappropriate"", you""ll ""get it"" when you see Napoleon's brother. If you're a person of color and you've experienced racial discrimination, you'll ""get it"" when you're in the middle of a high school election involving Napoleon's close friend who is Mexican, Pedro. These are only a few of the characters who make Napoleon Dynamite so captivating and entertaining.2. THE ACTING is in short PERFECT! Jon Heder nails his character, an aimless teenager trying to find meaning in his middle class (if not lower class) lifestyle. All the actors were cast in roles that fit them perfectly, and they carry off their parts in a convincing way. Remember, these characters fall far short of perfect, in fact they are very imperfect. It ain't easy carrying off a part which has so many negative features; but the actors do it. Therein lies the genius of the movie. We are first astonished and shocked by the characters, then come to appreciate their inherent goodness as the movie develops.If you don't like Napoleon Dynamite, then you'd better have your funny bone checked. This is a very different comedy, but it is of a genius genre -- made up from an excellent knowledge of how teenagers relate to one another, an excellent knowledge of what it is like to be a loner, and an excellent knowledge of how teenagers somehow survive that very challenging, anxious, fearful time in their lives.",Napoleon Dynamite
290,cameronmcclure,Once in a lifetime,10,6 January 2021,A 6.9 average rating is absolutely criminal for this film one of the best comedies made just so secure with itself and doesn't try anything too out there,Napoleon Dynamite
291,voxparody,Chapstick Chap,8,23 April 2005,"I was caught totally by surprise by this fine little comedy. I had heard a few things about it and decided to see it for myself. I didn't regret one moment. I literally laughed until my sides ached; but then again I laugh at oddball, quirky and original stuff such as the stuff seen-and-heard in this type of film.Napoleon is a likable teenage nerd who attends high school in Idaho. He befriends a Hispanic student named Pedro, a walking Botox-injection that rarely shows any visible emotion in his otherwise blank facial expression (throughout most of the film). In fact, the majority of the characters play their roles with deadpan facial expressions... especially Napoleon and Pedro; which makes them ideally suited to each other as friends.There are other characters, many of them quite funny and just as off-center as Napoleon. The Idaho State setting contributes much to the even-handed humor of the film's numerous and noteworthy scenes... The FFA milk taste test, the farming and potato references, sleepy rural-town life, etc. It's no wonder the town's citizens go about their various daily routines in a state of almost complete stuporThe verbal sparrings between Napoleon and his lay-about older brother, Kip, are genuinely hilarious to watch, and Napoleon's vagabond Uncle (who lives out of his van) provides more opportunities for even more hearty belly-laughs.I hope you enjoy ""Napoleon Dynamite"" as much as I did. It's uniquely in a small class of its own. I congratulate everyone who contributed to the making of it.",Napoleon Dynamite
292,toddinvestor,Not funny,4,8 January 2005,"Love it or hate it. I am in the latter group. ""Napoleon Dynamite"" just does not deserve its rating of over seven out of ten on IMDb. I do not get it. I kept wondering while watching this film, is it time to laugh now? Slow. Very slow. All of the characters are deadpan. No expression. No humor. No nothing. The subplots involving Napoleon's uncle and brother are extremely boring. As for Napoleon himself, I will admit there are a few redeeming moments in his journey through high school. Napoleon is almost likable. The idea of making a movie about nerds and misfits has potential. ""Dumb and Dumber"" did it right. ""Napoleon Dynamite"" misses the mark. 4/10",Napoleon Dynamite
293,Gorilla Punk,Artistic while still absolutely hilarious,10,14 July 2004,"This is one of those comedies where you find yourself laughing non-stop. The person who wrote Napoleon Dynamite really played out the eccentricities of each of the characters.  We have Napoleon, who lives with his chat room addicted older brother Kip at their grandmother's house, Pedro, a recently arrived immigrant who has an unusual way of getting to the ladies, Uncle Rico, obsessed with football and time travel, plus all the other minor characters, like the owners of the farm where Napoleon works.  The popular students at Napoleon's school pick on Napoleon and Pedro for being nerdy, but unlike in the typical high school movie, this isn't overplayed.  Rather, the movie focuses more on each of the character's personalities and how they live life.This movie is like the 1986 Corey Haim movie Lucas if the people from Reno 911 made it.  10/10",Napoleon Dynamite
294,perfectisolation,"Eh, OK for most, a few (5+) years behind curve stylistically",2,29 May 2004,"Has a few funny scenes, but like other reviews point out, it sometimes seems that the movie was made around these and that the movie as a whole is very disjointed. Was it written poorly? Did they over edit story points? Did some scenes just not workout well on film and have to be cut and hurt the movie? I cannot tell you, maybe it will be on a commentary track. But I thought it was....eh, an indie derivative of the indie/personal movie revolution of the 90's.Shoot, it took Tarantino 30 years to remake Lady Snowblood and Sergio Leone, and those were foreign movies/directors. Hess has managed to cut that down to 8 years and Wes Anderson, Todd Solondz (Welcome to Dollhouse, Happiness), David O Russell (Spanking Monkey), Alexander Payne (Election, Citizen Ruth) and others were already Americans. I feel that this movie fit right into that wave of small or indie movies that were made in the late 90's (hey, I said ""or"" because, though it is stylistically different, ""dazed and Confused"" was not an independent, it was a studio movie that cost about $18mill BEFORE advertising) with its deadpanning. Hess shoots just like those movies, uses slow dialogue, pulled back shots, everything, well, they were his film school. So for everyday folks this may seem like something new and fresh, but not for me.I would have liked this much more if it was 18 and not 27...I can't help it, it's typical human nature...it's a passe' style for me. been there, done that. Anyone can paint a cubist, dadist, impressionist painting nowadays...Does any really care if they do? no. been there, done that. Does kids really care about boy bands nowadays? no, we are in that cycle of, been there done that.Sorry, but there are people like me who upon seeing Troy said, eh, been there, done that just a few years ago with Lord of the Rings.

The two main characters Napolean and Pedro both act so heavily medicated it reminded me of other so called ""wonderful"" movies such as Donnie Darko and Garden State. I don't watch movies to juxtapose them with my own life experiences, I watch them because they contain experiences that you seldom get from life.

296,Systematicer,At first I thought it's surrealism.,2,6 September 2005,"I thought it's surrealism because the film doesn't have any qualities other than making no sense at all. But after one hour watching the movie I got it. It's not surrealism, it's mainly a crappy Sci-Fi film. The world as we see it during the picture is how the world would be if everyone had 40 IQ-points less. With that in mind the film actually DOES make sense. The reason I'm saying it's bad Sci-Fi is that the world couldn't work like this. We wouldn't had any technology like computers and governments couldn't work. There wouldn't be no economy and so on... Of course you could say there has been a horrible event taken place in 2003 or something that caused people to turn into complete idiots. And from then on everyone continued their lives, just with 40 IQ-points less. But since there is nothing in the film that would imply that tragic event (even bad Sci-Fi films have that) I can't seriously consider this film to be Sci-Fi. So you could look at it as surrealism or Sci-Fi. Either way, it's a very weak film.2/10 for not making sense and causing no emotional reaction at all for full 94 minutes (incl. the epilogue at the end) and for being the un-funniest ""comedy"" I've ever seen, which from some perspective is quite an achievement on its own.",Napoleon Dynamite

It will also appeal to people that have been or live in a small town that is behind by 15 years in fashion (ex: Wisconsin), granted thats not so bad compare with the fashion sense we have in Atlanta right now.The characters are laughable and the situations in the story are bizarre, but at least this comedy is different from the well known Hollywood comedy formulas.I would only recommend this movie for people that are comedically open minded, not for people that enjoy 'Barbershop' or 'Bringing Down the House'.",Napoleon Dynamite

And in their own quirky way, each of the main characters achieves a personality that is more than the cardboard cutout that is typical of ""teen"" movies (especially comedies).I'm no teenager and, in fact, I was way, way past that age when this movie first came out. But I'd think that anybody who has ever been in high school should be able to relate to the comedy here. In fact, I could relate to almost all of the character types, from the failed athlete (Uncle Rico) to the painfully quiet girl (Napoleon's friend), and just about everyone in between.With so many random scenes, it's inevitable that a few will miss the mark, and there are some things that IMHO should have been left out or altered.

299,curtman2,Funny Fluff,7,24 February 2005,"""Napoleon Dynamite"" is one innocuous, offbeat, wacky little comedy with plenty of pleasant drollery to classify as one of the better funnies of the new millennium. It's as simple as apple pie and as inane as a black cactus, and it's often hilarious in its own right without having to resort to being crude or lewd. Some may own that the film is pointless, a guileless crock of shallowness void of any conspicuous plot, character development, or even resolution, while others may extol it as a most ingenious, timeless concoction of comedic greatness; I suppose critical intelligentia could go either way, depending upon one's appreciation of comedy and film. I personally found ""Napoleon Dynamite"" to be nothing more than an innocuous and inane diversion, and while I wouldn't particularly elevate it to cult-classic status, I will say that I thoroughly enjoyed its world of frothy hollowness, and found myself laughing (though hardly hysterically) at the sheer zaniness of it all. The story (if there is one to be found) is about a social outcast (in laments terms a careless loser) named Napoleon Dynamite who hangs his buckteeth out for all to observe his exasperation and nonchalance about life. He has a considerably insignificant existence, sneering at anyone who bothers him with a question, drawing abysmal pictures, haplessly playing tether-ball, and following his equally meek and mawkish brother, who chats online, purchases time machines, is into judo-karate, and relates his existence to his narcissistic, shallow ""uncle"", while occasionally feeding his cow some ""grub"" on their Idaho farm. That is, of course until Napoleon meets a curious fellow outcast named Deb and decides to campaign on behalf of his new friend, Pedro for school president (""Vote for Pedro"" can now be recognized on T-shirts, bumper stickers, you name it); now he's really meeting people and going places, however you want to put it. ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is of course wholesomely hollow, yet funny and endearing, in its droll study of ""the life of a nobody"". I can definitely understand its LDS appeal, as many Mormons I know could identify with many of the same interests presented in the film. A cultural phenomenon? Hardly! I just took ""Napoleon Dynamite"" for what it is on the surface, and found myself consistently amused by the jarring absurdity of it all (e.g. what is Napoleon always fleeting from?). It's a light-hearted, innocuous, and meaningless little comedy, hardly a cinematic dreck yet hardly Citizen Kane; a charming, feel-good film that, in my opinion, should neither be extolled nor dismissed. See it for yourself, and maybe you'll get ""lucky"" and actually be amused by this independent whim, not a cinematic gem. *** out of ****",Napoleon Dynamite
300,Mondo-Cane,Refreshing take on teen comedy genre.,10,22 June 2004,"Not only is ND one of the most funny teen comedy movies, but one of the funniest movies to come out in the past 4-5 years.  Which came as a shock to me as I found out it is an MTV film.  Napoleon Dynamite, as well as the rest of the characters, is so quirky yet realistic as watching them might remind you of someone you know in your suburb/rural hometown.  There are lots of 80's looks/references which may muddle the era of which the movie takes place, although I do believe it takes place in the modern era as Kip, Napoleon's older brother spends his days in cyberspace looking for love.If your a fan of deadpan, strange comedies such as The Royal Tenenbaums, then check out Napoleon Dynamite.  Hopefully it will be released in major theaters as at the time I write this it is currently playing in select cities.

There appeared to be a big difference between what they had told me and what I saw. I heard some people would pay twice just to see the movie and that it was a ""fall out of your seat hilarious"". What i had saw was a plot-less film about a teenage kid living in a rural area in the middle of Idaho. Basically the movie depicts this teen's everyday life where he lives with his uncle, and brother, both of whom do not look their age whatsoever. The only trace of a plot is shown when Napoleon has a shallow interest in one girl whom he tries to impress by assisting is dry and unfunny foreign friend win a school election. I am a strong advocate of independent films and low-budget productions, however the point of a movie is to give the audience something to watch for. This movie has no substance, no purpose, no meaning, no entertainment, no point, no lesson and absolutely no value.

I get it that is not for everyone. I have read many people that after hating this movie the first time it grew on them.
I watched recently a few bloopers and outtakes that curiously were not included in either the DVD or Bluray. Those kind of puts in perspective hoe hard it was for the actors to keep a straight face while reciting the absurdity of the dialogues and the whole aspect of the movie.
Also props to the editing and the score and sound track of the movie. A quick search in youtube will take you to the ""I caught you a delicious bass"" final scene and song which many found just perfect and beautiful in tone.

It looked like a typical teen comedy which I would never normally watch, but interesting reviews pulled me in. What is so good about this film is that it is really funny without being cruel to the characters. Napoleon and his nerdy friends know they are geeks, but really don't seem to care, and they come out winning in the end against all odds. Watching Napoleon Dynamite you never quite know what stupid scene might come next, with great characters such as 1982 obsessed Uncle Rico, the scope for crazy sequences is endless. I have to admit crying with laughter, which is no easy feat for a film to achieve. I cannot recommend this comedy highly enough. If you enjoy absurd comedy such as Airplane or Police Squad (the series) you must watch this. It may not appeal to everyone, you need to just sit back and enjoy the stupidity. Don't expect any particular plot, stunts or special effects. This is a film to just turn off your brain and absorb.

Well it was quirky but it was so intentionally and over the top quirky that it never washed for me. It had the stink of the Royal Tenenbaums to me...a film that was trying way, way too hard to be quirky and unique that it forgot to have any story.The characters are all painted with the same laconic brush. The lead characters all sort of mumble away while looking at the ground. The dialog becomes grating just because listening to the characters is painful. Then, they aren't actually doing anything interesting so it really tends to not matter all that much who they are.If you dig on Wes Anderson's films: Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Bottle Rocket, Life Aquatic you will likely jones on this film so it has an appeal, just not to me.",Napoleon Dynamite

In talking to young people that have seen ND already (and who hated it) I find their sense of humor tends to be more geared for ""Scary Movie"", ""White Chicks"", and any comedy with nudity, foul language, and ""in-your-face"" characters. I recently attended a screening of ND at the Ontario Mills Mall in Ontario, California. Five minutes prior to the movie starting there were only fifteen of us in a four hundred-seat theater. By the time the trailers of coming attractions were over there was not a single empty seat in the house. I cannot remember the last time I attended a movie that sold out. I may have been the oldest one in the theater (45) and I laughed from start to finish. The characters are so quirky, so original, and so likable that I immediately felt right at home in Preston, Idaho. I liked the fact that there is a movie maker still alive that can entertain 400 movie-goers without resorting to the low denominator of profanity and nudity. What a breath of fresh air. But I will give a word of warning...this movie is not for everybody. If you are looking for naked women, sexual references in every line, and ear splitting profanity, then skip this movie at all costs--you will be bored. If however you enjoy tasting an odd slice of life that has rarely been put on the screen as well, then peddle on over to the nearest theater and take a trip to white-bread America, where wide lapels can still be seen, and a real representation of ""nerd-dom"" can be enjoyed by all. I think that everyone sees a little Napoleon Dynamite in all of us. Outstanding film!!!",Napoleon Dynamite
311,SteveHistory,"My heck, it's only one of the best independent films in years...geeez!!!",9,25 July 2004,"What a gem this one is!!! Seldom have I seen such a polarization of opinions on a movie here on the IMDb. I've seen this movie three times in seven days and I cannot remember the last time I ever did that. I am not a 16 year-old high school student either, I am a forty-six-year-old father of five with a Master's Degree in American History and a lot of movie watching experience in my past. I am dumbfounded to read comments from individuals who claim there was no character development and no plot. It appears that modern film making, (that relies all too often on violence, nudity, rampant profanity, sexual situation after sexual situation, and cheap scatological humor) has perhaps numbed several movie-goers to the point they cannot understand nor appreciate delicate plot elements and subtle humor. What a shame. For my money, this is a sleeper in the running for an Academy Award.If you can be entertained without watching fist-fighting, sex, nudity, and vulgarity, then perhaps a trip to Preston, Idaho is just what you need. Oh, and don't leave until the closing credits have finished rolling. There is a little treat awaiting you after the MPAA, blue screen, rating information. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful! GEEEEEZ!",Napoleon Dynamite

Not much to add you that haven't read before, just wanted to boost one of my favorite comedies of all time with my little 10/10 stars and add another review proclaiming a love for the Hess clan.

313,trix_n_min,"Hilarious, Side-Splitting Simplicity",9,11 May 2008,"Napoleon Dynamite is a simple film, obviously made on a low budget, with none of the usual American glitz and glam. It is dry, kind of dark, extremely strange and absolutely hilariously funny. Jon Heder is absolutely perfect in the role of Napoleon, as are all the other cast members, especially Kip, the nerdy, net-chatting brother. The thing that is fantastic about this film is that despite being completely odd and having bizarre, eccentric characters, many of the characters, or some of their traits, are familiar to us. Who hasn't known a Napoleon (though doubtless as funny as this one) who is completely off-centre, strange and offbeat, a complete nerd in full, who nonetheless seems unaware of the fact that they are, in fact, a complete nerd, and this lack of caring or awareness makes them somewhat cool. Brother Kip is hilarious for this reason as well - a computer-obsessed nerd who thinks he is cool, despite being adorably dorky. Uncle Rico is a believable egocentric man, and Pedro is the strange foreign student who, of course, bonds with the outcast Napoleon. The casting in this movie is perfect, the popular people at his school are so realistic, especially the girls during the lame dance at the end. Absolutely hilarious how spot on these characters are. The film has the most unique and clever dialogue I've ever heard in a movie, it seems to create it's only language-for-dorks, which is fantastically funny. The ending dance scene is fabulous, as for the very first time Napoleon is seen as cool, and accepted by his fellow peers after his on-stage dance, yet he flees before the applause begins, and probably never is even aware of this. It makes this scene so much more special, typical Napoleon not having to prove himself to anyone, even when they do love him for it. He and his girl make the cutest couple, on a side note. I recommend watching this film at least twice - the first time, you just aren't sure what is happening and if you should be laughing or not (although I was), but the second viewing makes you find it absolutely hilarious, and every time after that as well. Funny, clever, exceedingly strange, with perfect casting and enough classic quotes to last you for ages, Napoleon Dynamite is one of the best films released in modern times. Highly recommended, but don't try to read into it, whatever you do - it is the film's simplicity which makes it so fun and easy to watch.",Napoleon Dynamite
314,stephanmj,Very nice movie,10,7 January 2005,"This movie is interesting to me, as I am not an American. But as a European who has lived in America for 13 years it is interesting to see this movie and read other comments from people who have also seen it. I have noticed that Americans are very status oriented and achievement focused people. If you have achieved a lot you are a ""winner"" and if you are less ambitious you are deemed a ""loser"". In this sense American society is very black and white.This movie concentrates on what other Americans would call ""losers"". People who do not fit in, people who live in the distant past, people without meaningful careers. The main character of the movie is definitely a social misfit and he attracts and maintains friends only with other social misfits. There is one excellent shot depicting this where Napoleon, Deb and Pedro are staring out at all the people dancing, and they are standing motionless. Napoleon does not fit into the high school social structure in any way, and stemming from this he has feelings of worthlessness. His character has poor self esteem. He says things like ""I don't have any good skills"" and finds it necessary to make up grandiose lies about himself to appear better to others.I think this is a depressing movie for a lot of people. In America, popularity and acceptance are so heavily emphasized as being important, and young adults are raised to be intolerant of different people who do not fit into the moulded stereotypes that television and the media present us with. This is why in America you get people who are ridiculed for being different who sometimes make extreme statements using violence.The best scene in the movie is by far for me the school dance scene. The song ""forever young"" is perfect accompaniment for the actions within the scene making it poignantly sad. The director does an excellent job in making the audience sympathize with Napoleon as Summer waves to her friends and they wave back, while Napoleon waves to his friends, and they don't even notice him.On the whole I recommend this film. It is not as funny as people say it is, but an interesting character study of some odd and quirky characters.",Napoleon Dynamite
315,gforce762,Dreadful,1,8 March 2005,"This movie was recommended to me by a friend who said that is was one the funniest movies he had ever seen, and quite possibly the best movie ever made. Boy that is the last time I ever take a recommendation from him!!! This movie ranks up there (or would that be down there??) as one of the worst movies I have ever had the displeasure of sitting through. In the entire movie, there was only one line that even made me grin just a little. Whoever is responsible for this piece of inane drivel should be banned from making movies for eternity. Having spoken with many people of all ages, I have come to the conclusion that there are 2 types of people who have seen this movie - (a) those who ""get it"" and think that this movie is extremely funny, and (b) those who don't ""get it"" and just sit there at the screen going ""what the **** am I watching"". I have also discovered that your age at the time of viewing will determine which group you are in. I think that a lot of ""younger"" people (i. e. teens to mid-late 20s) will be in group A, while ""older"" people (30+) will be in group B. I am proud, no make that damned proud, to put myself in group B!! If I never have to see this movie again it will be too soon!! AMENDED 30 JUNE 2007 - No longer the worst movie that I have had the displeasure of sitting through. That title now goes to BORAT!!",Napoleon Dynamite
316,JohnnyNoGood,Short should've stayed that way,7,13 July 2004,"After seeing a preview for Napoleon Dynamite before Supersize Me, my sisterand I were cracking up. We were both anticipating it's arrival and it has finally come to a local independent theatre. After seeing the numerous teasers on MTV and the enlightening reviews, it was bound to be worthwhile. I must say, I was a bit disappointed. I read somewhere that this film was based on a short that was done for class. And having seen the same jokes and situations for almost anhour and a half, Napoleon Dynamite should've stayed a short. The jokes got old, the characters remained the same through the entire film, and not much teased the viewer to put down the remote and go out to see the movie. All of the good jokes were in the previews and to some extent, I think THAT'S what everyonewanted to see...just the preview. The first 30 minutes are great, but things start to lag and get stale. I enjoyed the general idea and Dynamite's negative view on everything, but there were also things in the feature length that the youngdirector could've expanded on (like one central bully or Napoleon's relationship with Debbie and Rico). I would've payed the same price to see this one as a 15 minute short...because that's all you need to appreciate it. And it is an enjoyable film and worth seeing just for the creativity and originality of it.",Napoleon Dynamite
317,mdixon,"This is one ""sweet"" movie :-)",9,6 October 2004,"I LOVED this movie - it was ""awesome"" :-) It's one of those quirky sort-of offbeat goofball movies, uncommon because in this one everything just works.Especially the lead actor - he was great! (Or as he might say ""awesome""). Nothing really seemed to get in the way of anything else - it all just sort of falls together.What I really liked about it was that it had no big agenda, didn't try to blow you out of your seat, no tiresome social commentary, etc. Just a great way to spend an hour or two simply watching, not thinking and being entertained.The ""quirky"" gameplan doesn't seem to work too often for one reason or another, usually because of an overt sense that the people in the movie were trying to prove to the audience just how quirky their movie is. Which of course alerts you to ""this isn't really a quirky movie although I'm supposed to think so"". It's kind of like that U.S. Justice instead saying he can't define ""quirky"" but ""I know it when I see it"". He would certainly recognize it here.The lead actor (I thought) was sensational but never having seen him before it's kind of hard to say if maybe that's the way he really is; maybe it didn't require a lot of acting on his part (when you see him you'll know what I mean). Like Carroll O'Connor playing Archie Bunker - it's done so well you can't tell if maybe there's no acting going on or O'Connor just plays that one part to perfection.Most of the main characters were really well written, what there was of it. But with what little there was, and some inference, you got a good sense for who they were (especially Uncle Rico). The editing was great in many spots - appropriately dramatic enough to really seal the deal (jokewise). And what often really cements one of these kinds of movies is the music - perfectly selected in this one, right down the line. The one complaint I have is that it's not enough - I want another ""Napoleon Dynamite"". I could easily watch this movie many times (and plan to), over and over, thoroughly entertained each time.8/10 (where a 9 would be ""The Big Lebowski"" or ""Punch Drunk Love"").PS There is more movie after the very last credit (I hate it when moviemakers let you discover this by accident). Nothing you'd feel cheated in missing but a little more ""Napoleon Dynamite"" before departing.PPS I've read some of the comments here and it occurred to me that maybe since I was more likely to be the kind of kid that would 'torture' a kid like Napoleon (not in a devilish, brutal manner), I therefore could not identify with him and consequently might have a different take on this movie. Perhaps because of my perspective I judge this movie not from a personal sense where I know what it is to be a kid like that, but instead dispassionately from the outside being entertained by an uncommonly well-made offbeat movie.",Napoleon Dynamite
318,lost4wurds,Funniest Movie I've seen in YEARS!!,10,14 June 2004,"From seeing the score given to this flick, about the only thing I can figure is that this seriously must be one of those movies that you either love or hate. My friends and I, all former (and honestly, current) geeks were dieing in the theatre. And, yes, I was aware that the entire place wasn't falling apart, so I even saw the mixed reactions in there. I personally felt that this was easily one of the funniest movies I've seen in YEARS, folks. No lie. I almost fell over on at least three occasions! As soon and my friends and I left the theatre, all we could do was talk about Napolean and Pedro. We were quoting the movie all night and vowed, after about an hour, to see it again as soon as possible! It was just fantastic and beautifully understated! 10/10",Napoleon Dynamite
319,Kurt-15,Puzzling appeal,1,15 January 2006,"A boring, anachronistic film about unlikeable people, undeveloped characters and lacking a clear plot.This film does not create empathy for its title character, instead it encourages its audience to laugh at him. Laugh at his inability to communicate to friends or family. Laugh at his horrible sense of fashion, and laugh at the sad reality of growing up in the Midwest.While countless other films glorified the lovable loser, this film goes in another direction by exaggerating the character flaws in a character whose only strong skill is to perfectly alienate all those around him, in a cowardly, passive aggressive manner.This film does have, without a doubt, excellent photography, great pacing and scene composition, although it is a uncomfortable film to watch.This film does pay homage to many great 80's era teen flicks, and those references are charming, the film lacks the charm of that era. I found the throwback costume and style of the supporting cast distracting, Heder's character annoying and the film as interesting as a hospital waiting room.",Napoleon Dynamite

There's no real plot to speak of, and no real logic behind why Napoleon becomes the ""hero"" of the film.SPOILERHe randomly picks up a how to dance video at a thrift store (we don't really even know why he's there), then he's randomly given a mix tape by LaFawnduh. His character has no motivation to learn to dance, and hence save the day for Pedro, it's just random events.I guess he's just doing whatever he wants to!

The movie moves seamlessly from one vignette to another and has only one goal: let Napoleon be Napoleon. (""Is Napoleon there?"" ""yes"" -pause- ""can I speak to him?"" -another pause- ""You already are."") There never has been anything like it, and never will be again I suspect. The true essence of nerdiness distilled to a fine elixir to be enjoyed by all.This movie is not to be missed.

What I loved about it was how Hess kept us guessing with respect to the time setting of the flick. At times it looked like it was set in the 70's and yet you had cell phones, references to 1982,internet access, etc. I loved the labeling on the time machine! Also, some of the students in the school looked 30 or older. Was that done on purpose? Seems like Hess hired whatever actors were available, regardless of age and said ""you're playing a high school student"".Other things that made this flick look like something out of the 70's was the multi-level home and the mile long cord on the phone.",Napoleon Dynamite

My favorite characters in Napoleon Dynamite are: 1)Napoleon Dynamite, of course, number 2, Kip and number 3, logically Uncle Rico! Napoleon Dynamite is my NUMBER 1 favorite character because he is so nerdy and no body likes him and I feel so sorry for 'im. Also, I admire Kip because he is so neutral and has no emotion whatsoever, and he's a total wuss, which is humorous!

This film barely has anything fowl in it. Some language is heard the only one heard is ""Crap"", that's it. Freekin is used as well. But, there is no major swearing in this film.

This crap was on the humor level of a 6 year old male (definitely male). That said, my 18 and 21 year old sons just love it. I wanted to slap Napoleon and his idiotic brother.

Everyone in the film is borderline eccentric. The film doesn't have a plot, it's a sequence of events in high schooler Napoleon's Dynamite's world. A students election is inevitable from the film's high school theme. Jon Heder and Aaron Ruell who play the two Dynamite brothers (Napoleon and Kip respectively) can take a bow for their crackling performances. One of the reasons I found this film lacklustre was because of the slow and sing-song delivery of dialogue almost every person in the film did. My favourite part about the film was the innovative title sequence that included Napoleon's drawings and items of food.",Napoleon Dynamite

But, for some reason, it struck a chord in me and I found it hilarious.The characters all seem to not only not fit into their place in high school, but in life in general, and that is perfectly shown by having Napoleon say everything with his eyes practically closed. Are these people breathing the same air I am? Of course, it helps that I grew up in the 1980s and one of my best friends was from Columbia, so I can identify with the Napoleon-Pedro friendship.Not only that, but I attended UC Berkeley as a computer science major and I met so many characters like Kip and Napoleon there, and one of the things this movie answers is ""how do these people actually function day to day?""

Napoleon Dynamite is a teenager who goes to high school in Idaho. He has an afro, large glasses, tucked in shirt all the time, and some ""SWEET!"" moon boots. This is the story of his life. When Napoleon and his brother, Kip's grandma leaves. They have to live on their own until their grandma is injured during her trip to the dunes while she is Four-wheeling and their nasty Uncle Rico comes. Napoleon hates him which is a problem. When he is at school, he meets a friend from Mexico named Pedro. He has the ""Friggin' sweet"" sledgehammer bike, a mustache and an Awesome wig (which he has to wear after he shaves his hair) And when Pedro figures out about a presidential election for the school, he asks Napoleon to help with him. Which concludes to the best part of the film. Napoleon Dynamite gets an awesome song, puts it in the large CD player and dances to it. Oh yeah, did I mention he dances if front of the ENTIRE SCHOOL! Believe or not, he is brilliant. Deb, who is a girl who is a shy quiet girl helps Pedro and Napoleon after the school dance.At the end, Napoleon and Deb like each other.There is a scene after the ending credits.

333,ericsinla,There's Something about Napoleon Dynamite!,10,27 February 2005,"What is it about the movie Napoleon Dynamite that people love? What is it about the movie that people hate for that matter? The latter trend is something for a different article; this article however will focus on the LOVE. Why do fans of this movie watch it over and over and quote it incessantly? Love it or hate it Napoleon Dynamite has become what is known as a ""cult movie."" Only hands full of films throughout history have this type of following. The Rocky Horror Picture Show, This is Spinal Tap, and the Austin Powers films are a few that share this same type of phenomenon. All of these movies have had the type of success that could never have been planed. In the past several months Napoleon Dynamite has developed a cult following. For starters it grossed over $ 49,000,000 in theaters. For a film that was produced for an amazingly low $200,000, that is no small feat in itself. It debuted as number one in DVD and Video rentals back in December and has remained in the Top Ten for the last two months. It has gone Number one to No. eight and then returned to No. six in the last two weeks. But that's just the beginning. There are Napoleon Dynamite t-shirts and merchandise being sold online and at Hot Topic. There are Fan clubs and biog sites online and thousands of threads dedicated to the film. Millions of youths are quoting this film in the High Schools and Middle Schools throughout the US and elsewhere. One school was even reported as to having proposed to have a ""liger"" as its school mascot. I have to admit the first time I tried to watch this film I was a little put off. The characters seem so real and deadpan. I thought that the movie was mocking misfits. The more I watched it however I realized that the film wasn't an exploitation of ""geeks"" or weird people (as EW's Owen Glieberman has called it) but an affectionate celebration of the ""dork"" in all of us! And by the end of the film I was completely won over by Napoleon (a sort of modern day anti-hero) and the plight of his misfit friends. Jon Heder gives the performance of a lifetime as the awkward yet oddly self- assured Napoleon and Aaron Ruell is hilarious as his ""chat-room"" obsessed brother Kip. All of the above mentioned things are funny and entertaining but what is it about this movie that people are responding to in a ""cult like"" way? I have few theories. I believe the movie has an infectious and sometimes almost mesmerizing way of telling a story that most young viewers are not used to seeing in a movie. The dialog is obscure but catchy and its full deadpan sentences and phrases that get caught in viewers ear and become funnier upon hearing them repeated. The characters especially Napoleon Dynamite are the types of characters that become ""gags"" in themselves. Just looking at these characters is sometimes amusing. But in he context of the absurdity of this film people want to add to its humor somehow. This is unlike anything we've seen in teen movies. If you look at most films geared toward young people these days (Dodgeball, American Pie) there is always a glossy Hollywood approach to the movie-making and humor. They are loaded with vulgarity, sophomoric pranks and good looking well known actors. Napoleon Dynamite is different. It takes it's time to deliver its offbeat punch lines. It offers the viewers a glimpse into rural America while making them laugh at its universal theme of ""outcast geeks"" triumphing over ""the popular kids."" And for once this is done with a PG rating. This is a movie with no sex, violence or profanity. You could show this film to any age group and yet it has an edge to it. The edge being the movies offbeat quality, sometimes the film makes you believe that something bad will happen and when it doesn't the scene plays out in a more innocent or funnier way then the viewer would have expected. Jared Hess shot his ""geek epic"" like an art film featuring little (or sometimes no) camera movement and lots of wide shots. I think this is also a part of the films appeal. Although most people just see it as unique (and unique it is) there are very few movies that have this kind of effect on an audience and a following where people are compelled to mimic its content. Jared Hess and company should be some given credit. It's only the only film I can think of that's an Independent film made by Mormons, that's an ""art film"" for teenagers, that was filmed in Idaho, that has a lama and a time machine, and that has a Jamiroquai and a White Stripes song in it all at the same time. It's just about the best movie ever made! So if you haven't seen Napoleon Dynamite yet you should check it out, you're missing out on a great moment in movie history!",Napoleon Dynamite
334,flying-monkeys,Don't See The Point,6,26 February 2005,"There were some really funny parts in this movie but what was the plot? And I'm sorry but Napoleon was just plain boring. Sure I know what's it like to be considered a bit of a geek but I just didn't connect with this character at all. The funniest scene to me involved the phone cord. *laughs* I guess you have to remember having those old rotary phones with the 20 foot cords. The brother, Kip, was pretty hilarious as well but when you put the movie together, as a whole, I didn't think it was as great as everyone was saying. To each his own. This is definitely a ""you either hate it or love it"" type of movie. I don't think there's any gray area where Napoleon Dynamite is involved. Just my opinion as always.",Napoleon Dynamite
335,honkus,"Startlingly original, hilarious comedy",10,26 July 2004,"I had been waiting to see this movie for six months, after I missed it at the South by Southwest festival in Austin.  Half a year later, it finally came to my town, and to say it was well worth the wait would be an understatement.  I rarely find myself laughing out loud at the theater, but here I couldn't stop for almost the entire running time.This is an entirely unique brand of comedy, utterly unpredictable.  Each joke flows into the next while remaining its own separate and hilarious entity.  Each character is well-developed and endearing, despite being so off-the-wall that their every action is funny.  Although many of the events in the movie seem ludicrous and contrived, the audience is kept in the story by the realistic, down to earth setting.  (All of the non-major characters look and act like normal people, and are funny just by being themselves.)The most surprising thing about the movie, though, was the heartwarming message -- free of cliches, out-and-out moralizing, and condescension one sees in almost every family film.  In fact, you don't even see it coming until a very moving moment at the end of the film, after Napoleon uses one of his many special ""skills"" to win over his fellow students.  After bearing Napoleon's burdens through the entire film, the audience now gets an uplifting feeling of vindication and worthiness that is absolutely genuine. This and the PG rating (which adult viewers won't even notice because of the complete success of its clean humor) make this a great film for anyone.",Napoleon Dynamite
336,xtremegurl88,This movie vividly sucks!,1,17 January 2005,"OK, this movie got way too much media attention. What should have been said of the movie is this ""It has no plot!"" You can tell by the previews, but it is even more illustrated by the way the movie goes.The basis of the movie is...there is no basis. It has a few funny characters and a petefial uncle with llamas. There is nothing hysterical about it. There are a few places where you can giggle, but it is nothing to get your panties in a twist over.I am usually a fan of indie films, but this movie...poorly made and just very stupid. If you are on drugs while watching you may enjoy it, otherwise there is no point to watching it. It is an hour and a half waste of time.",Napoleon Dynamite
337,pmc-17741,Story of our collective lives,10,17 May 2021,"The director was born in 1977 when I turned 16. I experienced boredom in the afternoon or early evening when I watched all the shows I was interested in, read too much earlier, and friends were out of town, or moved away. The worst behaviors that teens got into were finding someone to buy hard street drugs, mostly speed and downers, and mom and dad hard liquor stash. Also grand theft auto, no not the games, but really stealing a car, drive it out of state, and sell it to be stripped down for parts and walk away with $500 for each guy on a car worth $1500 to $2000.For the Clark Kents like me, I had a friend who was attractive to older women, age 30 to 45 and had sexual fantasies of his aunt. He would go on the next panty raid, but winter he went with one of her bras and later pantyhose. One school morning 9th grade he decided to wear her pantyhose to school and as he walked, he had to keep checking that in his mind that he did not have gym class that day. Each morning class he felt ashamed and even frighten, so he ran home during the lunch hour and used his mom's sewing sheers to chop it off of him instead of rolling them down to save. It took until the next week that he told me about this event and I said something like you are not a cross dresser. We both had a good long laugh over it. He did eventually get married at age 23 to a woman his same age and we stay in touch to this day.From another friend, I heard that during last summer, they wanted to see if a fart was inflammable, so one had gas and lower his pants and underwear and prepare to go, and the other one had a Bic lighter and he said they had ignition. Really dangerous for the one farting should the flame travel inside of him, he would need hospitalization.I was a paperboy 7 days a week and mowed lawns for my grandma, so made $100 a month and if you keep busy working like I did; you stayed out of major trouble. Class chums thought my family was rich, as I had money when they were broke. If you played little league sports or dance or boy girl/scouts that is how much of us stayed out of trouble.There is not one movie that every single person appreciate, but then we have something to discuss face to face and not only in a forum.",Napoleon Dynamite
338,pzilliox,Too Uncomfortably Surreal,3,23 June 2006,"Most of the time I enjoy surrealism as a source of humor in film, but this one made me very uncomfortable. I finally figured out why: Napoleon, Pedro and Deb live in a subtly eerie, perpetually awkward world which is all they know, but they clearly don't really belong in it. They're geeky and socially inept, but they, themselves, are not that different than any normal young teenager. Many of their actions are just honest attempts to best deal with the weirdness around them (with limited success). There were a few potentially funny scenes, but I couldn't enjoy them. I was too disturbed by the knowledge that these reasonably realistic teens were trapped forever in a surreal world of bizarre adults, mean classmates and unpleasant situations, and that the sole purpose in putting them there was so the we, the audience, could laugh at their clumsy inability to deal with it all. Surrealism can be funny, but the characters in this film aren't in on the joke.Several close friends were sure I would LOVE this movie. They were amazed when I reported back to them that my wife and I greatly disliked this movie--then we discovered that they were popular, confident cheerleader types in school, and I was an awkward, geeky outsider. I remember the pain of getting laughed at for just trying to fit in clearly enough that I can't laugh at somebody else in the same situation, even if they're fictional.This has become my ""litmus test"" movie. Before anybody gives me a film recommendation, I ask them, ""Did you like Napolean Dynamite?"" If they say yes, I discount their opinion.",Napoleon Dynamite
339,atandt,not all movies are plot-driven... and that's OK,8,7 April 2005,"If you haven't seen the movie: - understand that it has a story but ""no"" plot. you, in the audience, are meant to be an observer in a type of cinéma vérité, as it presents honest, believable, amusing, detailed, and yet surreal/quirky experiences of the various people in a small Idahoan town. You will be surprised when you see photos of the actors playing the main characters, and how much they ""acted"" their parts. the direction, cuts, jumps, etc. move along the story so that there is no need to dwell on unimportant bits for the sake of moving to the next significant one. the effect is efficient, and it's neat to not know where you will be brought to next.the focus is predominantly setting and character: -a main character is not by definition always a likable one, remember that! here the writers and actors do their work with grace in that what is revealed to us are unedited human beings, not polished, infallible caricatures of what our Leading Man/Leading ""Lady"" is supposed to be. The honesty and truism in this is also refreshing. you can recognise people in your own world more here than you could in a hip-hyped celebrity-studded blockbuster. the setting is pure as well-- shot on location, real houses not facades, vast prairie and farmlands, long shots of county roads, birds chirping in every outdoor scene. no symbolism or sweeping statements are intended by this either. you are simply shown What Is. the era is hard to place, combining old and new technologies & fashions-- this a thing David Lynch does. this adds to the reality, and speaks to several generations at once. the young people in the movie are diffident and awkward, with mannerisms and favourite expressions that they unconsciously repeat. The realism in the eye movements, the pauses , the breaths alone speak as loudly as the dialogue as for that, Deb basically recites her sales pitches from rote, & Napoleon uses coined words or mild oaths in every sentence.only those who trash this movie are claiming that it is a rip-off/take on other movies. keep in mind that the story we follow in this little world is based heavily on the personal experiences of the writer(s), down to actual dialogue. also, the other movies ND is accused of imitating are overly-stylized, forcing the actor into meeting a sufficient quota for hipness, urban chic... the teens in those movies are, not matter how alienated, still cool, edgy, and when they fail, do so fashionably (or tragically). not so in ND. Pratfalls happen, and you move on.the ageist warnings that you won't like/understand the movie if you aren't a certain age or lived through a certain era should be discarded. i'm certain that anyone can infer meaning from something unfamiliar based on the context-- if that wasn't true, we could *never* understand or learn anything, as there always would be a need for prior knowledge-- which is by definition impossible when presented with any fact or experience for the first time. sadly, the majority of the negative views expressed are poorly thought out, and due to being nonconstructive, are therefore unhelpful for someone wanting to make a decision for themselves. to be merely told that something is 'stupid' or 'sucks', or to use insults against the viewers who liked it say nothing of the movie or its fans but everything about the reviewer. there must be a few balanced yet negative comments out there, though... i'm sure some people like to be taken seriously when giving their opinions, and therefore have written a comment/post which accomplishes this.sometimes you can have a sentence that is good & makes sense but doesn't have a verb... there's no need to whip out a rulebook and declare it invalid as ""all sentences contain verbs!"". in the same vein, the question should not be whether a work did or did not do something conventional, only whether it was done well, if it worked. IMO, this movie succeeded at giving us a taste of semi-rural life, showing us misfits and snobs yet without ridiculing/punishing them, and leading us through a slice of life which speaks to our own.When it doesn't, perhaps at that moment another ND-loather is born. I personally think that the root cause of the opinions for or against ND are *not* based on age, personal experience, or location... I am convinced it must be genetic.... Once science has mapped the genome to find the bit responsible for what we find funny, then we can live peacefully side by side, knowing that what we once thought were matters of ""taste"" and ""opinion"" can be helped no more than our heights or eye colour.",Napoleon Dynamite
340,m2dad,"Brilliant writing, clean fun, countless noteworthy quotes",10,22 May 2006,"Within one minute of the start of this movie I was already laughing uncontrollably. In the mannerisms of Napolean I saw my youngest son, a junior high schooler who lived at the time in s. eastern Idaho. Although I had seen the name up on the billboard of our local theater here in western Arizona, it wasn't until I visited my kids in s. eastern Idaho did I get to see Napolean Dynamite. My kids kept telling me I just had to see this film. I sat down to watch it without knowing anything about it. As the movie played I laughed throughout the movie along with my kids (ages 25, 18, & 13 at the time). Although the movie had been out on DVD for just a week my kids were already able to mimic countless lines as the movie played. There is so much the filmmakers got right in making this movie. They succeeded in portraying bits and pieces of life in this area of the world. If you had the fortunate opportunity to live in s. eastern Idaho or in a n. Utah community there is much to identify with. But, anyone in small town America should identify truths about rural life in this film. And, having grown up in s. California and having gone to high school in the early 70's I could still identify with many of the types of characters in this wonderful, and even amazing film. The ensemble cast is quite noteworthy. It is very easy to think while watching the film that they pulled the main cast right out of the community and they were just being themselves. Having seen Jon Heder on Saturday Night Live only accentuated what a remarkable acting job he did as Napolean, and the same for the other main characters. The locals they did use in the film only added to the authentic mix of characters. The instant I saw Dale Critchlow as Lyle I thought I was going to bust a gut laughing. If you have lived anywhere near a farming community you will recognize his character. The writing is quite noteworthy. The memorable quotes from this film are many, more than almost any film I can think of, including The Godfather. What makes this film stand alone is that there is not one quote that you cannot laugh at in mixed company. This is all just pure clean family fun, quite in contrast to the lazy writing we are most often exposed to which exposes us to the ""F"" word and other profanity countless times. How original is that? If you are one of those that hate this film you either have no sense of humor or you take life too seriously. This is a clean and innocent romp spot-lighting the lives of people who are just trying to make it through life like the rest of us.",Napoleon Dynamite
341,dragoness,Unconvincing and inaccurate portrayal of nerds,1,21 May 2006,"The premise of this movie has fine potential: illustrate the boring lives of boring, nerdy people. Unfortunately, the whole thing is done rather amateurishly and exaggeratedly, and subtleties are ignored. The costumes were particularly amateurish and reminded me of the way people dress at Halloween when they want to look like nerds: late Seventies-style polyester everything. Well, the movie is set in the current time, and certainly nerds today look nothing like these people. For one, nobody wears a mustache any more. If anything, you wear facial hair if you're cool, not vice versa. Today you'd really have to search hard to be able to buy the glasses frames the main characters wear. They would have had to inherit them from their parents or something.In order to achieve comic effect when you're working with this type of non-story line, the acting has to be so good that you don't notice it at all. So good that you'd imagine these were real people filmed by hidden camera. Here it's nothing of the sort.If you've seen the original English TV series 'The Office' and then compared it to the American version, you'd know what I mean. The comedy relies entirely on very subtle stuff, which is pulled off beautifully by the superb actors in the English series. The inferior American cast unfortunately ruins the job.",Napoleon Dynamite
342,deltahotel,the funniest thing I ever saw!!!,10,1 June 2008,"This movie is a rare comedy that gets a super high rating from me. It is by far the funniest thing I ever saw. I give it a 10 because of it's uniqueness and replay value, and the more I watch it the funnier it gets. I can't get enough of it. The more you watch it, the less dumb it gets. It's a work of genius. I think my favorite scene is when Napoleon was standing against the wall and this dude walks by and checks him into the wall. A few seconds later Napoleon tries to kick the guy, when he is long gone. You can hear him grunt with effort, like he was actually going to land a strike on the guy. That scene has nothing to do with the story at all and that is part of why it was so funny. This film is just loaded with so many funny and subtle things, like the way Napoleon drinks from his bottle while talking to La Fawndah, his fascination with martial arts weapons, his membership in the Happy Hands Club, etc. I like the scene when his brother challenges him to a fight. Kip is much more of a wuss than Napoleon, yet he confidently says ""Come down here and see what happens if you try to hit me."" Uncle Rico's fascination with his failed football game in 1982, his living in the past, and get rich quick schemes are funny as well. This movie does not fail to deliver an unending string of funny scenes, without being loaded with sex or profanity. For those of you who think it's dumb or pointless, give it a couple more tries and I'm willing to bet you'll find it more entertaining and funny each time.See my profile for my rating philosophy.",Napoleon Dynamite

I heard it was good and decided to see it, but my parents told me if I rented it I had to watch it at least once... And I would have rather killed myself, and that was only the first 20 minutes into the movie... None, as in none of these jokes made sense since it kept skipping from place to place, like when Napoleons at school for a few seconds and then feeding his cow, and throwing food at your pet cow is a sad attempt at comedy that's not priceless...

344,cliffcarson-1,Movie is full of FAKE deadpanning that the editing reveals,3,9 December 2004,"I was looking forward to this offbeat little independent film but nothing could prepare me for the slow overly rehearsed and prepared 'takes' directed as if it were ""spontaneous"" ?? The film is unbelievably boring. One minor deadbeat joke is stretched out for a tedious 90 minutes until you feel pretty much hit over the head with it. Jon Heder seems to be faking a dead pan and it shows in many scenes. It's not his fault, The problem here lies with many of the takes lingering without an edit to the point of revealing their set up. You can almost see the director setting up his actors and telling them to ""HOLD THAT DEADPAN LOOK GUYS . . . OK, ACTION "". A wannabe WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE without the cleverness or showmanship. Despite the character, Jon Heder does seem to be a really decent and talented artist. His dance at the end of the movie is no less than mesmerizing. No matter what he ever does in his life he'll probably always be associated with this role . . . for better or for worse.",Napoleon Dynamite

The developed characters are all good, and shows that good guys can be interesting too, especially when they fight with other good guys. Bad guys are sketchy at best and lack depth and development, and represent problems to be overcome, just like the real ones.Celebrates any awkward time in life in which strong characters like Napoleon, Rico, Kip, and Deb stumble forward, sometimes limp, and help each other along the way, but even those who limp do not go backward.Interesting that some conflicts between the characters are overcome instead of resolved. Chock full of captivating and meaningful vignettes about teenage (and adult) life, with accompaniment from appropriate 80's songs. There is something different in here for everyone to get, for ages 6 to 16 to 36 to 66. Positive portrayals of racial minorities seamlessly blended by context into the plot. Apparent unification of opposites in that a movie containing what some may say is nothing but humorous fluff is in the end fluff-less. ""I caught you a delicious Bass."" Best movie of 2004.

It was like watching a 95 minute MTV promo where they show you these lame people like salesmen.I also found this movie to be bias. Reguardless of the fact that this movie revolves around a geek, the protrusion of the white female cheerleader being perfect and the Mexican characters being run down and poor.

I have never watched such an awkwardly made movie be so funny, and i mean that in the most sincere way possible. If this movie didn't have the awkward feel to it, then it would have worked.I give props to the writers and director. They created quite possible one of the most unique and weird characters ever to appear on screen. Every frame that they appeared in was just strangely amazing, and I found myself laughing out louder than anyone else, and believe me, everyone in the theater was laughing their asses off. I loved the guy who played Napoleon the best though. This performance was incredible. The way he moved, breathed, everything, was great. and the end, well, it was genius. It was such an articulate characterization. I wish Oscars were given out to performances like this. Noone else could have pulled it off so well. Props also go out to kip, who by the end is a totally different person... anymore than that and ill give it away, and i don't wanna ruin the surprise. And to deb- that girl was so cute and innocent and although had very little to work with, she made it all her own and brought out what could have been a small role, into probably the second most important, next to napoleonI also loved how all the jokes related back thru out the whole movie. it was so great to see how it all works out, especially the stuff with rex hahaha that was so funny, and the ""glamor shots"" photo hahaha brilliant stuff.What i think made the awkward comedy work was because it was well balanced between physical comedy and speech. The film manages, for the most part, to not overkill it. Yet once in a while, the movie talks a bit much, hence dragging on the length of the movie.overall, this is a great debut film from the directors and actors, and i would love for them all to do more work along this line.***1/2 outa ****",Napoleon Dynamite
351,dalehoustman,WET POWDER,3,9 October 2021,"Comedies can certainly arise from cynicism, from disgust and revulsion, even some of the best. But even then, it is important to maintain at least one ""point of reference,"" a relatively ""normal"" center to act as the viewer's surrogate. John Waters' early films for instance are certainly based in a revulsion at American values and cultural debris, but there is always at least one character (and usually more) who maintains their integrity and rises above the debasement. In Napoleon Dynamite there are none. It makes the film almost unbearable to watch, except for those who made it a hit, I guess. Its post-modern dismissal of humanity is more disturbing than humorous.There are boring and seemingly pointless human lives in this world, and who could doubt it? But this film (bereft of the human touch, a parade of obnoxious freaks) actually exploits rather than critically satirizes the essence of such lives. It tells us that there is either no escape from this ""hell of retardation"" or that such things are happening to others whom we never have to meet. Such a relentless put-down of every character is the opposite of comedy's revolutionary process. Comedy (even black comedy) serves the disenfranchised by both attacking power and providing release of anger and fear. But this film basically says that the people get what they deserve, because they are stupid and selfish and deserving of eradication. Such bleakness is not an appropriate vessel for humor, which is not supposed to leave the viewer feeling that any effort is wasted effort.The film ""Dumb and Dumber"" is an example of how little a shift in cinematic approach might have been necessary to create--if not a good film--a decently viewable one. I personally can't stand the ""Dumb and Dumber"" films, but, at the very least, the central characters, while wretchedly stupid, are given a modicum of integrity and are revealed to have genuine affection for one another and others. They are the heroes of the film. This is as to say, ""even the stupidest among us have value."" Thus a certain point of reference is provided us: ""yes, they are morons, but let's not put them in a bag and toss it in the river"".Some say (some always say) that this is ""just a comedy"" but comedy has never been (or should not be) immune from a critique based on its social and cultural ""value."" In fact, because comedy is the most revolutionary in its engagement with power and alienation and values, we can actually expect more from it than other genres. So we watch the great comedies of Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, Stan and Ollie, and what we see are disenfranchised men forging a system of values amongst oppression from capitalism, the police, the vain and the worthlessly wealthy. That constitutes a social critique.Napoleon Dynamite's killing flatness, its relentless pursuit of degradation lacking any light of ethical position, or escape is inimical to the very spirit of humor.A shoddy and mean-spirited product.",Napoleon Dynamite

In that respect, you either get these kinds of movies, or you don't, just like there are people who don't like Pulp Fiction or Citizen Kane.That said, if you like Jarmusch's off-beat, stream-of-consciousness style of directing, or the movies Sixteen Candles or Revenge of the Nerds, chances are, you won't be disappointed by Napoleon Dynamite. In fact, this movie is actually a substantial improvement because although it doesn't completely avoid them, it manages to soften and make more realistic the typical clichés for high-school characters, primarily the obnoxious 'jock' and his pretty, popular girlfriend. Yes, they disdain and harass Napoleon and, true to form, get their comeuppance. But, refreshingly, it's not done in the normal, formulamatic cartoonish mannerMy favorite aspect of the movie is the lack of swearing. There's not so much as a 'damn' in this movie, but it isn't a distraction because, unlike most 'G' rated movies, the acting and dialog is quite good.

356,ajh193,Worst Movie Ever,1,19 January 2009,"As someone wrote earlier, I would rather watch paint dry. This movie wasn't funny, or remotely interesting. It had absolutely NO PLOT and in my opinion, was the worst movie out of all the movies I've ever seen. I have never met anyone like Pedro or Napoleon in high school. There was not one funny line in this movie. In addition, it did not have any point. It went no where and it doesn't fit into any genre. It was not realistic and the acting was horrendous. In fact, the movie is so boring that it's irritating. It annoyed me to the point where I wanted to set my T.V. on fire. I would sooner drive a steel spike through my abdomen than to watch this movie again.",Napoleon Dynamite

My wife and I sat down, expecting a light comedy along the lines of ""Revenge of the Nerds"". Instead, we were subjected to 86 minutes destined to go down in motion picture history as one of the worst movies of all time. This ranks right up there with ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" and ""Night of the Comet"". I want this wasted hour and a half back!Seriously...disown anyone who suggests you watch this thing. Or better yet, if they offer to loan it to you, accept the movie, punch them in the face, then burn the DVD.",Napoleon Dynamite
358,ajudki20,Freakish Watchability,8,19 September 2012,"I won't attempt a traditional review here. I'd like to point out two things about Napoleon Dynamite which put it in elite movie company. The first is 'watchability'. This film is perhaps the most watchable movie I've ever seen. Whenever it happens to be on TV, literally, I'm able to watch it, whether I end up doing it or not. Most films create a sort of cringe reaction when even the suggestion of repeat viewing is mentioned within less than a year. This film's timetable is more like a week. And one can pick the film up, after an initial viewing all the way through, at any point and have no trouble enjoying it. It is almost like each scene is its own self reliant little film which has all the enjoyment a viewer needs available. To a large extent, this film's unambitious plot makes it mostly a series of vignettes, but those vignettes are so strong and so well paced that the approach is immensely effective and comes off looking brilliant if you think about it long enough.The second thing about this movie that makes it elite is how memorable it is. As a whole it is quite memorable, but I'm talking even more about specific, small pieces. Lines, momentary reactions or physical comedy moments, small details and little scenes burn themselves into the memory in a way that most films are incapable of. Every time I go to a thrift shop my mind involuntarily plays the moment from the film when Napoleon picks up a sai off the shelf and puts it in his belt loop. Red Gatorade makes me want to dance. I never look at eggs quite the same way, but they do make me want to look for arrowheads. The list is very long. I have a movie-loving friend who puts huge stock into how memorable a film is to him after viewing. He has a point: our mind and its biases can clutter our judgment, but our brains are sort of making an involuntary review of a movie when they remember something well, or when you are able to watch something over and over and enjoy it and not want to leave to room. Napoleon Dynamite may not be elite art on an intellectual level, but tell that to our brains! Our minds tell us there is something special about this film. It is mysterious.In a way Napoleon Dynamite is a perfect storm. Otherwise little known actors suddenly put in legendary comedy performances. Everything works---length, tone, plot, style, editing, music, structure, writing. The director and writer Jared Hess now seems incapable of creating anything in the same quality and innovation solar system as Napoleon. This film is charming to a huge degree, innovative, and well made on almost no budget. That alone is a huge achievement. But its amazing ability to burn pieces of itself in our brains and be watched with casual joy over and over is elite and perhaps unique and that should merit high consideration and praise. 8 and 1/2 stars.",Napoleon Dynamite
359,lordjord96,"9.4/10, an inspiring film.",9,15 July 2012,"Why is this film rated 6.4 on IMDb? The answer is simply beyond me. How can a film which packs superb acting, an inspiring storyline and hilarious comedy be rated so low?I rank this film 9.4/10 in my personal rating system. I found that, first off, the acting was simply incredible. Jon Heder (Napoleon) is just, wow. Never have I seen somebody pull off the solitary nerd so effectively. It isn't stereotypical cringe worthy acting, it's inspiring. The way his lines were written really make you feel for him and this is helped by Jon's superb acting. Then there's Pedro; I have never had sympathy for a character as much as Pedro. HE is a truly inspiring character and I applaud the acting.Next up is direction. The reason I like this direction is the same reason why I love 'Fargo', nothing seems staged, it all feels like a documentary on Napoleon's life, something Jared Hess should be very proud of. I think also it's the setting which does it. It's just, well, Idaho. Nothing really to it, is there? And that's what I love. The setting is just normal, the characters are a little less than normal and the story is well below normal. I love it.Do I have any worthwhile complaints? No, I don't. So, a film which is a combination of great acting, great direction and a great story; 'Napoleon Dynamite' thoroughly deserves my rating of 9/10. If you don't like it then 'Gosh, y' frickin IDIOT!'",Napoleon Dynamite
360,mswritesalot,Dud not Dynamite,1,22 July 2005,"My boyfriend commented that when he was in film class, his professor warned him that there are films out there in which the opening credits are better than the film itself. He says he has now seen one of those films -- Napoleon Dynamite. I couldn't agree more. I had to leave the room to preserve brain cells lest they atrophy while watching this waste of time. We waited and waited and waited for a plot that never even thought about manifesting, everything that was supposed to be funny wasn't, and I quickly reached a point where I wanted to slap brother Kip hard enough to knock the taste out of his mouth. Maybe you have to be absolutely stoned to enjoy this movie -- I dunno. I'm just thankful that we borrowed the DVD rather than paying to rent it! Boyfriend says he's going to have a LONG talk with his daughter about her glowing recommendations of this film.",Napoleon Dynamite
361,ablang,Hit or Miss,7,14 July 2005,"Let's get one thing perfectly straight. Napoleon Dynamite is either a hit or a miss. You'll either love it or hate it.This is one of those stupid comedy movies. It's an independent movie that didn't have much going for it. The acting sucks. There doesn't seem to be an actual storyline. But you do feel for the characters, perhaps out of pity.I feel this movie has a few good redeeming qualities about it. 1) Hilary Duff's sister, Haylie is on it. She plays the prototypical popular stuck-up blonde chick, which seems to be the only role she is suited for, and really not very good at. 2) There is some physical abuse that people will find funny. 3) The musical soundtrack, including 80s movie is awesome. And 4) The dance skit that Napoleon does at the end is very cool.Those are the reasons I gave it a 7 (out of 10). It's not great, but it's not bad either. Funny thing is, I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel, just to find out what further happens to the characters.",Napoleon Dynamite

Everything in the movie is 100% perfect in every way, and the comedy is genius. I don't think I can explain it, but the writers and directors must be operating on a different plain of intellect and existence than us, and they have created perfect comedy that is impossible to explain and is probably beyond our intellectual capacity of understanding. I think my iq decreased while watching this, but my mind is Probably just experiencing a level of genius that it is not yet evolved enough to understand. I've legit never laughed harder at a movie in my entire life, and I don't know what else to say. This is a piece of film that is 10/10 in every way imaginable, and even in some ways not imaginable by our human minds. I don't need to recommend this, I need to force this on all of you.

364,pearl_girl79,Pretty much the best movie I've ever seen,10,10 October 2005,"What can I say? Its a plot less movie about nothing. The main character is a total geek, and yet, I cant help but love him and his friends Pedro, Deb and his brother Kip. This movie IS hilarious.Its just basically a story about a teenage kid and his life in a small town (seems stuck in the 80's). He gets beaten up at school on a regular basis and has only two friends, Pedro and Deb. He lives with his Grandma, and his 35 year old brother Kip, who spends his time ""Chatting to babes online"". Kip thinks he's this total stud, but he's really this scrawny little geek. I think that something that helps one to connect with he characters is being able to relate to them. As a teenager, you were either LIKE one of them or you went to school with someone like one of them, and they were probably your friend. The ""Summer Wheatly's"" of life (probably) wont like or get this movie.This movie is a source of constant quoting and obsession among me and my group of 21-31 year old friends. We constantly quote Napoleon and reminisce about our favorite scenes, and we even have purchased and created Napoleon inspired clothes. This movie could easily be that for you and your friends.You gotta see this movie, give it a chance!",Napoleon Dynamite
365,talkjawking100,"It was once okay, but now it has slumped down to complete idiocy.",1,7 October 2005,"Let me start like this: If I see one more VOTE FOR PEDRO or I LIKE TATER TOTS shirt, I'm gonna snap. I'll literally kill whoever I see wearing that shirt.Why is it that an average, half-okay half-mediocre comedy, gets turned into the most over-hyped over-used indie CRAP on this world? Now I have a hard time admitting this, but I didn't mind it the first time I saw it. I thought ""The worst day of my life, what do you think?"" was one of the most clever lines in showbiz history. There were a few others like that, but overall it was really overrated, I thought.I thought the movie would lose popularity very quickly, like a lot of movies that come out nowadays and are way over-hyped. But no. Oh no no no. I was sadly mistaken. This movie only got more popular. Especially here in Utah, where Mormons finally found a movie that was over-hyped that they could watch (since it's PG-rated), and the popularity still isn't dead. I say something to someone that a normal person would respond ""cool"" to, they do that stupid-ass ""Yessssss"". And that was just yesterday.And the worst of all: a church held a youth dance a few months ago. Now, when I say 'dance', you think of teens dressing up and picking up girls to go and dance to soft love songs and hip pop songs and drive home afterward, right? Yeah, that's what dance it was.......except it was a NAPOLEAN DYNAMITE THEME DANCE. That's right. Everyone was to dress up as their favorite NP character and go to the dance.Yeah. Believe it.So, I say to every fan........STOP PRAISING THIS MOVIE LIKE IT WAS THE MESSIAH OF COMEDY. It was only okay, and now it is a major ball-sucker. I give it 2 out of ten, just for the small things that still manage to make me chuckle, but that's it. That's very kind of me, considering the annoyance I get from the die-hard fans makes me wanna give this a negative ten.",Napoleon Dynamite
366,garysjwa,Like nails on a chalkboard.,1,15 June 2005,"Yeah, it's a cliché, but I can think of no better way to summarize the cinematic train wreck that is Napoleon Dynamite. It irritates the hell out of everyone, and the person doing it actually thinks it's funny.This movie just seemed to revel in being annoying. Every character, every scene, seemed calculated to insult and irritate any thinking person who tried to sit through this dreck. Nothing in this movie was likable, interesting, funny, quirky, or even benign enough to ignore. I just wanted to slap the entire cast.Here's the scene that best sums up this movie's awfulness. (Warning: this might qualify as a spoiler.) Napoleon wants to go to the school dance with the equally dim-witted and emotionally challenged Deb. But apparently she's going with Napoleon's new pal Pedro. Rather than discuss his feelings with his best friend and his closest female acquaintance, Napoleon gets the brilliant idea to ask one of the popular girls at school instead.Napoleon decides to try to win the popular girl's heart by drawing a picture of her -- something he might actually be able to manage. Finally, a scene that looks like it might go somewhere. Will he win her over? Will Deb come around instead? Will something funny happen? Not in this movie. He goes to her house uninvited (icky), reveals his hideous Bic-pen-on-lined-paper drawing (really icky), and a little later in the film Napoleon's scheming brother Rico gives the girl a flyer for a breast-improvement clinic (really really icky).Then, even after his hideous artwork is revealed, the girl's mother doesn't let her turn down this obvious creep. I couldn't quite figure out why. Like I said, the script is not this film's strong point. Anyway, they go to the dance, where the girl promptly ditches Napoleon. He sits in the corner for hours, too stupid to even realize what's happened. Then, we're forced to watch Napoleon conjure up a lengthy series of pathetic excuses for his date's absence, while the dance goes on around him, without ever being poignant or meaningful or funny or even sympathetic.It's not just that Napoleon's an unlikable creep. It's that you're also forced to watch him bumble around a bunch of supposedly normal people who aren't normal enough to tell him to buzz off. Just once, I wanted to see someone in the movie react in a realistic way to Napoleon (or to anything else, for that matter). Never happened. If this movie was a plant, it wouldn't even grow towards the light.I could go on, but you get the idea. Contrary to what has been said, there is no subtlety, irony, or anything-y to be found here, except maybe ""empty."" This is an awful, unredeemable movie that Crow and Tom Servo couldn't save with a carload of exploding clowns and a full tank of laughing gas.",Napoleon Dynamite

There is No plot at all, the acting is terrible, I DON'T WANT TO VOTE FOR PEDRO SO STOP MAKING THOSE DAMN SHIRTS! They're everywhere, those insipid morons sporting Napoleon Dynamite themed apparel. I only have one thing to say to those people: You are not special. Those shirts do not make you clever/cool. Do not think you are the only one who has it, I can assure you, you are not. Burn it, the burn your movie and go watch The Crow. The original, not that other crap they'd like to call installments, especially the one with Tara Reid. Whoever decided to introduce her to the really world outside of alcohol and to a camera should be locked up. Napoleon Dynamite deserves to be ranked in negative numbers. Unfortunately this website does not offer that option. This movie is not even remotely funny as most would have it seen. For some reason people my age idolize it, as did those idiots in my chem class. This is the kind of celluloid trash that makes older generations fear for the world when the generation that loved ND ""takes over"".

OF THE SUMMER. i liked the film, very much like what my friends and i act like, then we film it, but after everyone started quoting it, i just lost interest. I cant stand when a person says a line from the movie that has been kiled, humped, and eaten for breakfast, i just feel less intelegent.The film follows the life of Nepoleon, a country side city boy with an eccentric family, and loner friends.

370,another-dreamer,Napolean Dynamite,7,3 April 2006,"Comedy, like sex, loses all upon explication. Why is Napoleon Dynamite funny or not? is not a question that I will not attempt to answer. You either ""get it"" or you don't, and there's definitely no shame in finding this film entirely banal.The plot follows a simple and familiar structure: awkward teen experiences trouble at home and at school - awkward teen develops a friend with a fellow awkward teen - awkward teen meets awkward girl - awkward teen... and so on until the awkward teen is somehow ""redeemed"".(Somewhat tangentially, I wonder what this film would be like if it was put into the hands of Todd Solondz. I imagine we'd have quite a devastating film, similar to ""Welcome to the Dollhouse""...)Perhaps it would be helpful to describe the type of humour that is found in Napolean. I find the humour to be similar to that found in ""Waiting for Guffman"", or ""Best in Show"", but somehow less gleeful (and certainly not in the same class). It relies on the viewer to appreciate social norms and the inherent ""humour"" in witnessing these norms being breached by the characters in the film.I don't think much more can be said about this film that is objective. Personally, I found it hilarious, while at the same time I recognized that as a film it is pretty loosely assembled.7/10. Recommended.",Napoleon Dynamite
371,aurora7,"I hated it the 1st time, but it grew on me...",10,16 June 2006,"I saw this movie in theaters when it first came out and was quite curious because of the hype surrounding it at the time. When I walked out, all I could hear myself saying in my mind was ""What the hell just happened?"" and felt like going back to the box office and asking for my 10 bucks back.Reader, I positively *hated* it - I didn't ""get"" the humour and I thought all the people in this movie were just plain weird - like somehow this movie was ""trying"" too hard to be funny yet the humour was falling flat. Also the style of most of the folks had me wondering if this movie was in the 80's or something or if the film makers were torn between setting this movie up in the 80's or 90's or maybe if the film makers were making some sort of statement on mid-westerners being 10 years behind us east and west coasters - I mean the weird T-shirts, Naploleon's hair and attire, the break-dancing music, Deb wearing stir-up pants, the ponytail on one side, 80's music like Cyndi Lauper and poofy prom dresses. The only thing that gave it away that this film takes place more recently were the references to the Internet for Uncle Rico's time machine, the heavy techno-dance music that Pedro's cousin play in their muscle mobile and Kip's online romance with Lafawnduh as well as Napoleon's dance sequence to Jamiroquoi's ""Canned Heat"" at the very end (which BTW, seemed to be inspired by the ""Solid Gold"" dancers of the 70's and 80's).Then something strange happened. The film cable channels here started playing it frequently and I'd catch bits and pieces of it here and there and found myself enjoying the humour more and more. I was finally getting it and enjoying it - I was even starting the know certain parts of it by heart. My brother went out and bought the DVD of the film and now I can safely say, I really love this little film. After being absorbed in Napoleon's universe, you realize he's actually a really good kid and just trying to find his place in the grand scheme of things despite being misunderstood at school and at home. You end up *wanting* Napoleon to succeed and be happy and I think we can safely assume he does. In some ways, this film is like Napoleon, it's the small-budget film that could and I'm glad to see the cult following this film has developed. It deserves all it gets.To those of you who hated this film after watching it once, all I can say is I'd encourage you to watch it once more and give it a chance.

I thought it was some alternative independent film that had a crazy off the wall story I wouldn't understand.Then I was looking though the channels on television, saw this was on, and started watching. It was about 15 minutes into the movie. I couldn't stop laughing. The movie was absolutely hilarious. It was an alternative independent movie, but it has to be the greatest one ever made. It must have cost $10.00 dollars to make this movie, and it was worth every penny and more. I decided to rent it one night and invited one of my friends to come over and see it with me. It was even funny the second time. The 'Burbs was at one time my favorite comedy movie, but this is just as good. Everything about this movie is funny, and it has a very good story.

Given millions upon millions of dollars, any number of directors could've told the story of Howard Hughes or a scrappy female boxer. Those were great films, too, but Dynamite made our jaws drop while simultaneously lifting our spirits with its anachronistically hilarious depiction of modern Idaho. For those of us who remember Jon Gries in Running Scared and Real Genius, his Uncle Rico clearly steals pretty much every scene he's in.

The pace is slow, the references are great and the characters are believable. My best friend in HS was a guy from Laos, he didn't fit in great at first but was a character himself, Pedro brought back many memories. If you grew up in the period of this movie, you'll enjoy it, can't speak for anyone else. I didn't really want a huge review of this movie, but for the sake of the content gods I'll add that the movie does falter at times, the internet chat for example post dates the time line of the movie and really doesn't add to the story.

There are thousands of comments on this movie already, so there's not much to add except that my whole family, kids to middle-aged, enjoy this movie and watch it again and again, and are stuck saying the catch phrases. It is a character study of a variety of nerds and misfits, some of them likable, some of them not, but all very earnest in their drive to prove themselves to the world. Each person has their quirks, just like in the real world, and each person thinks the others' quirks are weird, just like in the real world.These are people I know, people I've met. There's not much plot, just a story of quirky people being quirky.",Napoleon Dynamite
377,ApprehensiveSpaghetti,"Kids, you have no idea what this is about but I don't care",10,10 September 2015,"It makes me feel old to know that I've been enjoying this movie since I was 12. That was 10 years ago. And it certainly throws into sharp relief the differences between the culture in the movie and the culture around us today.The film's setting - Preston, Idaho - is or at least was already known for being behind the times in comparison to other places (it is situated very near Utah, whose informal motto is, ""Welcome to Utah! Set your watches back 20 years!""). The film is even more of a period piece than ever since it not only went to an already old-fashioned town for its setting, but even what it depicts is probably not there anymore.Kids today have probably never had to deal with the extension cords on phones (like when Napoleon takes advantage of it to have a secret conversation on the front porch away from Kip & Rico), VHS tapes (Napoleon not only finds VHS tapes for sale at a Goodwill-sort of store but also already has a VHS player in his room), or expensive Internet connections that make being online in a chat room for ""four or five hours, maybe"" a pricey endeavor. Nowadays, cords on phones are virtually nonexistent, even DVDs - hell, physical media altogether - are falling by the wayside, and people stay online for hours at a time doing whatever they want without a second thought.Granted, I was born in 1993. At best, I was on the tail end of this cultural generation. VHS went the way of 8-tracks not long after this movie was released, and right around the time I began to enjoy it in earnest (it took a few repeat showings before it finally grew on me and I identified with its off-beat charm). But I was raised by a single mother for most of my childhood, which put us at a disadvantage compared to other kids - we ended up sticking to VHS for far longer than most probably did. I grew up with Disney tapes, and still have a fond place in my heart for them.This movie is a distillation of what real life is commonly like. The plot-driving conflict is by no means epic. In fact, it's downright pedestrian & boring. It's about a kid, Napoleon, who just tries to get by day by day while living in his own little world, but suddenly has the opportunity to make something he's never had before - a friend - and maybe make a little tiny mark on the world around him by influencing his school's presidential politics rather than simply keeping to himself like he always does.Does that sound like a riveting good time at the cinemas to you?Granted, Napoleon is a bit... eccentric. He's fond of drawing but he's absolutely horrible at it, and he makes some pretty big claims about himself (like hunting wolverines with not just any 12-gauge but a freakin' one in Alaska, bagging ""like 50 of 'em"") that are never substantiated in the movie. For no reason anyone can explain, at the beginning of the movie he ties an action figure to a string and tosses it out the window to drag it behind the bus as it travels down the lonely dirt road along which he lives with his grandmother & brother. The isolation and bizarre setup for his family life are probably what would contribute to someone developing a personality such as his.Long story short, Napoleon is a loser and he doesn't care. He knows it, but he's a winner in his own little world, where everybody knows his name, and that's fine by him. Until Pedro & Deb came along, he never really cared about anyone else in school anyway.But the film lets us know this is unusual for a kid his age. Napoleon's not virtuous and in fact can be downright annoying at times, as characters are often quick to let us know. But like it or not, he's a part of all of us. He's not conventionally attractive, no one else does most of what he does, and he has hopes, dreams, & aspirations just like the rest of us. We don't just share vague characteristics with him by virtue of being human & alive in this day & age - our connection with him is on a much deeper level than most realize.Napoleon is the fictional character I identify with most strongly, and this film carries a lot of nostalgic value for me for many reasons. That is why it is my #1 favorite movie of all time.",Napoleon Dynamite

Out of 10 people who watched it 4 were under 30 and 7 were fossils (like me). Without exception the over 30 crowd thought it was the stupidest movie in recent memory. The under 30 crowd seemed to enjoy it, even though they all had already seen it. I'm giving this a 3 from my admittedly parochial view of a 50 year old. Younger adults will probably like it, but the older crowd will sit in complete befuddlement as to what's going on and amazement as to how they've failed as parents in that their kids actually like this film.My suggestion is that if you rent this, it would be more enjoyable for the parents to find ""something else to do"" while they're kids are mesmerized watching it.",Napoleon Dynamite

Hearing all the praises from critics and kids from my school i was ready to put it on my movies list and give a 8 or something up there, but i'm going to not put on my movies list and i give it a five out of ten.napoleon is a very bland character(he has his pros and cons) living in a bland town(which helps the story a little bit) with bland characters.i barely laugh and the only good scene was the school dance. the story moves very slow with certain scenes that they had to put in or they would have another Peluca type almost feature length almost short. if the plot was a line made by a pencil the line would barely move an inch. a few scenes make you remember you school days(mine being the tator tot scene) but many don't need to be in the movie. the camera angles are not inventive, just mostly shots that look straight at the person, place, or thing which helps it keep its bland taste. most of the humor fell short for me and that is why this movie isn't for everyone. this movie did so well because of its comedy but that is why i didn't like it. this is my thought of the movie. its just a kids exaggeration of every day life. just listen to what hes saying everything is over the top look at the locker colors and how lashondah looks and how everyone looks. so in conclusion this movies humor isn't for everyone so my advice for you is rent first then decide what you think of it",Napoleon Dynamite

But Napoleon Dynamite seems to exist specifically to prove that a movie needs none of these things to be good. It was wrong.Napoleon Dynamite has no discernible plot. Characterisation is non-existent: there is no character in this story to which the audience could possibly relate. As an extension of that, there was no character within the movie to which any other character could relate on any sort of intimate level. Taking these two things out, all that is left is a series of tedious, unrelated passages of existence amongst a group of equally idealistically catatonic characters.When the end of the movie is finally reached, nothing has happened. No character has grown, least of all the main character, who remains the gawky, uninspiring boy he always was. Spoilers? There's nothing in the film to spoil.It is possible to work a movie around a lack of plot and character if the exchanges amongst the characters are entertaining; however, barring a few sniggers at some of the unimaginably stupid or unrealistic situations, the whole movie is simply a pointless yawn.I learned nothing, I gained nothing, I felt nothing, and I want my 1½ hours back.",Napoleon Dynamite

Most of the jokes fall flat, half of the scenes have no point to them, there is no plot, and the only likable character is Pedro, who barely speaks. Unfortunately the movie picks up only when it reverts to tired stereotypes (mexican gang members.) As seen as a drama, the movie captures a more realistic feel. The characters seem mostly real until Napolean overacts. I'm sorry, nobody walks at a 45 degree angle, though many of his other mannerisms seem reasonable.There will be scenes that are just odd. For example, he takes an action figure and drags it at the end of the bus while tied to fishing line. We don't know why. And the scene just ends. Huh?

Now, I was supposed to have liked ""Napoleon Dynamite"" because it was more ""underground"" than most other comedies released this year but...I didn't. I just simply don't understand the hype surrounding this movie and I don't think I ever will. ""Napoleon Dynamite"" has been called ""the funniest film of the year"" by nearly every high-school student in the entire world. I tried to like it, I really did, but the fact is that ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is absolutely empty. It's a two hour gag that runs itself completely on a style that sadly tries to mimic Wes Anderson's masterpiece ""Rushmore"".

The comedy was totally lame. The actors were simply annoying to watch. I can't think of anything good about the experience other than being grateful it was finally over.Jon Heder played the lead and he was irritating during the entire movie.

And that's just what makes Napoleon Dynamite so great.In my opinion, it is one of the funniest movies ever. From a critical standpoint, this movie as absolutely nothing to offer to esteemed critics, but it's not supposed to be that way either. Its humor is to only appeal to a certain brand of people, myself in that group. The humor hits every time, and the characters are so idiotic that you may as well be laughing simply at their presence.I can't go without mentioning how quotable this movie is. The quotes within this movie are instantly recognizable, and just give off an utter stupidity that will make you laugh every time.Comedies aren't supposed to be cinematic masterpieces, and Napoleon Dynamite definitely was not trying to win any Oscar nods.

I think we all got a small bit of satisfaction when Napoleon gets smacked in the forehead with a steak. That's what I'M talking about!!! These highlights make the movie worth being patient with. You had to be part of the right generation in the right kind of place to understand the cleverness in this movie. The movie is intentionally about nothing, with dull characters, and a weak plot. Any movie making fun of the mundane would kind of have to be. The movie is about the comedy of adolescence and the hilarious stages we go through in discovering who we are as we move closer towards adulthood. Any girl who has ever worn a pony tail sticking out on the side of her head and been able to wear a straight face while doing it should be flogged if they didn't laugh at Deb's character.",Napoleon Dynamite

It's not an uproarious comedy, it's simply the most uplifting, inspiring, feel-good movie I've seen in a long time. It's a movie, to quote Cletus, that ""celebrates friendship at it's basest level and demonstrates the triumph of good people above overwhelming odds"".Napoleon, obviously, is a loser. What I found inspirational is the fact that other than two times in the entire movie, there was no sense that Napoleon realised it (Rex-kwan-do's ""dress like peter pan here""; the 2nd ""cya"" to LaFawnduh and Kip). In one fleeting look away, and in one 'cya', Jon Heder beautifully betrayed Napoleon's self-delusion that he is one of the cool guys in life.Uncle Rico longs to go back in time ""knowing what he knows now"". This movie made me realise that if I could go back in time knowing what I know now I'd rather be Napoleon, Deb, or Pedro, than Summer, Trish, or that Billy Idol fella whose name I can't remember.This movie inspired me to one day give as pure, and as heartfelt a high-5 as Napoleon gives Deb in the very final shot of the movie.Keep following your heat, Napoleon.",Napoleon Dynamite

I'd say ""American Splendor"" was the last successful ""geek-is-cool"" movie because it wasn't necessarily going for laughs and was telling a true story (sort of).Look, I'm just as much into the retro-indie lifestyle as the next guy. I like thrift stores, I buy tapes and weird vinyl. That doesn't mean making a movie with all of those props and bad clothing is anything but props and clothing. It has to have a purpose and its characters need to have a goal or we will simply not care (and I didn't). Besides, all of the ""'80s stuff is funny"" jokes were very un-geeky in that they just went for the obvious and not the obscure.I really thought I'd love this film from the trailer (like I'm sure many did). Perhaps some people's love of this film comes more out of what they wanted it to be than what is really there. It's trite, mildly funny but not great or even very good. Todd Solondz, where are you??

390,stile1973,"Subtle, realistic, and minimal",6,15 January 2007,"I started out feeling aggravated by the film, but by the end had warmed up to the characters. That is probably due to the fact that the humor in the film is so subtle. I didn't find it laugh out loud hilarious as many of the users on this site have commented.The film is an examination of the lead character Napoleon Dynamite and his small outcast group of friends. The makers of the film, from writer to actor, chose to portray Napoleon in as realistic a light as possible. They don't try to make him likable, they simply present his character and let you either take him or leave him. And his character is subtle - it isn't really clear what his goal is. What does he want and what is stopping him from getting it? Story opens up in that gap between expectation and result, but in ND, that gap is so vague that it almost imperceptible. Hence I would have to file ND in the category of minimalism: the protagonist is relatively passive, his desire is unclear, and his character arc is minute.The theme of the film is hard to pin down, but I think it relates to non-conformity and the struggle of the underdog. To avoid spoilers, I won't give nay more detail than that on the theme. Overall, I am glad I watched the film - it is definitely a unique character examination. If you enjoy minimalism, you will definitely enjoy Napolean Dynamite.",Napoleon Dynamite
391,adidasraver,Interesting take on rural teenager's family and school life,10,4 October 2004,"Let's face it, we all had a Napoleon Dynamite in our school. The weird nerd. Not the smartest nerd on the block, but possibly the weirdest. He was the one that sort had an odd popularity. Everyone knew who the weirdo was. 'Napoleon Dynamite' is an interesting take on rural life as seen through the eyes of a gawky teenager. The plot seems to revolve around a time in Napoleon's life during his senior year when his Grandmother gets hurt during an ATV accident, and his Uncle Rico feels the need fill the void for Napoleon and his dorky older brother Kip. I had a few issues with this flick. It seemed to get lost in the time period it was trying to represent. I also did not enjoy the characters deadpan delivery. It almost seemed at times like they were little kids being forced to read their lines. Odd. Jon Heder's performance as the title character was engaging, but at not one point did I sympathize with the plight of Napoleon. As the credits rolled I felt neither happy, nor sad, nor enlightened...not even satisfied. I was really left feeling like I had seen the insides of some poor writers unsatisfying child life and I didn't even empathize with his situation. I found a few laughs here. Mostly slapstick stuff, but there were a few good laughs that were not just your normal flatulence based humor attempts. 6/10",Napoleon Dynamite

I decided to rent this out on the recommendation different people I knew, and because of that, now I am contemplating homicide. The movie was just simply almost too painful to watch. The acting was okay, likewise the cinematography. The problem was that it just wasn't funny, moreover, it was tedious, and had absolutely no plot whatsoever. Most of the characters spent most of their time acting like either they were on some serious sedatives, or had lobotomies, or were just simply unpleasant people. Sure, I knew people like this in high school. We all did. It doesn't mean I want to return to the wreckage of other people's youth, though. In an odd way, I found the movie reprehensible. It didn't glorify or champion the geeks of high school we all knew. Frankly, it only made fun of them. That was the only way you could find humor in this movie, for the most part. It was sad and pathetic. And the worse part of it is knowing that some people liked this drivel enough for the producers to probably want to produce a sequel....Coming soon to a theater near you.....

How does that make a movie good?! To me all that says is that ""This movie is so bad you have to think of funny things for it"" WHAT THE F**K?!I'm all for use of imagination but I found it sort of ironic since to me anyways this shows that the American youth has become so stupid they could laugh at a movie that has nothing in it but an uptight white dude and his friends who are just as meaningless.I HATE THIS MOVIE WITH A WHITE HOT PASSION I DESPISE IT I'D GIVE IT 0/10 BUT SINCE I'M FORCED TO GIVE IT A ONE, I RELUCTANTLY GIVE IT A 1/10 STAY AWAY FROM THIS CRAP!",Napoleon Dynamite

He's just plain painful to watch. I don't mean the actor BTW, because I'm not familiar with him. I mean the character, because the script sucks.There's a place on the screen for mindless comedy, but not for mindless trash that isn't funny whatsoever.

I had my suspicion that it would be understated, episodic and hilarious. I was correct on all three counts.To discuss any kind of plot would be missing the point entirely, since the film is only about the characters. Napoleon himself is a frustrated, awkward teenager who, refreshingly, isn't afraid to speak out. Whilst it is contained in a usual American High School setting, and the elements are all present (the nerds, the jocks, the princesses etc), the typical style of brash, loud comedy set-pieces is left out. Instead, the film is restrained and does not focus on any one particular aspect. Indeed it is very episodic, the links between scenes are weak - not that this is a criticism. Indeed, it is how the humour is driven. Napoleon Dynamite is a very funny film, and quietly so; much of the dialogue and events are presented not to deliberately make you laugh, but just to show you this strange little world and one strange little family set-up. But it is funny. At some points, it is too funny for words. Uncle Rico, a misguided no-mark trapped in 1982, is probably the root of much of the film's humour. That said, all the performances are top-notch; perhaps not in the typical acting style, since the performances are deliberately warped, but then again there is very little that is typical about Napoleon Dynamite.At the end of the film, and you may have to watch it more than once in order to grasp this, the film has actually achieved quite a lot.

They have mimicked their deadpan style (though a lot more dead and a lot less pan) , but have overlooked the importance of the ingredient common to Wright and Phillips and missing from this - wit and humour.

400,iollann,Review-Napoleon Dynamite,5,1 April 2017,"Review: Napoleon Dynamite Napoleon Dynamite is a quirky film. Directed by Jared Hess and starring Jon Heder, Efren Ramirez and Jon Cries it is a film about an alienated teenager who decides to try to help his friend become class president whilst dealing with his strange family life at home. This film doesn't actually have a story to be honest. 'Napoleon Dynamite' is a comedy first and foremost so when I re-watched, I had already seen it before, I was really only expecting it to be somewhat funny but to have no story. I think I was right. Although it was a bit painful to sit through it to be honest. Saying that though there were a few funny moments. 'Napoleon Dynamite', played by Jon Heder, is an awkward outcast in his school. He tries to help his friend 'Pedro', played by Efren Ramirez, run for class presidency, he deals with problems like getting a 'dance partner' and he deals with his strange home life. As I said not much of a story but it's more about the comedy which is sometimes funny. First and foremost Jon Heder does a great job at portraying 'Napoleon'. He is completely suited to the role. Now the character of 'Napoleon' is not at all likable he is an awkward, annoying teen. Although sometimes the awkwardness was slightly relatable. Now onto the humour. Some scenes stick out as being funny to me like of course his dance seen after Pedro's speech the awkwardness and the length of it is pretty funny. Also the scene where he is being pestered by a classmate: 'Napoleon, gimme some of your tots' That is a very funny, iconic scene. Now most of the other humour isn't for me. Scenes with uncle Rico played by Jon Cries are pretty funny as well. Uncle Rico is living in the past. He's still sour over his coach not playing him as quarterback when he was in secondary school. The relationship between Napoleon and Rico is some of the funniest moments in the film as they are usually arguing. In conclusion Napoleon Dynamite is a comedy first and foremost. There is basically no plot and the humour is sometimes actually funny. There is no deeper meaning, none of that. The actors are good even though they are given characters that are extremely hard to like. Overall I give it a 5/10. I would recommend seeing it if you like comedies with childish humour, much like most Adam Sandler and Jim Carrey films.",Napoleon Dynamite

In fact, I'll have to say that it captured the high school experience I endured in Freedom Plains, NY from 1961-1965 better than any other film I've seen. It's a beautiful piece of art and it left me feeling terrific. I cannot rave enough about the acting and the writing. I can't get this movie out of my head and I don't want to. Great music too.

I find myself sorting everything into two groups: things that suck + don't work, and things that are sweet.The great thing about this movie is that it spread mostly by word of mouth, and part of it's appeal was being in-the-know.If you've already heard every line of the movie from your friends, I bet you're going to find it boring.

404,lisayannaco,"Is Napoleon Dynamite, Dynamite?",6,6 October 2021,"Since its release in 2004, Napoleon Dynamite has left its mark on cinematic history by becoming a classic cult comedy with a massive fan following. The film was written by Jared Hess and his wife, Jerusha Hess. Napoleon Dynamite was adapted in part from Jared Hess's production of Peluca, a short film he submitted as an assignment while he was a student at Brigham Young University. The film was produced by Jeremy Coon, Chris Wyatt, and Sean Covel, with Munn Powell serving as cinematographer. Napoleon Dynamite's cast includes Jon Heder, Efren Ramirez, Jon Gries, Aaron Ruell, Tina Majorino, and Diedrich Bader.Jared Hess's Napoleon Dynamite is very unique comedy, and is vastly different from the other module films - Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator and Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing. Both latter films contain starkly clear political messaging and are based on circumstances that literally carry life-or-death consequences, while the former offers a more light-hearted viewing experience. Napoleon Dynamite's messaging is more subtle than The Great Dictator or Do the Right Thing, and it emphasizes the outsider perspective and explores the intricacies of grassroots political organizing. The film's main plot involves the awkward and socially inept outcast Napoleon (Heder) assisting a fellow student outcast, Pedro (Ramirez), in successfully managing his candidacy for class president at their rural Idaho high school.Napoleon Dynamite has an interesting history in terms of the film's creation and development. Jared Hess and Jon Heder met at Brigham Young University, and became friends through frequenting the same social circles. The film is inspired by Jared Hess's experience of growing up in Preston, Idaho - which is also where the film was shot. Hess constructed Napoleon's character from aspects of himself and his brothers, which he describes as their collective dorky and nerdy qualities.One of the most notable cinematic devices Hess employs throughout the film is the use of jump cuts, which produce the effect of movement through time. Additionally, the sound effects used throughout the film emphasize the onscreen character's physical actions, which makes them more pronounced and heightens their comedic effect.This was actually my first time watching Napoleon Dynamite, and I found myself noticing moments from the film that were often referenced in jokes and memes when I was in middle and high school, that I never truly understood the origin of (particularly ""Your Mom goes to college!"" and ""Vote for Pedro"" apparel). One of the elements of Napoleon Dynamite that stood out to me was the universal and timeless application of the high school trope. The film was released in 2004, but it could have easily been set in the 1980s or 90s based on the style and aesthetics of the characters. The specific time period isn't relevant to the story though, as these high school dynamics highlighted in the film (social outcasts, bullies, complicated family lives, etc.) are something that most, if not all, viewers can relate to.

However I must warn anyone whom hasn't watched it that even though it isn't offensively bad it is: pointless, slow, with a film student's amateurish feel, and above all *not funny*.OK perhaps I don't get it but still where are the punch lines? Where is the situation comedy in between the plot? And talking about the plot it is as common as they come. Dorky guy in school and all the usual tribes that exist not only in the US but all over the word. This would be fine because it has a universal appeal but where is the interesting funny stuff in between? I can't find a single positive thing to say other than maybe Jon Heder's acting. There's at least a couple of giggles even in the worst comedies, here I swear I didn't even smile once all though the movie.Actually I don't think it was ever screened in this part of the word but I bought the DVD after seeing Napoleon vs Napoleon in ""Epic Rap Battles"" on you tube with my 11 year old son. We were intrigued and got us thinking that we had missed a good comedy. Alas we ended up giving sideways glances at each other while watching it and the only ones laughing were the missus and my older daughter teasing us about the ""great movie"" we brought home.There are always a people enjoying movies I didn't like and I certainly accept that. How come this was so hyped I'll never understand.",Napoleon Dynamite
406,marcosr,"Awesome Name, Awful Movie",1,3 July 2004,"For a movie with such a cool title it sure was a huge letdown. Jared Hess plays outsider Napolean Dynomite, a teenager that spends his screentime being eternally p***ed off at the world for a reason that is never explained. It would have been nice to see his character figure out why he is so mad and solve it, but that would have required extra thought and heart on the part of the screenwriter. Instead the movie slugs through one failed joke to the next. The title character is written so far out there that believability flies out the window as soon as he opens his mouth. I spent most of the movie trying to guess what year the movie takes place in. I spent the rest of the time looking for some semblance of a plot but came up short. The supporting cast acts completely embarrassed to be in the movie at all and seemed to be waiting for the director be call a cut. Napolean Dynomite is mess of movie with little story and even fewer laughs.* out of ****",Napoleon Dynamite

At first I was confused, but as the film went on I realized how classic this film is. It is so basic, yet the characters are so interesting in a bizarre kind of way. I watched the film, waiting to see what crazy thing would be said next, I can see this film having a core audience and becoming a ""cult"" classic. I would recommend this film for anyone just wanting to see something different. I hope the writers come up with some more of these quirky story lines and get them out to large audiences. The frustration the main character has is evident in everyones lives at some point.",Napoleon Dynamite
408,phattdirty,A piece of comic genius with the best anti-hero character ever,8,29 November 2005,"This film is a piece of genius. There is very little plot but some excellent one liners including ""You know I'm training to be a cage fighter"", ""I can't fit my numchucks in my locker anymore"" and ""Your just jealous Napoleon cos you know I've been chatting online with babes ALL day"".Napoleon Dynamite is the perfect anti-hero - he is such a geeky loser but you can't help but love him.I wouldn't say its the best film ever made - it most certainly is not - and in terms of cinematic value it doesn't rate too highly - it doesn't break any new ground in terms of camera work or editing etc. But ND is definitely in a genre of its own and is unlike any film you are likely to see.Probably not to everyone's taste hence the low ratings and negative reviews but for some of us ND is the pinnacle of subtle, offbeat humour and the one liners are so memorable as they are so completely ridiculous.Kip, Napoelon's brother is one of the highlights of the film for me. He is an uber internet nerd but the scenes with him and LaFawnduh are nothing short of brilliant. ""Lawfundah is THE best thing that ever happened to me. Peace out."" 8/10 overall but 10/10 for originality and humour.See this film!! Gosh!",Napoleon Dynamite

I loved this film. If you aren't shallow you'll love this film too. First off, heres the only minor bad point. It's on the long side. But it couldn't have been any shorter. Some of the long takes are what makes this movie so amazing because you really feel uncomfortable (in a really amusing way) when you have to watch the characters suffer through an uncomfortable moment. Totally freakin hilarious.If you've ever felt out of place in the world, you'll love this movie.9.5 out of 10",Napoleon Dynamite
410,abutterw,A One-Act Pony,4,24 April 2005,"Maybe the reason I disliked this film the way I did is because I first saw it on DVD, after all the over hype.But I doubt it.By that time, the jokes were outspoken and unoriginal. ""Gosh!"" ""I'm having the worst day of my life, what do you think?"" ""Ever take it off any sweet jumps?"" Napoleon has been imitated so much I cringe now whenever I hear it.Which is what gets the film its substantial merit. It stays with you. And it is very well edited and shot for a small independent feature.But other then that, the humor is mundane, the story muddled, and the acting morose. It seems like everyone is either acting over the top or deadpanning.My recommendation is to give this one a pass.

413,wilbertvonbork,Everyone has missed the point in this film,10,23 October 2005,"Napolean and Pedro have Aspergers Syndrome; its a neurological impairment that basically wipes out one's ability to possess and process nonverbal communication. All communication is 80% nonverbal, so imagine experiencing the world without that ability. Watch the film again and try to identify how many times Napolean and Pedro have actual ""affect"" on their faces. Nerds are nerds, and Kip is as nerd as it gets, but he can read nonverbal cues and express emotion using his face and body and thats the distinction. This film is really about people who are labeled ""nerds"" or ""losers"" when they shouldn't. The On-Demand information that I have about this film reads: ""A frizzy-haired loser seems custom built for the torment of nearly everyone in this dingy small town in this quirky comedy."" Everyone has missed the point of this film. I have a degree in communication and work with children with autism, mood disorders, and other conditions that create behavior issues, so I immediately knew something was different about Napolean and Pedro when I first watched this film...which was last week, I'm a busy guy.",Napoleon Dynamite
414,horrorfan_86,"Funny, but in a different way",8,20 January 2005,"This is probably one of the funniest movies in a while, but it takes the right kind of audience and atmosphere. The first time I watched the movie, I watched it with just one person. I thought it was funny, but not that great. The second time I watched the movie, I watched it with about 5 people, and it was twice as funny as the first time. NP is a very refreshing comedy. It has no language, no sex and no crude or sexual humor; it's not that I don't enjoy comedies with adult material, because I do, it is just refreshing to see a movie that is hilarious without any of that. NP is one of those movies you will either love or hate. I loved it. My one complaint about the movie is that it moved incredibly slow at times. This movie is the kind of movie you would just sit down with a group of friends and have a good laugh with. Overall vote 8 out of 10.",Napoleon Dynamite

A little off-topic, but, a wonderful film nonetheless.Num-chuck swinging Napoleon Dynamite isn't trying to be funny, but his hilarious one-liners emulate his pure nerd-ism (if that is a real word!). The 'retards,' and 'frigin idiots' Napoleon refers to are really his goofy family, and stuck-up class mates, and are funny in their own little ways.Definitely worth renting.

416,boondoggle129,It will be Ten Years before you see a Movie this Good again.,10,5 April 2005,"Could it be? Is everyone in this movie a protagonist? It's a character driven movie. But let's give a big ups to the amazing crew who worked on this. The cinematography narrates. The unprecedented sound engineering transports the audience to a different world. The editing raw and dirty and inventive. The blocking of the actors is totally limited to the movement of their eyes. The costuming elicits a strange empathy and conflict between the labels of cool and nerd while not letting the 'bystanders' interfere with the character focus. The entire cast and crew, moving in the set of a real town, plays together like a well tuned jazz ensemble. But if you don't give a darn about all that, well, The movie is a character essay. You will need to relate to one of the characters in order to really like the movie. You may vaguely relate to the plot. Technical analysis aside, let's talk about you. If you don't relate to the character, or the plot, I guess your world ends and begins at the tip of your nose, just like every other Hollywood snoot who pans this film and fondles their collector's edition of million dollar baby. This movie is explicitly and in every dimension about the human need to try and do something, anything, to find the place where their dreams and quirks can cooperate. Same for million dollar baby and Gladiator. However, This movie doesn't have the sweeping majesty of the protagonist becoming the greatest on earth, (which is a required character trait for a best actor nomination these days) the movie has the sweeping majesty of a protagonist trying to become the greatest person to themselves. Yes, every tummy-tucked nose jobbed Academy voter thinks they are the greatest in the World, so they won't like this movie because the The movie is about trying to like yourself. If you are trying to like yourself, join your buddies in Napoleon Dynamite: The characters, the crew, the volunteers, and the town that participated. You'll be less lonely that way.

418,FioMnsfld,"A brilliant little comedy, but I didn't quite 'get it'",9,14 June 2006,"A lot of people say on the comments that they felt very happy after watching this film, I must say that I felt happy, but differently. I felt a very weird hybrid of depressed happiness. But it was definitely a good film, without a doubt, I just didn't really click with what was supposed to come across.I thought what made this film so good, though, was the visual style. If you look at it, the film has a very drained, boring feel to it. Everything from the colours, to the fashion, to the characters themselves, this film is boring, but it uses it to it's advantage. The main character of the title is conceived brilliantly. His fashion sense, dialogue, character and overall look fits perfectly with the overall geekiness.In fact, the acting in this film is top class. All the people involved really put a lot of effort into making the film feel even more boring. There's a lot to relate to here, but the character I really relate to (besides Napoleon himself) is Deb, Napleon's friend who is played brilliantly by Tina Majorino. I know so many girls who think that they are fat and walk around with zero self esteem. She's brilliant.And I guess that's why this film has such a love-hate relationship with audiences, because of how much they can relate to. Being thirteen years of age, I can't really relate to a lot in this film. But I still love it for it's simple quirkiness and charm. Some of the films lines really stuck out in my mind afterwards, because I use speech similar to it, or just for it's strangeness.'My god, you guys are retarded!''I like your sleeves.''Hey, Napoleon, gimme some of your tats!' 'No, I haven't had anything to eat today.' 'Napoleon, just give me some of your tats!' 'No!''Napoleon, you're just jealous because I've been chatting to babes all day.''Tina, come get some ham!'So on and so forth.All in all, the entire film is very slow, dry and bland, but is all the better for it.",Napoleon Dynamite
419,rugb,There is a plot AND deeper meaning...,10,31 July 2005,"You just don't get it. And that's not a slam or an insult because even many who like it keep saying the plot is thin and the film has no meaning. The proof is that anyone who bothers to watch it more than once will say they like it more and it makes more sense each time they watch it. Why is that? I thought this film was nothing but site gags and one-liners? Wouldn't that cause the film to get old real quick? Ask yourself why this has become a cult-classic. It's not difficult to see why.To say this movie is not complicated is an understatement. So why is the premise and meaning is still lost on so many people? Because of their expectations and preconceived notions. It's not typical or formulaic or ""what you'd expect."" And that's what makes it so great to those of us who get it. Let all that go and appreciate Napoleon for who he is and what he wants out of life. Put yourself in his shoes or Uncle Rico's or Deb's or Pedro's. Change your perspective before you watch next time.From the very first scene on the bus to Napoleon's various dialogues (or lack of) with Pedro and Deb, this film subtly approaches some amazing character development. Uncle Rico is a realistic character and superbly played by no one I knew prior. Consider that in light of the fact this was a B-budget effort and first major attempt for Hess until Fox got a hold of it. With a nearly-no-name cast and a very dry script, the simplicity of this film holds more water than it should.That says it all in comparison to the gaudy amounts of money spent on drippy dramas and over-the-top action films that continue to disappoint. Sure, those film's plots are discernible and easy to follow - and that's what's wrong. You're being fed what you want to eat. We're giving Hollywood credit for taking the easy way out because we are to lazy to think or focus during a film. It's easier to spend a lot of money when you have it and draw in box office numbers by fooling people with big name actors and explosive plots. It's more challenging to get a mostly unknown cast, write a story about seemingly nothing, and make one of the most unlikely adored films.There is a plot and a meaning. It begins with his line on the bus, transcends through meeting Pedro and Deb, poignantly highlighted at the Prom (the shot behind the three of them during Forever Young), blatantly obvious in Pedro's speech, and wraps up perfectly in the final scene. It's so easy...",Napoleon Dynamite

But the people who did Napoleon Dynamite took it several steps further. I wouldn't be surprised if this ends up in the Criterion Collection as well. Halfway through my second viewing of Napoleon, I noticed that it had put a persistent grin on my face that would not go away.I can see how many people would enjoy this film just for how painfully well the character studies were done. I personally feel validated, understood, redeemed, etc., and I love Napoleon, Pedro and Deb. A prime example of how the synergy of great script, acting and directing can make you care so much about a character in a movie that it hurts.Hopefully there will be ""more where this came from...""",Napoleon Dynamite

I just didn't see anything in this movie that I haven't seen done before---and to better effect---in movies like Welcome to the Dollhouse, Election, and Rushmore.  On the surface, it sort of seemed cool and ironic, but there was nothing beneath that.  The whole ""cool dorkiness"" aesthetic is interesting but shouldn't be used just for the sake of itself.  That's true for any artistic choice of tone or style or aesthetic.  There's got to be something supporting it to make it worthwhile.

It goes along with M*A*S*H* (the movie, the show may be the greatest thing to ever hit TV) and Baby Geniuses. Yes, I'm comparing it to baby geniuses. It was that bad.This movie is a comedy, but for some reason I only remember laughing once. When the guy shoved him into the locker and Napolean kicked at him. That was the highlight of the hour i could bear to watch.There was nothing memorable in the characters. Napolean was dull, his brother was an idiot, and it must be hereditary because so is their uncle. If there were any other characters, I don't remember them. Like I said, nothing memorable...I don't know what was going on with the script either. There was no plot discernible-unless it appeared in the last 30 or so minutes. Not that there's a problem with no plot, I've loved some with a hardly discernible plot. The script itself was drab. It's like it's trying to be funny but it has an air of pathetic that suffocates the viewer, with thoughts of 'how dull can anyone get?'and 'what a bad way to start a career, Jon...you've just been typecast...'.However there is some talent here. Jon Heder has Hollywood potential, but he's been typecast as a nerd, an image he's probability never going to be able to save.I don't know why everyone liked this movie so much. Maybe i like movies to accomplish something. Or maybe everyone else can't spot bad movies from good ones.

I found that it was boring and was not funny in the least for a movie that is praised for funniness.

424,labontearia,Unique,7,2 February 2020,"Napoleon Dynamite is a tale as old as time of a teenage outcast, albeit, thousands time more awkward than you remember. Directed by Jared Hess, the film centers around teenager outside Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder) and his life living in rural Idaho. By all means Napoleon lives an unextraordinary life. He lives on a farm with his grandmother and older brother (who both have better things to do then hangout with Napoleon). The film follows Napoleon's life after his Uncle comes to live in the house with him and his brother when his Grandmother has an accident. From here, all kinds of zany adventures occur. These include Napoleon's uncle selling items door-to-door, Napoleon's brother finally meeting his online girlfriend face-to-face, and Napoleon doing his best to help his only friend, fellow outside Pedro, get elected for class president.
It is a relatable tale of awkward teenager who gains redemption. On their quest for class president, Pedro and Napoleon try to win students over to their cause, and, while it does not always work, Napoleon ultimately ends up winning his fellow students over in an infamous and elaborate dance scene, securing Pedro's bid for class president and perhaps a bit more popularity and understanding for the whole gang of misfits. The film itself utilizes a beautiful static shot that captures the groovy body movements of Napoleon (along with his facial expressions) and emphasizes the utter cool-ness of the dance even though it's being performed by a gangly and awkward teenager.
The story being an outcast is a common one and though this movie is a unique one never seen before, it is reminiscent of movies past. ""Do the Right Thing"" by Spike Lee features a similar story line for it's characters, though instead of using awkward teenager years to highlight looks at the discrimination faced by different races.
The freshness of the film is undeniable and yet, it was produced by a team of new grad students in rural Idaho in a matter of 23 days with an extremely small budget. Perhaps this take on things and the forcing of operating so quickly and cheaply is what sets Napoleon apart from other comedies. Either way, though not everyone's cup of tea, there is no denying that this film is a step above the rest. The humor may be dry and the story itself very slow, but the it's worth it alone if not just for the dance scene. A classic comedy of the early 2000's, 7/10",Napoleon Dynamite

426,SinisterDreamMaker,Stupid Humor: A Growing Problem Among America's Youth.,1,5 September 2006,"This movie is just boring, play and simple I mean all it is riding on is the fact that stoned teenagers find almost anything funny (even lazy film-making). I was fooled into watching it like many of the others who have posted comments, and I thought ""OK I have been hearing a lot of good things about this movie lets give a try."" I feel like part of my life has been stolen away from me. This is a movie that you sit there and just keep telling yourself ""It is going to pick up this can't be all of it"", and then you realize the movie is over. Then I have to hear about how great of a movie it is from EVERYONE, which makes me hate it more then I already did. I have never been more underwhelmed in my whole young life. Napoleon Dynamite marks the climax of what I like to call ""Stupid Humor"" (if you need an example watch new Family Guy episodes) just this un-witty, un-clever, uncreative, lazy crap. Where it is just ""funny"" for characters to spend more time standing there in silence then doing anything else. Don't get me wrong I understand how silence can be one of the things that makes something hilarious, but that doesn't mean I want to watch it for 10 minutes of a 15 minute show or 60 minutes of a 82 minute movie.Just because something doesn't make sense does not make it funny! This movie is just lazy, lazy lazy, nothing is really funny about it beyond Pedro's cousins, but that isn't worth suffering through any amount of time in this movie. I pray to God that Jared Hess was stoned and/or drunk when he wrote this, for it would make me think less of the film-making community, no never mind the human race that a sober and ""clear"" mind came up with something like this.

It didn't make sense to me, and the cheesy bit after the credits where they get 'married' and ride away on a horse is ABSOLUTELY POINTLESS!!!!! This film could be so much better. The actor of Napoleon plays the roll very well as a sort of, boring and strange male. He speaks a good way, which represents his character very well.

It gets really confusing for me when I start to wonder if such a kid like Napoleon really exists in America because I totally cannot relate Napoleon to anyone I know of in my country because such a kid would've been in some kind of special school or some sort. I don't remember meeting any geeks when I was in school either.But then I rated it as 6. It lost 4 stars from me because I don't think it may appeal to Asian. The 6 stars I gave is for the intelligently written scripts, for its creative directing and especially for the superb performance by Jon Heder. Oh yeah I also like the filmography.

It also seemed as if the story didn't know which year it was supposed to be.This film is heralded as being ""hilarious"", but I think passing a kidney stone would have been more entertaining. It's true I laughed, but in only one scene for about 4 seconds. The rest of the film I spent trying to stay awake.

433,chewablesarcasm,The most charming movie ever made,9,12 June 2006,"I can't explain why I enjoy this movie so much. I don't think anyone can. The movie had no money going in, and it shows. I normally associate this kind of budget with films like ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" (the most awfully watchable movie of all time). But that movie is terrible, and this movie is stellar. Part of it is the writing, part of it is the acting, a lot of it is direction. Everything in it is charming. Prime example, when Deb delivers the letter to Pedro, there's a close-up on his hands. The cover, or whatever, of the letter says ""To: Pedro From: Deb"" with lots of hearts all over it. So, Pedro starts to unfold it. He unfolds it three times, before he can red her yes. When he finally opens it completely, it's upside-down. It's guaranteed to make you smile. Frankly, there's more to this movie than all of that, too. Some people say that everyone sees some of themselves in this movie. I didn't believe that at first. Everyone in this town is weird. Even the cool people in school are very weird. But, truly, that's kind of what makes life interesting. All of your friends will have some eccentricities to them. You do, too. Everyone's a little weird. This movie helped show that to me.

434,kevacho,All hail Geeks...,10,13 April 2005,"Now here's a movie! Napoleon Dynamite is absolutely brilliant. Not brilliant in the manner most of us think of as brilliant, but rather, this film has an unsuspecting, quiet brilliance very similar to ""Bottle Rocket"" or ""Rushmore"".Not only brilliant, Napoleon Dynamite unabashedly triumphs the geek in all of us. It is, as a mater of fact, one of the most positive, heart-felt, honest, humble, and witty movies I have seen in a very, very long time. Furthermore, there is level of courageousness to this film that most viewers probably won't, at first, even notice. The character of Napoleon Dynamite is fearless utterly fearless. He defends himself against bullies, he dances in front of a crowd of hundreds, he is gutsy and spirited in the face of overwhelming odds. Dynamite is a hero for the ages or maybe just a hero of the 1980's.If you do not like this movie, there is, quite simply, something wrong with you.",Napoleon Dynamite

You simply do not understand half the jokes people say unless you see the movie. I was shocked to find that the first time I watched it I already knew most of the lines just from hearing them being recited by my friends. So, I watched the movie expecting to be entertained. No. I've heard that if you're under 30 you will love this movie. Well, I'm 18 and hated it. I know that it's not a movie driven on plot or any sort of character depth, and that it's supposed to just be about humor. But ND wasn't in ANY WAY funny. The only point of my watching it is to now understand posters around campus and things people say. Other than that, it was a waste of time. Seriously... it's just awful.

I was pretty psyched to see it during class one day in school... boy did that revert my optimism to a large list of problems. Now don't get me wrong this film isn't the worst thing ever, it just tried too hard to be funny that it came off as a try-hard instead of a good comedy. They are literally given a set up that could lead to a hilarious slapstick or comedic timing joke but they ultimately don't take the lead and just zoom in on Napoleon's face because they think that a extreme close up is the funniest thing since sliced bread. Even when it ins't focusing on trying to be funny it is trying to tell a story that seems to be two TV episodes stuck together and extended to 90 minutes. (92 minutes technically.) The first half is about one thing, then the second half forgets everything that happened in the first half, doesn't help that some deus ex machina's are thrown around just to cover up plot points that the writers seem to want to remove from the film without coming up with a creative conclusion. It seems that they had an idea for a film, but then got distracted creating the finale (which I won't spoil, but it seems to have the most effort put into it, although you've probably had it shoved down your throat like I have.) I did have a chuckle at a few moments, but the awful dialogue that just seems to be awkward because that is what the writers think is funny really hurt my enjoyment of it. I wanted to love this film, the opening shot was fantastic and creative when using the foods to write the credits! Everything is just a mushy mixture of trying too hard and not trying enough to keep me invested into it for 92 minutes of my life. I would not recommend.",Napoleon Dynamite

This Mormon story of a lost boy and his coming- of-age is priceless. It puts SNL and Wes Anderson to shame. With a cast of essential nobodies, the story plods along, making you squirm and fidget and smile and finally laugh. Much like mid-career SNL, the jokes are funnier when you think back and hilarious when you watch it (over and over again). It borrows from many other films (which good films don't steal the good jokes) but it maintains an originality that hasn't been seen in any film in a long time. The studios have a lot to learn: You can't just but a pretty boy and girl and except laughs.",Napoleon Dynamite

Every time I mention that I never saw the movie, people gasp and tell me I'm a weirdo. So finally, my family rented it because I begged them to see this movie that was ""the #1 movie and in America!"" and the movie that was named ""funniest movie of the year"" and all I wanted was to join in a conversation when ever my classmates talked and laughed about it.After my friends, my family and I watched it we were all silent, not because we were blown away or stunned into silence, no, the question that was on everyone's mind was..."" wh-what?"" What just happened there? What was the purpose of this movie? because I'll tell ya right now, it was NOT to entertain!!! In fact I have no idea what it was for, perhaps a promotion for wigs, or an advertisement for Thrift Store, or an inspiration to film makers that even if your movie is um...pointless and has a bad story line it could still make the big screen, have novelty merchandise made, and have the lead actor become a star.To make a long story short my reaction is: ""HUH??""",Napoleon Dynamite

Most of what I read indicated the reviewers didn't think much of the movie. I found it innovative from the opening credits through the after-the-final-credits epilogue. It's an enjoyable look at a dorky teen trying to make his way through his life, as improbable as his life was being played out. He was so uncool it was endearing. His little girlfriend played her part with a very realistic wide-eyed innocence. There were lots of stereotypes, but they were lightly handled and funny as a result. I was chuckling or laughing out loud throughout most of the movie, and the audience around me also seemed to be having a good time. If you think you'd enjoy an unpolished, non-special effects movie drolloped with sarcastic humor, give it a try.",Napoleon Dynamite

Every time I catch it on cable, I can't change the channel, even though I have the DVD. This movie captivates me. Scene after scene it takes you away to dwell in this quirky world they live in. The story is clever and funny, the characters are fleshed out beautifully, while still retaining their quirky charm; at the same time while each character is fascinating on it's own, the interactions between these characters present their own fascination and wonderfulness. I can't say enough positive things about this movie. It is truly a wonderful adventure in this small town. I love these people and wish they actually existed. And while at times they can be edgy they retain a sweetness and charm that is truly endearing. This has become one of my favorite films of all time.",Napoleon Dynamite

Napoleon never seems to grow or change, but more finds his niche in the world that is changing around him. Unfortunately, the movie takes too much time on most shots and violates standard movie conventions in what appears to be an attempt to pad the movie out to something resembling a feature film. Not that any scenes are unnecessary, just that a scene that could have taken 30 seconds takes 45 seconds with that excess time simply being wasted leaving the character on-screen. The credits are quite unique however and show the filmmaker's creativity (and lack of budget).",Napoleon Dynamite

Throughout the movie, I kept saying to myself, ""This is 2 hours I'll never get back!"" Fortunately, it's not quite that long (I also missed the first 5 minutes, so that's a bonus). With the exceptions of Kip's transformation and Napoleon's presidential 'skit', both of which occurred near the very end of the movie, none of the characters in this film did or said anything substantially different from one scene to the next for the entire length of the movie, nor did they encounter any situations that were the least bit interesting. They didn't even go as far as changing facial expressions. This might have made an interesting 5 minute SNL skit, but a full length feature movie it is not! Maybe you have to be 14 to appreciate it.If you want to watch a compelling movie with interesting high school nerds, check out Bill Forsyth's ""Gregory's Girl"", Mark Waters's and Tina Fey's ""Mean Girls"", Tony Bill's ""My Bodyguard"", or Richard Linklater's ""Dazed and Confused"".

The characters were not as diverse as some would put it but still, they cater for a vast majority of the population.

The film is Napoleon Dynamite, an indie film by brothers Jared and Jerusha Hess, both Mormons, that is constantly hilarious without resorting to ""dick and fart jokes."" The film is also one for the kids as the closest to swearing is when a character, usually Napoleon, says ""Gosh!"" or ""Dang!"" Not only is the film hilarious but it tackles many important issues that lie just beneath the film's surface. The issue of economic wealth, racial harmony/disharmony, social and class harmony/disharmony, and rural American life.My friends and I laughed throughout the entire film at the community theatre in a nonstop laughfest. Tonight was a repeat, albeit solo, laughfest.

If you have been to Idaho you would understand that this movie is set in the present, and that there are no contradictions whatsoever.  Also, lack of a plot?  Come on...  This is a coming of age story, not unlike many before it.  It may lack the obvious conflicts and relationships that one would find in a typical Hollywood blockbuster (thats fine by me), but in the end its about nerds finding their own niche and being comfortable in their own skin.  By the end of the film, each main character has overcome some adversity through the use of his or her own ""skills"", and I was rooting each of them all the way.

453,craysellers,Truly funny: a unique comic form,10,13 July 2012,"This is a whole different animal in the genre of film called 'Comedy'. It doesn't set up conventional comedy dilemmas that allow you to judge its merit on how well it handles the pay-off. I mean it as a compliment that it's more Pee Wee Herman than Mel Brooks, because it assumes we've all known a Napoleon Dynamite and know that really funny people are 'out there': unashamed of their inherent nature, and not about to show any deference to anybody.While I'm not a big Pee Wee Herman fan (the infantilism makes me a little uncomfortable), Jon Heder's Napoleon doesn't enjoy being silly. His geeky affectations are delivered with the belief that nobody is cooler or smarter than he - other people are just, all-too-often, luckier (""Lucky!"" is his common anguish when he acknowledges that he wants what you got). In fact, the whole plot - if you can call it that - is a tally of unexpected lucky triumphs and frustrating failures where Napoleon fearlessly follows his odd instincts with abandon. He will not deny himself the experiences his curiosity brings because he might lose or look stupid. Bullies can do physical harm to him, but they'll never shame him. Dropped by a punch to the gut from one who despises his absurd bragging, he snarls ""Idiot!"" - a little too loud, too nasty, for us to feel sorry for him if it earns him a second punch. But there's something admirable about his refusal play the victim. He lacks pathos: that traditional, endearing characteristic of all the other comic losers who don't deserve their misfortune. So why is he so funny? Why do we like him? Because he's so insanely strange, but he's not over the top - we really know people with that stubborn, self-righteous commitment to not letting anyone else decide how they feel - and an ability to dismiss his tormentors as annoying without giving them the power to challenge his resolve. This kind of comedy ignores all the formulas that define what 'funny' is. Like the best jokes are the ones that make you groan, this is comedy where you watch him play out a strange but vaguely familiar character - ridiculous, but completely believable - shake your head and think, ""Idiot!""",Napoleon Dynamite
454,wordclock,Who needs a hero?,7,19 March 2005,"I have no idea why I liked this film, but I really liked it. Absolutely nobody in the film is shown in a positive light. Everyone is a loser, a geek, a nerd, weak, pathetic, brainless, shallow, charmless or just plain out there. But starting from such a low level of expectation, these hopeless characters are able to shine. That's the bizarre thing about it - in a world where every person is pathetic, it only takes a tiny thing to redeem each character.Napoleon's mind is buzzing with superheroes, ninja warriors, knights, mythical beasts, and yet his boring life couldn't be further from his ideals. As he confesses, ""I have no skills"" and he's right. He and his friends don't even know how to talk to each other - they look at each other sideways, body language screaming ""run away!"" and sentences short, clipped and painful. This is what it's like to be the loser, the bottom of the food chain.Yet this is a film about triumph against adversity, the victorious underdog - a great Hollywood tradition, but turned on its head. No great hero emerges, there's no rallying cry of ""we can do this if only we work as a team"", there's no ""love conquers all"" just inept people bungling their way through. So is it worth watching? Well yes.If you have a taste for the absurd, the surreal, for subtle and quite dark humour, you'll like it. There are a few laugh out loud moments, like the time machine Kip buys on the internet, Napoleon taking Pedro's bike off a ""sweet jump"", Kip testing the plastic bowl, Kip at the self- defence class. But the charm of this film is its slow pace, oddball characters and disjointed dialogues. The actors are amazing, totally convincing in their deadpan deliveries.

I could feel my brain cells dying from ""moron radiation"" being emitted from the movie. The story goes from one plot point to another with extreme awkwardness, it is painful to watch.

Another thing that bugs me is I can't place the movie's setting in time, it could be anywhere from the 70s to the 90s.

Don't you get it? ARG! It's just such a simple and entertaining and I was so surprised by some of the comments. Don't listen to them.

I'll give the filmmaker points for originality and avoiding a lot of movie clichés, but otherwise this is a pretty poor effort. 5/10. Oops I need to write a few more lines here it seems so let's see... There were a few ""hehe"" giggle moments in the film but mostly the jokes fall flat.

Two brothers who are total nerds, an uncle who lost touch of reality and lives in 1982, and a Mexican zombie. I like the fact that they didn't pick actors just for their looks, none of the lead actors would ever win a beauty contest.

I liked the funny and relatively subtle (compared to other films) depiction of the struggle of good vs bad e.g. Napoleon's tots being crushed, attending the Rex-kwon-do seminar, Kip training to be a cage fighter. You can see them trying, in their own way quirky ways, to establish a place in the world. -- And the good guy wins in the end--just like a movie is supposed to end! The unexpected popularity of this film doesn't surprise me. Does it surprise anyone else? I expect that most anyone who has been to high school could relate to Napoleon. The director must have a great memory and have been paying close attention to the high school experience.

A lot of people don't agree with me because of how stupid they think the movie is, but I think that's what makes the movie absolutely hilarious. Sure, it really didn't have a story or plot line, but for many of us, this is the funniest freaking movie ever. This movie is filled with great jokes to keep you laughing. If you're someone loves comedies, and don't really care about plots, then this movie is the one for you. Most of the actor this movie are hilarious, especially Jon Heder as Napolean. This is one movie you don't want to miss. Vote for Pedro!!!",Napoleon Dynamite

There is a joke for everything, and Napolean's nerdiness makes everything even funnier.-GOSH- The movie has a strong storyline with multiple plots happening at the same time. There is relief from laughing at sad parts. Yet these parts are replenished by another joke.The story is about a high schooler going through the trials of the magical dungeon of high school. Napolean's overactive imagination and strange family makes him the perfect person to talk about in the movie. Not to mention the plot lines that revolve around Pedro Sanchez and Deb.The movie is extremely funny and perfect for the whole family.",Napoleon Dynamite
470,Pooledogg,This film is a basic storyline of geek to hero but is so funny all the way through,10,8 November 2005,This is the greatest film ever for people who are weird and like weird random comedy. If you like this you will like envy and a series called peep show. The acting is so dead pan in places that the comedy just ooooooozes. The unsung hero is the martial arts instructor played by diedrich bader who also has a cameo in Jay and silent bob strike back. It is quite easy to see why a lot of people will not like this film as they will not get the comedy. It is very much a marmite film so love it or hate hate it you will know with in the first 30 seconds of the film because that sets the standard for the next 90 minutes. I only heard about this film through my friend michelle derosier and finally got round to buying it as she is a weirdo like me and it is very much power to the geek.,Napoleon Dynamite

It's such a breath of fresh air to see an American film with dry humour and quirky, interesting characters. ND has style and dares to be different. I loved the bizarre retro clothes/hairstyles that spoke of cheesy, small-town America. It gave the piece an 'other-worldly' feel, as I know it was set in the present day.The movie is a surreal joy, from llamas and moon-boots to tater tots and time machines. I have great difficulty in choosing a favourite character as they're all so fabulous. I love Uncle Rico's tops... where on earth did they find them? And Kip, what a babe! I suppose I have to go for Napoleon as the fave: he has 'skills', he draws like a dream and, boy, what a funky mover. Dang, he is sweet! See this film and love it.",Napoleon Dynamite

The movie's plot is about a young high school student and follows his trials as he tries to arrange for a dance. We also watch his family deal with jobs and dating.If you live an average, weird life - like the majority of the world - then you are much more likely to identify with this movie than preps, jocks, or the rich cliques in life...Life for Napoleon and friends is not weird, as in some science fiction comedy, but more like real life - girl friends and pity dates, guys which have weird discussions and fantasies about what they do in their lives, and etc.If you like off beat, comedy about nothing, etc. then you may have what it takes to enjoy this movie.",Napoleon Dynamite

If you want to see an MTV Generation film about high school students in Middle America and their wacky antics, see 'Election' with Matthew Broderick. Same concept only with a script that actually moves the story along. Napoleon Dynamite is just a collection of site-gags and inflated stereotypes pushed into one totally implausible situation after another. Nothing HAS to be believable, but this just seems as if it were written on the fly and submitted as a first draft. Yeah, it's pretty mindless fun. Yeah, that's the point.

It has funny lines, compassionate moments, unexpected characters, chickens and a teenage boy with a perm. It's also amazingly original.

476,Alex_DeLarge_Is_Here,Cult Classic?,1,27 May 2008,"Jared Hess' ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is the kind of movie that became a cult hit when it has no right to be. It's a movie so dry and humorless that people call it ""absurdest."" I hate it, so I must not ""get it"". I get it alright: It's a bad film made by a bad filmmaker.Jared Hess, to my knowledge, has made only two films. Napoleon Dynamite and Nacho Libre. Usually when the debut film of a director is sub par, it's his follow up that determines his worth to film. When his first film is an unfunny bomb and his second one is even worse, then we know we have a problem.I saw Napoleon Dynamite months after it came out. This was around the time that every kid in school knew the movie by heart, called it ""the greatest movie ever"", and injected Napoleon's mannerisms and sayings into every conversation.Napoleon himself, exist as a rare breed of nerd. He's in the film as a punching bag. He's also drawn so paper thin, an actual punching bag would be more amusing. He's the kind of sad clown who is loosely inspired by real personality types and then portrayed as something almost human, but more robotic. This is a nerd comedy. But it's one where we don't even like the nerd. Napoleon doesn't like anyone and nobody likes Napoleon. He's an alienated character. The charm of the underdog is that they offer a sort of insight and charisma that's hidden from others. They may have the worst sense in fashion, lanky features, and awkward mannerisms, but underneath they're human and they offer more then the students who make fun of them. They're often victims of an unfortunate social structure that is tilted against them.Napoleon Dynamite is the kind of nerd that alienates himself. People reach out and he pushes them away. I've known nerds like him. They're jerks. Yes, nerds can be jerks and 90 percent of the people in Napoleon Dynamite are jerks. His family is jerks and pushovers. Most of the school is filled with jerks. The only people I can think of who didn't come off as wholly unlikeable were the love interest in the story. Granted his brothers online girlfriend was something of a huge stereotype and Napoleon's was so underdeveloped that it felt kind of like a cop out. However, the last scene of the movie was one of the only one's that range true. With Napoleon and the girl playing tether ball. That and when they danced. In those scenes we saw something this movie lacked, humanity. Unfortunately, those scenes came after we established that this reality is filled with jerks who are jerks to jerks because those jerks can't help to be jerks.The film is pointless. A testament to an apathetic generation looking for something to call unique. It's a pretty standard story that's so devoid of humor that people look to call it something more.It's stupid humor, but it's unfunny stupid humor. It's the kind of humor that justifys standing on a couch and looking into space as being ""hip and unique"" when really it's just killing time. And that's exactly what this film does. It kills time. But then it doesn't only kill time, it waste it.I fear we'll see another Jared Hess film. I fear it will be another futile exercise in sub human characters and ill formed plots. I also fear that people will call his next disasterpeice brilliant and we really can't afford that.",Napoleon Dynamite
477,CrowServoNelson,Extremely overrated,1,7 February 2005,"This movie is highly overrated by everyone who claims it is such a funny movie. That fact is...it really is not all that funny. Sure, the movie has its moments, but I guarantee you that all the quotes you keep hearing from people are said in a very unfunny way in the movie itself. The characters are very drone and while yes, they are meant to be that way, that along with the lack of a solid plot line makes the movie just tiresome and boring.Basically, you have to be part of a very small group of people to like this movie. If you go into it hating it...you will leave hating it, and the same applies if you go into it expecting to see the funniest movie ever because you will be highly disappointed.",Napoleon Dynamite
478,natalyasn,The Funny and Awkward Life of Napoleon,8,7 October 2021,"Review for ART 1145 American Cinema - Napoleon DynamiteNapoleon Dynamite directed and written by Jared and Jerusha Hess and produced by Jeremy Coon, Chris Wyatt, and Sean Covel is a 2004 comedy film starring Jon Heder as Napoleon Dynamite.Napoleon Dynamite is a ""geeky"" and unpopular 16-year-old from the city of Preston, Idaho. Throughout the film, we watch this ""too cool for school"" teenager go through multiple problems, such as butting heads with his online chat using 32-year-old brother Kip (Aaron Ruell), helping his immigrant friend Pedro (Efren Ramirez) run for class president, dealing with Deb (Tina Majorino) a shy multi-business owner who's trying to save up enough money for college and his Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) a former athlete who can't let go of his glory days.For a low-budget movie, this was a very well-put-together comedy. Although there are many things that make the production of this movie great, the main thing that caught my eye was the filming style. The filming style is rough and rural which gives a very natural and personal feeling while watching, which at times makes it a little awkward to watch since everything that happens in the movie feels very real. Another thing that production did very well in terms of aesthetics is the color palette. Whether it's because it is a low-budget film or they did it purposefully, despite the movie having a diverse color palette, the movie is poorly lit, giving it a very muted look, which matches the tone of this movie very well. Do the Right Thing, by Spike Lee also is very good at setting the tone with this, as we see throughout that movie extremely vibrant colors on the block.To be quite honest, this movie wasn't really the greatest film I've watched, however, it is a socially relevant and funny film, which is probably why it has such a huge cult following. Although on the surface, it seems like an absurd comedy film, it can also be a coming-of-age tale (albeit an extremely absurd one).",Napoleon Dynamite
479,crunch-o-matic,Oh the poor saps that don't get it,9,2 September 2004,"The fact that people just don't get the humor or are offended by the portrayal of a geek in this film are the ones that solidify the theme, the entire purpose of the film.It's marvelous to watch them scratch their heads and say ""I don't get it"" while you roll on the floor with open mouthed laughter. I actually fell out of my seat twice during this movie and almost choked to death on popcorn.You are either the person who thinks this film is absurdly funny OR the person being mocked by this film. If you are indignant about having to choose you are the one being mocked.",Napoleon Dynamite
480,joanna_bg,Somewhat funny,2,1 August 2005,"Typical American comedy... This movie does not bring any new comic situations or humor to the cinema. All jokes are pretty much taken from previously made movies, hence making this movie very dull and predictable. There where a couple of moment in the movie that brought a smile on my face..so I guess it was somewhat funny. If you enjoyed American comedies like American Pie, and the like, you will love this one, if not you will find it to be a waste of time and money.Rating 2/10 skip it!",Napoleon Dynamite
481,JackSparrowBauer,Pretty much the worst movie ever made,1,25 June 2007,"All of my friends talk about how ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is the best movie they've ever seen. ""It's so funny,"" they say. ""No it's not, it's stupid."" I tell them and they respond by saying ""I know that's what make it so funny."" There is no point to the movie at all! One person told me that if you watch the movies where the chapters on the DVD show in random order, it doesn't make a difference. If you ask what the movie is about, no one can say, because it isn't about anything. No plot, no humor, really random. It's just not funny. Don't waste your time. I hated the movie, the whole time I watched it, I was thinking to myself ""Why am I watching this?"" It was the most stupid movie I ever saw! ONE PART of the whole movie made me laugh. That was when the guy shot the cow, when the school bus was driving by. That was pretty funny.My one friend thought that the funniest part in the whole movie was when Deb went to Napoleon's door trying to sell stuff and Kip said ""Your mom goes to college?"" I have no idea why everyone loves the movie. I said it before and I'll say it again, the movie is a big fat waste of time and don't bother watching it.",Napoleon Dynamite
482,grendelsmom,An Accurate Portrait of High School Life,10,13 January 2006,"Napoleon Dynamite is the most impressive debut feature of any director since Reservoir Dogs. I can't think of another film that has so realistically captured the experience of high school. The film is at it's funniest when it's at its most real - I laughed hardest when Napoleon utters lines like ""Do the chickens have large talons?"" or ""I already made, like, infinity of those at scout camp"". It's less effective when it resorts to conventional comedy such as turning Kip into a gangsta rapper wannabe. And ironically, the brown suit that Napoleon wears to the dance is actually the coolest thing that anybody wears in the film.One of the most refreshing things about this movie is that while it is highly subversive, there is no profanity, explicit violence or sex. In this sense it is much more radical than films which feel obliged to be ""gritty"". A genuinely sweet film like this is pretty rare these days.I will slap the next person who says that Napoleon Dynamite is ripping off Wes Anderson. The quirkiness in Anderson's films seems contrived and laboured whereas in Hess's film, it is effortless and flows naturally. If anything, Napoleon Dynamite has more in common with the films of John Waters which celebrate the blandness of suburbia.And I reject Roger Ebert's assertion that we can only laugh at comedies like this because we either feel superior to the characters or we pity or like them. This is a movie for those of us who never got to hang out with the popular kids, who were never good at talking to girls, who retreated into fantasy because reality was either too bland or too painful and those of us who pretended we didn't care what people thought of us because they thought so little of us. So when I laugh at Napoleon, I am also laughing at myself.Of course a film like this couldn't succeed without the outstanding performances of all the main actors. If the Oscars were awarded on the basis of merit, then Jon Heder would win the Best Actor award. But they're not, so he won't.Though not perfect, I am giving the film 10 stars because it is so unique... and also to lift the overall user rating - After all, if crap like Donnie Darko can get a rating of more than 8 while Napoleon is only around 7, there is something seriously wrong with the world.",Napoleon Dynamite
483,jpanettiere,Revenge of the Nerds meets Welcome to the Dollhouse,2,3 February 2005,"This movie could have been good, but instead it regurgitates a tired cliché of the losers who win out over the ""cool people"", with lots of played out stereotypes like the rich-white-jock-bully and the cruel-shallow-cheerleader-hussy and behold! The losers get along with colored people while the ""cool people"" look down on them and behold! The losers use their eccentricity to defeat the ""cool"" people who rely on money and popularity. This movie was fresh and original TWENTY SEVEN YEARS AGO when it was called Animal House, the only new twist is that it has more of the contemptuous sneer for the mythical ""Middle American"" that is often found in Todd Solondz' garbage. To MTV's credit, they managed to refrain from exploiting young people having sex with each other, it must have taken considerable restraint.

That's true, but the issue runs far deeper - From the opening frame of this movie to as far as I got into it, every mannerism and every single shot of the film is SO forced it's painful. If you laugh harder than a laugh track at the new SNL, you might like the movie, otherwise, don't waste your time.Like so many bad sitcoms, it takes a clichéd, stylized concept and frames dozens of setups that beg ""this is supposed to be funny - you should laugh here.""

I am making a big confession here, but perhaps you need to be... a nerd, or formerly a nerd, to get how funny this film is. If you can identify with the characters at all, it's hysterical, if you were perhaps the head cheerleader, you're probably not gonna get it.Also, I hate to admit this as well, but this film has a lot more to do with growing up in the US and typical high school kids than many ""teen"" movies which have been produced in the past ten years.To sum it up, it's a sweet film something along the lines of ""American Graffiti, showing ""typical teens"" in a small town, with much more character study going on than a strong plot.... except the kids in ""Graffiti"" were not such...

I was unaware that there was this ""Napolean groupie club"" of people who are fanatics about the movie, quoting lines and such. I went into the film completely expecting to love it since I like quirky films in general. From the beginning, though, I was bored. There were maybe two places I laughed out loud at the deadpan or slapstick humor, but overall it was a disappointment. I kept waiting for something to happen, waiting to like at least one of the characters, but no. The film is quirky, yes. But it is also disjointed and cliché.

And it's not even because it's one of those stupid, ""supposed to be dumb"" movies, because I LOVE those movies. ""Airplane"", ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"", ""Spaceballs"", ""History of the World"" evenall very good movies. They were wickedly goofy, things you just have to laugh at cos they're just so silly, but ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is just so BORING. It lacks the normal charm a goofball/screwball comedy should have. For one thing, I was NOT constantly laughing, the way I should've been when watching a TRUE clever goofball comedy. I laughed like three times at most when I watched it. And I mean, actually laughed.One of the times was when Uncle Rico went over a piece of Tupperware when he was driving his van in reverse. I can't even remember the other two times I laughed. Reason being, it was just NOT a funny movie. It was, in fact, lame. Maybe that's the tone the script was going for, but there is a difference between ""this movie is so lame, yet so silly that it tickles my inner child; I'm so happy I'm watching it"" and, ""this movie is so lame you're practically forcing me to laugh."" I'm glad I didn't see it in the theaters. Napoleon Dynamite is not worth my time or money. I would like that hour and twenty minutes of my life back. ""GOSH!""",Napoleon Dynamite

""deep-seeded""... I was waiting for them to tell us the film was ""a hardless exercise that lacked sole"" too...anyway...This may be the first 'genetic' movie - in the same way that some people are lactose intolerant, some folks are apparently Napoleon intolerant. For what it's worth, I loved Rushmore, Bottle Rocket, the Royal Tanenbaums, etc... and this movie is I think, the epitome of the form. It seems that whatever this movie does have (and it has it in spades) can't be explained to some people. Either you appreciate it or you don't. Its oil to some, water to others. By now it should be plain to anyone reading these reviews that if you like your humour with *any* 'BA-DA-BING!!', this is REALLY not a movie you'll like.And oh yes, I'm well over 30 years old, so this 'if you're over 30' stuff doesn't wash as far as excuses go ...

490,skingfan03,Two thumbs up for a wonderfully comical movie!!,8,5 March 2005,"Napoleon Dynamite is a refreshing new comedy that doesn't fall short by going for the gross out (i.e. There's Something About Mary, Freddy Got Fingered) or irritatingly lame attempts at hip-hop humor (i.e. So High, A Low Down Dirty Shame, You Got Served). Not that there haven't been some very successful comedies. There have been, indeed: Taxi, Bringing Down the House, and even Scary Movie 3, to name a few. OK, I'm digressing here. Sorry. Napoleon Dynamite is hilarious not because of one-liners and wit (although there is some of both in the movie) but because the characters are so unique and so funny themselves that you like it right from the start. My favorite character is a toss-up between Napoleon Dynamite, who always seems to have a pseudo-sarcastic reply to everyone and his 32-year old brother Kip, who you would SWEAR is homosexual because of his mannerisms and his lisp, but is, actually, anything BUT gay. Then there's Napoleon's somewhat-sleazy Uncle Rico. And Napoleon's good friend Pedro, an exchange student from Mexico whom Napoleon almost instantly befriends. The basic plot? It's pretty much a ""A year in the life of a high school outcast"" kind of storyline, but it's so much fun to watch and the characters are so enjoyable that ""plot"" takes a backseat in importance. I love the way Napoleon addresses people and his grandma's pet Llama, Tina: ""Tina! Come eat your dinner! GOSH!"" or he's going to do ""Whatever I want to do! GOSH!"" with an occasional ""IDIOT!"" thrown in there for good measure. This is not like many other comedies out there, and it's wonderful that it's not slathered with over-the-top big names, but rather with lesser-known actors that make it easier for you to identify with. I think what makes this movie so enjoyable is that it's just so...laid back, so...casual and easy-going, and some of the characters almost border on eccentric behavior, so it all makes it a very enjoyable comedy that is sure to have you laughing. Maybe not rolling-on-the-floor, eyes-streaming kind of laughter, but good hearty laughter nonetheless.",Napoleon Dynamite

The film does not pander to traditional comedic acting, directing, writing and plot outline. Frankly, the story itself is rather simple. The joy of this film is not so much in seeing how the story will resolve, but in watching the reaction of the characters to situations and people that may or may not have any real bearing on the outcome of the movie.The movie is subtle, with characters that are drastically underplayed. thus lending to comedic effect.This movie is nothing short of hilarious--and one of the things I enjoy most about this film is that there is not one cuss word or sexual act in the entire film.Don't even bother renting this film--just go ahead and buy it!",Napoleon Dynamite

Napoleons sardonic sheltered sytle is perfect for the drab setting of a town with little to be happy about. Mismatched characters abound and are brilliantly written in. The dialogue is quick and witty, while sometimes random. Stereotypes are stereotypical but somehow more fleshed out than in other movies. Not to put this purely as a dialogue based comedy, the physical humor was spot on at the drop of a hat. I would have given this a nine but some of the acting was a little...off.

Heck, it doesn't even really have a story, just mainly goes through the life of Napoleon. But that's what makes it so great! It doesn't have any graphics, big scenery or anything. It seems like this was probably a pretty cheap movie to make, but it turned out great! Don't watch it expecting complicated dialogues and a complex story, just watch it for fun, to relax. I bet that certain scenes or quotes will stick with you, and it does actually have good messages in it. MINOR SPOILERS HERE:**One example is that Napoleon takes his chances and when Pedro doesn't have a skit prepared, he goes out and does an awesome dance because he doesn't want to see Pedro let down. Talk about friendship!** I'm sure you will most likely love the movie because it is hilarious without having to use gross or nasty jokes. Plus it is pretty family friendly.

I had not heard any of the hype that apparently surrounded its release or seen any reviews, so expected nothing. The film transports you to nowheresville where not much is happening to the location or characters. I found myself laughing at the most unexpected moments, and the other three people were too - this was a rather pleasant experience in itself. In the days that followed, I found myself thinking about the film often, so I went to see it again. The second viewing was one of the best times I've ever had at the movies. Apart from the often moronic but very quotable dialogue, I was absorbed by the wonderful cinematography (Idaho looks fantastic) the quirky soundtrack and the intense character performances - Pedro's 'skit' scene ranks as a classic moment of physical comedy. I can see this is a like it or hate it film - I was lucky to have none of the preconceptions that have spoilt similar films for me (Punch Drunk Love?) So much for hype and advertising......'Bleach is the defect in this one'.",Napoleon Dynamite

As a matter of fact, regardless of the fact that I thought it was horrible, I sat through the whole thing.It is a terrible movie. I gave it a 4 out of ten because it has occasional funny moments, but that does not make it worth watching.What's wrong with it? First, and possibly most annoying, is that the creators feel a need to show Napoleon eating/drinking most of the time, and he has spit hanging all over the place. It's not funny, it's disgusting.Second, to say the pacing of the film is bad would be wrong, since the film HAS NO pacing.This movie reminded me of a bunch of highschool kids who decided to set up a camcorder and record themselves being jerks. Interspersed in that are a few very weak plot threads. It's rather like ""Wain's World"" only poorly written, and with no sense of comedic timing.I love small-budget movies, and what people can occasionally accomplish with only a little budget and lots of imagination. This movie made me realize that not all small budget films are great. I recommend 'Battle of Shaker Heights' or 'Saved' if you feel a need to rent an indy, far above this one.",Napoleon Dynamite
497,monsterman865,Worst Movie I have ever seen...,1,26 October 2005,"No joking, this is the single worst movie I have ever seen. Now before you start saying ""You didn't understand it"" ""You can't relate"" ""You're a freakin' idiot"" ""You don't get the humor."" Let's get a few things straight, I'm a geek, a nerd, a loser, what ever you want to call it. Hell, if you are on IMDb, you are too, so that throws out the possibility of me not relating. I have heard in many places ""it has very dry humor."" No it doesn't, dry humor is Dr. Strangelove, Rushmore, etc. This is stupid comedy, which I have no problem with in cartoons (Ed, Edd, and Eddy, The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy), but for two hours without a plot (a movie with a plot that is constant stupid humor is Army Of Darkness, and look, there is a plot), it doesn't work. Now call me old fashion, but I like to like my main character, not want to rip his face off. I also like to have a plot, but that's just me. I would give props to the guy who played Napolean though, but after seeing what he really sounds and looks like, I just can't, he was playing himself. So in short, skip this movie, by all means, go rent Ghost World if you want to see a movie about hapless geeks.",Napoleon Dynamite
498,take_a_breathx53,This movie is absolutely hilarious.,9,10 February 2005,"Since you HAVE to make me describe Napoleon Dynamite in one word, I'll just say it's sweet! Gosh!Napoleon Dynamite, a nerdy high school student dwelling the gem state, has proved himself to have nothing to prove by being a top seller in the box office and in DVD. He is the average weirdo, overshadowed by other members of the family (In this case the older brother, Kip, and Tina the Llama 'Eat the FOOD!!!') and have none or very little friends (Pedro and Deb).We love Napoleon because we all have a Napoleon. Some of Napoleon's infamous lines are:1. ""Sweet!"" 2. ""Gosh!"" 3. ""Gimme your tots!"" 4. ""LaFawnduh"" (kip) 5. ""Liger"" 6. ""Tina, eat the food!!!"" 7. ""Did you ever land any sick jumps?"" 8.

499,Chloroform,Napoleon Dynamite: A Plot?,10,22 February 2005,"Wow. I've heard a lot of things about this movie and I actually saw it. For those of you who look for a plot in everything, this isn't the movie for you. The movie was built upon random series of events happening and had nothing to do with anything. It was basically just like an episode of Seinfeld, a funny stupid thing. It was a stupid movie, but for those of you who like plot less funny movies, if you're looking for a very funny one then see this movie.But, when seeing this movie don't expect any plot, because there isn't one. It would suit being a TV Show much more than a movie, actually.I did enjoy it though and it got a few good laughs out of me. It was a LOT better than other comedies I saw like that something and Kumar go to White Castle something movie, that was just completely stupid. A typical teenage movie. This movie is suitable for all ages, not just teenagers!",Napoleon Dynamite
500,Vampirella666,A broken and murdered comedy.,3,28 February 2005,"Hey, it was an okay movie. Serioualy, all these people insult the movie and say it was so dumb, well, there has been worse! The movie's idea was pretty typical: A nerdy kid with no friends, and he likes this girl, and we get the impression she likes him... Typical, everyday kind of idea. But I'd say this movie was literally butchered by the director and actors. Horrible script (""Punch me"" ""WHAT!?"") pathetic. The actor for Napoleon was relatively horrible, the best acting must have been ""I see you're drinking 1%; is it because you think your fat..."" And the dancing was hilarious although it was stretched out a bit too long.I watched a downloaded version of this movie and well, you could hear the audience when they laughed...they laughed a total of two times. I forced myself to watch the entire movie just so I could comment on here.

It is able to be an entertaining movie without having much plot (if any at all). This movie may not be for anyone over the age of 30, but for those of you younger than this, it is truly a great movie. It won't win the Best Picture Oscar, but it will entertain you. The sheer stupidity of some of the jokes are what are so hilarious. We all know the ""your mom"" jokes, and this movie just takes it to the extreme. ""Your mom goes to college."" says Kip. My friend and I were laughing so hard at that part, for the mere fact that our friend always makes your mom jokes like that. The tone of voice, the sleazy uncle, the ""Sledgehammer,"" and the dance scene. All are simply genius.""You think anyone wants to take a roundhouse kick to the face in these bad boys?

But the only thing I had in common with these people, was that I went to high school. I couldn't relate to them. And can someone tell me what decade it was supposed to be in? The opening titles showed a 04 on the id, but everyone looked like 1987. Or are we supposed to believe that Idaho is that slow on the times.I couldn't wait for it to end.

I know a lot of the people here won't agree with me because of the stupid humor that's in the movie, but most of it was actually funny. One downside to the movie was that there was no real plot, it was just about this kid named Napoleon Dymamite, his everyday life, friends and relatives. This movie however does make ever single scene funny with it's amusing quotes and funny facial expressions. This movie made me ""laugh until it hurts""when I first saw it about a month ago and it still was funny when I saw it again yesterday because of all the new things that I discovered about the movie--quotes that I hadn't noticed before, funny posters on the walls (in the Rex Kwon Do room for instance), the acting (incredibly stupid but extremely funny). One last thing, if you get the DVD, it has the best scene in the entire movie on it. I don't know why they cut it out, it was pure genius.8 out of 10",Napoleon Dynamite
505,emmagersten,"Great movie, didn't age well",5,7 February 2020,"Napoleon Dynamite was produced in 2004 by director Jared Hess. The main actors were Napoleon Dynamite (played by Jon Heder), Uncle Rico (Jon Gries), and Pedro (Efren Ramirez). The movie was about a gentleman who live with his grandmother and brother. Specifically, following Napoleon and his friends throughout high school. The two main plotlines of the movie are that Napoleon's older brother is meeting a woman from a chatroom and Napoleon is helping his best friend Pedro run for student body president against Summer Wheatley.
Compared to Do The Right Thing, this movie lacked diversity and was in a drastically different setting socio-economically. While still hilarious, I liked this movie a lot when it came out but watching it again recently found it to have aged. Camera shots used were plenty of long shots, full shots, some mid shots. Camera movement was minimal but included crane, planning, and tracking shots. Eye level angles were mainly used. Editing was just basic scene transitions. Sound was diegetic. Socially this movie had an impact on American Culture. It was such a big hit that people quoted it a lot and bought lots of merchandise. Overall it was a good comedy. I would recommend it for good and wholesome laughs.",Napoleon Dynamite
506,wescrenshawphd,Now for something completely different...Aspergers Syndrome,6,19 April 2006,"I try not to practice my real trade on this board, but I was surprised to see this movie basically portraying a teenager with Aspergers Syndrome. I'm not really sure that this was the writer and director's intent, but that's exactly what you end up with here. For those who don't know, Aspergers is a kind of developmental disorder that creates the (usually a bit less humorous) sorts of symptoms you see in Napoleon. In fact one of the diagnostic questions has to do with whether ""Napolean (lets say) 'gets' others or others 'get' Napolean."" In this movie nobody -- including the audience -- ""gets"" him and he sure doesn't get ANYTHING (love, school politics, clothes, himself, you name it). The movie is kind of interesting this way. Like Monk teases OCD without being mean, this movie does the same for Aspergers. In fact it turns this kid and Pedro into heroes. There's also an element of Bevis and Butthead here, again without the meanness. B & B travel through a complex world and try and make sense of it. We identify with them because they are so dumb that they can't understand that world, much as we feel kind of dumb in confronting the increasing demands of society. But this is where ND runs into trouble. When you contrast him with everyone around him, he is really the sanest one of the bunch (except for the sweet, anxious, and innocent girl who likes him). And this makes for a kind of funny domination of his zaniness with the more malign craziness of his world. Unfortunately, because everyone is so strange in the film (even the nice girl) ND doesn't really have much reality to confront so the juxtapositioning of weird kid and great big world never comes off. He really just doesn't stand out. The other problem is that the film meanders a great deal. This is not terribly annoying, but in some ways it seems like they didn't have enough footage that was on message and had to throw in a little that was not. There are however, some incredibly funny scenes. The best is when Napoleon offers ""Pedros protection"" to a boy being harassed by other kids. And you can't help but be touched when ND does his dance (which is really pretty good) at the end and saves Pedro. Like most aspergers kids, you pull for them even when they are terribly annoying, because you want them to succeed so badly. And ND does pull off that sense of empathy in the end.",Napoleon Dynamite
507,thepigsoftheroundtable,Funniest Movie Ever,10,5 October 2015,"Although Napoleon Dynamite was a sleeper hit it has gained much popularity in mainstream media in recent years. I think it's the funniest movie ever made, right up there with Airplane and Cadyshack. The movie is about a socially awkward kid that every school has. He doesn't have many friends, he's a target for the school bully, and his family is REALLY weird. But when he meets the new kid Pedro everything changes. With no plot the movie is a little hard to follow but it doesn't matter, you will be laughing to hard to notice. Everything in the movie is engineered to be funny, Take the scene where Napoleons older brother is talking on the phone while making nachos for example. Every time they cut back to him the amount of cheese gets bigger and bigger, until there is an absurd amount covering the plate. It's little details that the Director put into this movie that really adds to the experience. Napoleon Dynamite is a hidden gem of the comedy genre, and although not for everyone this movie never fails to make me laugh.",Napoleon Dynamite

I thought it was funny, but rather weird and I really didn't feel it. The second time around, all the twisted characters crawled under my skin. I love every single one of them. I have never seen a movie with so many well casted actors spitting out an obscene amount of hilarious and memorable lines. Jon Heder is amazing, his performance is outrageously awesome, everything he does, he does it right and with such perfection, that it's almost scary. He was born to play this part. The best thing is that he doesn't ""steal"" the show - everyone else in this move is absolutely brilliant. They all work perfectly together in this mad and totally original comedy. I have never seen anything like this... Napoleon Dynamite leaves you with a feeling of success. You can do anything no matter who or what you are.

The plot consists of... .... .... ...umm, well I should digress at this point. There are a few, and only a few spots in the movie that are funny. And I do give credit for avoiding mainstream. However, this movie went towards the negative side of it. I know some people enjoy movies that are sort of about ""nothing,"" but honestly, I tried to do some work after I watched it, and it took my mind a half hour to recover from the inactivity. There are no ""hooks"" or anything to keep your interest...it just drags on while you wait for it to become interesting...in vain... It is exactly what gives MTV a stereotype, embodying diversionary tactics and a general absurdity which attempts to cover up the lack of imagination and plot, as well as slowing down the pace and interest of the movie, giving it a kind of ""drugged"" effect. There are a few aspects of enjoyment in it, but are far outweighed by the vapid and mindless core. I don't expect all movies to have a deep intellectual side and character development, but it sure doesn't hurt, and the cases where it is not needed are those which are actually fun to watch...and this movie and Mr. Rogers are neck and neck.",Napoleon Dynamite

When this movie first can't out, it seemed that college kids and high schoolers alike were really into this film. Perhaps it was due to the goofy characters and the thin plot line. The setting has the feel of the 80's or 90's. The wardrobe is pretty bland, but realistic for the characters.
The one thing that I would have to say about this movie may have been an overlooked theme. 
This movie is about friendship. Napoleon is a geeky kid who seems to have no friends and is bullied. As the story progresses, he finds friendship and even a girlfriend. I think with this theme in mind that, it makes this film a bit more sweet.",Napoleon Dynamite

It's a good example of how the youth of America thinks though. If you're in to mindless comedy and plots that are nearly non-existent, this movie is for you. I for one like my characters to open their eyes a little and have some conflict. The old mildly funny parts in this movie were physical gags followed by a lethargic Napoleon quote. While this movie might entertain teenagers who leech off their parents and thus are bored to tears, anyone else will be offended by the stupidity radiating off of this carcass. I sincerely can't see ANYONE thinking this movie is funny besides people who struggle so hard for originlity that they settle for random bologna.

It was great to see a film without a 100 million dollar budget, and no CGI special effects. This was just a really funny really sweet story. Yes sometimes it was a bit of dark comedy (ala the cow and the school bus), but it really gave me my moneys worth and I left the theater feeling like a million bucks. To those who say its a Wes Anderson rip off and recycled 80's nostalgia I say HA! you just don't get it. It was the little touches that made this movie special, like when they get to the Dance and Alphaville's Forever Young is playing.

One of the (many) odd things about the movie is that it isn't set in ANY clearly identifiable time period. True, there is a lot of music from the eighties, but I picked out a Backstreet Boys song in there as well. ND and family dress straight out of the 70's (like the decor from their home), but the brother spends all day on the internet. Many of the other kids dress 80's (especially at the dance), but others look more contemporary. Bizarre and disorienting, and places the movie clearly out of reality and in a world where a guy like Napoleon could really exist...

This movie, due to its success and time period I believe is culturally and historically significant in pin-pointing an even more rapid decline in art than we have witnessed in the earlier last half of the twentieth century.Previously overtly stupid films had to have at least the semblance of a plot (see 'Airplane', for instance.) From this point on films became plot-less character sketches, which by itself might not always be terrible if the characters weren't all one-dimensional (I'm thinking the likes of Will Farrell, whom I've never witnessed do or say the least thing humorous.)In short, a pointless, unfunny, ugly movie and further evidence that the west is doomed.",Napoleon Dynamite

I like Jon Heder, but this movie was hard to sit through. I got bored really fast and by the end I wondered why everyone thought this was great.The Rex Kwon Do part I loved, because that guy (I believe he was on Drew Carey Show) is funny.The Part where the kids see the guy shoot the cow was funny.And other parts had chuckles but not extreme laughter.This was definitely a overrated movie, I'd say rent it and see for yourself, maybe it will grow on you.

I remember seeing this film five years ago after friends recommended it. During the entire movie, I chuckled maybe twice. In fact, I actually missed the nearly-whispered ""your mom goes to college"" bit my first viewing. Even after renting Dynamite on VHS a year later, I still found it tiresome and boring. Sure, there are hit-and-miss slapstick laughs here and there, but more often they are of the ""miss"" variety, and even the hits are too few and far between. Even the actors seemed to empathize with me; the acting is sluggish, the delivery of lines is laboured, and the whole movie has this bored tone to it. It's as if the cast all have on invisible buttons that say ""I REALLY WISH I WEREN'T HERE RIGHT NOW."" Nevertheless, I must give Napoleon Dynamite kudos for its non-cliché portrayal of high school life (which some claim was its intent) and for not dissolving into a character study of nerds, jocks, etc. that we've seen at least fifty times in increasingly dull strokes.",Napoleon Dynamite

The movie didn't make sense, it didn't really have a story line and the main characters were so dumb and annoying. Were they supposed to be acting stupid or were the actors just like that because they accepted the role? I'm sorry if I sound mean, but I didn't like that film at all. The only entertaining part of the whole movie was a dance at the end, which only lasted about 1 minute. I didn't find it at all funny or entertaining, I don't know what everyone in my class was on when they watched this film, but I will never trust their judgment in films again.

I have been really looking forward to this film ever since I saw the preview and it did not disappoint. The bizarre collection of characters in the film is reminiscent of Wes Anderson and the humor is simple and innocent. I brought 7 people with me to see the film because I had a strong feeling it was going to be a lot of fun. Everyone had a great time and we could not stop laughing. It is easy to see why this film was such a hit at film festivals and it is one of the few films I've been to in the last couple of years that received a resounding round of applause at the end. I strongly recommend this film.,Napoleon Dynamite

However, after seeing Jon Heder in ""Just Like Heaven"" (yes someone did watch that film) I decided to give ND another shot. The second viewing gave me a whole new perspective and appreciation of the movie.While watching this film the first time I made an assumption that I was not going to like it, even remotely. I was certain that it was going to be just another formulaic ""kids"" movie about the goofy, unpopular kid/crowd, that suddenly becomes an A-lister and the epitome of cool! I was also assuming it would be filled with childish jokes, sophomoric humor and would consist mainly of burp/fart/puke scenes. I don't think I have ever misjudged a movie so completely! Instead I found the opposite to be true; Napoleon Dynamite was filled with smart, witty, realistic and touching dialog and situations. (Object lesson: ""Never judge a book by it's cover""!) The movie was cast brilliantly and the choice of music was a match made in movie land heaven! I cannot envision any other actor/actress portraying the characters than those chosen and the music could not have fit the film more perfectly!

To be honest - when I saw bits and pieces on Cable TV - I thought - what a dud! But - I did find the time to watch the whole thing in one setting - and realized the brilliance of the writing and performance.Who didn't know someone like Napoleon in high school? Most likely you felt sorry for them...thinking they didn't have a prayer in the world. What this movie did was create a character that had all the flaws - but we all share some of them. A bit over the top in places or maybe 'sureal' in some scenes - but it really does capture the awkwardness of youth in a lot of social situations. A lot of high school movies have the 16 and 17 year-olds acting like twenty somethings - but in reality - weren't we all a bit scared at the school dance? Not knowing what to say? Not knowing where to hold your dance partner during that slow dance? But thinking it was supposed to be this grand, special event? Just to leave disappointed?

Now that I've actually seen it,the sentiment holds true....among other things. Its...different,that much is for sure. I think,the only disturbing point in the movie came when the farmer who lives across the road from Napoleons family,chose the moment that the schoolbus drove up,with all the kids watching no doubt,to shoot the cow or steer that he was going to give to Napoleons aunt [?] or sell for meat. Other than that slightly offkilter scene,which wasn't shown to the audience,at least on the DVD,there isn't a thing that could be hated about the movie. I kinda wonder....does anyone else who might've watched the expanded version in theaters think there might be a sequel?

This film is amusing solely because of the characters as there is a complete lack of a coherent story and the majority of the humor is low-level, and either repetitive or visual - not surprising for an MTV film. It's only funny to see Napoleon (or his brother or Uncle) in their goofy outfits so many times, and the emphatic ""Gosh!"" or other non-expletives Napoleon lets out get old and annoying after a while.I found myself wondering if there was even going to BE an ending after a while because the story didn't ever seem to progress. Basically, Napoleon bumbles through part of a year of school with his Uncle in town and relatively normal stuff happens. The dysfunctional family relationships drive the humor and what plot there exists.Finally, props to MTV and Mr. Hess on creating a film that didn't need F-bombs and blood to entertain the masses.",Napoleon Dynamite
530,jakegest,Who knew?,8,18 January 2005,"I dreaded this movie like the plague. When it first came out I refused to see it in theaters and managed to convince groups of friends to rent something else so I could avoid watching it. I suppose I categorized this film with the Wes Anderson movie Rushmore which I hated. I was finally convinced to watch this with a friend who couldn't stop raving about it. I really have to admit this was possibly the biggest turn around I have experienced in my lifetime. I found this film to be brilliant. The acting was wonderful, the storyline and screen writing was not only well done but truthful. Finally I was watching a film about high school that was funny not because of endless jokes about sex and drinking, but simply because it displayed something believable that I could relate to and yet find hilarious. Jon Heder was extraordinary and Tina Majorino's performance was also spectacular.",Napoleon Dynamite
531,kipluck,Nothing to Prove... But Funny as Heck.,10,1 August 2004,"Yesterday my friends and I decided to go the movies to laugh.  We picked Napoleon Dynamite because one of us ""heard it's pretty funny.""  And you know what?  WE LAUGHED.  At the beginning of the movie we looked at each other and whispered ""do you wanna stay and watch this?  We could leave, I guess."" But somehow things changed.  We laughed.  We laughed at his moon boots.  We laughed at his sayings.  Duane about bust a gut because so much of it was filmed in his home town of Boise, Idaho and he kept recognizing everything, including the thrift store, Deseret Industries... a favorite place of ours. We laughed till we cried in some parts.  We quoted it back to each other under our breath.  We went to the movie to laugh.  And this film succeeded wildly at that.  Was it an academy award winning masterpiece?  Nope.  And we didn't care.  We cared that it made us laugh.  And by the end, we loved Napoleon.  We wanted to hang out with someone like him.  He was still a nerd at the end... and that was just fine.  He didn't need to change, and I hope he never does.",Napoleon Dynamite

Maybe it's the way the lines are delivered by the different characters, especially Napoleon, or people's expressions, again especially Napoleon's, but the off-beatness of this movie keeps it going strong. It never gets boring, because you can't wait to hear what everyone has to say next. Some people may not understand this movie, it is true that its concepts are way above an average movie. But its this innovativeness that makes this movie what it is- a great way to spend an hour and a half doing and learning absolutely nothing. There are no morals that come from Napoleon Dynamite. It doesn't ask anything from the audience but to just simply watch. And laugh. A lot.",Napoleon Dynamite
533,lanasrj,The air is thick with dork,10,22 March 2004,"Let me begin by saying that this movie has some of the finest acting I've ever seen.  Everyone, from the leads to those with the smallest parts, are so believable one almost forgets it's a movie and not a documentary. Napoleon in particular is awesome, and he is the heart of the movie. He is no longer content in his role as the high school loser who everyone can pick on, and he sets out to overcome that stigma despite everyone's best efforts to dissuade him.  His quiet triumph is very inspiring.  The film is very funny and warm, with a strong Wes Anderson influence.  A great soundtrack too!  (By the way, the director was at the screening I attended, and he assures us that while the movie appears to be set in the 1980's, it's just a byproduct of life in Idaho that everything is like 15 years behind.)",Napoleon Dynamite
534,blank_tyler87,This movie made me hate life for an hour and a half,1,29 May 2006,"So in summer of 2004, ""Napoleon Dynamite"" was the film that unfortunately got the best word-of-mouth from all my friends, who- in a bout of foolishness- I trusted this time around. To say that this movie was stupid is an understatement. The characters make you feel nothing. The story (if it can be called that), the dialogue, all of it is more deadpan and dry than anything I have ever seen before. This is not to say dry humor and deadpan delivery do not work. I am a huge fan of ""Seinfeld"", ""Lost in Translation"", and many other films or shows considered to be dry or ""about nothing."" The crucial difference is that, for example, ""Lost in Translation"" had terrific acting and a good script, while ""Napoleon"" simply made me feel like my time was being utterly wasted. The most common argument that I hear from fans of this film is that it's great because these are characters we would see every day in our home town or in high school, but why would we want to ever see such sad, pathetic, and ultimately annoying characters again? Personally, if I die having never seen another Pedro or Kip in my life (or another Vote for Pedro shirt for that matter), I will die a happy man.",Napoleon Dynamite

But I found it to be sweet at its core. I didn't see any of the ""post modern cynicism/disdain for humanity"" and on and on that a number of other posts complained about. Though the pacing was rather slow, neither did I feel inclined to fall asleep. I watched ND with my kids, 14 and 12, and Napoleon's speech patterns definitely reminded me somewhat of theirs. We were all able to enjoy the movie, and we all chuckled almost throughout the entire thing. Perhaps the key to enjoying this movie is watching it with others. Perhaps I wouldn't have chuckled nearly as much as I did if I'd watched alone. I can't say for sure.I agree with those who state that the plot is weak or almost not there at all. The music has a sort of cheesy, cheap quality - but for this movie, it all works. Almost all of the humor is in the characters, and not so much in the situations.There is an abundance of true crap out there - mindless violence, formulaic chase scenes, laughs that appeal to potty humor. ND is a small movie with a good heart. All of the invective folks seem to be dumping on it on this message board seems way over the top. If you don't like it, then you don't like it. I could name many dozens of movies, some of which were huge commercial hits, that are much more deserving of the sort of harsh criticism ND has received from many people here.",Napoleon Dynamite
537,lisamcdonnell0816,A Goofy But Feel-Good Cult Classic With a Social Lesson,8,3 February 2019,"Napoleon Dynamite, released in 2004, has no big name (or hardly any recognizable) actors, but became a cult classic and still remains a popular movie today. The main character, Napoleon, is an awkward but ironically confident outcast in a Midwest farming community. Napoleon, played by John Heder, navigates through high school with no friends and uncommon hobbies, such as drawing mythical creatures and practicing his nunchucks techniques. Until a new student named Pedro, played by Efren Ramirez, arrives at the school, Napoleon spends most of his time getting bullied. The characters are nearly monotone at all times, rarely exhibiting any emotions. This creates a dry type of comedy, which is not always accepted or understood. Writer and Director Jared Hess does an excellent job with the comedic timing, and capturing the goofiness of the characters' interactions. The most emotional scene is possibly the one when Napoleon is in the yard trying to feed Tina (the family's pet llama), and his frustration with the people around him bubbles over to him yelling at Tina to ""eat the food!"" while throwing spoonfuls of casserole over the fence. The ridiculousness of scenes like that add to the comedy of the movie. The theme of a group of outcasts persevering still stands out, even in the silly moments. From Napoleon and Pedro becoming best friends, to Napoleon connecting with Deb (Tina Majorino) and Kip (Aaron Ruell) meeting the love of his life, the lovable misfits ultimately end up happy. The lesson in this film is that you don't have to fit in to have friends, make meaningful connections, and be successful accomplishing your goals. The characters all do right by the people they care about. By doing the right thing, we can all overcome adversity.",Napoleon Dynamite
538,john_johnson,Dare To Be Different?,10,22 July 2005,"Napoleon Dynamite is unique. Not only is it shot in a different style to other movies, but the humour is on its own. In fact, it is a perhaps a new genre of comedy. Its main strength is that it goes into avenues which have yet to be touched in the movie industry. Unlike most comedies which rely on gross schoolboy jokes, this movie has a many great delicacies which are intricately timed, and most importantly, rely on the strict observation of the viewer.Revolving around some very strange and unique characters, the film is about the rise to acceptance of a geek in Idaho. However, it is not as primitive as the subject matter suggests. It is very subtly done. So subtle in fact, that most comedy fans will not even understand what is meant to be funny. There are so many nuances. Most are to do with homing in on the eccentricities of the characters.I highly recommend it to those who want a different comedy.",Napoleon Dynamite

Although the genre is said to be 'comedy', I did not find anything funny in this movie. Actually, I did not see any point to this movie as well. The pace is very slow and nothing happens during the 82 minutes of its runtime. We are just shown how Napoleon lives his life and, to tell the truth, his life is really boring. Besides, his character is annoying and acts stupid. I can't see, how this movie could be a cult-classic, if the main character isn't likable at all. I wouldn't dare to recommend this movie to anyone, the plot is non-existent and no comedy at all.",Napoleon Dynamite

It is utterly full of ridiculous sayings, and ridiculous delivery. How they kept straight faces during the takes is utterly beyond me; I found it hysterical.I'd say Nap D is very much a sociable film; I watched it with some friends who are all quite lively and we kept the laughter rolling between us, it was so much fun.If you have fairly dour friends, or if you watch it on your own and are relatively sour, then you probably will enjoy it less than we did.If you don't relate at all to the film (especially the hilariously awkward prom dancing), you may be in denial :) If you do relate but find it uncomfortable, you might need to learn to laugh at yourself more (I struggled here). I think this is a great, well-observed take on a certain, awkward stage of life. I'd say it's for people who are no longer at the protagonist's age, as at the time you probably can't spot half of the traits you do in fact share with Napoleon.As I say, see it once.

542,cbfan24,I give this movie a great two thumbs up for best comedy!,10,21 January 2005,Napoleon Dynamite is just a comedy made to get laughs. This movie really makes you look back on your high school life and remember how crazy and wacky it was. Napoleon is just your average everyday geek who does stuff to impress people. I love the dancing scene! I laughed like crazy. I even re-winded the video over and over again to watch him dance. His friend Pedro is a new kid that comes to this school. He ends up being friends with Napoleon and tries to run for high school president. The only reason Napoleon dances for Pedro's campaign is because they didn't know they needed an act after the speech to boost up their campaign. So that is why Napoleon does his wacky dance. I urge you to not only watch this movie but to buy it as well if you would like a good laugh every now and then. I voted this movie as a 10 because of how it brings out laughs.,Napoleon Dynamite

There's NO plot, NO character development, NO theme (for those of you who think I mean no plot, theme is the main idea/moral of the movie, book, story, etc. which is pulled out of the plot). It may be a love or hate movie, but I hated it. The humour was corny, stupid, and just pathetic. The main character is a complete geek that nobody likes and nothing is done to fix that issue except give him an equally geek-like girlfriend which was pathetic because the only remotely flirtatious things that Napoleon said was ""I like your sleeves"".

An updated and friendly version of ""Revenge of the Nerds"" perhaps, this movie is and of itself a classic. The main character Napoleon is truly likable. His attitude and actions remind all of us in one way or another of ourselves. We all are guilty of that one ""nerd"" factor that makes us who we are. In a more extreme way, Napoleon and his friend Pedro remind us of that one group of kids in school that just weren't that popular. This movie is so creative in character development that it's no wonder people have turned this into a cult classic.All the supporting cast is so much fun to watch . Even if you can't identify with them, you can't help but laugh and can't wait to see where the story takes them. Uncle Rico is perfectly cast, and his obsession with his high school football days is absurdly genius.If you haven't seen this movie, Rent it. If you didn't like it the first time, watch it again.

The characters cover a wide range of social misfits and exhibit the nuances of their behavior in a way that makes sense to them, if not to the general public. It's like a sociological case study of a primitive and exotic tribe of ""Nerds"". Everyone of us should be able to recognize at least one of the ND characters from somewhere in our past or somewhere in our psyches. The acting is sublime, because sometimes we forget that they ARE acting. The writing and dialogue are inventive and unexpected, and so dry it might take you a few days to start laughing.

Most of the others that he interacts with on a daily basis whether it is his family or his friends are also portrayed as retarded. There is no way that this movie has any meaning or sub-plot. No normal, intelligent adult would be able to sit through this film. I cannot begin to convey how bad this movie was! Reading some of the reviews of IMDb members who said their college friends loved it, says a great deal of what attends our colleges today. The writer/director of this mess is Jared Hess. If you look at some of his past credits, you will see that he has for the most part of his career been an ""assistant"" of one kind or another. He should stay within his capacity as an assistant ""a men's room assistant"". Do not waste your money by renting this movie.

Napoleon is a charming character that I think a lot of people can relate to. I really liked the dance scene and all the relationship dynamics between Napoleon and his friends and family. I enjoyed the performances of all the actors and think they did a great job with the characters.

People say that it's funny,it took them about 5 time to find the humor. One word of advice, they can't search for the humor, bring it out at least. A five year could think of a better storyline. Why can't Napoleon get in a fight with the locals, or Pedro have a different attitude at the end. You can't leave people hanging in the wind, man. This is clearly a box-office mistake because if you compared it to a painting, it would be a stick figure with a demented sun because it's not enough effort to attract a variety of audiences.

551,louisebindon,a vote for pedro is a vote for justice,8,1 June 2016,"Napoleon Dynamite is not for the faint of heart. There are tater tots, llamas, steak- eating football-junkie uncles, and babes our brothers have been chatting online with all day. When I watched it for the first time, I found that I didn't quite get it. There was something missing for me. I had seen that ginger Afro everywhere. The people I knew who'd seen it either absolutely adored it or found it completely idiotic. I didn't even know what the story was about going in. When I actually watched it, I felt a little suspicious. People tended to have very violent opinions on this, and so far all I was seeing was a dude in school with moon boots. It was lost on me. The first time. I decided to give Napoleon another chance. Tina deserved better. So a few months later, I re-watched it. I don't know what happened, but apparently something changed me within that time period, because the second time I watched it I was laughing for at least half the film.This movie captures a very specific mood; the feeling you get on hot, sunny days when you've been in school too long, and you're praying for summer vacation but you still have weeks to go . There are no goals anymore, no conflicts, you kind of just exist. What I love is that they take this mood and apply it to everything: script, cinematography, costumes, sound/music. Everything that touched this film had a certain aesthetic to it.I wouldn't normally go for films like this, but this is a special exception in my heart. It seems like everything just happens; it's a boring high school in the middle of nowhere filled with a bunch of bored people. But looks are deceiving. Everything in this film is incredibly well thought out. In one of the first shots in the film, we see Napoleon toss his tiny buff friend out a window attached to a string. We then see the toy get dragged through the asphalt. It's a simple scene, there's only a couple of lines, but it tells us so much. Every single character has a back story (love you, Starla), and the writers made full use of the script to show us. It's really brought to life by the genius timing of the actors. The characters themselves are awkward, uncomfortable, but the timing is smooth and works very well.If you're open to something dialogue-heavy with no real conflict or character development, watch this film. If you're in the mood for unique characters and tater tots, watch this film. If you love llamas and moon boots, watch this film.

Also, something I noticed is that another fellow had mention Jim Jarmusch (or however you spell it, I don't really care), the director of Coffee and Cigarrettes, which I thought to be one of the worst films I had ever seen.

When it was released in theaters last summer, I read about it and urged all my friends to go see it. No one wanted to. One day, while I was at work, they all went to see it and loved it. I figured it was a movie that I'd want to see with friends so I decided to wait until it came out on video. The wait was not worth it.I don't consider myself an art-house snob. Nor do I consider myself to be a person who only likes mainstream movies. I am a film lover. Good, bad, and ugly. I love cheesy 80's movies, blow up action 90's flicks, and high concept 21st century movies. Napoleon Dynamite tries hard, and I think that's what I disliked most about it. The opening titles are cute. And the long shots and the forced awkwardness moments...cute. But after awhile, that's all it amounts to. The direction is CONSTANTLY calling attention to itself.I'm amazed to hear people call this a character driven piece when the director's hand is so evident in every single frame of the movie. However, there is another hand prevalent as well and that is the lead actor. Now, I understand a lot of people have fallen in love with this character he's created. And I will admit to loving some goofy characters in my time, and laughing at anything they do, but I found Napoleon to be lacking what most of them don't.Napoleon is a mean spirited, angry, hurtful, and disturbed individual. I can relate that people find solace in certain things he does in remembering their own foibles of high school life. But all he does is moan, and complain, and us the same delivery for every GAWD single GAWD line. I don't know about you, but the nerds I knew in high school, and the times I felt like an outcast, I at least had a couple of different deliveries or expressions. I just find the character so unlikeable. And those who call him a hero for anyone who's ever felt like an outcast. What movie were you watching? He doesn't undergo any CHANGE. He just continues to droop his eyes, bitch at people, complain, and act like a moron. Oh, he plays tether ball with the girl. That isn't a change in HIM. She just agrees to play. He has no redeeming quality to make him a hero. god knows I wanted to be an individual, but I'd never wish him on myself...and what's with the time period.80's all over it, right? But, this isn't the 80's flick everyone makes it out to be. I thought that way too, at first. Then I paid attention. Uncle Rico wants to go BACK in time to 1982. The car is busting hydraulics. I would peg this movie to take place in the 90's somewhere. So why am I to draw 80's nostalgia? because the director has preened it all over the screen.The film uses set ups, cheap laughs, and over directed camera composition and movement to cover up the fact that it can't decide on a tone, mood, setting, or make any decision at all. The movie is one long failed Mad TV skit, yet even those movies make SOME attempt at a plot and cohesiveness. I have to give this one, a D+",Napoleon Dynamite
563,I_have_a_brain_cloud,On beyond funny,9,19 April 2007,"Everybody, stop making declarations about who does and who doesn't like this movie. I'm a woman well over my thirties and I find ND as a movie and a character to be totally endearing. In those flat-affect, zombied-out kids I recognize myself as a teenager, totally drugged out not by readily available street drugs but by hormones, social pain and self-consciousness. Napoleon has the added stress of living in a bizarre and cruel family. Napoleon, Deb, and Pedro are misfits painfully carving out a place for themselves in a social world that continually and inexorably rejects and mocks them. The degree of their alienation from the conformist world of their high school makes it amazing that they succeed as well as they do. I love the way that most of the main characters rarely, or never, actually finish a conversationinstead, they just run off (the way Napoleon runs off when his dance music ends). Especially Napoleon. He doesn't know how to begin things, or end things--every piece of social discourse is a total trauma.In spite of the unusual qualities of this movie, it really has a very conventional plot, where a suffering misfit eventually redeems himself and achieves social standing. The scene where Napoleon breaks into his dance is like watching a landscape turn from winter to glorious spring.This movie is much more than the sum of its parts. I won't say it's a work of genius but I think it borders on that. As someone said in another comment, anyone who doesn't recognize him or herself in this movie is in denial.Napoleon Dynamite is not just a character, but by now a permanent social icon, like Hamlet. It's really no wonder that playing Napoleon Dynamite has made it so difficult for Jon Heder to break away from the stereotype. Having made us all that gift, I hope he can achieve other things that he can be proud of.",Napoleon Dynamite
564,andyb2300,Please Give me my time back!,1,24 December 2004,"Let me just say that I have seen literally thousands upon thousands of movies and have voted for each on here, and this was the first movie I have ever given a 1. If that does not sum up my opinion of this movie, let me elaborate. This movie contains absolutely no plot, relies on the audiences' stupidity to pull its humor from, and was very poorly made.As best I could follow, the movie follows a ""guy"" named Napoleon Dynamite through high school. To say that he is a nerd is an understatement, and he befriends a new Mexican student named Pedro. He is picked on by others, and his family life is a wreck. That basically sums up the plot, and to say any more would give the writers more credit than they deserve.I love a good comedy and even laughed a few times through such idiotic movies as ""Dude, Where's My Car?"", but never once even chuckled at this movie. This could be because I have an IQ over 20, or it could just be that there was no humor to be found. I assume it is the former since my brother found this movie funny, but I can't be sure since he has never been tested.I am no movie student, but have taken a few classes in film appreciation, although I don't think that was needed to notice the flaws in the movie making. Camera use was poor, lighting was off at times, and the acting was sub-par. I have seen movies where more serious flaws were overcome by excellent acting, but as previously mentioned that was lacking here.Take those few dollars you spent and put it towards anything else, it will be money better spent!

When the lights came up after Napoleon's triumphant dance number, I turned to him and said ""there goes your loosing streak.""

If anybody says that ""it's something they relate to"" they are living a lie.Supposedly, it's ""Nonsense comedy.""

Having seen it, I'm still waiting to see what the fuss was all about. I'm literally hard-pressed to think of a worse movie I've seen, and I've seen some doozies. It was so bad I couldn't even make fun of it, as I could with that awful new dragon movie with John Rhyes-Davies in it. And I thought I could MST anything!I've been told the comedy is dry and satirical. Being dry and satirical myself, I strongly disagree. The movie plods along, sprinkled with painful dialogue uttered by characters whose patheticness makes you want to put them out of their misery, with no discernible end in sight until the last 20 minutes where a predictable ""happy"" ending brings everything to a long-overdue conclusion.It's not plot-driven; there is no plot. It's not character-driven; none of them have any personalities. It's not a coming of age story; nobody learns anything of value. It's not 80s nostalgia; Uncle Rico is about as close as you get to that. The best I can figure is that it's early to mid-90s nostalgia from Loser Land (and having come from Loser Land myself, I'm in no rush to go back.)The only good point was that the actors playing the students actually looked like ""realistic"" teenagers, i.e. not perfect bodies and not ten years older than their characters.Perhaps I am biased. I went to school with a few Napoleon, Kip, Deb, and Summer clones. Maybe the movie wasn't funny because I have already lived it. Having said that, I still think ""ND"" sucked like an F5 tornado. If it's meant to be satirical, clearly nobody knows that the point of satire is to make something appear ridiculous in order to change public opinion or to bring about change. If it's meant to be over the top, it missed the mark by a long shot. If it's meant to be absurd comedy, well . . . it met half the criteria, at least. The writers ought to be ashamed of themselves for coming up with such crap, and whoever accepted the script should be crammed into one of those skinny lockers.",Napoleon Dynamite

Along with all of his friends and relatives.Some have argued this makes the movie ""artistic."" Allow me to dare to compare this with other dumb heroes have we? There's Forrest Gump, but his achievements are portrayed as a consequence of his sincerity, trust in people. Then there's Dumb and Dumber, an unashamedly dumb movie, but it's saving grace is that in my humble opinion it's actually funny. But this... Our heroes' achievements just fall out of the sky and follow no logic or semblance of the plot whatsoever.Pedro is elected president because Napoleon can dance well. Kip has a sexy Lafawnduh come all the way from Detroit to take him away, immersing him in hip-hop culture, all for no obvious reason. I guess it's because the director thought dressing this geek up as a rapper would be funny.

It's never a good sign when an 80 minute movie can't hold a person's attention for that short amount of time.I liked Rushmore, I liked Bottle Rocket (which this movie rips a lot off of), I like films of that genre, but I absolutely can't stand this film. The only humor is random acts of slapstick, which any film can do. The deadpan delivery would be funny if it was only Napoleon who did it, but since every character does it, it loses any sort of comedy that might be there.The plot is weak: the election only takes place in the last 30 minutes of the film, with the first 50 minutes as complete crap. Even then, the movie drags on and on and on and on, without any real conflict. I know the defense is that ""real life"" happens like that, but it doesn't. Conversations I have with people generally have points and emotion and the like. It seems like they tried to stretch a 5 min skit into a full movie. You could probably condense the first hour into 20 minutes of real movie.The fact that the loser(s) win in the end is exactly what you would think would happen. There's no real reason to root for them, though, because I hate Napoleon and Pedro. And Deb. And most of the characters.Don't use the ""I don't get it"" line, because I like interesting, groundbreaking, experimental movies. I like when films break the rules in positive ways.

581,LN_Smithee,Dynamite? Where's the Kaboom?!,6,24 October 2005,"This review contains spoilers.IMHO, the hallmark of a good film is when there is more good stuff to be seen after you have already seen the trailers and clips on the talk shows, which are designed to lure you and your eight-to-ten smackers into the theater. I saw only one scene from ""Napoleon Dynamite"" before watching it yesterday on Comcast OnDemand: the one where Jon Heder as Napoleon lands clumsily on Pedro's bike and grabs his crotch. Funny, in a crude way. But when that scene came up early in the film, I was ready for it. I waited for similar hilarity to ensue.I had a long wait. It wasn't until the bonus footage after the credits that I had a good loud hoot.The nerdish yet indomitable Dynamite clan of the plains of Idaho (I expected Napoleon's real surname to be revealed, and apparently, it is Dynamite) is amusing in a sitcom sense. Despite getting laughed at, beat up, ripped off, and let down, they never lose their fighting spirit, although the battle is, in most cases, lost before the fight. Eventually, they all gain hard-fought victories, with wispy brother Kip (Aaron Ruell) winning the biggest prize of them all: a voluptuous chat-room sweetheart from the big city who is oozing with brown sugar.In searching a way to describe how I didn't think ""Dynamite"" was terrible even though I didn't laugh while watching it, it got me thinking about other small-screen nerds, such as Arnold Horshack (Ron Palillo), Steve Urkel (Jaleel White), and Skippy (Marc Price). It struck me that the character of Napoleon Dynamite could very well be described, in Hollywood high-concept treatment talk, as ""Matthew the office spaz from 'NewsRadio' as a teen."" He is doubtless a talented fellow, but let's face it: tall, frizzy-haired Jon Heder as unicorn-loving Napoleon is not much more than a body channeling the spirit of tall, frizzy-haired Andy Dick as unicorn-loving Matthew.It's easier to appreciate ""Dynamite"" when you consider what it could have been -- another one of those seedy angst-filled character studies that are the specialty of the thoroughly creepy Todd Solondz, or some quasi-intelligent teen sex comedy like ""American Pie."" ""Dynamite"" is frothy and lacks focus, but in being so, avoids the trap of attempting to teach us all The Big Lessons about how being different is OK, or how being a bully is not, etc.While the vaunted ""Dynamite"" is a disappointment, it is far from unwatchable; it's just that its sleeper hit reputation has you thinking there is, at its climax, a ""BOOM!"" and instead, it just goes ""pop."" It's not the kind of movie that I figured would sell so many t-shirts.",Napoleon Dynamite
582,govenor_phatt,Boring and Disappointing,4,1 October 2005,"I rented Napoleon Dynamite last night after hearing some good comments about it, and was expecting some sort of hidden gem. I had seen some clips of it on TV and didn't think much of it, but i decided to watch it with an open mind. How Disappointed i was.Why? Imagine if Eraserhead was in colour, and instead of the occasional moment of extreme weirdness, it has an occasional moment of humour. But the painfully slow pace and lack of any clear plot remains. But at least Eraserhead made you think, to try and work out what you have been watching, and what it meansThe humour is okay, but not great. While it provided me with some genuine giggles it was nothing that sent me roaring with laughter, and was usually too scarce to hold my attention.The film points a big finger at those guys from school that everyone avoids because they are so strange and full of such bullsh*t. They don't mean any harm but they're still damn annoying. And that is the character of Napoleon Dynamite. Other than that there is not much else to say about the film. It has not discernible plot, and is basically just a series of things that happen, some of which seems to bring nothing to the film or characterisation, but just to fill time, some of which appears to be there for no reason. For example, at one point of the film we cut to Napoleon tasting different jars of milk at a table with ""FFA awards"" or something like that written on it. He explains things about the milk that are tainted to some judges. Then we cut to Pedro doing the same with cows udders. For no reason. There is nothing leading to it, no mention of why they're there, and nothing gained from the scene other than seeing Pedro wearing his medal for a few of the following scenes. If i had to describe the extremely loosely related incidents that happen that appear to be a story it is this. Napoleon Dynamite. A geek that usually gets beaten up and spends most of his time with his geeky (but occasionally hilarious) brother Kip. Napoleon meets a new and equally geeky student from Mexico called Pedro Sanchez (original). They ask some girls out and then Pedro runs for class president. And thats it. Really. Oh and there's some other guff about Kip meeting a girl online who turns out to be very attractive, and Napoleons uncle Rico, who mooches out of their house and tries to sell Tupperware. None of the events seem to lead to any sort of climax, resolution or satisfaction to the viewers.I was briefly reminded while watching it of the TV series of The Office, with its slow pace and subtle character observations, but at least The Office is witty and has a story in each episode which lets us see more of the characters and their situation every week.",Napoleon Dynamite

It doesn't even claim to make a lot of sense, or strive to reach our hearts or teach us things or blah, blah, blah. No, it's a comedy. It is for laughing very hard- at some points, so hard I was crying and choking on my popcorn.Everything that is said and done in this film is fresh comedy as opposed to the generic pranks and gross-out stunts and gimmicks we've seen countless times. I really think the director's technique here was the (and I quote the Simpsons here) ""it's funny 'cuz it's true"" technique. This movie shows us losers, absolutely and completely, as we have seen them on the streets, in school or at work, and gives us a tiny window into their warped lives and delusional minds. The indie feel of this movie keeps us from feeling like anybody in this movie is *trying* to be funny, which would take away from the naturally comedic scenarios that occur. The dialogue is excellent because all the funny lines are so unexpected and completely out of nowhere that they throw you out of your seat.See this movie.",Napoleon Dynamite

The acting is somewhat horrid at times, and the characters never really get defined -- they simply are the way they are with no real explanation. Some of the scenes work well to show what I think is the main theme; the awkwardness of being a teenager. Napoleon is an awkward kid for sure, but he is not fully definded. Pedro seems to have some issues, and older brother and Uncle Rico are total misfits. Overall, this film is funny, but a renter at best.

586,CapDac,Don't bother,1,30 January 2006,"OK, this movie got a lot of great press. Everyone was praising it, calling it a great movie. So when the stepsister rented it, I sat down and watched it.I want my 75 minutes back.I fail to see what is soo good in any way, shape or form about this hour-long session of people staring at the camera blankly (no, not the audience, the acting).I was honestly surprised by Napoleon Dynamite. It was so bad, I could hardly believe what I was seeing. There are no characters, just a few stereotypes wandering around. By the end of it, they all looked the same and spoke in the same monotone I was having trouble telling everyone apart.The extent of the character development was giving each character a name and an occupation or hobby, and that's about it.There was no real plot, and none of the characters seemed to have any motivation. In fact, the only good thing about the movie - the final dance scene - just began on its own, coming from nowhere with a pounding track. While I was watching this movie I kept asking ""Where is this happening? What's going on?"" The acting was high school drama quality, with stiff wooden delivery, as though the actors were reading from cue cards without comprehending their lines. Their trouble delivering lines was made even more obvious by horrible sound design. The limited ADR sounded like it was recorded in an open room. And to cap it all off, half the actors didn't even bother opening their mouths when they spoke.The actors were constantly taking obvious care to hit their marks, looking almost robotic in their movements. So, these listless automatons are whisked through a series of implausible and confusing scenarios, often without even the benefit of transition scenes. They were here, now they're there. This was happening, now that's happening. Random scenes with little rhyme or reason.This movie made absolutely no sense. The whole fiasco was polished by the fact that there was no ending. The Peruvian kid, or Spanish, or Mexican, or whatever the hell he was (no one actually mentioned his home country's name in comprehensible English) was running for school captain, and had to perform a skit. Napoleon dances. Suddenly we see the ethnic (for want of a better word) guy cutting a cake. Then we see the sleazy uncle (whose character had a tiny gleam of promise which was flushed down the toilet anyway) practicing football as though it's a new thing, despite the fact that he spent a quarter of the movie doing the same thing. Then suddenly Napoleon and his girlfriend are playing ball. There's no resolution of the under-focused conflict that supposedly went on between them (the uncle might have suggested that Napoleon wanted her less flat-chested, or Napoleon could have suggested she cram a spoon into one of her pores, I have a hard time telling which), and everything's just happy dandy This film made no sense! Why does it get such praise? No one has yet to give me any convincing reasons, but after asking about a hundred people ""Why is it so good"" you'd think I could get more than ""It just is!"" Not even worth renting. Being perfectly honest, this film makes one of Uwe Boll's look like Shakespeare!",Napoleon Dynamite

There is no sexual content whatsoever in the depiction of teenagers, and this is refreshing as the interest is sustained by the deadpan performances and the constant surprises. All of the characters are losers, with nowhere to go. Casting was excellent, and Jon Heder's performance as Napoleon is a triumph of understatement. In the pre-election scene at the high school auditorium his dance reveals him as a performer with great comedic skill and a remarkable coordination. I'd like to see him in another role.",Napoleon Dynamite

My friends hated it but I got touched in my heart. Napoleon reminds me of the child I once was. I think this movie had a very different script than other 'teen movies'. There was so much to remember in this movie. The opening sequence is so simple and great. I know many people will get bored by the movie but I loved it and kept thinking about it for the whole day. I downloaded and listened to the opening song like ten times in a row. It was pure fun. This movie is not perfect but it doesn't intend to be. I recommend people to watch it at least once, you would either hate it or fall in love with it.",Napoleon Dynamite
589,groundskeepercarlspackler,DYNAMITE is a bomb.,1,11 June 2004,"Amateurish, unfunny indie film about a high school kid named NAPOLEAN DYNAMITE. The film doesn't have much to say or do. It seems content merely to create a weird, childlike universe, and allow its characters (most of which are extremely annoying) to exist there without much purpose or development. Many indie filmmakers have distinguished themselves with similar films- NAPOLEAN DYNAMITE is vaguely reminiscent of Todd Solondz' WELCOME TO THE DOLLHOUSE or Wes Anderson's RUSHMORE- only those films had memorable characters on interesting journeys. NAPOLEAN DYNAMITE is some kind of hipster attempt to mimic the worlds of those better films, but with every new scene the film becomes more and more annoying.",Napoleon Dynamite
590,john-1361,Funny Movie - Funnier Comments,10,30 July 2005,"I just saw this film on Cinemax, I resisted renting it or actually going to see it at the theater because of the awful word of mouth it received in certain circles. While I found the movie to be delightful, very funny and sadly poignant, I had a better time reading the comments of the people who hated it, and there are quite a few.Suffice to say my British parents were right when they warned me that Americans just don't get satire. Most of the extremely negative comments focused on the lead characters deadpan, mumbling delivery. That of course was one of the key elements of the film's comedy. The folks who absolutely despised it and called into question the intelligence of the producers did not even for a moment glimpse the fact that they were in large part the very people the film was satirizing, the ones who only wish to see lovely, pretty, well spoken people in their cinema, the ones who probably ridiculed and tortured their classmates who were judged to be odd.The young lead actor, John Heder, was brilliant throughout. He turned the character of Napolean into a very real teenager, someone almost everyone can identify with, in one way or another. I have never before seen the anguish of an outcast, gawky, un-loved and desperately lonely child so effectively played, and with a comic edge and loving manner that eventually redeemed him.Bravo to the filmmakers, may you all have long and lovely careers and may you all continue making such worthwhile films!",Napoleon Dynamite
591,jzac79,"Hilarious, unique movie with a good story",8,6 March 2006,"Napolean Dynamite starring Jon Heder and directed by newcomer Jared Hess is a very original comedy about two awkward high-schooler losers in rural Idaho who come together by chance to make a run at the high-school presidency. This is the simple version of what happens in the film but really, it's much more than just that. First of all, this movie is unique because of the characters and the world(s) they all live in. I've never been to Idaho so I've no idea if this movie gives an accurate depiction of this place, but if it does then Idaho is very unique. Judging from this movie, Idaho is stuck in time (perhaps 1982;)) The music is mostly from the 80's: ""Time after Time,"" ""I want Candy,"" and ""The Promise."" They also have an original ""score"" that sounds like some cheesy 80's game show music or elevator music. But, surprisingly, it fits the film and the characters perfectly. The clothes all the characters wear are also a throwback to the 80's or at least the 90's. But, the one thing in this world that is modern is technology, because one of the characters (Kip, Napolean's younger brother) uses the internet on a regular basis. So, this causes some confusion to viewers because it really seems that the story takes place in an earlier time. But, really it's just that the town is stuck in 1982 (perhaps). This theme of the town, or, at least, some of the characters being ""stuck,"" whether it be in a certain time or situation, plays a significant role in the story that probably goes unnoticed by a lot of viewers. Since the characters and dialog are so funny, it is easy to overlook subtle things in the story. But, these things make the movie work on more than one level. For instance, look at ""Uncle Rico,"" played by John Gries. Here's a guy who is stuck in 1982. His whole reason for monetary gain is to buy a time machine to go back to 1982 so he can re- live his high-school football days and ""take state."" It's obviously an obsession with this guy because he makes tapes of himself throwing a football to no one. And we are told this is the reason his ex-girlfriend has left him. He clearly has a problem with living in the past and we, the audience, pity him. But, we also can admire him for setting goals and actually following through with trying to accomplish them, however impossible they are. Uncle Rico presents a theme by which most of the other characters also follow in the story - that of an eccentric, social outcast, unaware of their own awkwardness, who tries to accomplish their goals and isn't always successful, but they keep trying. Kip, Napolean's 32 year-old brother lives with Napolean and their grandma, doesn't have a car, and regularly chats with ""babes online all day."" Napolean's friend, Pedro, the Mexican immigrant, is perhaps the most normal of all the main characters. He is a little odd, but he does have ""skills."" Pedro also tries to be something better by running for president. The shirt Napolean wears to support his friend, ""Vote For Pedro,"" becomes a symbol. And finally there's Napolean, played brilliantly by Jon Heder. Napolean is the embodiment of every dork we've ever known in high-school or college. He talks funny, looks funny (his eyes are almost always half-closed) and he draws strange pictures of Ligers and warriors. But, it turns out Napolean has a hidden and unexpected talent that will help him and his friend Pedro in the high-school presidential race. The plot itself is simple and effective. But, the story isn't driven by the plot. It's all about the characters. And the characters are realistic and hilarious. There's a very dry humor to this film that surfaces in the dialog. The way the characters deliver their dialog is funny in and of itself. But, after awhile, hearing Napolean say, ""freakin' idiot,"" with the same bored, emotionless expression gets a little tired. And the film would fail if it relied purely on this alone. It is slow at times on the verge of being downright boring. However, the film picks up a lot when we see Naploeon and Deb at the school dance. In this touching scene we see that Napoleon, despite his admirable efforts, is not going to get the girl he fancies the most in Trisha Stevens. But, we see also that there is a definite connection between him and Deb as they slow dance to Cindi Lauper's ""Time after Time."" From this point on the movie isn't just funny anymore, it's inspiring. The ending completes the plot and also gives the audience an age old message to ""follow your heart,"" and be yourself and you'll become a winner if you do so. In the end we see that even though Napoleon, Uncle Rico, and Kip, may still be ""stuck"", whether it be in a certain time or situation, they manage to find someone who likes them for who they are and is therefore truly worthy of them. And the t-shirt with the writing, ""vote for Pedro,"" is a symbol for supporting uniqueness and authenticity in all people. It tells us all the message to be yourself and you'll become a winner in the end.",Napoleon Dynamite
592,lindsayhanners,the comedy of the century,10,30 December 2004,"This movie was so refreshing, and it gets better with repeated viewings. The direction is especially noticeable. I can't believe this is someone's first movie. It's perfect!! I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is part of generation x or y, fans of rocky horror picture show, and maybe even fans of pulp fiction. and definitely fans of half baked! I guarantee that you will see this movie, love it, crave it, buy it, and buy it again later when that friend steals it or when it becomes too scratched up to be read anymore. might as well buy an extra copy, or burn 2 instead of 1. This is the best thing that MTV has put it's wretched stamp on since ""The State"" was on the air. I love this movie.",Napoleon Dynamite
593,the_punish0r,The Godfather.... roll over!,10,7 December 2004,"Napoleon Dynamite is quite possibly the funniest film i've ever seen! This movie is perfect, i don't have a single complaint. The writing was incredible and i loved the orginality of it all. OK, so there have been movies about nerds before.... but.... normally, the message that tends to get tagged on to these sorts of movies is... ""well in the end, the good looking, sporty and popular guy - with the totally hot girlfriend - is the real geek!"" but not in ND! in ND, the real geek.... is well... Napoleon!Being a bit of a nerd myself, i can relate to Napoleon. The guy is like all my friends rolled into one great big super nerd, with +9 saving throw against all members of the opposite sex... well, almost all! can't forget Deb.I loved this movie, seen it twice now and can't wait until it comes out on DVD.",Napoleon Dynamite
594,Jenfranbax,I laughed I cried I pooped my pants......,7,22 October 2005,"First, I think this is part of a new generation of movies , like ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" and ""Elephant"" (Of course that one was no comedy) that are coming out of a whole new way of thinking about high school and the experiences of teenagers. Nothing like the John Hughes version of adolescence where the nerds were really just artsy and different and the rich kids spoiled, sexually active and seemingly without adult supervision. I was in high school in 1988 and I can tell you this is a more honest look at life at Bayside High in Queens than any John Hughes movie of the time. (Maybe everyone is just being more honest with themselves these days. That is why my kids are watching ""Family Guy"" while in the 80's we were watching ""Smurfs."") This movie even looks ambiguous time-wise. Although the give away is the uncle who lives in 1982. Still, I can remember the guys who couldn't let go of the 70's and we snickered about their bell bottoms and velour shirts behind their backs. Same thing. Sooooo the guy who said people over 30 would not like this is deluded. Teenagers today have no idea how people my age relate to this stuff, we lived ND!! The movie is slow paced, yes. It is deliberate. You have to stop and watch a few times to get the jokes. I love that! It reminds me of the slow paced Mel Brooks movies that required more than one viewing to appreciate. Refreshing now that we are slowing down and examining things. This is part of the turning from the fast paced teen farce with quick edits and pervasive music that made it impossible to feel anything on your own. Music is used wisely here. The dance scene in the end is epic...and will make you want to run out and get Jameriqoi (spelling?) The love story underneath with the nerdy girl was very realistic. The popular girl Summer, marginally good looking, but blond and bitchy...realistic. The older brother who is of questionable sexuality and his girlfriend ""Lawfunduh"" who he meets in the chat rooms is really funny too. But this is really Jon Heder's movie. With the half open eyes and sarcastic delivery, he is like a kid with aspberger's. A geek with balls. He decides he is going to get his lethargic friend Pedro elected student body president. My favorite scene is when he asks the guy for one of summers (she is the most popular girl in school and also running for president) pins and then throws it down the hallway nearly hitting other students with it and then does that nerd exit (it's like an awkward dart out of every scene) Watch for the nerd exit after the climactic dance scene. *SPOILER* Make sure and stay after the credits for the wedding.",Napoleon Dynamite
595,khess-2,Hated it.,2,8 January 2006,"I am shocked that this movie gets such rave reviews. It is funny in places but it is more of a ""dumb"" funny rather than actually funny. I never really found a plot to the movie. I think it seems like more of a movie that is about high school kids that was done by high school kids. Not sure how this one ever went to production but hey, Hollywood needs help obviously. Hollywood needs some new blood from the likes of this and that gay cowboy movie...sheesh! It seems that there have been a lot of pointless movies made in the past few years...About Schmidt was one, then that damned I Heart Huckabees...geez if I had only known it was this easy to get crap on the screen,...I would have gone to Hollywood years ago and be famous now.

No luck.The message (if any) is not clear. The main characters are single-digit IQ students, hard to sympathise with them (unless the watcher is in the same situation, and in that case they may not understand the humour). Make no mistake, Forrest Gump this ain't.Typical American high school bullying is portrayed, with a twist: where in other movies jocks torment smart (or funny, or witty) yet socially inept schoolmates, here it's idiots against other (maybe even bigger) idiots.I didn't have the heart to watch it to the end to find if and how the inept lead character would prevail.Napoleon Dynamite brings sad and abused cliches to their limit, and beyond. The result is an appalling display of idiocy.Don't waste your time with this crap. Having your nails ripped would be a less painful experience.",Napoleon Dynamite

This is the best comedy I've seen since Office Space, it's even funnier! My mom even liked it, and that says a lot! I would definitely recommend you buy this film, you won't be disappointed..Some people may not find the humor in this film, but I really don't understand how..?? Jared Hess done a wonderful job of directing and the soundtrack is Great!! The actors for this movie were perfect, I don't know where they found Jon Heder, but he's amazing, and Napoleon is my favorite character of ALL time! along with his brother 'Kip', which makes this movie totally funny.

Just like Dumb and Dumber, Napoleon Dynamite will have you quoting it weeks after you have seen it. It makes you want to come back and watch again. By far the funniest scene is the dance on stage by Napoleon. If you have not seen I urge you to do it. You will roll for hours after it is over. I can't help but laugh even thinking about it just writing this.Respectfully submitted,Zack",Napoleon Dynamite
599,hls_04,"a great, original movie!",10,16 June 2006,"I seriously don't see any problems with this movie. So, why are so many people putting it down? Is it because they've never seen it? Or are they afraid to like something so anti-Hollywood? This is one of the most original movies I've seen in a long time. The characters are just regular, ordinary people trying to get by in life like we all are. It isn't meant to be glamorous or anything along those lines - just a movie about the life of Napoleon Dynamite and his friends and family. All the actors played their parts wonderfully. I like watching a movie where I don't see some of the actor/actress in their part - they seemed like they completely transformed into their character, which makes this film even better! It's original, funny and flippin' sweet! I give it a 10 out of 10!",Napoleon Dynamite
600,molagmar18,A different kind of funny,10,15 January 2005,"Napoleon Dynamite is one funny movie. What I like is the fact that they can make a really funny movie without loading it with bad language and other elements (freakin' is NOT a bad word, at least for me). Naopleon Dynamite is a perfect example that crude humor isn't the only funny out there (but nothing beats Jeff Foxworthy). This is one movie that you can watch over and over. Though I frequently enjoy almost any kind of humor, Napoleon Dynamite is one of my favorites. So many one liners that can make you laugh till you choke. I say to you, you just need to watch it if you haven't! All I have to say now is I just love this movie, GOSH!",Napoleon Dynamite
601,pigeoncake,A believable nostalgic comedy - very subtle & involving,8,5 January 2005,"Firstly, when I say ""nostalgic"" I don't mean it takes me back to a certain time because it's set in modern day isn't it? I just think the word nostalgic helps describe the overall feeling and ambiance the film generates.Another thing that's impressive about ND is it's alternative portrayal of high school American life, it has the cool kids, bullies and geeks but they don't all live in a huge penthouse in some rich leafy suburb.All characters are thoroughly well played, almost as if they're not acting & just being themselves. It's one of those films that has a universal appeal but counts on it's geographic location for the brand of humour...I'm from northern England myself & I'm sure this film has as much relevance to people living where it was set as, say for instance 'Twenty Four Hour Party People' has to me.Napoleon Dynamite is one of those well executed & cleverly observed comedies that are very rarely put on general release. One of those films whose quality won't be seen for a good while I imagine.",Napoleon Dynamite
602,albertinamel,"The Phone Call, 2004 extended re-make",8,28 May 2016,"I know I'm writing this review over 10 years too late, but the fact that my family still loves to watch this movie years after it came out is a testament to how funny we still find it.People who don't get this movie have probably never spent time in a rural, Western town. If you have, you appreciate how dead-on this movie is in depicting the absurdities and banality of life in such a town.Also, people claim the movie borrows from movies like Rushmore, but if you want to see the original Napoleon, you really need to watch a little-known short film made by the Mormon church from 1977 called ""The Phone Call."" Hess took Napoleon's character, and a few other details, almost directly from this film. The film stars Mark McClure, the older brother in Back to the Future and Jimmy Olsen in the Christopher Reeve Superman films, and you can find it on YouTube. Once you watch it, you'll have a better appreciation for Napoleon. (For the record, there are a few Mormon jokes, like Napoleon's ""Ricks College"" t-shirt; Ricks was the name of the BYU-Idaho campus in Rexburg, ID before it changed its name.)Again, not everyone will get the movie. And that's OK. It's more ""slice of life"" than punchline humor. It's not meant to appeal to everyone, but for anyone who ever spent a summer in rural Idaho (or Utah, Wyoming, etc.), you'll fall off your seat laughing.",Napoleon Dynamite

How many times did you call home and you could not get out of staying in school? The character acting is perfect! I forgot I was watching a movie, I really became attached. I have had friends with mixed feelings about the movie as a whole,however, they still continue to talk and use expressions like the characters. ND is addictive and I would love to see more.I have watched the short on the reverse side of the DVD, and I still want more.

604,velvetoneo,"Cult Classic, Sure, But Not As Great As Everyone Says",8,13 November 2005,"This is a cult classic with absurdist, in-jokey humor that is hugely in vogue now among Gen Y teenagers and younger twentysomethings. Some parts of it are hilarious, but don't think too much about the movie. There's a very casually-placed, light-handed message in there about being different and finding yourself through the absolutely absurd (but somehow lovable) characters. I don't think it would hold up too well on repeat viewings, but it is FUNNY. When you get into analyzing it, it was a hit because it came out at the right time with the right group of people, and then quickly got into pop culture. This movie was a success because it was funny, but not for the typical reasons, and had a very sentimental, comforting message without being too obvious. Parts of it made me laugh more than any other movie that'd been released in years, and I think it'll actually age better than some other indie hits from the 2000s like ""Garden State"", which were so empty and so sentimental without anything else to them that they'll wear thin once the crowd born in the 80s and early 90s gets into the workforce and finds self-esteem. Besides being a cult classic and a phenomenon, don't think too much about it, and it works better than most other movies of its kind.",Napoleon Dynamite
605,triffidtom,"Very funny, off-kilter film",8,24 October 2014,"There's pretty much nothing poorly done in this classic goof ball film. The acting is great - on the mark for the types of characters the film requires. The writing is great - dialog and story telling work portraying a time and story strange yet familiar. The visual set pieces are excellent. There are visual moments that are now iconic, strongly associated with the film.I found it re-watchable and hilarious, with characterizations that remain with me long after the last time I saw it.

My grandma however enjoyed this film and she's 80 plus years old. There's no sex, no over abundance of naughty swear words it's the perfect film for grandma! it's also the perfect film for you as long as you're not A square.

607,Hammygoodness,Deadpan delivery with lots of comedic timing,10,20 January 2005,"ND is an odd movie if ever there was one. Many have called the acting bad, but I found the quirky characters to be quite realistic... in a fictional kind of way. I'm not really sure how to explain it. The plot is... who cares. There's not a whole lot of attention paid to the plot in this film, and for good reason. This is straight up a comedic film, and as such its purpose is to make you laugh. Now, people have different senses of humor, so for some it will be hilarious, while others will be left scratching their heads.I suppose the best litmus test for whether you'll like this film is if you like deadpan delivery, and if you can appreciate timing. A lot of this movie is slow. VERY slow. But that only seems to add to the awkwardness of the characters giving the dialogue, thus making them more realistic, and to me, endearing. But for those of you out there who need flashing lights, explosions and sweet electric guitars wailing, I think this film will go over your head. The non-sequiturs and one-liners are perfect for the characters, but if you can't appreciate the characters themselves, you'll hate this movie.I think all the talk about relating this movie to your own childhood, or how it's a movie for the Gen X'ers might have SOME merit, but let's not overdo it. Comedy is 90% good characters in my opinion (think Seinfeld) and this film has some of the best I've seen in a LONG time.",Napoleon Dynamite

I fall into the ""10"" crowd.This movie's brilliance is in part, due to the fact that there is absolutely no profanity, or sexual references. That takes real talent on the part of the creators, but what's amazing about this movie is that it just has never been ""done"" before. All the temptations to exaggerate a character, or play on a safe, tested predictable gag are carefully avoided. This movie is big risk. It's a story about Napolean, a dork. His brother and uncle, are dorks. They don't act like it, they just are. Napolean gets involved in trying to get his friend ""Pedro,"" elected student body president. His brother ""Kip,"" and uncle ""Ricoh,"" are irrelevant side stories. That's it. Somehow, this movie made me laugh harder than I have laughed in....I don't remember. It's all about the characters. They are all under-acted on purpose. The setting is a little town called Preston Idaho. It's actually shot on location, and uses the local population for all but the main stars parts. The kids are real, the story sounds about as boring as it gets. In the beginning, you're not laughing that hard but you're chuckling and realizing that this film is delightfully original. By the end of the movie you can't get up from your seat, because your stomach hurts so much from uncontrolled laughing-But don't get up! Stick around for the add on scene after the credits. It's the most hilarious part of the movie! there is no way to possibly give an example of how funny this movie is-it's just too original.

609,lenkyliciousness,A terrible excuse for a movie with absolutely no humour,1,14 July 2005,"I watched this movie because all of my friends said it was hilarious, and since this movie is aimed at my age group (I'm pretty sure it is anyway) I took their word for it. My friend and I rented it out one afternoon and settled down on the couch ready to laugh.Not once did I laugh. Not once did my friend laugh. Not once did I think that any part of this movie was remotely funny. This is a lame, pathetic attempt at a teen comedy.The character of Napoleon Dynamite made me want to cry. To try and imitate someone who clearly has some kind of mental disability and then make their acts funny is sick and disturbing. There is a kid in my year with a mental disability who acts very similar to Napoleon; he sits alone, has no friends and is laughed at constantly because he is different. It saddens me that someone would take this kind of situation and try and make a supposedly 'humourous' movie out of it.The humour in this movie relied on the actors inability to act, which in my opinion can never be a good thing. Ther drab, dull performances was supposed to be funny but just came across as they obviously would, drab and dull.For your own sakes, I strongly recommend that you stay away from this movie at all costs if you wish to be entertained.

Though it was difficult to find a theater in my area that was actually playing the movie, I did go out and see it. I was not disappointed, the movie was very funny from the beginning, but not really in the plot, more in the humorous mannerisms of Napoleon and all the other characters. There are several humorous encounters throughout the film between the more normal secondary characters and the quirky main characters, and these often end humorously, such as when Napoleon goes to pick up his reluctant date to the dance, Trisha, and winds up being taken to her house by his best friend Pedro's cousins with a pimped ride.

614,lion_time,Easily my favorite movie,10,6 July 2016,"Many will ignore Napoleon Dynamite as an asinine movie packed with obnoxious phrases for your idiotic coworkers to endlessly repeat forever. However, these people are missing the point. Napoleon Dynamite is an honest and painful, yet hilarious examination of small-town American adolescence. The movie portrays the often comical juxtapositions that rural America is experiencing in the twenty-first century.Kip's endless interest in chatrooms and the internet offers an escape from the droll technologically stunted lifestyle Idaho offers him. Kip is part of a generation that grew up with unlimited access to information through technology, but no outlets for their creativity due to limited real-life resources. Kip's lack of interest in blue collar work and manual labor cut him out to be unsuccessful in a small town in middle America. He turns to strangers on the internet for validation and comfort.Pedro's campaign for school president reflects the aspirations and barriers that Chicano Americans experience in predominantly white schools. His culture is mocked by Summer in her campaign speech and his prom proposition is rudely declined. If it wasn't for Napoleon, Pedro would be outcast and shunned by his white peers for his accent and attire, an all too real reality for many Americans.Uncle Rico's get rich quick schemes distract him from his unfulfilled dreams of sports stardom. He personifies Kip's and Napoleon's futures as a maladjusted adult in the middle of a midlife crisis. He's obsessed with time travel to an embarrassingly childish degree and demonstrates a poor understanding of social tact and boundaries. He is in charge of two young men but remains selfish and irresponsible.Deb makes and sells charms and trinkets to try to pay for college, which is incredibly difficult to afford in America. For her, her escape from Idaho is in education. She also runs a photography studio to help fund this dream. Although she exists partly as an object for Napoleon's affections, she too shows a valuable aspect of small-town life.Finally, Napoleon is a young man who is awkward yet well meaning with no role models to look up to. His father isn't around, his uncle and older brother are losers, and his grandmother leads a secret life. Napoleon is trustworthy and kind as demonstrated by his loyal friendship to Pedro, but his romantic endeavors are failures due to his tactless advances. His adherence to a purpose is discovered when he finds a dated dance instruction tape at his local thrift store. The dance he learns from this tape is hilarious to the viewer, but within the vacuum of this small town in Idaho, it's truly astonishing. His dance recital as a surprise addition to Pedro's school president campaign is the climax of the movie and it represents his overcoming his awkwardness; he simultaneously wins Pedro's campaign and wins Deb's heart in this moment.If this movie wasn't so funny, it'd be extremely depressing, which is why it rings so true.",Napoleon Dynamite
615,elefantman-1,Great Movie-People who say it doesn't have a plot are wrong. Every movie has plot.,10,24 November 2005,"I believe Napolean Dynamite is the best movie I ever saw. I gave it 10 of 10, hands down, my number 1 movie. I'm obsessed with Napolean Dynamite-I know the dance all the way through, I dressed up as him for Halloween, and so on and so forth. I can't explain why I liked it, because I can't single out one thing-I liked it all. The comedy, the acting, etc. I dislike how people are saying it has no plot. Others say it didn't need a plot. I think anybody who thinks a movie dosen't have a plot hasn't given it enough thought. Every movie has a plot. The word plot is defined as what happens. So even if nothing happens, then something's happening-that something would be nothing. So even a blank screen technically has a plot. If you agree or disagree with me, or just want to chat about the movie (or quiz me-I've seen the movie 15 3/4 times, so you probably can't fool me) please feel free to e-mail me. I will not accept anymore e-mails after Christmas.",Napoleon Dynamite
616,Pure-Gold,"Overrated, but surprisingly good.",9,16 April 2006,"Napoleon Dynamite. I'm going to start of by repeating what I have already said ""Napoleon Dynamite is quite overrated."" There's nothing wrong with it, but it starts off a bit...well...slow. The first time I watched Napoleon Dynamite, I kept on wondering when the opening credits were going to end. The song, was good. But how they were put together was...well...somewhat boring. Not too boring, but boring. The movie is different. It's plot is hard to figure out-but since half my friends talk about Napoleon Dynamite 24/7, I had to see it for myself. So I watched it three times. Once-the first time-without commentary. The first time, I thought it was quite boring. It is for sure a movie you should watch at least twice, because like I have said, the plot is hard to figure out (I actually still don't quite know what the plot was, but no matter), but you will eventually catch on. The second time I watched it was with the commentary on, and I thought it was a bit better. The plot was a bit easier to understand, but I think there's at least 3 different plots here. I liked the references to the directors hometown. I began to catch on, and eventually like the movie a bit more. The third time. The third time was the time I enjoyed the movie most. I understood Napoleons...um...interesting voice a bit more (""You guys are so retarded"" ""You guys are such frickin' idiots"" will always be funny to me, no matter what age. Napoleans voice is also quite funny, but parents, if you're going to let your kids watch this, beware, because they might imitate Napoleans tone of voice, or interesting choice of words. Try watching the movie beforehand.)The commentary helps, lots. And you begin to laugh a lot more. Overall, Napoleon Dynamite is a great movie, and has it's hits, and misses. Kids can even relate to some of the characters, of relate to how some characters treat others-mostly referring to Haylie Duff. I recommend this movie, highly, for ages 10+. Maybe even lower. Boys will most likely like this movie more then girls... Definitely 9 ""delicious bass"" out of 10.",Napoleon Dynamite
617,joshwalt2,shallow and cruel,1,15 July 2005,"if you want to see a good movie about outcasts, watch Welcome to the Dollhouse. If you'd rather laugh at nerds and Midwesterners (it was supposed to be current...they just get fashion/music a few years later than those of us on the coasts), then this is the movie for you.I rushed out to see it. The trailer was fantastic and it was playing in an indie movie theater. I soon found out that MTV produced it (""Huh, that's weird...""). Not weird at all. It's just the kind of movies that the ""cool kids"" at MTV would put together: The characters were one-dimensional. The writing on the whole was atrocious. Although I admit that it was visually okay, this is a teen movie and nothing more. I laughed maybe twice in when I had desperately wanted to see it.To all of you doofs who think wearing a ""Vote for Pedro"" pin/shirt/whatever is hip...this movie is about the furthest thing from hipness. It's not ""absurdist comedy"" or whatever pseudo-intellectual frat boys want to label it as, it's just a mean-spirited sketch that was stretched from the 10 minutes it should've been to around 2 hours. This is the mental equivalent of Celebrity Deathmatch. Just because something was screened in an art-house does not make it an independent movie, and it certainly doesn't make it cultured.",Napoleon Dynamite
618,paigeelton,Napoleon make yourself a dang quesadilla!!!,9,1 June 2016,"Napoleon Dynamite hits everything important that should be in a film. Subtle humour, aesthetically pleasing shots, and killer wardrobe. I remember watching this film for the first time when I was 7, and not really understanding it, but continuously watching it with my family and friends as I grew older, and slowly but surely finding it more funny, and picking up on the awkward dialogue. In this film every word counts, their sparing use of words, causes the ones they do include to be some of the most famously quoted ones in film. Every character is so thoughtfully planned out, Kip, a 30-something year old still living at home spending hours chatting online with his internet girlfriend Lawfawnduh every day, Rico, an uncle who wants to travel back in time to the 80s when he peaked in high school, to play football and meet his soul mate; even background characters who have a very small roll, like Rex from Rex Kwon Do, the self defence teacher with his deep raspy voice, his sweet heart Starla, the character is so perfectly planned out, down to the American hammer pants. I would say yes, I do get Napoleon Dynamite, though, I don't think there's all that much to get, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Maybe I'm wrong, but I think it's just a hilarious film, that shows that you really can make something brilliant on a budget. Many people said that it was boring, but I would beg to differ, maybe it's more of an acquired humour, but this is one of the movies I know I will be watching for the rest of my life. I almost can't totally say why I love and appreciate this movie so much, maybe it's nostalgia, or the fact I can relate to being an awkward teenager, in conclusion, this film is one of the best of it's time,and one everyone should see.",Napoleon Dynamite
619,fyona-03838,It was good.,6,31 May 2016,"""Napoleon Dynamite"" is a very different style of movie. It is a very simple movie; no guns, no special effects, etc. It has very basic dialogue and a very simple story-line. However, enjoy the story-line; I like movies that show what real life is like and what most people go through on a basic day. ""Napoleon Dynamite"" did this. ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is a very basic movie and many people may say that it is just for enjoyment and that there is no thinking required whatsoever; I on the other hand think that every movie you watch makes you think, no matter how simple the story-line is: ""Saw"" makes you think to what extreme will you go to to survive; any Disney movie makes you think about how there are real bad guys, but unlike Disney movies they don't always get real justice, and ""Napoleon Dynamite"" makes you think about life. It can make you think about your life now, what your life will look like in the future, and what it was like when you were younger. When you watch a movie that accurately portrays real life you are left questioning and thinking about your life and how your life is similar to those in the movie. I do like this movie; I watched it when I was younger with my family and I think that is a big reason why I like ""Napoleon Dynamite"", however it isn't a movie I want to watch over and over again because the story-line is quite basic and simple. I like how is wasn't filmed with a huge budget; I remember when I was younger, I thought it was filmed by high-school students. I also really enjoy how characters were based off multiple real people and how some of the most popular catchphrases were from real life. I think the director of this movie wanted to accurately portray reality and give people a different way to analyze reality. I think this movie is more directed to teens with the jokes and some of the content, but I do think certain adults would enjoy the movie. I definitely think that ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is a movie and not a film. A film is for educationally benefit, like a documentary, but a movie is mainly for pleasure; ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is for pleasure. Overall, I did like the movie and the jokes, but I would usually prefer to watch a different movie.",Napoleon Dynamite
620,rodrigoorozcom,Napoleon Dynamite,2,24 May 2016,"Napoleon Dynamite is a movie about a normal life in high school. If you would like to watch movie and fall asleep, this is the movie you are looking for. There are not incredible things on the movie, it just shows Napoleon's life. Napoleon is not popular, shy , boring, etc. He and his family are not a ""normal family"". There are few entertainment parts of the movie, like when Napoleon and Kip start fighting. That is really funny regarding that normal fights are not like that, they fight open handed like babies. When their uncle comes over, he is telling them about his high school (his highest point in his life, he loved it and miss it) and how he used to throw the ball. Another boring person there is Pedro, the Mexican guy, he is kind of like Napoleon. Kip goes with his girlfriend to some place, Pedro ends up with his family and Napoleon ends up with his girlfriend. at the end of the movie his uncle is in his car throwing the ball and a girl come, nobody knows who she is.",Napoleon Dynamite
621,hduggan-99735,You think anybody wants a roundhouse kick to the face while I'm wearing these bad boys? Forget about it.,9,15 June 2016,"I have loved this movie ever since I first came across it one sunny afternoon while I was channel surfing and procrastinating my homework. I didn't know what I was getting myself into, but I'm sure glad I got into it because by the end of the movie I was killing myself with laughter. This movie isn't like mainstream Hollywood films, and it definitely isn't like any of those independent movies that get your mind spinning with inspiration. It's just a simple story about a high school kid living in Middle America with his older brother, his grandma, and his llama. After watching the movie, I fell instantly in love and it became one of my all time favourites. It's one of those movies you watch at the end of a bad day, or the end of a great one, or while you're cleaning your room or doing the dishes; It's really just one of those movies where when the name pops up on your TV guide, you can't help but smile and press the OK button on your remote. With all that being said, I was quite disappointed to hear that a rather large number of people don't share the same feelings as me. A lot of people find the movie to be pointless and boring; they say that the movie has no direction and that they don't get it. What they don't understand is that there's nothing to get. The movie isn't meant to have a hidden message that answers one of life's greatest dilemmas. It wasn't made to get people thinking, it was made to stop people from thinking. Napoleon Dynamite was made to entertain people, to get them laughing, and every time I watch it it does just that.",Napoleon Dynamite
622,harkinshailey,I didn't like this movie,3,1 June 2016,Personally I wasn't a big fan of this movie. I found there wasn't anything to get in this movie and there wasn't any point. I didn't like how mellowed toned everyone talked it made me want to fall asleep. This movie overall didn't appeal to me and it didn't keep me interested. All the characters seemed really flat and boring. I think the director was trying to set a laidback/relaxed mood and I do think that they were successful considering I wanted to fall asleep. I think this film is targeted to tweens and younger kids because I think that because It has such a simple plot and the kids won't get lost is a long complicated plot. I think this is more considered a movie because it is for entertainment and doesn't have a educational meaning.,Napoleon Dynamite
623,saffyhowell,A family favourite,10,6 May 2020,"This film is our family's go to movie! With such a low budget Napoleon Dynamite proves that you don't need award winning actors or Hollywood budgets to create a movie that people love. When showing it to others I have noticed that it may require a certain type of humour which is why people may not have understood it and therefore lowering its average score. However, it's extremely clever and gives you characters and lines to remember and laugh at whatever age you are. The soundtrack also adds heart to the film!",Napoleon Dynamite

Pedro decides to run for president, but even in that he just mumbles through a speech and has Napolean do a dance. It has a few amusing moments but really it made me almost fall asleep. It's a movie you can borrow from a friend if you really feel the need. Joe Heder is pretty good I guess as Napolean, who's part is so dull you can't tell if he's doing a good job or not.Overall: 3/10.",Napoleon Dynamite
625,Shadowhardt,Worst excuse of a comedy,1,20 August 2006,"I watched this movie with high expectations, everyone i know has said that this movie was a classic comedy such as ""Zoolander"" and most movies featuring the ""Frat Pack"". So i borrowed it from a friend and prepared myself for a great comedy, i was seriously disappointed. The movie was slow, boring, and the parts that were supposed to be funny were clearly not. Line such as ""Gosh"" and ""Freakin Idiot"" which most people found utterly hilarious only made me raise my eyebrows and shake my head. It wasn't witty or well written, but it wasn't slapstick either, in fact it is the poorest excuse for a comedy i've ever seen. Things such as ""Vote for Pedro"" which everyone seems to have on their shirts these days were just not funny at all, in fact everything about Pedro was just lame. It seems that the movie is set around the eighties or early nineties because of the terrible fashion sense and music used. But uncle Ricco is always going on about the eighties hinting that it is set more towards modern times, how does that explain the retro fashion used be EVERYONE! I can't see how so many people love this movie and how it comes so highly recommend but it does so i guess it really is a matter of opinion, but still come on this was just bad, if you want to see a decent movie try looking in the COMEDY section.",Napoleon Dynamite
626,cegentner,A very different sense of humor.,8,1 May 2018,"To find this film funny, you have to have to understand the unique sense of humor that it utilizes. It doesn't have a real plot that the audience can follow, and that's because it the events that occur aren't actually all that interesting. What makes it a funny movie are the characters and their personalities. It's honestly a big risk to make, because there's no guarantee that the general public will enjoy this type of humor, and the producers are actually very lucky that enough people made it as big of a hit as it is. 
The humor used is a different and unique type of mood, all coming from one-liners and character traits. This is a movie that I personally quote all the time; every time I hear the name Tina I think of the llama, and whenever I see a tetherball I think of this movie. These aren't jokes that just anyone would find funny, but if you have a weird and quirky sense of humor, Napoleon and Pedro will be your best friends.",Napoleon Dynamite

This film was so painful I thought I might have to gouge out my own eyes. No discernible plot. No decent dialog. Definitely not funny. I laughed only at the point where I thought I was going to lose my mind from boredom. The actors were good at portraying very strange individuals, though. The lead actor (Napoleon) and his buddy Pedro were excellent at portraying a couple of spaced-out geeks in high school. It was also nice to see Tina Majorina all grown up from her frequent roles in the early 90s. So, unless you're extremely bored and have a few bucks to blow on one and a half hours of your life you will never get back, I would urge you not to waste your time on this movie.

This movie is by far more fun to quote than it is to watch. It's hilarious out-of-context, but not worth sitting down for an hour and a half to watch.

The ""funniest movie ever made"" fell flat on its face. I laughed a total of twice, one where he tried to feed a llama camel thing a steak, and the other when he hurt himself trying to jump a ramp on his bike, and I think that was only because he got hurt. I can't give it a one, because it did make me laugh a couple times, but frankly what this movie comes down to is being a fad.

This movie like that steaming pile of crap nacho libre is boring with little or no plot. There's so many others movies that you could watch I could list them but it would take forever. What don't I like about this movie hmm it made me want to go read a book it was so stupid. It had little or no plot and lacks any enthusiasm from the actors. It was like the actors wanted the scene to be over so they can go do something more worth while. The scenes that were so amped up by my stupid friends were dashed by actually watching the damn thing. It was either going to see this or batman begins and I chose this and I still regret not seeing batman instead I've seen it since then but I'm still mad. Now overall I find one good thing about this movie um it makes me want to be less stupid which is a good thing I guess.

""Napoleon Dynamite"" is a severe insult of the audience's intelligence, and so many unfortunate people have been completely and totally duped.The direction is a bore, with its long pauses in dialogue and non-realistic delivery of lines. There is no real plot, and the screenplay could have been written by the most popular nine-year-old on the playground. This is not a real portrayal of awkwardness. This is the way a bully would make fun of an awkward person. The jokes are so dry they could be powder, and there is unnecessary racial profiling that comes along with the African-American and Latin characters.All-in-all, those of you who see ""Napoleon Dynamite"" as a three-star film (which is a dramatic rating, considering that such cinematic masterpieces as ""Amistad"" and ""Goodfellas"" have been rated three stars), you have had the wool pulled over your eyes. Liking this movie will not make you different, nor will it make you intelligent. Quite possibly, it will make you seem less intelligent.

I had fully planned to jump on-line while she watched, instead I found myself laughing all the way through, and am actually planning to buy the DVD. I finally made it on-line all right--I must have spent a good 2 hours (so far) surfing for whatever I can find about this refreshingly hopeful movie that deserves every dollar it earns.I'm not big on gross-out humor and couldn't be paid to watch anything with""American Pie"" in the title. I don't really know what I expected, all I know is what I found was making me grin randomly throughout the day @ work, and I'm an administrator at a bank. I haven't so thoroughly ENJOYED a movie in a really long time--and I don't even know why. GOSH! I think it's gentleness was very appealing to me. It was amazing to see Napoleon's character be so true to himself throughout the movie, whether this was intended or not. I thought it interesting that a previous comment referred to his ""mean-spiritedness""--I may be out of touch, but I picked up on nothing even close to that. His ability to be loyal and to try to do the right thing when it counted far out-weighed his haphazardly abrupt comments, ""Whatever I want to do--GOSH!' moments. And in today's culture where there is such a societal fear of: a. being different or b. people who ARE different, how novel it was to watch the events unfold in Napoleon's life and to know he had absolutely NO plans to construct a semi-automatic from a kit out behind the llama shed. He was simply himself, and made no apologies (nor collected any real resentments) for it. A few things happen in the movie that aren't really explained in any further detail--I don't know about you, but for me, that's kind of the way my life plays out, too.I hope to see more of this character in future ""installments"".

But how this endless, plot less, pointless film could have gathered a following without the director physically holding a gun to someone's head just seems impossible.There is not a single even mildly funny moment, the parts which should have been funny were presented in such a slow and ponderous way that all the humour was sucked out slowly and painfully. Just like the plot, which basically doesn't exist.I wish I could fill this review with expository spoilers, but there's simply nothing to spoil, and I can't ask you to watch the film to see for yourself because you'll simply come out, like me, coming out wishing you had done something more constructive with the last two hours; like hunting down and shooting everyone involved in the production of this movie. In fact, I only wish I could give it a minus rating.Even with the worst films that I've seen there's always been at least one positive I can think of, with Napoleon Dynamite there's nothing, just a deep anger that the movie exists. I'm not an angry person but this film brings it out in me.",Napoleon Dynamite
645,seoxys,crappiest movie ever made. boring and stupid.,1,10 May 2008,"This is by far the crappiest movie I've ever seen, with the possible exception of ""Shadow Man"" which I didn't even bother watching to the end.This movie is boring and slow. Awkward, and really not funny. It looks and feels like a movie made 20 years ago by some college kid, with crappy boring actors who have next to no talent.The technical aspects of the movie are fine: good camera-work, perfect image, perfect sound. However it is the content, or rather the lack of it, that bothers me so much.I was literally dying of boredom during the whole movie. The fact that every character is a total disgusting weirdo loser makes this movie even worse.Napoleon actually seemed mentally retarded, standing like a moron saying ""gosh, frickin idiot, retard"" with no expression.This was a total waste of my time, and I had to ask for my money back.",Napoleon Dynamite
646,cameronsawyer,Paradoxically Brilliant,9,4 February 2018,"This movie really should have been bad. Low budget, no cast, almost no plot, yet it comes through in a big way. I've probably seen this movie 20 times and have not grown tired of it. The tone of the writing is so weird and spot on to rural Idaho. Napoleon is a loveable character who just wants to be somebody. And the aesthetics in this movie are so good. To top it off, it's just a freaking funny movie. It's the kind of movie that makes you wish Hollywood would take more chances. I love it so much.",Napoleon Dynamite
647,gerarddesign,an absolute gem,10,12 July 2008,"this is a modern gem. i found the whole thing hilarious and at the same time moving.first of all i'm not some teenager from America who just likes the fact Napoleon's an idiot (although that it's very funny). I'm sure before this movie got backing from MTV it was never about that. this movie is funny on many subtle levels, it refrains from too much physical humour, and keeps a solid plot line throughout. it can be seen from many angles; the majority like this movie because Napoleon is an idiot and his struggle through life is funny, other people like it because you see an interesting and funny few months of Napoleons life.if your like me you will feel sad at the end of this, because it is such a moving and at the same time hilarious movie. and thats hard to find these days.",Napoleon Dynamite
648,Fenix82,This is in my Top 10 list.,10,10 April 2009,"I love this movie. It's a shame so many people rated this movie down because they don't like the story. Well, there is no real storyline, that is for sure. It's all about these unique characters and they are not involved in a real plot, heading from A to B.And the characters in fact are the reason why Napoleon Dynamite is so great. These guys are totally refreshing. They are nerdy from tip to toe and just don't care. Napoleon for instance, wears moon-boots to school. How cool is that?In the first scene, when Napoleon enters the bus, there is this little boy, asking him ""What are you going to do today, Napoleon?"". They way he looks at Napoleon is the exact way I would look at him. I could not wait to see what he is going to do next. Not to laugh at him, just to watch him do profane stuff normal people just wouldn't dare. Like throwing the He-Man out of the window. Again, how cool is that?The acting is superb thru'out the whole movie. The characters have been casted very well. Though Jon Heders performance is great but the real star for me is Uncle Rico. Jon Gries is amazing!!! KUDOS to him. When he threw the steak at Napoleon I nearly wet my pants. The succeeding monologue was acted so brilliant. ""I bet I can throw a football over the mountain.""But not just the main cast acted flawless. Even the least actors were great. The couple uncle Rico wants to sell this 24 piece set, Pedros cousins with the sweet hook ups, Lafawnduh. And Rex. Oh boy, don't get me started on Rex. ""Do you think I got where I am today because I dress like Peter Pan here?"" KUDOS to Diedrich Bader. And Tina Majorino is just sweet. *kiss*I wish there were more movies like this. I wish there were more Napoeon Dynamites out there, instead of all those Brad P. wannabees. But I guess the motto ""be happy with who you are"" just doesn't sell enough s***.I'm working hard on becoming a N.D. myself. Not yet there but still trying.Yours truly, Fenix82",Napoleon Dynamite

Many said that they almost died laughing while others said that they almost died of boredom. Personally, I enjoyed this movie. It's true that this movie isn't a cinematic masterpiece, but it's not trying to be. It's just a movie that wants to entertain its viewer with silly humor and hilarious characters. If you go into this movie thinking that it will be a deep comedy with social commentary, you will think this is the worst movie ever made, but if you go into this movie thinking that you will be entertained with good simple humor, you will have a lot of fun watching this off-beat film.",Napoleon Dynamite

Like Office Space, or Garden State, this movie perfects humor in that it completely escorts your mind to another state of thinking for the duration of the film. This movie is filmed in a way that makes it unique and genius. When I walked into Hot Topic and saw that they had paraphernalia from this movie, I thought ""oh god, but at least this means the kiddies will be seeing something decent."" Watch it, own it, love it. It is DYNAMITE!! The movie is creative, ridiculous, hilarious, real, and fantastical.",Napoleon Dynamite
653,dimplemonkey,What a refreshing film!,10,23 October 2004,"I had no idea what to expect when I first saw Napoleon Dynamite except that it had the beginnings of something I thought I wasn't going to like. Napoleon is a typical loser at first glance. He's not very respected in his high school and his aspirations are low key. This is not your typical nerd triumph, per se. This actually hits the mark and I am glad I remained for the rest of picture.Napoleon is surrounded by a wonderful balance of characters. Each with their own ideologies about life yet they intertwine with his. I didn't really sense any chemistry between him and Pedro or even the rest of his family and friends, but then is not life scripted this way? The high school was not packed with Hollywood hotties or WB jocks or even ""Revenge of the Nerds"" like geeks, they were regular people! What a concept? Yes, Summer was cute, but she wasn't a Hilary or Lindsay type girl - and that's a good thing! Her boyfriend wasn't sporting a six pack or striking looks, but he was still good looking for the part. Even the nerd and the bully were OK. It's just like I remember them when I was in high school.This is a great film. It breaks the stereotypes and shows it as it would be without the slick polished look of other films in this genre.",Napoleon Dynamite
654,egp10990,This was unbearable.,1,12 August 2005,"I can say in all honesty that this was the most awful, unbearable movie I have ever seen in my life-and that's being nice. It's a shame that it isn't in the bottom 10 of IMDb.com! I think we need to work together to get it there. Instead, you people have rated it higher then, say, Mean Girls, which actually had laughs and a plot? It seems like everyone around me has lost their sense of humor! The story line was awful- in fact, I still can't figure out what the plot is supposed to be. I guess that he helps his friend win class president or something? In all honesty, I could not sit through more than an hour of the movie. I mean, I did, but my mind was somewhere else towards the end. I didn't laugh once throughout the whole thing. If that is comedy, then I guess Lord of the Rings is a chick-flick?? Oh yeah one more thing- DON'T VOTE FOR PEDRO!",Napoleon Dynamite
655,slodaddio,This one's sure to be a classic.,10,23 May 2004,"I went into an advanced screening not knowing what to expect--and that's probably the best way to experience this (or any great) film, should the hype make your expectations exceedingly high, thereby leading to inevitable disappointment (So, dear readers, ignore my acclaim and go into this movie believing it to be a mediocre effort). I have a hunch that the buzz from this film is going to be strong and, whether or not it's strongly marketed, the word of mouth alone should give it some legs and make it a classic, if not a cult-classic.Simply put, this is one of the funniest, quirky and original movies that I have ever seen. I feel that it effectively captures the painful (and hilarious) awkwardness of adolescence in much the same way as Rushmore or the much-acclaimed television series Freaks and Geeks. It's been compared to Welcome to the Dollhouse as well.The characters are all fully realized, with the exception of the popular kids, who don't really matter anyway since the geeks rule in this film(well, sort of--when they're not being slammed against lockers and coerced into giving up their bikes). I especially like Napolean, who demonstrates an interesting admixture of abject cluelessness and smug self-assurance. In a way he is slightly askew and awkward, but in other ways he represents someone we should aspire to be--pure in purpose and spirit and a beacon of hope amid dire circumstances. There are several other highly memorable characters, but instead of getting into their collective pathos, let me just strongly encourage you to go see this timeless gem of a film. You'll be pleasantly amused.",Napoleon Dynamite
656,kemberm,worst 82 minutes that I've spent in a long time,4,14 January 2005,"While the movie wasn't the worst, it was definitely the worst I've seen in a while. The combination of absurd comedy and lack of composition really turned me away from this movie. There were some funny parts, but they didn't account for the remainder of the film. I seem to remember on one of the IMDb daily polls for the most hyped up movie of 2004, Napoleon Dynamite was either at the top of the list, or one of the top 3, and I see why. I am glad that I didn't have to pay for this movie. I came across it from a friend who said it was one of the funniest movies they've ever seen, however I don't share this same thought. Unfortunately, I don't think that I would ever pay money to watch this movie again.",Napoleon Dynamite
657,Tony-B4,Painful,2,24 August 2007,"This has to be the lamest movie I've ever seen. Scenes that were supposed to be funny were just plain sad or painful. The characters were not at all sympathetic, just lame. And the plot development was slower than a glacier.The plot meanders quite a bit, basically just showing scenes of just how pitifully outcast Napoleon is. He drags an action figure behind his school bus for no apparent reason. He tries to feed his grandmother's pet llama leftover casserole by flinging the food over the fence. His brother spends the entire day chatting with women in Internet chat rooms. His uncle (who takes over guardianship when Grandma is injured on a date) is a former high school second-string quarterback who keeps dwelling on his potential glory if he'd been put into play a crucial game 20 years ago. The whole town is full of such dull stereotypes. If I were the state of Idaho (where this is supposedly set), I'd sue.I had to stop watching this movie because of an overall sense that I was wasting 2 hours of my life that I could've used watching paint dry. The latter would've been more exciting, funny, and dramatically compelling.I saw this movie at home, not at a theatre. But I can't imagine that even a theatre full of people would laugh at anything in this stagnant movie. I'd demand my rental money back, but I checked it out for free at the public library. Maybe I'll burn my library card instead.",Napoleon Dynamite

I fell asleep within the first 5 minutes and was woken up twice more. I did not once laugh!!It was so ridiculously boring....i felt like my brain had dropped to a level as low as an American brain. This had no humour in it whatsoever!! It had no plot, it had nothing!! If anything, the only good thing is the main actor is a very good actor, especially considering for the first half of the movie i was under the impression that he was mentally handicapped and it isn't easy to act as if your a 'retard' convincingly.This movie just proves my point that Americans are by far the dumbest people on earth. They lack the capability to appreciate anything with culture or with real entertainment.I honestly found this to be the absolute worst movie ever made. I'm glad it did not get nominated for any Oscars, and i am shocked it did not get nominated for any Razzies.It's because its even too low for Razzies. This is a disgrace to humankind and it is a true reflection of how state of humankind is on a decline.Poor poor fools who enjoyed this film....i pity you!!

660,JoshRoessler,"A Well-Marketed (but rather average, quality-wise) Movie",5,13 June 2004,"I have a theory at how the creators of this movie decided to make this film, and it's really just that--a complete theory.I think that someone saw Jon Heder and said to themselves, ""That guy is instant comedy. He doesn't even have to do anything."" And for certain scenes in this movie, they'd be right. A sequence where he breaks out his funky dance moves is hilarious, as is his very intonation, at times, and his physical acting. And there are bits of funny dialogue that he is given at different points in the movie as well.This film also has some quite interesting, random and quirky characters besides Napoleon, and each of them has their moment to shine.But really, that's what this movie is: moments. There is very little real plot or story arc. We don't really see the characters grow or change. Stuff happens to them and they react to it, that's basically it. There's no real overarching theme, either. I've seen it suggested that ""awkwardness"" is the thematic point of the movie, but that's ridiculous, and NOT a theme. It's akin to saying, ""My theme is love."" It means nothing.So what are we left with? Moments. Some great comedic scenes here and there that don't really add up to anything more. It's rare that I've seen a movie try to be so self-consciously uncool, with the underlying message seeming to be, ""See how not cool I am? Pretty cool, huh?"" What's more disturbing is that people have bought into it so easily, so much so that many of the people in the crowd where I watched it seemed to be in love with the movie before it began. The simple fact of a movie being different does NOT make it good.For me, this movie doesn't rate much better than a renter, and I think you'd be better served checking out Welcome to the Dollhouse, Rushmore, or even 80's John Hughes movies.",Napoleon Dynamite

Much to my horror, my children called me back into the room to tell me there was more. It pained me to go back to watch another minute. The biggest laugh I had all night was reading some of these reviews. If anyone tells you this is the best movie they ever saw, their IQ is a double digit.

Thankfully I chose to give it a 2nd viewing and am baffled at how I didn't recognize the brilliance of Napolean Dynamite. This is a terrific film and an impressive debut(quasi-debut) for Jared Hess. Interestingly enough, I found a lot of similarities to this film and Bottle Rocket, formally and contextually. I can only hope that with experience and bigger budgets; Hess's career will bloom like that of Wes Anderson's, who may I add is a god amongst men. I will agree with others that the humor here is certainly an acquired taste, but for those of you who were untouched by this film the first time around, i'd strongly recommend a second chance. 8.2/10",Napoleon Dynamite

(Ferris Bueller, Animal House, Monty Python's....) None of these were exactly what ND is but I hope you get the picture. The other point I want to make is how happy we all should be that this generation has been given a fantastic piece of film and humor without(sex, language, and nudity) Now I know that all of that has a place (Porky's) or maybe that little room in the back of the rental store but high schoolers can be entertained and made to laugh without resorting to such and for that along with the humor itself ND should be praised.",Napoleon Dynamite

There was a handful of laughs but the overwhelming awkwardness of the people, situations, and relationships was nearly unbearable. Doesn't everyone know somebody from high school that acts just like Mr. Dynamite? White trash, no fashion sense, social degenerate, chronic lack of visual appeal, fantasy geek, awkward to speak with, no visible skills, home life is less than desirable, no prospects... you get the point. 90% of the show I wondered, ""This can't possibly be going anywhere, can it?"" But when Napolean stretches his neck out for his friend at the end, you start to realize what it was all about. He was surrounded by mediocrity. There was nobody to lift him to greatness. His risk/sacrifice not only propelled his friend, but himself as well. A sub-theme seems to be that success can come from unconventional methods.

Unfortunately, it seems to have a special appeal for people (Family Guy fans?) who find incredible amusement in the hyper-mundane. When the friends of such zealous fans come along expecting grand comedy, it's no wonder there is disappointment.Napoleon Dynamite is not a hilarious movie. My impression is that it was not intended to be that. More, it is a kind of irony play on the tropes of the teen comedy genre. Hess turned Hollywood-plot style romanticism of adolescence on it's head by portraying it (by the numbers) with bumbling, and uncomfortably familiar, naturalism. I adore it, but it's no laugh riot.Napoleon Dynamite is something like Robert Altman's The Player. Both are unusually clever. Both are hugely popular with certain people.

Eventually, I had to give in to my slight curiosity.When I finally did see it, I was pleasantly surprised. It was very funny and down-to-earth. It showed the high school experience in a PG version from the perspective of the lowest people on the popularity scale- the geeks. I professed myself a geek until I saw Napoleon Dynamite and realized how not geeky I truly was.This movie appeals to all types of people and for different reasons. Sometimes, such as in my case, you find a character who is geekier then you are, which boosts your self-esteem up a notch. Maybe, in Napoleon Dynamite, you were able to find a character you can identify with. Or maybe, as in the case of most of America who saw this movie, you found it comedic and original. Whatever your opinion of Napoleon Dynamite, it has undeniably become one of the biggest hits of 2004. Napoleon Dynamite is the little indie that could. It was made for about $400, 000 and it grossed $43.1 million at the box office. This movie has also spawned catchphrases such as ""Whatever I want to do, Gosh!"" Bottom line: It's a pretty good quirky comedy that focuses on the importance of friendship. I encourage those who have not seen it to see it and form their own opinion.",Napoleon Dynamite

My friend is obsessed with this movie, and I try to show him movies like Dogma and The Royal Tenenbaums, but he says they are too slow. How can anyone think Dogma is slower than this? I have no problem with B movies, and I love independent movies. Snakes on a plane was WAY better than this, and I just don't see what the big deal is with Jon Heder. He ruined his life because he will never play a different character. Those are my 2 cents on the piece of crap that is Napoleon Dynamite. (oh, and Jack Black saved Nacho Libre)",Napoleon Dynamite

His one liners and stupid remarks are just one of the funniest things out there! But my all time favorite person in the movie is Napoleon's even nerdier brother, Aaron Ruell, also known as Kip. He is the coolest nerd brother anyone could ask for. He chats with babes and aspires to be a cage fighter... how cool is that? Don't listen to the non believers of this movie, who say that is has no point and it's not even funny. I give them that it doesn't really have that clear of a plot, that it is just thrown together and it's stupid, but that's what makes it funny, the stupidity!

673,arewehavingfunyet,More like a collection of short films,8,3 August 2005,"""Napoleon Dynamite"" is, in all respects, a very funny movie. However, it lacks cinematic construction and composition. Many scenes in the film stray from the story and do not affect the outcome either way, they are simply unnecessary. Even though the movie made very little sense to me, I still found myself coming back for more, watching it several times in one week. As stated in the summary, the film is more like a short film collection. It seems the story is rolling along nicely and then spliced right in the middle of it we get a short scene that is irrelevant to the movie. It's monotonous and repetitive. But, it's hilarious at the same time. I can't really say why I think this movie is so funny, but once you see it you'll understand.",Napoleon Dynamite
674,ironskeletor,What a travesty!,1,9 February 2005,"Where to begin... Let's start out by mentioning that this film has absolutely no plot. It's like some bad miniseries, every 15 minutes the focus changes, leaving the viewer wondering what the hell's going on. I'd also like to point out that I only watched this film because all my friends raved and said it was hilarious. Hardy har har. 90 minutes later and not a single laugh even thought of escaping my lips. What tries to pass off as a joke is simply the main character getting frustrated with those around him, spewing retard catch-phrases like 'God!' and 'Idiots!'. Of course, the script sucks as well. Early on in the film, the main character is informed that his grandmother was injured and can no longer look after him. This would be sad... if they had even MENTIONED the grandmother before now. Soon after you realize that the purpose of this maneuver was to introduce Uncle Rico, someone who (if possible) is actually stupider than Napoleon himself. And it's not like Rico brings anything to the party. Neither he or any of the other actors in the film have the slightest bit of acting talent. But of course, the writers didn't want us to leave with good memories of the film. The last scene shows us a very touching game of tetherball in a deserted schoolyard. Hooray for them. I guess if there's a moral it's that you shouldn't give budgets to shitty film ideas like this, and you shouldn't give the budget-giving authority to someone who'll misuse it.",Napoleon Dynamite

I was a dweeb (although I can't remember what we called it back then). My bottled water guy was NUTS over this movie. He saw it four times and bought it the first day it was on sale. We frequently share taste in movies, so I rented it. Now, I laugh more than anyone I know, so I expected to laugh during this movie. To be fair, I did laugh a few times. However, as much as I wanted to like it, I was simply bored. I kept waiting for the ""punch line"" so to speak. I have no ill will toward the movie or the people who loved it, but I just don't think I ""get"" the movie. Sometimes, I guess that's just the way it is. I'm so happy for the folks who loved it, but I can surely understand those who didn't. I'm kind of sad that it didn't work for me. :-(",Napoleon Dynamite

I honestly haven't stopped thinking how brilliant this film is (I've seen it twice) and have even had a dream where Napoleon and I owned a Japanese restaurant together..but I digress...I am honestly so inspired by this film as it's so smart the way it pretty much makes fun of the main characters (the dorky Napoleon, Kip and Pedro) yet it never gets really cruel, on the contrary, you end up loving them. Speaking of loving, I LOVED the language and dislodge in general, all the 'hecks' 'dangs' 'idiots' 'GOSHes!'and, of course, Napoleon's anguished sighs. To me this film was a Daniel Clowes comic (Ghost World - Eightball etc) come to life, especially Pedro (who actually looked like Clowes drew him) - much more than the movie version of Ghost World...Jon Heder is AMAZING! I can't believe he's actually good looking in real life..Just a gorgeous, laugh out loud yet subtle film.",Napoleon Dynamite

It is absolutely hilarious, there was basically no flaw I encountered while watching this. One strong part of this film is Napolean's dialogue, his sarcastic tone of voice alone is probable one of the strongest parts in this film, this is also one of those memorable films such as ""office Space"", where you can't help but quote the lines from time to time. Another memorable aspect is the characters which I will not spoil for you.Well the story center's around a teenager named Napolean Dynamite. He is one of those dorky like kids who acts quite sarcastic pretty much all the time. Since I don't feel like giving away much about this film to you you'll just have to see for yourself. 10 out of 10, this is definitely not a film to pass up.",Napoleon Dynamite

I just don't understand why people enjoyed this movie so much. It wasn't funny, it wasn't entertaining, the only thing that my friends and i could come up with is that it made people feel better about themselves.If that's what people want from a movie, then they should stick to movies starring Carrot Top or Franky Muniz. This movie won 10 awards including a best picture. That surprised me. I wasn't surprised that it won best picture from the people who produced the f'ing thing. anyone else put that together. it won best picture at the MTV entertainment awards, THEY MADE THE MOVIE! DOES THAT MAKE SENSE TO ANYONE ELSE! This movie got far too much credit. IMDb should put a zero rating for the vote panel, we can call it the napoleon level. The only other movies that will accompany this abysmal movie will be those starring jean-claude van dam, and that Russian guy from Rocky 4. Those of you who claim to enjoy this movie, you really don't. your brain is dead. Stop listening to what MTV says is funny and make that decision for yourself.

Now (if you can) project yourself into a strange way of thinking. A NEW path. 'How about...' (and here it goes) 'films are actually made for...wait...no, I think I know...anyone who likes them?'

When I first saw it with my friend Megan, half way through the movie she turned to me and said, ""This movie has no point whatsoever."" Every time you watch it, it just keeps getting better. You can see the parts coming, and that alone is enough to crack yourself up.At school - people go around quoting Napoleon all the time. Imagine sitting in french class. The teacher calls on a kid that you've barely ever talked to, and under his breathe you're the only one who can hear, ""GOD, you're ruining my life!"" in that oh-so-nice Napoleon charm.

I heard all of the buzz surrounding this film, so I decided to check it out. This is undoubtedly one of the WORST movies I have ever witnessed in my life, and I have seen plenty of movies. Personally, I think that the acting is horrible, directing is atrocious, and just the whole film is one I think should be forgotten in the future, and once it is, I don't think it should re-mastered or anything, it should just simply go ""away and never return"". Napolean Dynamite sets a BAD example for everyone, it allows for stereotypes that this nation should be breaking down, and the drug usage? No wonder there is such a surge in paraphernalia usage because ""gosh"" nobody can think for themselves and must follow a ridiculous and horrid character that is Napolean Dynamite.",Napoleon Dynamite
682,california_mcw,Brilliant and Clever,10,20 December 2004,"""Napoleon Dynamite"" is a very wonderful movie. It is extremely clever and very well-portrayed. It depicts a young man, Napoleon in a typical high school. However, Napoleon is 'featured' as the person who just doesn't quite fit into the social structure of life.{Possible SPOILER) He becomes friends with a young man named Pedro. Together, they make a dynamic duo. (More SUMMARY) Both actors portray their characters extremely well. There is a realism to how this can relate to any high school in any town, in the nation.High school can be an interesting place. . . and a place to find yourself. ""Napoleon Dynamite"" was an exciting movie that had the right blend of comedy, realism, and excitement.All of the actors really played their parts very well. Check out this movie! It is definitely one of the more realistic movies that show a deeper portrayal of how a movie can be made without all the glamour and glitz.All a movie needs is a bit of chemistry... and ""Napoleon Dynamite"" has chemistry from the opening credits to the final scene.",Napoleon Dynamite
683,christopher-conklin,"Sure to Be Just Another Cult Favorite ""B"" Movie",5,14 January 2005,"With terrible acting, a layman simple plot, and mediocre production quality, Napoleon Dynamite seems like a terrible movie. However, occasional spritzes of brilliance by the actors and comical scenes make the film what it is: one really long Saturday Night Live sketch. Definitely worth renting to cure boredom, but save yourself the twenty bucks and steer clear of the DVD. Very easy for everyone to relate to, but the humor in this film is hit or miss. MTV Films has not been known for cinematic excellence and Napoleon Dynamite is no exception, however, it is sure to find its niche as a cult favorite ""B"" movie in with the likes of Office Space. Jon Heder is perfect in his emotionless, plain john role and there are instances in the movie that are simply hilarious.

Hesitantly, I decided to check it out, and believe me, that was the smartest decision I ever made. This movie has a certain...unique sense of humor that only the most sophisticated of minds can even hope to understand. Really, this movie has no equal, but if I had to it would be Drop Dead Gorgeous. It has the same sort of humor in a lot of it, only cleaner, no swearing, etc. Probably the best thing about it though is the title character. Just the way he IS is so awesome! He talks with his eyes closed and he draws mythical creatures like Ligers and he has a big IL' FRO. Too cool. I would also compare this to the website www.homestarrunner.com.

Napoleon leads his friend Pedro to victory in the school elections for class president. The humor in this is beyond compare. Sadly, though, many think it is just stupid. I think that in order to really enjoy this movie, you need to understand where Napoleon is coming from, hence the fact that all nerds will enjoy this movie!

686,hurleylocker,The Plot that wasn't there,1,9 March 2005,"From its non-sequitor opening credits sequence until its out-of-place finale, Napoleon Dynamite fails to impress me. The plot (should I even call it that?) concerns Napoleon, an anti-social geek who lives with his older brother Chip. When eccentric new kid Pedro arrives Napoleon befriends him and eventually tries to help him run for class president. Along the way, Napoleon has to deal with other eccentric people like his conceited Uncle Rico who comes to live with him. None of these people I can relate to. An essential element in an interesting movie is a developing plot. It would be nice if this movie even had plot at all. Too much of the film is spent watching Napoleon in various awkward situations, with Napoleon never looking at the people he's talking to. In a movie you should be able to relate to the characters. In Napoleon Dynamite it seems as though all the characters are surrounded by an invisible bubble which no one can enter. The actors also seem not able to enter that bubble, robotically delivering their lines with thin confidence and uneasy stares. After all my harsh criticism, you'd think never to watch it. But that's not the case for most littler kids who absorb the non-sequitor humor like a sponge, not caring about plot or character development. Even my friends criticize me for not worshiping this film like they do but I stand firm on my position: Stay away from Napoleon Dynamite, it's one of the worst movies ever made. And I've seen ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"".",Napoleon Dynamite

After hearing about it at work and not getting any of the supposed inside jokes that were flying around, I decided to see this movie. What followed was fifteen minutes of sitting there, amazed that I had wasted so much of my precious young life. The characters are barely 2-dimensional, boring, whiny, and lacking in any sort of an ironic undertone that would normally make this kind of movie funny, or at least watchable. The events are simply not funny, and not connected with any sort of either empathy with the main character or hatred for him; Just... nothingness.

What I love about it most is the unself-consciousness of the characters. They are who they are independent of who might judge them and of their own self-judgement. There is a profound freedom in not labelling oneself and in being unaware of others' labels for you. Similarly, they are very self-accepting and very accepting of others. These characters gave me hope, a totally different take on the movie than others who found it mean-spirited or uninspiring. I found it endearing and inspiring.",Napoleon Dynamite

Different people enter the movie and the dialogue is terrific. Any fan of a dialogue based comedy will love this movie. This movie really has no point but acting is great and the overall feel of the movie is fresh. I personally look forward to more great comedy from the directors. Of course this movie is a comedy but they tackle some hefty issues with the use of laughter.

No matter where you go you can always here those memorable quotes from Napoleon and his friends. I have seen the movie twice and in my English class alone, people have seen it even more than that. I honestly can't say I even remember hearing about the movie when it was in theaters, but around December the buzz hit our school. I had known that my brother had seen it and thought it was hilarious, but I really hadn't heard anything about it from my friends. For Christmas my sister received the movie as a present. My family watched it together and that is when I fell in love with the movie. It almost seemed that while I was watching the movie it was humorous, but I became a Napoleon wannabe after seeing the movie and thinking back to what happened. After discussing the movie with friends, I have realized I wasn't the only one who thought it was funnier the second time you see it. I guess it's just one of those movies where the more you watch it, the better it becomes. Like I said earlier, Napoleon has hit our high school like a bad case of the flu and it seems like everyone who has seen the movie all the way through can't get those witty quotes out of their heads.",Napoleon Dynamite

There is almost nothing offensive. You will never forget Napolean, Kip, Pablo, Deb, or even scheming Rico. I thought it was just going to be a stupid cult thing, that was pointless and mindless, but when my friend came back from winter break after watching it 4 times in 2 weeks (and this guy hates virtually every movie ever made, I couldn't resist.

694,UTAnthony80,Stays with you,9,2 March 2005,"Napoleon Dynamite isn't a great comedy, nor is it particularly clever. Rather, it's a movie that stays with you once the dialogue starts to sink in and occupies a permanent place somewhere in your brain. And then you start to quote the movie like it has been your favorite almost your entire life, and thus you feel sucked into this ever growing arcane Napoleon Dynamite quoting cult where the touching idiosyncrasies of each character start to attach themselves to your eccentric, innate sense of fun and joy in life. ""Build her a cake or something!"" or ""But my lips hurt real bad!"" or ""This is pretty much the worst video ever made."" So don't expect anything hilariously original. Watch it a few times, seek others who have seen it, carry on an intelligent conversation about the war in Iraq or BTK and just try to restrain your urge to say ""Last week Japanese scientists explaced... placed explosive detonators at the bottom of Lake Lochness to blow Nessie out of the water.""",Napoleon Dynamite
695,freakoo23,Napoleon Dynamite Review,4,28 January 2005,"Napoleon Dynamite the film is much like the Napoleon Dynamite the character. It makes you laugh, it makes you smile, and sometimes it get soo boring and repetitive that it makes you fall asleep. While for awhile this movie passes for wildly funny, by the end, its barely alive. In fact, it slows down soooo dramatically after the first hour, that the person I was watching the movie with fell asleep. I barely managed to stick through it myself. But what I saw, for the most part I enjoyed. The film does a lot of things right, but I think it could have been a whole lot better.Napoleon (Heder) is a teenager who is not very popular at his school. In short, he is an absolute NERD. But not the cool kind of nerd like me or Tom, a nerd that everyone hates and has no friends. He lives at home with his Grandma and his older brother Kip. When Grandma takes off for a few days, Uncle Rico comes to take care of Napoleon and Kip, This makes for some funny moments, but eventually the whole story gets annoying. Napoleon soon meets the equally nerdy Deb (Majorino) and the two become friends. He also meets the new student Pedro and they also become friends. Then, after about an hour of being bored with the films lack of plot and wanting to sleep so desperately, you find out that Napoleon is going to help Pedro win the Class Presidency. The whole point is that the plot is so bad that you get extremely bored.The acting is good and I liked the music that went along with it. The fact that Napoleon and his family still live in the eighties is kind of weird and seems a little out of place. The thing that really holds back this movie is a lack of plot. There is nothing in the world that would really want me to watch this movie again. It has absolutely no replay value at all which is kind of sad considering how many people really liked this film.OVERALL THOUGHTS ON NAPOLEON DYNAMITE Entertainment: A few funny parts are all that save this otherwise dull movie: 5/10 Plot: Don't get me started, don't you even get me started..: 2/10 Acting: Actually pretty well done. 7/10 Music: Fun and upbeat. 7/10 Direction: Interesting and funny, but seriously...the eighties??: 6/10 Alberts Analysis: Kinda funny but mostly dull. 4/10",Napoleon Dynamite
696,claire-banks,Beautifully Done,9,17 January 2005,"I rolled up laughter at the ridiculous but quite realistic scenarios presented to us from Napoleon's world. I think this film has a little something for everyone, but only if you remember there's no traditional story to be told, its just a peek into this chap's life. I feel that many people will be able to identify with the characters, either through being them or knowing someone like them, regardless of nationality. Its that element of this film that reaches out to the audience and speaks volumes. The scenery and domestic settings for the film adds to the aspect that time is standing still in this town, so are the people. It also points out to the audience that life can be pretty absurd and hilarious occasionally. I recommend watching this on a lazy Sunday afternoon with a cup of tea and digestive biscuits! Heaven.",Napoleon Dynamite

I think this would be better as a made for a TV movie or a TV show. They shouldve made it more interesting it was just boring. Maybe if Napoleon fell in love or something. This movie is recommended for you if you like to laugh at stupid jokes and if you don't like to think hard at movies. I like movies that are not predictable and that make me think. This is just not that type of movie. Sure, the quotes were funny but there was barely any dialog in the first place! It was like watching a funny nerd and his Mexican friend (talking about girls they like and watching them go on buses and talk to ""babes"" online) from school.

I don't mean to sound like a witch, but when I'm bored, I have to say that laughing at someone else (especially nerds) can be entertaining! I mean, who doesn't like a good laugh at someone else's actions once in a while? However, I will say that this movie is not for everyone. The humor is dry, very dry in fact, and the viewer is left to figure out which parts are hilarious and which ones are not. ""Napoleon Dynamite"" also uses slap-stick comedy...something you don't see very often in the movies today. And the things that Napoleon says...they are just too random! I happen to have a great sense of humor (and not a large ego, thank you), so I found this movie absolutely hilarious! Especially near the end...The cinematography is excellent as well because it enhances the look of a small town in Idaho (Preston, to be exact) which, in the movie, seems to be stuck in a time warp. The acting is also great...you seem to think that Jon Heder really is a nerd in reality!

I didn't wanna watch it at first cause I kind of got the wrong impression of it from what I had heard. But one day my sister asked me to only watch the beginning, then I was hooked. I love it because it is so pointless and slow. It is one of those movies that will give you and your friends a lot of inside jokes. A lot of Napoleon's little sayings could be used in our daily lives so it is fun to use 'em with friends or siblings cause no matter how many times you've said them or how many times you've seen the movie, it will always be funny. I could watch it everyday. If you ever get the chance to watch it, do it. I have to admit, it's a movie that you will either absolutely love or absolutely hate. Just watch it. What do you have to lose? If you hate it, then you'll move on and find another movie to your liking. But if you love it, then you'll have another great movie to add to your collection. So if you like movies like ""Dumb And Dumber"", ""Dude Where's My Car"" or ""Harold And Kumar go to White Castle"", then you'll definitely like this one. ""They kept trying to attack my cousins. What the heck would you do in a situation like that?"" Oh Yeah...I Love Pedro!

""Why did that happen?"" ""What does that have to do with anything?"" ""Whats the point?"". So often during this movie things happen that have absolutely no relevance to anything, some scenes seem to just be there for the sake of it.Not once during the entire movie is there any emotion, any reason to like the characters, at no point does there appear to be an interesting part of the plot such as it is. It just struck me as a random collection of stuff, impersonating a movie, often I can see why some people would like a movie that I personally dislike. But in Napoleon Dynamite I see no redeeming factors.I laughed a couple of times, but not for very long or to the extent I laugh when I watch the Breakfast Club yet! again.Seriously, I cannot say anymore than this movie has absolutely no point to it, nothing comes of it, there's no reason to care what happens and the plot is barely visible amongst the utter irrelevance of many of the scenes.2/10.",Napoleon Dynamite

703,ennuiforlife,Napoleon Dynamite,9,13 February 2005,"Napoleon Dynamite; when you think of those two words you get conqueror and explosion. In this film Napoleon Dynamite is just that; a nerd who copes with his everyday pathetic, yet enlightening life. Through out this whole film different scenarios take place, which, to some viewers doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Yet at the same time you find yourself falling off your chair in laughter. Napoleon (Jon Heder), his brother kip (Aaron Ruell) and uncle Rico (Jon Gries) find themselves in the humorous corrals; bickering with each other over the most random of things. Seeing this movie six times, as I have, you will find yourself laughing at things you never saw the first few times. In this film Napoleon (Jon Heder), Deb (Tina Majorino) and Pedro (Efren Bader) become the closest of friends; from riding the ""sledgehammer"" (Pedro's Bike), glamor shots with Deb and Napoleon drawing his date to the dance a portrait of herself that was, well, to see the least quit interesting. This film's characters are perfect for what the director is trying to do. From the costumes, to the acting, no one could play these roles as good as they have. This movie is and isn't what you would expect it to be. Funny? ""Heck Yes!"" But yet at the same time a bit hard to follow. Which in my opinion was the director's (Jared Hess) whole purpose? There isn't really a direct plot, instead the writers keep you guessing, so you are continually asking yourself' 'what the heck is going to happen next?' to be honest I wasn't to sure about this film when I first heard about it. I mean lets get real, a low budget, independent film? How in the world could this film be even remotely funny or good? So I waited until it came out on video. I haven't seen a funnier film that is so clean. By clean I mean no swearing, sex, drugs or alcohol. It's not like your everyday typical teen flick. I was completely shocked at this! It proved to me that there is still good clean humor out there in this world; and Napoleon Dynamite proved it. With his witty comments such as: ""Friggen Idiot, Heck Yes, and what the Flip."" If you want a clean, good and still ""Friggen"" hilarious film, then Napoleon Dynamite is for you.",Napoleon Dynamite
704,kgthdc2468,One of the best movies I never wanted to see!,10,6 February 2005,"Initially, I did not have any interest in Napoleon Dynamite. I saw the previews, thought it looked stupid, and basically ignored all the great reviews of it. Well, I've seen it now, and I think it's one of the best movies I've seen. Jon Heder was BRILLIANT in a pretty much non-acting part.The best part of the movie is that it is so quotable! After initially watching it, it was more completely random and weird than funny, but upon second and third viewing, it just got funnier and funnier! If you are into movies such as Anchorman or Dodgeball, I DEFINITELY suggest this.",Napoleon Dynamite
705,glennsnoise,Literally one of the worst,1,11 February 2005,"This film has been recommended to me by a lot of friends. I don't get it. The writers/directors in power here seem to be unable to recognize that there is a lot more to humor than people using stereotype accents (gay sibilance, Mexican, and Napolean's just plain dorky way of speaking) and keeping a straight face while saying things like ""What do you think?"" Granted, there is a limited amount of character development (see Napolean's girlfriend and the evolution of hairstyles; see also difference in manner of dress from T-shirts to collared shirts and ties), but this movie is overall so overwhelmingly slow-witted that it would have to jump up several notches to aspire to the level of Joe vs. the Volcano or Ishtar. Yes, this is quite possibly the worst film I've seen.",Napoleon Dynamite
706,ringmastr3,"Friggin' Awesome, Whaddaya THINK???? GOOOSH!!!",10,16 March 2005,"Absolutely loved it! We watch it over and over, and recommend it to our friends, relatives, and enemies. I agree with the person who said that it's not about age - it's about whether or not you can relate to the movie's characters and situations. I happen to know plenty of people like these guys... in fact, I told my husband that Napoleon and Pedro are every guy who had a crush on me in high school!! I was even pretty doofy back then, lol!!! I was a lot like Deb, except I didn't date guys like that (I preferred the ones who considered me to be nonexistent, of course). They were just my buds. I also heard that this movie has no plot. Okaaaay... I must be either crazy or have really awesome plot-recognizing skills, because I think that a guy trying to prove himself while helping his friend run for class president is pretty much a plot. Besides, who doesn't like a good root-for-the-underdog flick every once in a while?? I hope I don't offend anyone by saying this, but the ones who say that the acting/directing,etc. is bad in ND may not be intelligent enough to understand that the deadpan factor is there on PURPOSE. That's what makes the movie humorous. It's called theatre of the absurd, sportsfans. And Racism?? Did I miss something? Anyhoo, my pastor says that you either get this movie or you don't, and I agree!!! As for me, I say, ""Sweeeeeet!!"" Peace Out, as ""urban"" Kip might say.",Napoleon Dynamite

This film is all about the dialog and will leaving you scratchy your head at times over how stupid these characters are. Napoleon is truly and extremely memorable character along with his brother kip and uncle Rico. Pedro's periodic day summaries/confusion rants leave me simply speechless. certain small details in the film simply baffle me. look into the subtleties of the film while watching for best viewing.",Napoleon Dynamite

I really loved it. it might seem like there was no point in the movie but there was a point. i don't want to spoil it so i wont say what its about. but i thought it was very good. everybody in this movie was a good actor and very funny. there was not one boring scene in this movie. i think that anybody who is into movies that are weird and funny at the same time should really watch this movie. i hope that anybody else that watches this movie or that already watched it likes it. napoleon is a very funny dork in this movie and he seems very miserable and he says freaking idiot in the funniest way. whats wrong with you people who don't like it....gosh,freaking IDIOTS. anyways anybody who isn't stupid and likes a good laugh should see this and anybody who thought it was stupid needs to shut the flip up because there stupid and have no sense of humor and are to dumb and stiff and serious to laugh at this really funny movie. besides napoleon is extremely hot!!!!!!! and he is such a funny actor and am sure a lot of geeks that get picked on and are misunderstood can really relate to this!!!! its just funny and doesn't have any shocking ""omg"" parts its just plain funny and easy to laugh at and if you don't agree then there is something wrong with you and your dull mind!!!! i love this movie and napoleon so much that I might even get a t-shirt of napoleon!!!",Napoleon Dynamite
709,bbaney147,"Despite what others say, I like it",10,26 May 2005,"I have asked many people what they think of this movie, and most say that they didn't like it. However, I feel different about it. The characters are authentic, not something you see in most movies. Napoleon's character is a combination of all those people you knew in high school that you avoided at all costs. The writers seem to make his likable by showing you what he has to deal with everyday. It gives you that backstage tour of something that most people don't see. Kip is another interesting character. Making him 30 and still living at home is a cleaver idea. It perfectly shows his quirkiness that makes him who he is. His normal routine that includes ""chatting online with babes all day"" proves how blissfully unaware he is of things around him. Uncle Rico cracks me up with his talk about his athletic past in 1982. Seemingly stuck in the early eighties, he is quite original. If you truly love unique and interesting characters, you have to check this movie out. Look past the lack of a plot, and look more into the characters in it. Hopefully you will enjoy them as much as I have.",Napoleon Dynamite
710,raleta6,A movie not for everyone.,6,26 May 2005,"Napoleon Dynamite wasn't an average comedy that everyone would enjoy. There was a pretty solid line between the people who thought the movie was great, and the people who thought it was a bad movie. The plot was very thin and in most of the scenes I only laughed because of how stupid the things the people in the movie were doing. I wasn't really satisfied with the way the movie ended. It didn't really leave an impression of me wanting to see the movie again. I watched it a few times in school, and as I watched it more and more, it started to get less and less funny every time. The only part that was real funny to me was the whole time machine scene, other than that most of the jokes weren't really funny, and seemed kind of dull. If you're into movies that have thick plots and characters that play important rolls, then this movie is probably not for you.",Napoleon Dynamite
711,jonghyuk1997,"Original, but could've been elaborated",6,1 June 2016,"Napoleon Dynamite is about the high-school career of a deficient student and his friend, Pedro, and displays (quite well, actually) the lives of people in Middle America. All the characters are interesting, and the setting is original. But so what? I was not able to see anything that could work as a clear, main ""conflict"". The characters were interesting at first, but they are definitely not lovable, as they have flaws to their personalities that their actions make the viewer grimace at least once during the movie. I was sure this movie was based on character development, as each character learns from their experiences and grow for the better. Apparently it was not. I could say that the whole electing school president scheme would be a conflict, or maybe even the dance party. But not all the characters get involved, some not even indirectly. In that case, I would be hesitant to affirm that neither of them would be the ""Main conflict"". And the ending was extremely rushed- they made a whole big deal about the president thing and then it just suddenly comes to the end! Pedro gets elected, everybody congratulates him, and automatically everything is resolved. I understand that they would not have had that much in their budget to refine and elaborate, but that was some poor script-writing right there. I would like to end this review by stating, why are we going to movies for? Did we pay for the tickets and popcorn to watch people like us living their lives on a screen? I believe any movie should have a solid plot, or at least dynamic characters that you would not normally see in the real world.",Napoleon Dynamite

But alas, my friends...this was never to be. I sat and watched helplessly as the plot less garbage unfolded before me. I cried, I vomited, I clung to the theater seats as line after line of quotable trash was spit out by the skill-less actors and actresses. I looked in sickening wonder at the ""Liger"" as Napoleon droned on in a monotone lecture on why this thing was his favorite animal. My question to the people who made it is: Why? Why did you waste this perfectly good film with this? Why didn't you just give this camera, supplies, and financing over to someone with skill and see what they did with it?! Why did you single-handedly ruin American culture as we know it, as all the young people of today quote and quote and quote the useless babble that filled your worthless movie. I've said enough, but anyone who reads this beware: this movie presents no skill, no anything but some guy who knew someone in the advertising business well enough to get all that air time, previewing it until people wanted to see it. This is not only a swing and a miss...but this could very well be the anti-Christ.",Napoleon Dynamite
713,angelmacdon,What???,1,21 September 2005,"OK, this movie had absolutely no point. The only way I can describe this movie, is that this absolutely annoying kid named Napoleon Dynamite lives with his grandmother, she ends up in the hospital, the uncle stays there until granny comes home. In the mean time N.D. befriends a kid that he convinces to run for class president, and is annoyed at the presence of his uncle and older brother. Napoleaon is a total loser, only has 2 friends and he thinks he is the coolest thing to roam earth since air conditioned cars. Thats it! It wasn't funny, at no point in the movie did I even chuckle. Both me and my husband don't get why everyone loves this movie. It flat out sucked and was a complete waste of my time. I don't want anyone to think that I just don't like the type of humor that is trying to be used in this movie, because some of my most favorite comedy's are not blockbuster hits, and I do like twisted, dark humor. My favorite comedy's range from Orgazmo. Old School, Swimming with Sharks, The 40 year old Virign, There's something about Mary, to Surviving Christmas.

715,rhaphazard,Redeeming Qualities,9,12 April 2016,"Napoleon Dynamite is an interesting take on the nerd coming-of-age story. We start off with the typical awkward kid who gets picked on in school, and right off the bat the difference hits you over the head. Napoleon isn't just some kid who happens to be shy and quiet around his peers, he is legitimately awkward. He isn't good looking, he doesn't have knowledge of any esoteric subjects, he doesn't particularly like any girl, and he pretty much has no outward redeeming qualities.Despite his shortcomings, Napoleon is a supportive friend and puts in the sweat when he puts his mind to it. Two things no one else sees but lead to the one thing that brings his class/grade to their feet in applause. Interestingly, this one thing is still only an outward expression that isn't very different from what makes the popular kids popular.There are no villains, but there aren't any exceptionally good people either. Nobody's flaws are fixed, but they all find some peace with who they are. Napoleon is still the same old Napoleon plus a few new friends. Nothing is fundamentally changed, yet (almost) everyone seems happier, like a burden has been lifted off their shoulders.Incidentally, I think the movie captures the two most important lessons for young people (and older people): be a good friend and put in the work.",Napoleon Dynamite
716,tupchurch,like a train wreck,7,6 January 2006,"This movie is like watching a train wreck in slow motion . . . you can't NOT watch it! You try to convince yourself that it's too stupid to watch, the characters are too lame to like, but then you just can't pull away from it. It's alternately funny and sad. It's reality carried a little to the extreme, which ends up being unreal, yet still close enough to real to be credible. I could see myself back in the 70's in these characters, although they are of course caricatures. It was kinda scary actually to think I could have been that nerdy, although I was more like Pedro than Napoleon. I knew some ""Napoleons"" at my school, though.",Napoleon Dynamite
717,gigislam-best,very interesting movie.,8,18 May 2016,"Napoleon Dynamite is an example of a great movie with a low budget. Napoleon is a weird nerdy looking high school student, and through the movie you can fully understand the school environment of an Idaho small city in the U.S this is not a movie for everyone since sometimes the scenes could result really long or even boring sometimes. from this movie you can also understand the mentality of the people from these parts; for example, uncle Rico is one of the character who is always searching a way to go back in time as he really wants to go back to his high school period where he used to be a famous and loved football player, this examples the mentality of the time, where nobody was looking at the future but they were just caring about high school sports and stuff like that.",Napoleon Dynamite
718,aemilg,What high school was like for most of us!,10,20 May 2017,"Almost as good as the film are the one star reviews! My wife and I laughed our butts off reading the reviews written by people who haven't a clue! In our lives, we were Napoleon and Deb. Actually, both of us are a composite of all these very realistically portrayed high school kids. The jerks who mocked and bullied Napoleon, are the same jerks who write these one star reviews! This is such a real life depiction of what high school is like for the majority of us. It is a time of life when social acceptance is so important. We were never a part of the social scene at high school. We were the outcasts who were mocked and ridiculed and shunned. Neither of us had a date. We never went to a dance like Napoleon and Deb did because it was only a place where we would undergo more mockery, more bullying, more shaming and more ostracization. Seeing Napoleon and Deb at the dance is very romantic for us. We wish we could have had the opportunity to have met at that age. In reality, if a Napoleon and a Deb WERE to go to a dance at high school, they would be laughed out of the building. I don't know if the video that Netflix sends out has the extra features with the filmmakers commentary. If it does, watch the film while listening to the commentary. The film has many events from his life. Perhaps that is part of the reason why some people find the film silly and stupid and boring. They simply cannot identify with a lifestyle in a rural, mostly Mormon, mostly white, mostly conservative community where there are no strip clubs, no prostitutes walking the streets, no night life and no big city trappings whatsoever. Most of the people in this community are close knit families who teach their children morals and values and the kids, for the most part, are really good kids who really are quite different from their more sophisticated, streetwise, jaded counterparts from the big city. The kids do actually get in trouble, but it's for things like Napoleon does at the beginning of the film; dragging a He-Man Action Figure on a string behind the school bus, an actual event in the filmmakers life. If you understand more of where he's coming from, the film makes much more sense and you can appreciate it so much more. We love Napoleon. We identify with him. He's a good kid. Yes, he's awkward, has bad hair, is socially inept, is given to great flights of fancy and he doesn't quite fit in with his superior intelligence and his poor judgment in displaying that superior intellect around a bunch of idiots who look down on him.I love his guts and his total lack of pretense. He is who he is and he has a few moments of glory as he wows the kids with a totally awesome dance routine in a campaign rally supporting his pal Pedro in his successful bid for Student Body President! This is part real life and part fantasy and 100% Ten Stars for a really good movie that is really relevant for a lot of good people who were not in the social elite as kids. And that means most of us.The bad reviews? Go ahead and read them, especially if you love this film! It gives YOU a chance to laugh at the jackasses who laughed at you when you were a kid! It's really fun! They are showing how stupid they are and you can laugh at THEM! Enjoy! Seriously, you can understand the mindset of persons giving Napoleon Dynamite a bad review. It's the same mindset as the Beavis and Butthead types who would give Casablanca, Gone With The Wind or Citizen Kane a one star review! Totally laughable!",Napoleon Dynamite

Stuck in a home with a lazy unemployed brother, an uncle who is frozen in his own high school mindset, and a grandma who likes to live life on the wild side, Napoleon breaks away from societal norms and expectations with his own brand of humor and frickin sweet dance moves.

That's what makes this film what it is! That's what makes it funny!From the opening scenes it's easy to see that it's not going to be your conventional comedy. It's easy to say that the majority of what happens is entirely pointless. OF COURSE IT IS!!!! That's why it's funny. I can honestly say that I did not stop laughing once while watching this film. It's constantly entertaining and the characters are nothing short of inspired genius.Of course, everyone is entitled to their opinion, but are the people who say ""it's pointless"" and ""nothing happens"", the same people who champion overrated rubbish like Broken Flowers? I personally feel that this film does a great job of making directors like Jim Jarmusch look like a damn fool by being equally as pointless, but infinitely more entertaining and enjoyable than his recent effort (and a good deal less pretentious too).

The worst part though was that there was no real plot or reason behind the movie. A movie is supposed to have an introduction leading up to something, a middle and then a finale.

Napoleon Dynamite is set in the present time, but aside from the computer that Kip Dynamite uses to chat online with chicks, there is not a single object, prop, car, food product or article of clothing or furniture that would place the action later than, oh, 1977.The movie creates very meticulously this pristine world of 70's dorkiness plunked down in present day Idaho. Who knows, maybe Idaho is really like that. Maybe no one in Idaho has ever replaced their 70's wood console TV or their antique top-loading VCR, or bought a new car in the last 30 years.I admit I spent the first half of the movie wondering when any kind of plot was going to happen. The stuff about the dance and the class president election did eventually satisfy the expectation for at least a minimal story line. But make no mistake, the movie is not really about anything other than the trials and tribulations of being nerdy, dorky, shy and/or maladjusted in the 70's, I mean in high school.I think I laughed out loud exactly one time watching Napoleon Dynamite. Most of the time I simply watched in morbid, mouth-agape fascination, slack-jawed (the occasional drop of drool rolling out), as the characters spun their wheels in seemingly random, frantic, mostly futile and misguided acts of painful dorkiness.

The fact is, that Napolean Dynamite has absolutely NO plot whatsoever. What it is about is a teenager, who is unaccepted by most of his peers, just trying to get along in high school. Now having said this, most people might say, ""Well wouldn't that be the plot then?"" But no, in fact, it is not. It is merely a description. (there's a big difference there)Napolean is the average unpopular, geeky teenager. He has no friends, that we know of, until a new student (the one and only, Pedro) and a girl trying to get money for college (the lovely Deb) come into the picture and Napolean's life starts looking brighter. His family is not your average, boy meets world type of family. He lives with his grandmother and brother, Kip, and Tina, their llama. After an unfortunate accident, Napolean's grandmother is hospitalized (broke her coccyx) and Uncle Rico steps in. This causes many problems for Napolean.Throughout the movie, Napolean experiences some major life events. Getting a date for the dance, feeding Tina, meeting Kip's girlfriend, Lafawnda, practicing some dance moves, helping Pedro run for president, falling in love (we think), and getting some tots name just a few.Napolean Dynamite is hilariously funny and extremely stupid. You will either love it with all your heart or despise it. It is an awesome movie with an innocent main character you will love, no matter what. Napolean Dynamite is most definitely the next cult classic.",Napoleon Dynamite
731,tomorryo,"Original, hilarious, and non-sappy!",10,1 August 2004,"The first time I saw this movie was when it was in limited release. I was sort of surprised that almost every seat was full... until it started. From the very second the credits start, you can tell this is no ordinary movie. It is one of the most original films I've seen in my whole life. It uses common themes that anybody can relate to, but presents them in a new way. It is highly character-driven, and the quirks and attitudes that each character has is what makes each of them so lovable and hilarious. I was pleasantly surprised that this movie does not resort to now-commonplace 'comedic' overuse of expletives, nudity, or gross-out humor.Yes, he has to drink egg yolks in one scene, but it is justified in the context of the story and is not done in a gross way. Of all the people I've taken to see this movie, none of them wanted to go, but all of them laughed their heads off through the whole thing, thanked me for taking them, and started using the movie's catch-phrases thereafter. It seems like the kind of movie that both kids and adults can relate to and like on different levels.This is the first full-length movie by the Hess brothers and Jon Heder, and to me, it looks like a veteran effort. It is impeccably directed, casted, and acted. The writing is so good it makes me think they took the characters from people they know in real life. You get so wrapped up it that you forget that Napoleon, Kip, Pedro, Deb, and everyone else are just characters!While this movie has the same flavor of Rushmore, it is completely original, and, dare I say, much better... Good AND bad things happen to the characters - maybe that's what makes them seem so real. Another reason is that it doesn't have a single sappy or contrived moment (thank you!!!). Napoleon is a nerd but he has a great deal of confidence, and that's pretty rare to see in a film. Things like this give all the characters tremendous depth, and when you come right down to it, good characters and writing rather than special effects and the celebrity-star-of-the-moment are what make a movie truly GREAT.I can see why some people might not like this film - if you have a specific sense of humor or don't ""get"" quirkiness, then you might not like this movie. But so far, I haven't met anybody who dislikes it - it is TRUE quality. So do yourself a favor and see it!!!!!!!!!!!!",Napoleon Dynamite
732,JIJ56,Best thing since Kung Fu Fighting,10,15 June 2004,"This movie was wildly hilarious and smart. No wonder a ticket for this movie was hard to get at Sundance. Rare is a film that embraces the indie sense of nonconformity while being entertaining and original. All the actors were deadpan brilliant in their portrayals; you almost thought you were watching a documentary. And if you're in the mood for a little 80's schlock music, you've come to the right place; it's all there along with bad hairstyles and bad clothes. The final scene where the two candidates for school president present their views on stage (don't worry, this isn't a spoiler) is worth the entire price of admission. Where did they find these brilliant actors?Anyway, check it out. It's a great movie to see with a bunch of buddies. Or make it a date movie. You'll know right away your date is a dud if they don't laugh at this movie.",Napoleon Dynamite

There are hardly any scenes worth the time to sit and see, and the entire movie's dialogue is delivered as if all the characters are stoned.I can not put into words the disbelief I had when the credits rolled: I had just wasted over an hour of my life that I would never get back- I'd rather have sat through a meeting at work.I possibly have seen worse movies, but none come to mind.The first half hour of the movie is spent setting the character's up in their own, messed up world- it's the equivalent of reading a 400 page book to get to 'the end' and have nothing happen. Sometimes people are utterly uninteresting and this entire movie is based upon the most common, boring, uninteresting, characters. And I must assume this is the point of the movie: Bore you to death.",Napoleon Dynamite

735,trickyjj58,Not real humor - an entire waste of time,3,29 June 2006,"This has to be one of the worst movies I have watched the entire year. It's dull, and the humor in it does not consist of any jokes. I laughed out loud twice during the entire course of this movie due to its sheer stupidity. Before watching it, I read that some people would love it, and some would hate it. I completely agree, and I fall into the category that think this movie is terrible. The only positive aspect of the movie is the acting, which is quite decent, but nothing amazing. It is also very original in how it is made. To conclude, this movie is a waste of 90 minutes. Only watch it if you have no choice, or if you are really desperate to pass time. I give this movie a 3/10 because of its originality.",Napoleon Dynamite

737,mmunrost,dead-pan hilarious,10,30 September 2006,"When this movie first came out I refused to see it. I thought the trailers made it look stupid and the fact that almost every teen in America seemed to list it as their favorite movie just reinforced my preconceived idea that this was yet another dumb teen movie. How wrong could I have been? This movie is funny, intelligent, and dry, dry, dry - my favorite type of humor.It is obvious this is a low budget movie. There is no fancy-shmancy camera work, only simple shots inside plain homes and schools in a state dominated by big skies and wide open space. It made me feel like I was there. This simple camera work really helped me focus on the characters the majority of whom are nerds, introverts, wierdos or some other type of misfit. You can't help but love them all. The jocks and the cheer leaders are the ones that seem like the misfits in this film and I enjoyed getting a laugh at their expense.For all of you that said the over-30's wouldn't like this movie? Well you're dead wrong, I'm in my late 30's and my husband his early 40's and we both felt like this was a movie about our generation, not today's generation. In fact, it's rather gratifying that todays kids relate to this humor. There's hope for the world yet.",Napoleon Dynamite

Only two were so bad that I felt sick after watching them, House of 1000 Corpses and Napoleon Dynamite. I wish that I could get the time that I wasted on these movies back. As bad as Nap was it did have the cow scene that made me laugh. THERE WAS NOTHING good about House of 1000 Corpses at all. Napoleon made me feel angry when I looked at his stupid face. I wanted him dead in that movie. I hoped for the trench coat mafia to come in and shoot him at lunch. How anyone could enjoy this is beyond me. I'm a fairly open minded guy. I enjoy films by Hitchcock, Copolla, Eastwood, Tarantino, Herzog, Cameron Crow, Kevin Smith and many more. You can tell that my tastes are pretty flexible. I can watch just about anything and find something about it that I like. This movie movie was unbelievably bad. I actually hate this film.",Napoleon Dynamite

740,hairgut,a subtle delight,10,6 April 2005,"What a charming, understated teen comedy this is. None of the jokes have to hit you over the head, they don't resort to bathroom humor, nudity, or sex gags, and yet, if you are like me, you will be smiling the entire time. Think about the premise: A nerdy dork from rural Idaho helps his ethnic friend win a high school election- no way, right? Way. Heder is on cruise control all the way through, and you really wonder how he is pulling this off. Likely, one of the most compelling characters to hit the screen in a long time, and you probably don't even know who the actor is. The interactions of the characters are surprisingly complex and rather unpredictable, which provides much of the charm of the film. It stays with you a while, and never even comes close to throwing up a CGI effect. If this is Indie, give me more. Get this movie if you don't already have it. It works on many levels.",Napoleon Dynamite

I Love this movie! Yes it's not the ""high art"" that some folks may want to attribute. I found the humor and sensitivity brought to the screen extraordinarily well done.Yes, I laughed at many many points, but that is not what surprised me. My crying surprised me at the unconventional sensitivity Jared Hess brings to the screen.As much as it may not be macho I found myself in tears at two points; just after Napoleon dances for Pedro's class presidency and when Kip sings at the very end for his bride. I LOVE that scene, a truly amazing anti-hero love song! I give this a 10/10.A true Landmark Film! Thank you Jared Hess for making the world just a little better!",Napoleon Dynamite

I was amazed how this movie avoided profanity. The dislodge was boring but it was boring in a good way. It's not stupid by any means. It's old style and new style mixed together. Our generations are used to heavy profanity, sexual content, extreme violence. This movie avoided that like the plague. I was in high school in the late 80's early 90's. Remember movies like Basketball Diaries, Breakfast Club, Teachers, Fast Times at Ridgemnot High...... What did these movies have in common. They were all rated R. What was Napoleon rated? I was like these characters in the movie. I was boring. The friends I had were boring. I think too many people want fast paced, too much dislodge laced with four letter words. I think it's really hard to make a good film not boring. So my hats of to these people for making a boring above average film.",Napoleon Dynamite
745,jfloyd,I enjoyed and recommend this film.,7,6 May 2004,"""Napoleon Dynamite"" was an enjoyable film. Smarter and perhaps a little slower than the regular high school comedy, the film left me with a strong 'feel-good' sense. Jon Heder pulls off the likable loser title character quite well, capturing the awkwardness of being a teen-aged loner trapped in a harsh home and school environment. His friend Pedro (Efren Ramirez) comes across an odd juxtaposition -- another introvert, with a blank stare, but one who runs for class president as a newcomer. Without resorting to comically absurd situations, the movie makes you feel sympathetic to Napoleon, Pedro, Deb and even Napoleon's brother Kip and the charming comedy manifests as they each eventually find their own happiness. To someone who knows nothing of rural American life, this portrayal of small town high school life seemed real and honest. Seeing the quirky marginalized characters triumph in their own way through their friendships was entertaining and uplifting. I'd recommend ""Napoleon Dynamite""",Napoleon Dynamite
746,narelle-campbell,So funny I almost wet my pants!!!,10,26 January 2007,"Now here is a movie with comedy.At first you find yourself wondering what on earth are you watching. In fact the lady at the video store asked me if I really wanted to hire this movie going on to say that this is the wost movie she has ever seen. EVER. But..... lucky for me she was wrong. Being told that this was the worst movie I kinda went into it thinking it was bad. By the end of it I was laughing so hard I almost needed an adult nappy.I have now watched this movie more than 10 times, proudly own a Napoleon Dynamite quote pen, and am always quoting lines from the movie.Do the chickens have large talons will remain my favourite line from a movie for the rest of my life.I would highly recommend this movie. Stick with it and give it a chance. You won't regret it!",Napoleon Dynamite
747,clwill76,He's got the heart and soul of the man of my dreams.,10,3 February 2007,"This was an unusually emotional movie for me. Although there may be no specific 'plot,' the portrayal of high school life for a social 'outsider' was particularly touching. Napoleon absolutely won my heart with his drawings of 'ligers' and such. I did not attend a public high school, but I could still seethe with resentment at characters such as Summer and her gang. ""With me, every day will be summer!. . .uggh! Napoleon's friendship with the Hispanic guy (I don't mean to call him that but I forget his name) was particularly touching, and the greatest line of the movie has got to be when the two are backstage and he (Hispanic guy) is completely crestfallen because he has no skit, but Napoleon says, ""Just go with your heart; that's what I always do."" A simple line, but a proverb that a lot of people often forget or don't think about. Uncle Rico was absolutely sickening as he devoured his cheap steaks standing up at the kitchen counter, but I was surprised at the redemption (hate the overuse of the word) that he was granted when his babe pulled up on a bicycle in the end. I thought the martial arts instructor and his wife were an excellent casting job. Napoleon's 'girlfriend' at the end was absolutely endearing, with her humility and shining eyes (and the simple, homemade looking frock she had on at the end). In all, it left me with a feeling of reminiscence for the fragility of everyone's emotional and social lives during the adolescent years.",Napoleon Dynamite
748,dwzl32,Love it or hate it?,10,10 February 2007,"I loved this movie. It is amazing to me how controversial it has become as I read the other reviews, because this film did everything it set out to do, and more. A simple, funny, TRUE look at high school life if you don't happen to be a cheerleader or a quarterback is what it is. It's celebration of the regular, (geeky) person that is inside all of us, whether we like it or not. How refreshing to see a high school movie about these folks, and not about the ""IN"" crowd and the way they terrorize others! Also, it manages to be very funny without nudity and hardly any violence or swearing. I do find it interesting that some of the people who hated it the most had the most to say about it, and that in some cases their favorite character if they had to choose one is the only ""jock"" among the main characters, Uncle Rico.It is true that you will have more appreciation for it if you were in high school during the 80's, but there are elements for everyone. In it's own quiet way, it is one of the funniest films I have ever seen or ever will. FYI: car crashes, murder, hate, and bare breasts are NOT critical elements for a good movie.",Napoleon Dynamite

But when I started hearing everyone and there mother quote this movie it started to bug me. Then when I saw people buy shirts that said ""vote for Pedro"" that's when my hated for this movie began. Please someone tell me what is so funny about this movie? You have a nerd that's in high school and he has a little friend named Pedro. His brother is another nerd that wants to be a cage fighter and his uncle is a scum bag. This should have been a made for TV movie. But with kids now-a-days with no taste you can put what ever sewage you want on the big screen and every teenage will eat it up like it was a lobster dinner. Bottom line... this movie sucks",Napoleon Dynamite

Each viewing reveals more subtle, funny nuances in the characters' characters. Maybe that's what's hard for some people -- the situations aren't faked dramas and the characters aren't cartoons. Well, kinda they are. But if you're really watching, you begin to see how even the biggest dork has his or her environment where they are the star, and the popular crowd should really be paying attention to what can happen to them.... If, as you watch the movie, you are able to set aside your own personal preconceptions about who is a dork and who is cool you may find heroes in places where you hadn't thought to look before.",Napoleon Dynamite

I found myself laughing out loud hours later just thinking about parts of this film. Not only is it one of the funniest and quirkiest movies out there with great acting, it also has a lot of heart. It contains some great truths about friendship and being yourself while staying true to its quirky, lovable characters, and without beating you over the head with it. The audience I saw it with erupted into applause in the middle of the film and at the end. That's how good it is. Do yourself a favor and see this film if you ever have the chance.

(partly, because it reminds me of someone who is much like the lead character in real-life).I saw the trailer and thought ""OH-yeah. THIS DVD can be used to help steady that table in the den that's wobbly."" Then, one evening i saw part of it and took a few minutes to let it capture my attention. The first time i saw it, i truly thought it was just an odd story line and film.Then...i saw it again. It made more sense and i could actually enjoy the story and the acting (Diedrich Bader is always good - and Jon Gries is hilarious).Tonight, i saw it for the third time - from the beginning.DON'T MISS THE FIRST 20 MINUTES.It's the GOOFIEST movie i think i've ever seen. i LOVE IT!!!

753,azure_dunez,Bittersweet comedy,9,28 November 2007,"There's a bittersweetness about Napoleon Dynamite that makes it likable. Napoleon is the ultimate nerd but he seems oblivious to it. Without much of a plot (it's more little snippets of Napoleon's life) and a lot of nostalgia, this movie was surprisingly funny.Some reviewers have said its cruel. But I think rather than being cruel it places its characters under a magnifying glass and bares them for the audience to see. But in doing so it also reveals their flaws, their humanity, and they become likable. And the end it seems to say that despite how nerdy or a loser you may think you are, happiness is not outside your grasp.",Napoleon Dynamite

Quite bizarre in places but funny as hell in a square, cringing kind of way. There isn't much of a storyline here but this is more of character driven film and the superb acting and writing make it work wonders. The setting was pretty strange too, now I can't say I've ever been to Idaho, where this film was filmed but is everyone still stuck in the 80's or is that just another quirk of this film?! I definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys alternative comedy, but if you don't then like quite a few people you won't like it or just simply won't get it! But then that's half the fun, apparently.",Napoleon Dynamite

Upon renting the movie, I settled down for an enjoyable evening, or so I thought. As the scenes droned on, I found myself wondering if everyone who had recommended this movie saw the same one I did. Could there be 2 versions of this movie out there, because people either love it or hate it. There seems to be no middle ground. Napoleon's monotone, slack jawed speech patterns match the pace of this movie and the plot. I felt like I was watching a washing machine for an hour and a half. Could those who loved this movie have been caught up in that ""I'm seeing this movie with my friends...I have to say it's cool"" mentality?

Big mistake.The movie represents the worst qualities of the going no-where small town dork. Basically it is a tale of a loser on a fast track to nothingness. And the sad thing? There are likely people who are exactly like Napoleon. Maybe I was expecting a story of a nerd who changes his life and makes something of himself by the end of the movie. No. Maybe a message of hope? Negative. Action? Sex? Violence? Wrong again. This is a mediocre human being living a mediocre life in a mediocre movie.YOU WILL SURVIVE BY NOT WATCHING THIS MOVIE!!

I'm 21 years old and just about everyone in my generation thinks of this movie as the nerd's holy grail. The only problem with that is....nerds are generally and by definition someone that doesn't fit in with popular social groups due to their high intelligence level. Napoleon has no intelligence level. Actually, he's borderline retarded which maybe the reason hes an outcast, because his parents never had him diagnosed and put in the ""special"" classes. This movie is just mundane garbage the deserves a spot in the prestigious dollar bin at Wal-Mart. Indie film? This is an MTV production, and reeks of it. Everything in the movie absolutely mocks its entire fan base, and yet they still eat it up. The characters are pretentious, overacted, and worst of all badly written. Not a single moment in this film made me crack more than a half smile. In fact most of the time i was looking at the clock next to my friend wondering how much longer I had to sit here while he cracks up to absolutely nothing except maybe Napoleon looks nerdy. PLEASE save yourself the trouble if you haven't seen this and rent Revenge of the Nerds, or Welcome to the Dollhouse. At least those movies tailor to their fan base.

I have had it with the garbage that they put on screen today as well as the lobotomized lemmings that continue to pay money to see this garbage. Studios will continue to make and distribute these kinds of movies as long as people continue to pay for them. Can you honestly say this was a good movie?

760,marsfire2828,a sympathetic story of the cool uncool,10,1 September 2004,"I thought this movie was brilliantly funny and honest. The director shot the main characters so you would laugh with them, not at. The only characters who I felt were criticized or truly mocked were those who were mean or cruel. So infrequently in high school movies do we see non-affluent middle America.Most high school films show us suburban, east or west coast schools. I thought this was a refreshing look at the realism of lower to lower middle class life. If you came to this movie looking for Adam Sandler/Jim Carrey type humor, you'll be sorely disappointed.

Even though this is a comedy, it isn't very funny at all. Most of the humor is just the filmmakers showing you the stupidity and narrow-mindedness of the characters. There is no plot (I was told that Pedro running for president was the major plot line, but that is a very small segment of the movie) and the characters are very flat and undeveloped. They didn't show more than one side to any of these characters. This movie has no plot and no point. It's a waste of anyone's time.",Napoleon Dynamite

It's essentially a one-joke movie - that main character Napolean Dynamite is eccentric and so is his family - but there's enough skits strung together which get more and more out-there and keep laughing. The directors are clearly channeling Wes Anderson, but it's also got a down-home sort of feel as if the writers and directors are recalling their childhood or people they know, and not ripping off another writer/director.

765,Blake-D,We call Tater Tots potato in the UK,8,10 February 2005,"The American High school has been a comedy setting for nearly three decades now, with the nature of the jokes, generally speaking, focused on dick jokes and problematic sex. Napolean Dynamite isn't the first film to subvert this, but its approach is certainly a refreshing one. The protagonist, Napolean, is what would be termed as a geek, nerd, whatever. He triumphs despite his social stance. Nothing new here, Revenge of the Nerds already did the triumphant geek thing years ago, but the approach is wholly different, and perhaps more satisfying for a different generation. It is impossible not to side with Napolean, who like Donnie Darko, has a super heroes name but is seemingly powerless. Indeed, if Donnie Darko proved his superhero status through angst ridden, schizophrenic justice, Napolean achieves his pips through accomplishing the impossible. He is naturally the main focus for the movie, but all his actions are for his friends and families benefit. He fights against the evil that is his leeching uncle, campaigns for his social equal, Pedro, to be class president against the omnipresent head cheerleader, whilst pursuing the love interest throughout. Thing is, he does it in his own, sometimes surreal, usually idiotic way, which is what makes this movie so funny. Indeed, he straddles that thin line between fool and genius, seen with his dance, choice of prom suit, as well as pretty much every decision he makes. This is what makes the film so funny, because you have to respect him for his actions, but they are so absurd that it is impossible to take them seriously. Despite the nature of the characters, what they say and how they act, the roles are played in a very naturalistic fashion, and by the end of the film you would not question why Napolean has a Llama for a pet, it just seems apt. This is another factor that makes it a great high school movie over the general American Pie fodder, the characters are played in a straight way, but they are fundamentally left field. Instead of Sean Willam Scott gurning his way through some over the top sex addict, Napolean Dynamite has nice believable performances for characters with sometimes unbelievable personalities. The film is consistently effective at what it does, and has a lovable cast that will guarantee this movie a cult status indefinitely. The only gripe maybe is that some things could be explored better. Napoleans brother, Kif, is not exploited enough, in my opinion, and the nature of the film is not ground breaking, Wes Anderson has being doing films like this for a while. However, it is easily worth the attention, and definitely one to own, as the humour is able to stand against repeated viewing. This will be a fan boy favourite for a while.",Napoleon Dynamite

I mean, I like slapstick, goofy comedy, even cheesy teen comedies (like road trip, etc), but there was nothing funny about this movie.I agree with the poster who felt like this movie was set in 1985 with the exception of the chatroom stuff on the internet. My favorite part was the credits. Not because there were any additional scenes, but that the movie was over and I could go! I'd give this 0 stars. Go see something else. Anything else.",Napoleon Dynamite
767,headbanginCJ,Hilarious! If you get it,8,16 June 2013,"I start off by saying you have to 'get' this film to enjoy it, but this does not mean you have to be more intellectual than others or see a deeper meaning you just have to 'get' it.I am from the UK not the US so some of the stereotypes might have fallen flat on me but I still find this movie hilarious. People may say it's boring but that's the whole point, to reflect they're lifestyle, unlike 'Drive' which is just boring as hell, reflecting nothing. Every single character seems to be so different and interesting while being so boring on screen it's magnificent.My conclusion to this film is: If you're in the right mood and you watch this for the first time, you cannot believe what you're seeing and it's hilarious.8/10",Napoleon Dynamite
768,Sikatrixie,For the real indie-film lover,9,16 January 2005,"Quirky, imaginative, subtle and colourful. Napoleon Dynamite is original and comical to the audience who appreciates the uniqueness mingled throughout the film. How many other movies have a guy throwing a little plastic action figure tied to a string out a school bus window? How many people can say they've seen a llama named Tina eating a casserole? The slow but meaningful plot tugs at your interest in a similar way to Napoleon dragging his brother Kip into town with is bicycle. This film has indie written all over it and with it's quirky characters and down-to-earth, yet strange, reality, this film has all the elements necessary to impress the eccentric movie goer.",Napoleon Dynamite
769,joejanish,absolute genius!,10,7 December 2005,"duh! You will not get the full beauty of this movie by watching it once. It is one of those flicks you need purchase and then watch over and over and over ... it gets better every time. The tiny nuances and details of every scene get funnier as you take more notice. For those looking for traditional comedy, please look elsewhere. This is a movie that is ""out of the box"" in its style and presentation. If, on the other hand, you like ""dry humor"", this is like watching a desert. Note: keep an eye on Uncle Rico ... in real life, Jon Gries is a vegan, absolutely not a meat eater ... yet there are several scenes where he has to eat steak. Watch closely and you will notice that he NEVER swallows a bite of meat, and in a few spots you can catch him spitting the meat out.OK that isn't such a great point in the movie, but just another in a huge pile of comedic moments that give this film incredible depth.One thing that really makes this movie head and shoulders above others: you will connect, in some way, with every character in the movie. Each character presents a story, and as sad or unrealistic as their story may be, it's hard not to feel compassion. Brilliant character development in the script and excellent casting.By the way, did you ever hear of nylon polymer?Genius, absolute genius!",Napoleon Dynamite

I know who the Avatar is, and dig his freaky haircut. I can name all of the Camdens, and know more about Lauralie and Rory than I ever wanted to.... See -- I have experience with suspending my adult way of thinking, and just enjoying something for the sheer joy of enjoying it. However - when this movie was over, and I looked in the mirror -- I saw my mom, shaking her head and wondering WHAT I saw in ""Wayne's World."" Oh no! I AM an old fart!

A lot of movies have had the nerd stuff before, but the only thing different is that the characters grow out of their nerdiness by the end of the movie, but in this one, they stay the same throughout it all. You find yourself wondering what the plot really is, or if there really is a plot. Its a funny movie just because most of the characters are..well, nerdy. The stars aren't bad at acting either.I give it a 4 out of 10 because I don't believe that it deserves a higher rating. If you enjoy movies with no meaning, go ahead & watch it.",Napoleon Dynamite
772,grchereck,"Short on plot, long on quirky characters and situations",6,3 October 2005,"""Napoleon Dynamite"" is a lightweight comedy, mostly dialog-driven but with some physical humor. The conflicts in the story are handled in a light, deadpan manner -- so much so that, to some viewers, there may not seem to be a story at all -- and there's not much depth to the characters. Alienated teenager Napoleon, his 30-something Internet-geek brother Kip, their sleazy uncle Rico, Napoleon's shy schoolmates Deb and Pedro, and the rest are pretty much defined by their quirks and the absurd situations in which they find themselves. The more that I think about it, ND seems to be the kind of movie that basically lives or dies by its gags, whether you find them funny or not.Ultimately, I think whether or not you'll like ND boils down to your own sense of humor, but even at that rate, it's hard to tell... People who mostly enjoy crude, slapstick-y Hollywood farces (such as the ""Austin Powers"" series, the Farrelly Brothers' body of work, or anything with Adam Sandler) may warm up to this slow-moving little indie film, or they may find that it doesn't pack enough broad laughs for them; likewise, people who ordinarily enjoy artsy, slow-moving indie films may find this movie too shallow for their liking, or they may find it a cute and amusing diversion.Personally, I consider myself part of the last camp: I mostly like independent-minded and artsy fare -- especially the films of Woody Allen, Mike Leigh, and Alexander Payne -- but I can somewhat enjoy ND on its own terms. I found it to be an off-beat, mildly amusing tale of a self-absorbed, anti-social high-schooler (played by newcomer Jon Heder -- his performance *makes* this movie) who, while contending with bullies and snobby girls and his rather unconventional home life, gradually becomes more involved in other things *outside* of his own little private world and even finds a couple of unlikely friends. Overall, I don't think ND is great by any means, but it's a film I could watch every once in a while when I'm in the mood for something lighthearted, silly and low-key.(P.S.: I didn't see ""Napoleon Dynamite"" until months after it came out on video, when I received the DVD as an early birthday present this past summer. I rarely quote the film; I don't own a ""Vote For Pedro"" T-shirt or anything like that; and I don't personally know anyone else who goes around spouting quotes from the movie or wearing the shirts.)",Napoleon Dynamite

Meanwhile, a unique and entertaining storyline tells the life of several misfit high school students and their families. Unexpected twists and bizarre events makes the movie very unpredictable, in a good way. As you watch, you will acquire a particular fondness to each unique character; their experiences are easy to relate to. Also, the low budget allowed for a more realistic outcome of the setting and situation. This good-hearted and innocent film is sure to bring about a positive mood to anyone who watches it.

774,kc8krf,One of the worst films I have ever seen and I've seen Manos the Hands of Fate,1,2 April 2005,"This movie sucks out loud. There is no real dialog in the movie. everything is said in a short sentence then followed by a long pause. this effect might be good here and there but it is throughout the entire movie. The characters all seem to be trapped inside a crappy movie that they cannot get out of, the actors all seem very very bored. then there is the audio level, I had the TV turned up all the way and I just make out what they are saying. this movie dragged on for what seemed like forever. I found myself wishing the movie was over about half way through. however, the one upside to the movie is the cinematography. this movie was shot very well on par with other greats. This movie portrayed the shear expanse of the American Mid-West very well. in conclusion if your looking for a movie that demonstrates the art of cinematography this is it (with the volume muted of course)... otherwise steer clear of this Hollywood abortion.",Napoleon Dynamite

It earned a few laughs on my part; only because I have a thing for llamas and it's always funny to watch people getting hit in the head with things like steaks and grapefruits.But that's all this film was. Watching the same gags being performed with nothing but the humiliation to laugh at.

The material in this movie was fresh, creative, original, and kept you laughing the whole time. You won't find another movie quite like it.If you're still curious about it, there were only 40 or less people in the theater when I saw it, but if you were sitting in the front like I was you'd think that the theater was packed because of the crowd response. I've read some reviews that this movie doesn't go anywhere, but they're all full of crap. It does go somewhere, and ends strong. You have to give it to the director Jered Hess. No one makes their first movie this good. And all the actors (most of them having hardly any acting experience on film) did an incredible job. You can't top a movie like this.

There isn't a movie that I can think of in the history of all my movie watching that has made me laugh more than this one. I was grateful to find out this last weekend that it has spread all the way to San Diego. I went to the 8:30 showing, which eventually become a sold out show. I usually don't like watching a movie more than once, but I really enjoyed this one the second time around. I listened to the review on the internet that Ebert gave this movie. For some reason he gave it a thumbs down... His excuses for why he gave it a thumbs down were pathetic. No real logical reasoning. He basically said ""I just wasn't buying it, and I didn't want to play along"" yeah, fat middle aged men are usually the first ones to sit out and not play along.But Roeper disagreed and gave it a thumbs up. You can really tell who has the sense of humor and who wants to over analyze everything.What I like so much about this movie is that it's simple minded.People have been too critical of it. I don't know why. It's just a movie that makes you laugh and feel good. You don't have to think about anything. It's not abstract in any way. There is no throwing you through a loop where you have to figure out what will happen next. You just simply follow along and enjoy the ride. Napoleon gets picked on lot, and lacks a lot of social capacity, but he's confident and these things don't even phase him, which really taught me a valuable lesson. I like the fact that he didn't feel the need for revenge on those that did him wrong. There is just a good moral in the movie that good things happen to good people in the end.Anyone that walks away from this movie saying it sucked, or it didn't make them laugh, either didn't get it, or they're just the type that have to analyze and question everything in their path. All this movie requires is a person with a good sense of humor that can laugh at themselves from time to time.",Napoleon Dynamite

779,TheRealAlexYoung,There is no point to this film... but who cares!,8,22 March 2006,"When I first came across Napoleon Dynamite I was a bit dubious. It is essentially a film about nothing, just the daily antics of a loner who is practically transparent to all of his classmates. It is Napoleon's completely innocent and harmless nature that utterly endears the viewers to the point that they overlook his quirky and downright strange behaviour (ie trailing a figurine from the school bus by a ball of string!).It boils down to a teenage love story but refreshingly it doesn't go down the sappy Hollywood route of cliché after cliché. Instead it uses the romance as a secondary story while it keeps you entertained with Napoleon and Pedro's offbeat friendship, Kip's internet chatroom poetry and Uncle Rico's obsession with going back to '82. The time machine scene is a classic! There is no obvious plot to the film but I didn't find it a problem, if anything it just frees up time to cram in more of the one liners and catchphrases that have been as popular as Wayne's World's ""NOT"", so much so that a complete quote book of Napoleon Dynamite is now available...

The kids all have their quirks and strengths, but getting to them is like peeling an onion. Or, I guess, an Idaho potato. Think: Tater Tots. You'll never look at them the same again.

""Napoleon"" is about as ""indie"" as Starbucks (or MTV, who tellingly produced this) with half the soul (if that's possible).If you're under 35 & haven't seen this, let me point out that Kurt Loder (the wizened old troll/huckster of MTV News & Rolling Stone magazine) loved this movie.

I can watch it over and over again, and still laugh. It just goes to show you that pure, clean fun is still the best comedy.

I generally don't like American clichés but thought I may be able to stand this movie, which turned out to not be true. Rather than the off center genius I expected I found it contrived and extremely annoying. As for it being a comedy, I only recall laughing once and even the dance sequence, which was the only reason I persevered which watching, was completely pointless.

I delayed watching it and only saw it after much resistance and was sorry I waited so long. The opening menu screen sets the tone for this movie, a totally ridiculous account of a teenage nerd who acts as a compulsive liar and physical disaster exhibiting awkwardness with his every step. Napolean's sidekick, Pedro, and Uncle Rico offer ingenious comic relief and uniqueness. The movie itself is simple and slow-paced which only adds to its comic value. If you can relate to being a teenager in the nineties, this movie will not disappoint you. If you are a member of the older audiences, this movie will not please you.

Having read some of the comments here, I am however not shocked by some of the movie's naysayers. Apparently these people have forgotten the disjointed qualities, ennui, and overall ""WTF am I doing here""ness of high school, because Napoleon Dynamite simply would not have been as good if a solid plot were established.Come on, was high school really a plot-driven vehicle for *you*? Me neither.With that said, the movie's greatness is based on the fact that it's subject matter is not great, and the movie is happy to remind you repeatedly of this. The movie doesn't ask to be on the same level as anything else; it's just content to stand on the sideline of the dance floor and watch the rest of its genre float merrily on.Thankfully the film is character-driven, because all of the characters here stole the show. Instead of the main character chewing up all the scenery, the sense of the weirdo community comes out because no one character is allowed to steal a scene without another character delivering a line or gesture that wins the viewer's attention.Napoleon Dynamite is a really, really good movie. The icing on the cake (or should I say, ketchup on the tots) in this case is that *anyone* is able to watch this.

I bet this flick was on top of many a Christmas list this year. This film is the epitome of independent film success. I haven't seen a breakthrough film this great since ""Bottle Rocket"". Many reviewers have complained about a lack of story, slow pace or that it just wasn't funny. To me a great movie doesn't have to appeal to everyone, sometimes great movies do but that's a rarity. These brothers wrote a great comedy about a backwards town high school and an even more backwards anti-hero. Usually people who don't like a film will just forget about it, but people who fancy themselves movie aficionados will get all up in arms when something they don't like gets some attention.

Napoleon is constantly ignored by everyone in his small city Preston, in Idaho. At home, things are the same, his older brother, Kip (Aaron Ruell) and his Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) are always too busy with their own obsessions to dedicate time and pay any attention in Napoleon's life. It is only when a new student arrives, Pedro (Efren Ramirez) that Napoleon gets a friend and starts acting brave, challenging himself to become a true hero. This movie has not a better definition than with the following sentence: It's not for everyone. Either you love it or hate it. There is no actual conflict, just portraits the graceless life of a hopeless boy with no will to live whatsoever in the middle of United States, which means lots of Americans can relate to this shitty high school life that is also extreme, just like everyone's opinion about the movie: either you want to go back in time for the best period of your life (as we can notice, Uncle Rico shows us how he wanted to be a teenager again, playing baseball) or you hate the experience and want to forget about it. One good aspect in the movie is the fact that they don't focus on the stereotype movie about high school conflict: losers vs popular. Who would tell that a movie about mediocrity became unique? If you are still going to watch it, don't look for a intriguing story. Also the opening credits were perfect! I will give a few points for originality.

A better ending than Napoleon and Deb getting together would have been a nuclear bomb going off and killing all of the characters. At least that would have added a tiny bit of excitement.

All that I knew was that it was about a dork in high school. I think the best way to watch movies is to go in without an idea or what it should be. Otherwise, you tend to think it sucks when it doesn't turn out the way you expected, even though it may have been great.I loved this movie. Some people said it looked depressing. It was not, unless you consider Idaho depressing, which is a different topic. Actually the setting made me think of home, South Dakota, so don't be offended Idaho.This movie has a bunch of hilarious or quirky, random scenes that just happen for no particular reason until you get to the end. There isn't much of a plot. It is more of a story about a dork that is easy to like because he tries to be cool and fails miserably but doesn't care. You may have to have a different sense of humor to get this one. By that I mean the ability to get things other than what is on shows like Friends or movies like Men in Black.",Napoleon Dynamite
794,dgh10,A hilarious movie.,10,17 August 2004,"Napoleon Dynamite is a hilarious movie, although it caters to a particular brand of humor. The plot is very nonlinear; the movie generally chronicles the life of the main character Napoleon, an eccentric and immature teenager, throughout a few weeks of high school and family life. Along the way, Napoleon's friend, Pedro, runs for class president, and Napoleon helps him in this endeavor. Likewise there are a couple other subplots involving his Uncle Rico's door-to-door Tupperware sales and his brother(?)'s escalating relationship with a chat room acquaintance named La-Fawn-duh.Despite these general themes, the rest of the movie is quite sporadic, which I like. Recently, I've noticed a few movies whose humor is centered around ""randomness"" -- i.e., for no perceivable reason, Napoleon and his brother will obey a TV commercial's admonition to go to a trial class at the ""Rex-Kwan-Do"" dojo, or try out a time machine recently purchased on the internet. (Don't forget the crystals) It's not the sort of movie that is amusing to hear described to you, but if you're like me, you'll think it's really, really funny. The title character, played by Jon Heder, is uproarious...I'm not really sure why he's so funny, but I know that he plays the character so convincingly that you seriously wonder if the actor is any different in real life. (hopefully he won't typecast himself in this role)Also, despite the nonlinearity of the plot, I still found the movie building in energy to a satisfying climax at the presidential speeches and skits...I could hardly stop laughing!Anyway, if you like random, possibly ""stupid"" humor, you'll love this movie.I suppose you might like it too if you know a lot about and like artsy movies (I don't know that much about them).

When I went to shake his hand I said, I know who you are, you were in ND. His brother standing next to him said, ""I didn't think anyone saw that movie"". I bust up laughing. He's the real deal. Talked just like he did in the movie. I was living my own scene from ND. Of course I got a picture with him.",Napoleon Dynamite
796,ronald_bruce_hoagland,Greatest film ever,10,8 August 2004,"Napoleon Dynamite is the only film I have seen twice. I consider it one of the greatest films ever made. I have known people who are exactly like the characters in the film, (including myself). It is refreshing when Napoleon gets his 15 minutes of fame. He earned it! It reminded me of my 15 minutes and how SWEET they were. I loved the dark cabinets and wood paneling in his 70's style house. If you have ever been in a house in Preston Idaho (I have) you would howl. He wears a Ricks College T-shirt. Beautiful! I love it when he says ""fetch"" , ""oh my heck"", and ""gosh"". Having attended Ricks College, I was howling when I heard him say things like that. RUN don't walk to see this one. It is truly one of a kind.",Napoleon Dynamite
797,jd2461a,"Weird, Wacky Fun",9,15 August 2004,"Napoleon Dynamite is an offbeat film that defies normal description. Napoleon is a stereotypical nerd in many of the superficial ways of Hollywood, but for once there is something much deeper going on and an attention to detail that makes the movie delightful. Napoleon remains himself throughout in all of his social awkwardness and bad attitude, but somehow he acquires a kind of grace. I disagree with the previous reviewer that said there were no laugh-out-loud moments in this movie. I laughed fairly frequently and when I wasn't laughing (except for those moments of ""aw poor guy"" that inevitably happen) I had a huge grin on my face. It's a sweet movie with an offbeat sense of humor and a flair for slapstick that I haven't seen in years. Napoleon, Pedro, and Deb are great characters, and I thought the movie was lots of fun. Note for those of you going to the movie- stick through the credits, there is an added bonus.",Napoleon Dynamite
798,rgrant1,Loved this movie,10,18 March 2006,"I can really relate to this flick. I had a friend in high school that was a lot like Kip and I could have been Napoleon. I even have a picture of myself in a suit that I wore to my first dance that looks a lot like what ND wore to the dance. This films timing is great, the set ups for the jokes are perfect and the pace is just right so that when the punch line is delivered you just have to laugh. I have watched this movie at least a dozen times and have enjoyed it every time. In talking to others that have watched this film I have not found anyone who hated it. This is a film that can be enjoyed by people of all ages; my 12 year old loves it as do many of my 40 something friends.",Napoleon Dynamite
799,buckymont,"entertaining for some, a waste of time for others",8,12 October 2005,"I enjoyed the movie and certainly knew people and know people who live parallel lives to all the characters. But I can see why some may find the movie an utter waste. I guess I've learned to appreciate movies of this sort ... no plot, no deep meaning, just snippets of living. ""Slacker"" and ""Dazed and Confused"" (both filmed in my hometown, Austin TX) come to mind. I think another of the same type is ""Clerks"". I hated ""Clerks"" though, had to turn it off mid-movie. The ratings for this movie are either good or bad... with an average of good. Maybe a standard deviation should be included to the score?!?!""Napolean Dynamite"" held my interest. I guess I liked Napolean. I was a nerd and outcast in High School but I didn't have the expressiveness and confidence that Napolean has. I would have been drawn to Napolean and I guess I was in the movie. I wanted to here his loud exasperations and see his odd antics. I wanted to find out what happened to him. There was much in the movie I related too. Maybe that's why I liked it. I didn't find the movie perfect... I would have made some changes if it were my movie. I would have tried to make it more realistic and less ""sanitized"". I'm not saying the characters aren't, they actually all are very real. But I remember often feeling very real dangers at school and cruelty as well as senseless harm (stabbings, suicides, drug & alcohol related accidents, teenage pregnancy, ugly racial & ethnic tensions, gay bashing). I'm sure Napolean would have maintained his confidence and self-esteem through that as well, but I guess that would be a different movie then.",Napoleon Dynamite
800,mbelli-1,Very funny and complex in it's simplicity,10,1 August 2005,"What a brilliantly funny, surreal, strange trip ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is.The central character, Jared Hess, is perfectly cast as a lovable but chronically goofy high school dork and the supporting cast is equally outstanding managing to maintain a deadpan tone throughout the entire motion picture.Unfortunately, ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is a film that you'll either ""get"" or you wont! There's no middle ground here. But if you give this movie a chance, you'll be rewarded with a strong point of view, a social conscious and bold statements about our culture, and in a much larger context, about this strange, wonderful, twisted journey we call life. A journey where people do and say strange things and where ambition or action might not propel to a higher level or contribute to mankind. Napoleon's amplified absurdity reinforces the idea that life on this planet is here to primarily be -- to simply exist.Why film critics have been so hard on this movie, when Hollywood keeps torturing us with mindless sequels and remakes, regurgitating old ideas and concepts with little or no improvement, is beyond me.Sure there's flaws. We've all seen bits and pieces from ""Napoleon"" in other comedies. As well, the documentarian tone isn't entirely unique. But along with Wes Anderson's ""Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"", Napoleon creates a new comedic strain, one that is more biting, more clever, funnier and more soul searching than an average teen comedy.So watch the film and don't worry about it's low pulse or that it doesn't follow typical Hollywood structure. Enjoy ""Napoleon Dynamite"" for what it is and what the filmmakers intended. A smart, funny study on the weirdness of humanity and the beauty, connection and warmth that that weirdness provides.",Napoleon Dynamite
801,javis-1,a waste of time,1,5 February 2005,"many people have commented on how this movie is funny but its no. there is no humor here, there is no plot here there is idea here !the acting was terrible, the script was terribleseriously i know no self respecting person who watched twenty minutes of it.unless you want to have your I.Q dropped by ten points by the stupidity of this movie, don't even look at it.but what befuddles me the most aside from the fact this hit theaters, is how it got a 7.3?well i guess it matters on your taste ,but if you like GOOD movies, with PLOT, and DECENT ACTING , don't watch this movie",Napoleon Dynamite
802,SpookyDog321,Eeech.,1,28 December 2004,"Napoleon Dynamite, the title itself intrigued me, and the ad campaign led me to believe I was going to see a true underdog story, with no plot, and shtick. I was so excited about what a delicious combination that would be, then I actually saw the movie. Eeeech. The jokes were, at best, poor prepackaged quotes, really only funny when spouted back and forth between friends. I also don't like the way this movie advocates drugs, as you'd have to be on something to enjoy it. I think the premise for the movie was great, and the opening credits were very enjoyable, but after that, the movie leaves you wanting more. If you really are interested in random shtick and immature jokes, check out ""Freddie Got Fingered"". It's a terrible movie, but it's a terrible well done movie.",Napoleon Dynamite

You could watch this with a two year old or with a fifty six year old- it wouldn't matter, they would both think it was hilarious! This movie follows the misadventures of a dim witted high school senior who I believe doesn't close his mouth once during the film. The movie really has no plot except towards the end when Napoleon Dyanamite tries to help his friend Pedro when class president. Not one line of this movie wasn't funny, each time I watch it I hear new things.All I can say about this movie is that it is HILARIOUS and everyone should see it before they die.",Napoleon Dynamite
804,franland13,my favorite movie of 2004,10,8 January 2005,"I fell in love with this movie ten seconds into it. Surprisingly, it's the one thing my two teenagers and I agree on--this movie is fantastic. Jon Heder's reactions are by turns extreme ""how was school today, napoleon?"" ""WORST DAY OF MY LIFE. WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?"" and goofily subtle: ""can you bring me my Chapstick?"" We just quote lines to each other all day long: 'are you guys having a killer time?' ""lucky"" ""I'm practicing to be a cage fighter"" 'it would be nice if you could pull me into town' 'think anybody thinks i'm a loser cause i go home to Starla?"" ""i see you're drinking one percent milk. is that cause you think you're fat?"" ""I caught you a delicious bass"" and more. then of course, there's the physical humor. Uncle Rico throwing a steak at napoleon's head. that dance.(don't want to give anything away, but it is pretty fabulous.) napoleon's furious tetherball moves. If you get the DVD, you can see a great kickball session where Napoleon slaps Don and Don goes down. it's hard to describe this movie, but as much as I love it, there are people who don't like it at all and don't enjoy the humor. Me? i bought three copies. One for me and two for friends.",Napoleon Dynamite

When I first saw it took about 10 minutes to get ""into the groove"" but when I did it was one of the funniest and goodhearted movies ever. it does seem flat and surreal at first...so does life sometimes especially teenage life..all that heightened hormonal, not fully cognitive goings on juxtaposed to the intense busy/emptiness of daily life. First saw it in an empty theatre or nearly so.Understand, that as a 52 year old female it took a moment for me to get napoleon...now I have a greater love for all the slack jawed, gaze avoiding youth of the late 80,s and 90's. A rich fantasy life and such frustration underneath the apparent ""not there"" It was a revelation as to what lurks beneath the uncertain surface.And oh, yes...did i say it was funny.....I suppose someone, somewhere hates chocolate but I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't love Napoleon. Vote Pedro! !!!!!!CORNDOG and Tots!!!!! In fact if you hate it I would suggest a little self-reflection in the areas of hardheartedness,nerd and geek denial, snobbery.

The acting is horrible, the people are so boring, there is no plot to connect anything to, and most of the humor is just retarded mess that maybe a little child of 5 would laugh at. I mean while watching this i just wanted to hit myself in the face. This movie IS good if you're having a hard time trying to sleep and you turn on the TV to put it in. You'll probably have the greatest sleep of your life. All in all this movie is no more than a 3. Every element in the movie is just boring. Rent Dumb and Dumber, which you've probably seen a thousand times, and watch it. It'll be funnier.",Napoleon Dynamite

The protagonist plays the standard sedated, king-of-his-own-worlds teen and does absolutely nothing.

So many people complained to me that it was boring, there is no swearing, etc. A lot of people are put off by the characters because they are ""pathetic"". That just shows how THEY look at life. People like Napolean Dynamite are pathetic, therefore cease to exist, and are ultimately less important than anyone else. That isn't the way that I think. I've had friends like Napolean Dynamite. The thing I liked about this movie, was the overall theme. People are people. Everyone in this movie was real. I know these people. I grew up with these people. I didn't think they were pathetic because they wore fanny packs and had pony tails on the side of their head, or because they wore winter boots in the summer and talked about their crossbow skills. The weird people make life more interesting. What fun would it be if everyone was ""normal"" like the stupid jocks and cheerleaders. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I would love to see more movies that follow the lead of this one. Life is random, and so is this movie. If you want everything neatly packaged and straight to the point, don't watch this movie.

809,jhool,Straight out of the 80's this movie is like Valium (in a good way).,9,22 October 2007,"Napoleon Dynamite is a surreal character-based nerd-makes-good film. I personally loved, it, and while I can see how people would find it boring, I can't understand how anyone could actually hate it.The movie comes out looking and feeling quite surreal. Although the film is clearly meant to be set around 2000, at any given time you could be forgiven for thinking it is a seventies or early eighties period piece. This lack of a concrete era of time gives the movie a dreamy kind of quality.Some of the colours and images in the film are really beautiful, from the rolling hills of Idaho and the clear blue skies, to the brown seventies style homes, cars and clothes. Anyone who went to school in the late seventies through to the late eighties will get this film.The main character Napoleon Dynamite, is the type of maybe slightly retarded Dungeons and Dragons type nerd that we all knew (or were) in school. His angst and blatant lies about his ninja skills and magical abilities are totally not self-conscious. This is another aspect of the film that is a little surreal. Napoleon is hassled by bullies, but it is not cruel, it is almost a cordial kind of nerd-bully relationship. Being an outsider doesn't seem to get him down in any way, although he does seem vaguely annoyed at everything and everyone. These and other human interactions in the film definitely don't have the kind of edginess and fear of real human interactions.This could also be the downfall of the movie. There is no real protagonist, there is no real tension or resolution of, well... anything. It is just a window into these peoples lives where some stuff happens. This is not ""American Pie"" or ""Something about Mary"", there are a few moments of what I like to call ""moron humour"", especially with the comic relief of Uncle Rico or La Fawnduh, but mostly it is just hanging out in a simpler time with simple characters who are nonetheless great fun to spend time with.",Napoleon Dynamite
810,steven_chase79,Film of the year??,10,11 December 2004,"I'll keep this short and simple. This is a film that is virtually impossible to provide a synopsis for. The film is actually about nothing. Thats right, nothing. I can not even begin to try and describe the plot of the film because there is none. Although many people would see this as a major flaw for any film, Napoleon Dynamite is without a doubt the exception to the rule. I love this film.From the moment you first see Napoleon to the end credits you will not have stopped laughing for 86 minutes. The film is superb.If you have a sense of humour then it would be a crime if you did not go to see this movie. If only more production studios were pumping money into films like this then the likes of Van Helsing may never have happened.In summary, go see this film. It is superb. That is all.",Napoleon Dynamite
811,currerdell,Dry humour falls just short of being funny,3,21 December 2004,"First of all let me say that the end of Napolean Dynamite is GREAT. Other than that, the best things I can say about this movie is that it tried hard and was relatively creative. However, I sat through most of the movie with my face completely expressionless, pausing to laugh just once throughout most of the movie -- and that was because of an extra's expression. I think that one of the things that disappointed me most about Napolean Dynamite was its lack of charisma. So many of the things said could have been so funny if they were said slightly differently. Instead, the humour was neither outrageously flamboyant nor subtly ironic, it just was. So blandly so that anything humorous about it was dished out in the form of stupidity alone. Napolean's excessively stupid humour soon put me into a trance that I only was able to get out at the end when -- well, if you're honestly going to watch this movie then I won't tell you what happens. However, I must commend the actors for getting into character with such a gusto that they became what they were supposed to become: caricatures of reality.",Napoleon Dynamite
812,haysonhang,Awful - Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen,1,30 January 2005,"This movie is very good for one reason only --- Putting Me To Sleep! I can not believe that this movie is rated 7 out of 10. Who is rating this movie? I watched about 30 minutes of it then fast forwarded through the rest. Even then it was boring. This movie had no plot that I could find. It had no action (unless you count his dance as action) and it was not funny at all. The characters was dull and sloth-like. Everything about this movie was slow and mind numbing. I cannot believe they wasted the film to create it. Did I mention yet how much I hated this movie?? I know many people have different opinions about this film so to compare noted I did like Cellular, Colatteral, Coronado and Dodgeball. I did not like the Grudge or Cookout.

813,steve-1553,"Oh, this is TOO realistic",10,16 February 2006,"First of all, I thought Napolean Dynamite was one of the weirdest, funniest films I've seen in years. Interestingly, I liked it better the second time around. But the film is not for everyone; my wife couldn't stand the film, and we have incredibly similar taste in movies (and books).But here's my main point: I teach at a university, and for reasons I won't bore you with, I wound up showing Napolean Dynamite (ND) to a class on counseling children and adolescents. One of my students almost went crazy...turns out she is from the very same town (in Idaho) ND was filmed in, and yes the kids are JUST like that. Even the goofy part in which Pedro courts Deb by baking her a cake...this kind of gift-giving is a real tradition in that part of Idaho. In fact, the tradition is to be as weird as possible, so compared with other ""gifts"" boys and girls give each other in Idaho, Pedro's cake was very tame. By way of comparison, my student told me how a boy who courted her once gifted her with a chicken, innards an all, and when she cleaned out the bird she found a note inside it declaring his love! Now that kind of story just can NOT be made up. So is ND realistic? Apparently so! More than I realized!",Napoleon Dynamite
814,missy_cobb,Best movie of the year!,10,22 December 2004,"I just watched this movie, and I must say that I busted a gut laughing from start to finish!! This movie was like like a ""cut of butta"". The next best thing to Welcome to the Doll house (another must see movie!) The guy that plays Napoleon is classic! He is pretty ""friggin"" witty. I love his tone throughout the movie. I can't believe that the little girl that played in such movies as Corina Corina and Andre was the girl Deb in this flick. She did a wicked job in her role. For anyone that says that this movie ""sucked"" or was the worst movie ever...open your eyes and see the art and the comedy of this film.

I found this movie to be the worst I've ever seen, higher, actually, than Gigli, and I ""get"" the jokes, but I just thought they were terrible. I have a great sense of humor, and while I wasn't a ""nerd"" in high school, I can appreciate most humor. This wasn't funny. This was pointless. This was the cinematic equivalent of excrement.

I just feel that as a public servant, I need to tell you how absolutely horrendous Napoleon Dynamite is.",Napoleon Dynamite
816,runissknight,Simply brilliant.,10,6 January 2005,"I had first seen this film in theaters several months ago- And it was, without a doubt one of the funniest films I had seen in a while. However, I had only recently been able to sit down and watch this film with enough concentration and enough focus to keep from laughing out loud just recently- And in the process confirmed to myself that this is one of, if not the best film I have ever seen.Granted, the film isn't for everyone. Despite what anyone says, there IS NO WAY to typecast people and determine who will and who won't like it- I have met or heard about people of all kinds, young and old, popular or otherwise, who have been on both sides of the fence. What I can safely say, however, is this: It's almost a flat-out guarantee that you will either love it or absolutely loathe it, and you can usually tell which it's going to be within the first 8 minutes of the film.One misconception I think many people reviewing or criticizing this film make tends to be that the movie revolves around making fun of one character, or presenting a character so undesirable that you laugh at the fact that you are not him. This is simply not true. Not only are many of the characters and events based fairly closely on actual people and experiences, but Napoleon is not the only character with problems- Most of the characters in the film are subject to some sort of joke or humiliation at some point.Also, people have a tendency to mention the fact that the film has almost no storyline. Some people hate the film for this reason, but most tend to say ""It doesn't hurt it."" Honestly, I personally believe this helps the film. The fact that it is basically devoid of a plot I think serves as a vessel to tell the viewer that this is a film about life- It happens in moments, but it is more the people, not some underlying cause, which causes it to be memorable.Simply put, I found the film to be far deeper than I remembered it being after watching it the second or third time. Sure, it's hilarious, but especially watching the final scene (Before the credits) made me realize ""Wow. This actually means something to me."" Ahead, I'm going to break down this scene as I saw it. If you haven't seen the film, it may be best not to read on, if you really don't want to know how it ends... To begin, there is a claim that Deb and Napoleon's relationship is implied but, basically, nonexistent. I feel this scene could not disprove that more. Here are the facts. Napoleon is standing, alone, playing tetherball by himself. An action you've seen him do several times before in the film. Although the only person he ever specifically asks to play with him is Summer, we notice that nobody has ever joined him in a game of tetherball, which appears to be one of the few activities he has a particular fondness for. Deb approaches. After a brief and awkward exchange about 'delicious bass', the two end up playing a game of tetherball together, while the song ""The Promise"" plays in the background. I have listened to the aforementioned song well over 200 times in the past 4 days (Wow, that's sad), and I've found that if the words to this song do not represent devotion or love, not much else could have. Though I can't quote the entire song, I believe two of the lines from it show this particularly well: First, there is ""You know in the end, I'll always be there."". Second, ""If I had to walk the world, and make you fall for me, I promise you, I promise you I will.""At any rate, an absolutely hilarious film, with a surprising amount of depth- If you take the time to look for it.",Napoleon Dynamite
817,What_Its_Like82190,dang,8,7 January 2005,"this movie is awesome. at the beginning i thought that maybe some things i heard bad about it might be true. but, after 10 minutes of napoleon, you're hooked. i kinda looked down upon this at first after seeing it was pg. it seems like today everything that comes out pg is a piece of s***. but, i heard such great reviews from my friends, so, reluctantly i picked it up. i love the simple dialog and script of this movie. if you do watch it don't expect to see the greatest script in the world, but expect a lot cause you get a lot. i mean, after seeing it once i couldn't help seeing it again. and again. and again. so, over all, i say rent this one if not buy it, and watch it... and watch it some more.",Napoleon Dynamite
818,fingolfin1,Clearly not everybody's cup of tea but....,8,10 January 2005,"I absolutely loved this film. Being fed-up to the back teeth with puerile, pre-pubescent toilet humour which has been rife in comedy films of late, this film was a breath of fresh air. The direction is such that you feel complete ambivalence from the film makers concerning whether you ""get"" this film or not. I personally like that where comedy is concerned. The humour is mostly of the wry grin variety, although I was reduced to fits of hysteria in parts. The principal actors do an excellent job and portray characters who are very easy to like. The supporting cast are equally good, with a couple of outstandingly loathsome, yet funny characters. If you enjoy rooting for the downtrodden nerd, or indeed if you are such an individual, you will enjoy this film. Just don't expect it to explain itself to you.",Napoleon Dynamite

820,murph0613,An Unusual Film for an Unusual Generation...,4,11 January 2005,"OK, this movie is nearly impossible to rate unless you have seen it at least twice. Therefore, if you watch it, and don't like it, watch it again and give it a second chance.To say that this movie ""celebrates the nerd in all of us"" is mildly accurate. The ending, however, ruins that statement. This movie is actually fairly realistic (I felt pangs of anxiety as I watched my own adolescence re-enacted in this movie), but the ending is ridiculous.In fact, this whole movie is ridiculous.Which makes it funny, from a certain point of view.Your reaction to this film (laugh or don't laugh) may very well be determined by your age. As a 30-something, I found it difficult to laugh at most of the movie, because the plot was so incoherent, and the flow of the movie was horrible. The music also detracted from the overall picture. So, as I sat there, listening to the awful music, watching the horrible plot line, and the pitiful characters, I completely missed the humor within.However, I must say that my friends who are under 25 find this the funniest movie they've ever seen.It seems that the younger generation is not expecting as much out of their entertainment along the lines of story, acting, music, flow, and presentation. They are more interested in raw, genuine personalities, which this movie definitely has. They are able to overlook the flaws of this film to see the genius within.And believe me, they overlook a LOT of flaws in this one. I hear teenagers in the local high school walk through the halls and quote the movie, putting on their best ""Napoleon"" voice. Then they giggle hysterically as the next person does his/her best to outdo the last one. I've seen small freshman girls and big, burly senior boys alike act the same way when it comes to this movie.When you ask them what was so funny, they can't tell you. But they also can't stop laughing. When I pointed out the the music sucked, the plot was non-existent and the characters were ridiculous, they agreed. Then they just quote another Napoleon line and start laughing all over again.Will this movie become a cult classic? You bet. I'm saddened that I am now too old (mentally) to be able to find the humor in this, but I'm heartened that someone is making our kids laugh. They need that ""laugh of their own"". This movie has it.Never fear, if you're older than 25 and you found this movie funny, that just shows that you're young at heart. (Or maybe emotionally young, I don't know!) There's nothing wrong with that. Laugh hard and loud - that's what the creators of this movie wanted you to do! All that being said, I give this film a 4. Low rating, to be sure, but then, I'm one of those ""old"" people who just didn't get it. I'm so glad that there are those of you out there that did. I pray for my future, as you are probably the ones who will care for me when I'm old!",Napoleon Dynamite
821,JohnDubya,Great movie . . . after the first time,10,24 January 2005,"I absolutely love this movie . . . but I didn't at first. The first time you watch it, you wonder what the heck is going on, and only a couple of the parts are funny. But then by the end, you realize how ridiculous most of the movie is. And every time you watch it henceforth, it will become funnier because you are looking for the funny parts. If you've only seen the movie once, you have to watch it again (even if you think it's torture). Chances are, you will find it funnier the second time.This movie has my kind of humor in it. It is not stand-up comedy type of jokes, but just dry humor. The dryness of the main characters adds to the humor in the movie. Some viewers may not catch the humor in the characters' dryness, which will ruin the movie for them. I have also heard from some people that they didn't enjoy the movie because they felt that the makers of Napolean were making fun of the ""geeks."" But I did not watch the movie like that at all. I found most of the things that Napolean and the other characters did to be funny and pretty out there.",Napoleon Dynamite

I often have used the cheeky film to would-be geeks as a warning that once a geek-of-the-week always a geek. I thought it was quite humorous. The film was original and the location of the film added to the nerdiness of the plot. The actors were fresh and young in experience, which added to the uniqueness of the action. The music that accompanied the the scenes was perfect.",Napoleon Dynamite
823,epscylonb,A film that shouldn't be dismissed,8,27 January 2005,"This is a film that is very easy for serious film critics to dismiss but they definitely shouldn't. This is a film of our time and quite neatly defines the condition of young people in the middle of this decade. Call it generation Y or whatever else you want but this is above anything else a great representation of current youth culture.Its a comedy but there are very few (if any) genuine laugh out loud moments, despite this the film is immensely watchable. Driven by the lead character who shares his name with the title of the film, the plot is so invisibly thin that looking back after watching the film its difficult to point out what actually happened, indeed its debatable whether there was anything interesting or memorable in the narrative at all. Most traditional Hollywood films follow a narrative structure, the protagonist always undergoes some kind of change during the story, he succeeds, he fails, etc. Napoleon Dyanamite doesn't really change at all, but as said earlier this is a character led film not a story based one.Napoleon spends most of his time in a completely catatonic state, he gets beaten up by a bully and just carries on with his life regardless. In teen films of the past this would be the point where Napoleon vows to get his revenge and would eventually turn the tables in a feat of bravery and heroism. Napoleon's reactions are great, whether something good or bad happens to him he sounds exactly the same and most of the time acts the same. This is generation Y, feeling neither the highs or the lows.I'm not sure why watching this hapless character live his life is so enjoyable, while this film wont have you in hysterics it is gently amusing throughout.",Napoleon Dynamite
824,death2steelers,Not Realistic?,10,27 January 2005,"This movie is quite possibly the funniest movie ever. It doesn't have much of a storyline, but in this case, it doesn't matter. I keep reading reviews that say it isn't believable. Anyone who has attended High School in the last 10 years knows that this movie portrays exactly what it is like. Who doesn't know someone exactly like Napoleon? Or Pedro? Or Summer? Or Deb? Or Don? There are Napoleons, Pedros, Summers, Debs, and Dons in EVERY American High School. One of the funniest parts about this movie is that it IS so accurate. And who hasn't run across an internet geek like Kip? This movie is filled with jokes about our culture today. I haven't met one person yet who has seen it and not liked it. Talk about a cult classic in the making. The film uses witty humor, and a little goofy humor. It's the PERFECT film for light comedy. If you're into those kind of films that make you think a lot, this one definitely isn't for you. On the other hand, if you laugh at things like Napoleon getting psyched for a milk-testing contest, or lying about hunting wolverines in Alaska, exaggerating about his bow staff skills or his brother bragging about chatting online with ""babes"" all day, you can't go wrong.

825,AmM_xo_LnS_101004,Great movie!!!!!,10,29 January 2005,I LOVE NAPOLEON DYNAMITE!!! Napoleon Dynamite was a great movie. The first time I saw it I was with my bf and I don't think that I have laughed that hard in my laugh. I watch ND every time I go to bf house. Some people will love it and some people will hate it. Almost all of my friends love the ND! So many people copy what he does. My favorite part in the movie is were ND is dancing! My friend and I are going to do the dance for our talent show and some of them sounds just like him...my bf likes the MOON BOOTS and when he tells Deb that he likes her sleeves. This movie is so great!!!!!!! I recommend everyone to go see NAPOLEON DYNAMITE!!!!!!,Napoleon Dynamite
826,marcojurassi,Napoleon is bland,2,30 January 2005,"I rented this film at Blockbuster to see what all the buzz was about, both negative and positive. I had friends tell me, ""This film sucks."" and others say, ""It is brilliant."" After a viewing, I have one word to describe it...boring. I'm not opposed to the minimalist style of the film or the fact it has no plot. What I didn't like was that the characters had no personality. It seems the writer wanted to show what a real born loser high school nerd is like and I found Napoleon a few steps below the nerds I remember from high school. I think Spaz from Meatballs was a far more compelling character and much more entertaining than Napoleon, and that is a sad fact. I think anything with 'MTV films', on it is usually drivel. I think the some of the sight gags were a little funny, the kind that make you smile and say, 'gee that was sorta amusing', and definitely not the kind that made me laugh out loud. I was not entertained at all by this film.",Napoleon Dynamite

You have to appreciate the lifestyle of all the characters, that's hilarious in it self. And the dance scene at the end, forget about it. I couldn't flippin breathe.

I can't stop using them every chance I get.",Napoleon Dynamite
828,Eisenhicks,Could become a cult classic,7,4 November 2005,"John Heder is absolutely brilliant as Napoleon Dynamite, a lovable loser who finds his way. Set in a mid-west town, the landscape is as dry as the humor. But watch Napoleon; he become more hilarious as the movie goes along. It has all the elements of a cult classic, such as ""A Christmas Story"": a lovable loser as the hero, a weird grandmother and snake oil uncle, an apparently gay brother with a city (surprise not given) girlfriend; a buddy, in the duller-than-Napoleon, Pedro; the beautiful girl and her friend, who blow off Napoleon and Pedro; and a love interest in the only known actor in the film, Tina Majorino. Not for everyone, but if you liked ""Better Off Dead"" you might like this one. I do think guys will like this movie more than girls, but girls might appreciate Majorino's character.",Napoleon Dynamite
829,KaseGauner,Don't try so hard next time,3,26 May 2005,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, and afterward I decided that it wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen. But I have seen Glitter more times than I'd like to admit.I really can't get over the acting. The actors have very monotone voices, And there's little to no character development throughout the film. The plot's basically just following Napolean while we met all these unneeded characters who are just quirky for the sake of being quirky.I did enjoy the dancing scene on stage. I was falling out of my seat laughing. I give em that much.I watched it a second time in my film class this semester and had the same thoughts.3 out of 10 in my opinion",Napoleon Dynamite
830,Cc3980,"Very Funny, Very Stupid",8,27 February 2005,"Napolian Dynamite epitomizes the stupid teen movie. If you are looking for a movie with substance and meaning, Napolian Dynamite is not for for you. Jon Heder fit the role of Napolian beautifully as did Jon Gries (Uncle Rico), and Aaron Ruell (Kip). The film takes place in a rural Idaho town and follows the lives of a some-what awkward family, but yet a family that we can all relate to. Napolian Dynamite was pretty much what I expected, no more, no less. It was hilarious, but yet stupid and had no deeper meaning than to make us laugh. Personally, I thought this movie was very funny and as a student, I could relate more to the Napolians and Pedros of the world, but this is defiantly one of those movies that is not for everyone, although everyone should experience the ""flippin sweet"" adventures of Napolian Dynamite.",Napoleon Dynamite
831,SquareEyesMacTelly,Key question,10,19 July 2006,"Have just seen this film and came on here to praise it and compare notes - very surprised to see all the negative reaction. This film takes the standard American teen high school films of the eighties and injects them with a healthy dose of realism. The result is a comedic masterpiece. Superb casting, script, artwork, pacing and set piece comedy  a brilliantly understated celebration of the teenage condition, freed from the sanitised, sentimental fantasy of earlier archetypes. This film is funny because it allows us to look back at our teenage years and laugh at the absurdity of it all. There is a little piece of all these characters in ALL of us, both male and female, to varying degrees. If you don't find it funny, or even if you found it uncomfortable to watch, it might just be because you are subconsciously aware of the Napoleon in you, but have been trying to repress it, rather than embrace and celebrate your inner Napoleon. The key moment to understanding this film is the silence that follows Napoleon's dance 'skit' in front of the whole school. Did you want them to break into applause or to be sitting, mouths agog, in stony silence?",Napoleon Dynamite
832,dragonlord_92111,Best movie of 2004!,10,5 March 2005,"Napoleon Dynamite is a heartwarming tale of a nerdy high school student and his life. It's highly funny and the characters are really likable. Between his friends Pedro (a Mexican transfer student from Juarez), Deb (a girl who takes and sells personally done photos), and Napoleon himself they're all cool in their own way. There isn't supposed to be a plot. it's just a whole bunch of scenes spliced together to make a film, but that's not a bad thing. In fact, it's the exact opposite. It makes the movie funny. The school dance scene is good. But the best scene is when Napoleon dances to some 80's disco music for Pedro's Presidential election skit. The other supporting characters are developed nicely too. You see how much of a bitch Summer and her pals are.The setting is an interesting choice. It's a spoof of the 80's, but set in the mid-90's. You can easily tell it's in the 90's because of the inclusion of internet chat rooms.Pretty much it's an all around fantastic movie. The way they ended it by having Napoleon and Deb play a game of volleyball was a sweet and sentimental moment to always remember. Plus, the movie will give you a whole bunch of new catchphrases to annoy haters of the movie with.",Napoleon Dynamite

If this movie hadn't simply suck my energy dry, i would've kicked him out the door. This is a comedy? Unique, yes, that i'll grant it. No one ever dared put so much s**t on a film roll before. This is a good movie to punish adults with. I'd seriously rather take the beating of my life than watch this filth again! It's like drinking warm beer in Sahara. This is for all you people out there that liked this: send me an email titled ""why i liked this movie"", then go jump off a building! It's not funny! It's not in the vicinity of funny! God dammit, it's not a MOVIE! Structure? No. Any kind of plot? No. Identifying with any of the characters? Hell no. Who the hell identifies with any of those characters? They are retarded! I feel sick! I remember one time, during high-school, a class-mate got put in a mental hospital for a nervous break-down ( and stealing some money and running away with a guy three times her age...anyway) and we all went to visit. Well, this movie is worse! Much worse! It's actually funnier seeing a guy bang his head against the wall for 2 hours! I could write a novel just about how much i hated this movie! Did i say movie? Hah! I don't want to give the impression that i didn't like this movie. I HATED it!

834,pgray86,"Plot less, Pointless",2,16 March 2005,"I'm going to go ahead and spoil this movie, nothing happens. Absolutely nothing. I know some would argue that this is the funniest movie they've seen in years, but there comes a point when a movie can't be valued if it has no purpose. Even the so called humor is vacant and dull. It's like one big inside joke that the MTV generation supposedly gets. (Or is trying to get) I honestly believe that the only reason people like this movie is because of its publicity. Not only is Napoleon Dynamite over-hyped, the comedy in it never gave me a chuckle or grin. The best way to describe this movie is like watching two people have a dull conversation. Granted some humor can be found from the character Kip, and the acting isn't necessarily good or bad, but overall the experience isn't worth the price.",Napoleon Dynamite
835,igrieve1,Something to think about,10,24 March 2005,"The first time I saw Napoleon Dynamite, I thought it was just another stupid comedy, but then I saw it again and I learned to appreciate some of the more subtle nuances of the characters. The reason that I found Napoleon so funny was not that it was a reflection of high school life in any way at all. Maybe it's just that my hometown resembles Preston Idaho, but almost every scene in the movie portrayed some emblem from my elementary school years; the bumpers in the bowling alley, the girl with the side ponytail, the multi-colored lockers, the yes/no notes. Every time I laughed at Napoleon, I was laughing at all of the things I did in my k-5 years that made me think I was cool. Napoleon and the kids at his school are personifications of the most extreme examples of elementary behavior, and the whole experience is another way for us to look back on ourselves and laugh.",Napoleon Dynamite

The way I see it, either you hate it or you love it...nothing in between...This has become one of my favorite movies of all time and I encourage people to give it a chance.

Absolutely loved it. It is really, really funny. Many people who I know loved it. The only problem is everyone quotes it but it's hard not to. There are such good lines. But a good part of the movie is that you can find T-Shirts and buttons on it so if you forgot it, it helps you remember it. It is a good movie I give it two thumbs up.",Napoleon Dynamite

Boy was I disappointed. Now the Napoleon Dynamite character himself is mildly amusing, he definitely gets a few laughs, especially with his dance routine. But other then that, it's a very poorly made movie, the dialog is weak, the characters are at best one dimensional, and the plot, wait was there a plot? Now I'm all for independent films that aren't full of action or in your face comedy, but only if they have interesting characters and good dialog, this movie didn't.But really the main thing with this movie was the lack of entertainment value, bored is the only emotion I had during most of the movie.",Napoleon Dynamite

When I found out that the director had gone to BYU it all came together.This is the kind of film that Mormons love. I imagine them having church kids nights or something where all the parents are glad their children are watching this clean wholsome movie.However, the problem is that the film confuses 'profanity' with 'obscenity.' Yes the language is clean, but the laughs arise from the audiences feelings of superioriy over the characters. From the opening scenes we take the perspective of the bullies, sitting in classes and laughing at Napolean as he talks about hunting wolverines or the lochness monster.The film is clearly a ripoff of 'Welcome to the Dollhouse,' the older brother being a computer nerd and so forth; though it's as if a Mormon had seen the film and said ""oh this could be funny if it weren't so profane."" This film revels in laughing at people who the director finds inferior, and that is the true obscenity.This film is a work of cruelty.",Napoleon Dynamite
841,Marman1209,I really hope they don't make a second one,2,26 May 2005,"After I first heard about this movie, I really wanted to go see it. The anticipation was building up in me for a while, even though I waited to see it for cheaper at a second-run theater Definitely one of the better decisions I've made in my lifetime.Sure, since I had such high expectations for this film, I laughed at a couple of the scenes. I laughed when he first feed the llama, and when he danced but that was about it. I walked out of that theater confused, what in the world had I just watched? Nothing, really. I couldn't find any real sustenance in this movie. It uses really simple humor to be funny. Which is fine, but this movie is so widely loved by so many people, and it just doesn't make sense.It is also impossible to watch this movie more than once, lest you risk hating its guts. Without the high expectations I had the first time around, this movie is just tedious.I know they're going to make a second one, considering how popular this one was. Makes me sick.",Napoleon Dynamite
842,elhombreplatano,Funny sometimes... Sad more often.,6,18 August 2005,"The hype surrounding this movie is exaggerated. It is funny, and it does show true funny situations which probably all of us not-so-long-ago-high-school-students can relate to and even remember episodes which probably didn't look all that different.The movie has intention, but does not deliver. Although that is not my main concern. The movie is fine, it does make you laugh, and pretty hard sometimes if you can get the jokes, but underneath is a much more disturbing story.What is sad about this movie is how it portrays American teenagers: the way they are. And not just their personalities, but they way they live, act, think, behave and reason. It is very accurate and that's why this is an important movie. It portrays American teenagers as they are: lost, superficial, ignorant, aggressive, stupid, alone, fearful, regretful, and alienated. This movie could and probably should be used as part of a sociological study because this is the result of the American way, they American lifestyle.Freedom in America has resulted in an idea of ""freedom"" which has brought growing up in the U.S. to this: people who are sociopaths and psychopaths. I do not mean to insult or harass anyone with these comments, but behind the funny situations and personalities, is an underlying message of the truth: there are no families, no real friends, no ""normal"" people (although now THIS is normal).Good movie. Simple but effective direction. Simple story. Heart. Big warning. Watch it, but remember my words and think about it...",Napoleon Dynamite
843,mastadson-1,Slowest movie since Eraserhead,2,24 May 2005,"It amazes me that this was a popular movie. There were several time I was wondering if anyone was going to talk again. It is baffling that a movie with no action and no dialog speaks to the American people. I am sure it saved trees though. It could not have taken more than one sheet of paper to print the screenplay. I was impressed that there were more laughs in this movie than Lost In Translation. That was another movie with times I was not sure if someone was going to speak. It is not quite as bad as Eraserhead but it is high on the list of bad movies. I wish America would stop wasting there time with this mindless fare and stick to better films. There was no apparent effort put in buy anyone on this movie. This movie took place in the Eighties right? So where do they get some of this music from? Jamiroquai,Rouge Wave Figurine, and The Backstreet Boys are not Eighties artist. If this is supposed to be in the present it fails to convey it at all. The jokes hardly even made me chuckle. If I want to see humor done badly I will watch Viva La Bam or Jackass. No thanks to any one involved with this movie.",Napoleon Dynamite

I can't imagine an educated person laughing at this movie... It's not even silly- it's just plain dumb! The acting is pathetic (if you even dare to call it acting). The lighting is often horrible, the script is non-existent. I've seen funnier moments in commercials for starving kids in Ethiopia. There are MAYBE 2 decent ""one liners"" at the most, but even those didn't get me to actually laugh. How a cinema ever decided to invest in this piece of garbage is beyond me.

Being a teen is hard, but when your Napoleon Dynmite nothing is hard. I swear that kid has no shame. Thats whats so great about it though. Pedro is my favorite character just because of the way he talks about everything. It killed me how he actually thought ""the popular girl"" would go to the dance with him. The changes that Kip went through when he met La Fonda, were so dramatic. I think every teen goes through something similar at some point in time.

Thank God for DVD because there is no way I would have sat through this whole movie at a theater (I was at my sister's house and my 12 year-old nephew had it). I had to get up several times and find something else to do. How someone could actually like this 2 minute skit stretched into a full-length movie is beyond me.

I was (and still feel the effects of being...) a total social outcast. The pace was slow, the humour was over-the-top stereotypically nerd and the content was boring. My experience as a nerd did not amount to ridiculous conversations where there was nothing to say. (However, if there was Magic or Dungeons and Dragons conversations, we were there! Those at least have emotion) Overall, the script was emotionless. Not recommended, gosh! (Btw, go to gprime.net, click on the video clips and watch Napoleon's dance at the end to the Numa-Numa song. Much better!)",Napoleon Dynamite
848,kyrtstein,Cheese Whiz!,1,27 May 2005,"This movie blows like a tornado through Kansas.I think one of the reasons I hated this film so much is that it came so highly recommended from my friends that I fully expected a superbly written, directed, and filmed movie. On the contrary, this movie was poorly written, horribly directed, and looked like a couple of college students with a video camera filmed it.Seriously, take a look at the plot line of some kid that can't open his eyes for more than 5 seconds at a time, deliver lines like, ""stuuupid"" and ""you iddddiooott"" and then filming it like it was 1980 WAS NOT on purpose people! It was because the budget was under 300k and it was filmed in a town that hasn't changed since 1980.Another appeal to most movie goers is the fact that you can put yourself ""above"" this loser. I went to this film with four friends all of us blinked and walked out wondering how in the world this thing had a following, then realized that maybe most of America enjoys the thought of hanging a superhero out of a school bus by a string and watching it bounce down the road or like seeing a puffy red-headed kid walk around in moon boots with a brother that falls for a girl that looks like a transvestite on steroids.

So, I'm prepared for something along the lines of Joe Dirt, Dumb & Dumber or Good Burger (all of which I found too dumb to watch all the way through) - that's what I'm prepared for.But, with the opening five minutes, I'm laughing at the whole thing - Napoleon as a character, his mannerisms, facial expressions, his clothing, his interactions with the other kids - all of it. The whole room of us was laughing like we were high (but we weren't) and pausing and replaying bits of it.Each character is well developed, with his/her own mannerisms, background and drives. Also, the musical score was just as off the wall as the characters and the movie. This movie is a seamless garment. One thing that made it funny was the intentionality behind having not one swear word in the whole movie, substituting euphemisms like flippin', dang, gosh. jeez, etc. Really was very different from even family TV - and this added to the humor.I ended up buying my own DVD of it to watch during some of these boring Wyoming nights when I need a laugh and everyone within driving distance is a flippin' retard.

The only difference is that the main character of ""Dollhouse"" is an 11 year old female loser. The only reason why ""Dynamite"" hasn't been sued is because it has minor redeeming value in its various one liners. You have to see the brothers of both characters from both movies and ask yourself how someone can just blatantly steal another person's work.

There is little point really to the film, but sometimes those are the films that people will love the most! If you want to spend your evening creasing with laughter you've picked the right film! It's definitely one of those experiences where the main character will win you over, with quotes such as 'I like you sleeves' the understated comedy will have you in stitches. It has a very 80's styling as well which even though it isn't set in the 80's gives it a nostalgic, quirky feel. All in all well worth a second watch and a definite classic!",Napoleon Dynamite

This is a movie you either love like your children produced it or hate like Satan co-directed it. Full of dry, witty humor, and an unbeatably original plot, this movie is something I'd recommend to anyone who loves a good plot less film. It makes no sense. There is no storyline.

In fact, I seriously questioned the IQs of my ""friends"" who rented this movie for us to watch, telling me it was the funniest movie EVER.....that led to my questioning the IQs of most of my coworkers who quoted the movie for a couple of months (until they grew up, I guess).What was it about? I don't really know. A few days in the life of a few high school misfits, I guess would be the best description of the plot.Character development? There was none. Character ""devolvement"", perhaps.Save yourself a few $$ and a lot of agony...don't see this flick.",Napoleon Dynamite
856,Nmaster8,Pointless,1,11 July 2005,"Aside from the unique characters and their exaggerated mannerisms in this highly overrated film, Napoleon Dynamite falls flat. The story follows Napoleon's life in a rural community and it's about as interesting as spending a day sitting by yourself on the farm. Napoleon mutters quotes like ""Idiot"" and ""Maybe I will"" and runs like a pansy on several occasions throughout the movie. But the bottom line is that he just isn't funny. The movie feels like it was filmed in slow motion and there's hardly a driving force to pique viewers' interest. I guess I just don't get the point of this entire movie. It lacked heart and humor. This movie got far more credit than it deserved.",Napoleon Dynamite
857,hookworm56,Funny? How is this movie funny? Is it a clown for your amusement?,1,1 August 2005,"When my friend told me I had to see this movie, I was somewhat surprised at their level of excitement because the trailer just left me wanting NO MORE. My God was I right! This movie showed me BO funny bits, NO one liners, NO funny anything. What it did have was some interesting cinematography THAT'S IT! I questioned my oldest daughter (who said she liked the movie) and asked her to tell me just ONE funny or amusing bit from the movie. She couldn't and quipped, ""you just don't understand"". Well the proof was there, no scene no character, no dialog was funny. I LOVE comedies and I think Napoleon Dynamite is a blight on the landscape of comedy. MEL BROOKS (if he were dead - thank God he is still with us) would be rolling in his grave if he was forced to watch this comedy. What sense (or lack thereof) of humor do these promoters of this bland thing have? Please consider how valuable time is before ANYONE ever recommends this movie again! I consider the time I wasted watching NAPOLEON DYNAMITE as precious and completely gone never to be regained, and I am furious at my friend for suggesting I should watch it.",Napoleon Dynamite
858,ztsieg,Over-hyped? Probably.,4,15 May 2015,"In the years since its release, it has been featured on t-shirts, posters, fridge magnets, books of quotations, and basically anything a teenager would take to school (pens, pencils, binders, backpacks, literally anything). The way I've seen people react to it, I'd almost think it was the film that defined my generation.When I saw the movie, I had a hard time believing it was ever such a cultural phenomenon. It's not particularly good or, as some critics say, particularly bad -- but it is particularly boring. I only laughed once during the entire 96-minute run-time. I won't say that makes it a failure as a comedy, but it is definitely a failure when it came to keeping my attention.For a film that supposedly made an accurate representation of an Idaho community, I felt that none of the characters were particularly grounded in reality, Napoleon least of all, who is such an infamously rude jerk that it is probably why the film is so quotable. The problem then becomes: he is such a rude jerk that at no point in time did I find myself rooting for him or his efforts to help Pedro become class president....which, by the way, despite being the advertised plot point, the movie took just about half its run-time, if not more, to reach. I won't say here whether it is successful or not -- only that the way it is resolved comes from left-field and makes little sense.Those of you who have seen this movie can go ahead and tell me that's why it was supposed to be funny -- precisely because it didn't make sense. I will then say right back at you, that it is a lazy way to resolve the plot.",Napoleon Dynamite

I don't understand all the positive hype it has gotten. The movie is slow, bland, has very little plot or story and no real resolution. This movie is the biggest waste of an hour and a half I have seen since Johnny Be Good. If you can make it through until after the end credits, here is my spoiler, the wedding between Kip, the brother and his online girlfriend from Detroit, LaFawnduh is hilarious and their interaction during the movie when she comes to Idaho to meet him is, in my opinion, the only funny part of the movie. On the DVD, the deleted scenes are actually funnier than what made it into the movie, yes, they cut out the funniest bits. So, except for Kip and LaFawnduh, this was a stupid, pointless waste of a movie but because of its unexpected success, will probably spawn at least one sequel.

A lot people say this movie is boring...I don't think so. It's a kind of subtle and non-sense humor that will make you, at least!, smile. I din't get tons of laugh from this movie but i think this is not some kind of corny popular comedy that gives you an instant joke. It's horribly non-sensed. And that's great. However i think there are some terrible parts. Like that thing in the end where Napoleon makes Pedro win the election---> that's kind of idiotic because it was too predictable. The same thing goes to Napoleon's brother girlfriend. It was too obvious that it would turn out some hot babe and not another computer geek. Still i define this as modern absurdity. It took a little from Monty Python's non-sense and mixed it with a little bit of realism. It's an insane movie and a too slow one, but that was the main goal: an annoying story with absolutely no goddam sense that will make you desire for a few more minutes of this thing.",Napoleon Dynamite

The movie seemed kind of pointless. I remember seeing a lot of clips before seeing the initial movie. I thought these clips were hilarious but when it cam to watching the movie in a hole it wasn't the same. During the entire movie I probably laughed 3-5 times. Although there was bad there was a lot of good. I found that the movie had exceptional audio and acting. the script was good. In my opinion it showed a great cliché of what high-school is like today.

At the beginning he isn't popular at all, probably because of his look and style. His grandma was taking care of him and his uncle, suddenly she had to leave them alone with the lama and his other uncle Kip. Kip and Rico think about a good business idea and finally figure something out, which they think can make big money. At this point Napoleon is good friends with Pedro and they are thinking about who to take to prom. Napoleon asked one of his uncles customers daughters and she had to say yes cuz of her mum. The prom speech and dance is probably the highlight of the movie, when summer and Pedro hold their speeches and dance afterwards.

The movie was very slow and boring, and it wasn't really funny at all. There wasn't any action, either. I didn't like any of it except the last five minutes. The things that were supposed to be funny were not really funny at all. I didn't like any of the characters. The script was weak to the point of being lame. The quality of the actual film seemed more like that of a B-movie. I also object to this movie because it seems to poke fun at people who are a little slow or mentally retarded. The relative of one of the boys made fun of his nephew, and reflected little family love or concern for the boy. This movie reflected poorly on family life and family values.",Napoleon Dynamite

I think one of the main reasons for the hype is the over-exaggerated emphasis on nonconformity among teens in the US. Since it's an indie, and it's completely different than all the other films and breaks away from all those ""GOD-AWFUL"" typical films, it has to be great, right? Wrong. Quote from IMDb user who loved the film: ""This movie explores the very essence of boredom and mediocrity as you follow the daily life of a dorky guy doing uninteresting things in a small, unexciting town. Napolean's constant, open-mouth, blank stare says, ""I'm only tolerating this monotonous existence because I've got nothing better to do."""" That sums the film up quite well; however, after saying that, one wonders why someone would still watch the film. Shite. People think that anything 'different' must be awesome, but my goal in life isn't to pay to see some guy 'doing uninteresting things' throughout his 'monotonous existence' because '{he's} got nothing better to do.] I can bore myself to death without any help, thank you!",Napoleon Dynamite

The movie makes a very good portrayal of the so called ""middle America"", a part of America not so influenced by multiculturalism. The film can be considered quite slow for some viewers mostly because one the main points of the movie is to show the routine, life and thoughts of the main characters what creates a very realistic atmosphere that contrasts with the great fantasy that prevails in most movies today. The film is sometimes able to create discomfort feelings of identification with the characters, who are portrayed in a very human way during the entire course of the movie. The movie, however, errs in not making a more profound development of some secondary characters like the grandmother and the popular girls in the school. It's not a brilliant movie, it's a movie that gives you what it has promised though it does have its moments.",Napoleon Dynamite
869,benedunse,Napoleon Dynamite,8,18 May 2016,"The movie Napoleon Dynamite, set in Middle America (in a small countryside town), takes an interesting look at the life of an average student, trapped in over stereotypicalized America in the 60s. Personally at first I have to admit the movie was kind of boring to me because there is literally no classic ""Hollywood"" action and the dialogues are exactly the average small talk you would find in a High School. So if you just want to lay back and turn off your brain to just be entertained by a movie, i would not really recommend Napoleon Dynamite because the movie does not provide flat action and an easy good and bad fight. Although if you watch the movie with the purpose to actually take a message from it it can give you a little bit of life advice. Uncle Rico and his dreams about going back to High School kind of shows to me that I would really like to achieve something in life and not get stuck at a point in my life just wishing to be somewhere else. From my point of view it gives you some kind of energy to pursuit your dreams and live a the life you want. Napoleon himself also kind of shows that to me. He is a pretty flat character that is not very detailed but as soon as the classic dance scene gets shown it really shows that he had the confidence to pursuit his dream of being a dancer, although everyone doubted him and he got made fun of his entire life. I like all the different characters in the movie and although everyone is kind of one sided it creates this monotone vibe throughout the movie and really gives an illustration of the feelings inside the characters. From a cinematography point of view there is not a lot to say about this movie and that is honestly what makes it so good. There are no quick cuts or interesting transitions, no different angles or amazing pictures because that just would not provide the atmosphere needed for the setting and the story. All in all I think this movie is great and really gets you thinking about life and your dreams but people that only see movies as an escape from reality without a lot of thought put into the message of the plot might find this movie boring. You have to engage with the movie and the story until you can feel the atmosphere in Middle America until you can really understand the movie.",Napoleon Dynamite

Even though most of the cast were no names ( at least to me, a 13 year old girl) they still did an outstanding job. I especially like Deb.

But Napoleon Dynamite was a little different. I can appreciate a young gawky high school kid trying to fit in and all, but as I said before, ""funny but dumb"". The only thing that really gave this film any high hopes was the appearances of Hillery Diff's sister and of course, Diedrek Bader. For those of you who don't know who he is, he had a major role in the Beverly Hillbillies movie and he was one of the stars in the Drew Carrey show.

I know, sometimes movies with no real point are fun, but this movie is a steaming pile of garbage. The fact that THIS movie, of all the movies that were released in 2004, got the most attention is truly and deeply saddening. I guess it would make sense seeing as how people want to impress others with witty catchphrases instead of taking the time to see a movie that would make you think, much less having an independent intelligent thought.

This movie beats to it's own drum and it's not like anything I had ever seen before. This is like the Stanley Kubrick of comedy films, so open to interpretation and everybody can take something from it.
What I love about this movie is the characters.
Instead of looking at the characters in sympathy, you look at them in curiousity and confusion, and it's brilliant.
Don't get me wrong, the characters are likable and you can root for them, but not as much as you ask why. In any other movie, this wouldn't work.
This is a perfect example of deadpan humor, it prioritizes on really forgettable or vacuous aspects in life. This movie has the magic ability of getting into your head and being able to make you relate to things. There are some things in life that are just so oddly specific and silly, and that's essentially what this movie is. Weird, pointless nonsense. This is honestly hard to explain and that is the best way I can explain it. There are some very negative reviews saying how this film is boring or pointless and I can completely understand where they're coming from.

891,tricks812,It is what it is.........that IS the beauty of this film,10,27 March 2006,"Go into this film with NO expectations......just enjoy it for what it is; a truthful look at High School & all its demographics everywhere that everyone can relate to in some way. Don't try to read anything into it....don't analyze this film.....just enjoy it as I'm sure the filmmakers, writers, and actors wanted you to do! Too many movies these days rely on special effects and/or convoluted plots and subplots resulting in movies (too many movies if you ask me) with far too little substance and believability. Napoleon Dynamite is one of those rare (and getter rarer) gems that actually makes you pay attention while hitting a chord within you. And ultimately THAT is what a movie should do. Not to take away from the over the top ""special effects"" movies out there, I certainly enjoy those types of movies, it's just I think there needs to be more of a balance between those types of films and the type of movies that while being entertaining also strike a balance between suspending reality for a brief moment in time while also managing to stay believable.",Napoleon Dynamite
892,candide_bayer,any sort of lasting value?,6,3 May 2006,"Does this movie have any sort of lasting value? Will people in thirty years be tickled by the film's quirky sense of humor, or is it too culturally specific? It seems to be a movie particularly capable of amusing teenagers and twenty-somethings in the oughts (isn't that what you call this decade?).............Many comedies of the fifties and sixties are unfunny to audiences today. Even the funny ones, the screwball comedies of the 1930's that are still loved by new and young audiences (rarely i admit), even these movies tell a few jokes that mean nothing to audiences today. Even the most revered comedy of all time, Billy Wilder's ""Some Like it Hot"", even that movie was probably more full of humor for audiences at the time it was theatrically released.",Napoleon Dynamite
893,skyking-9,This is a VERY GOOD film!,10,5 September 2004,"At the end, a buddy sitting on my left said, ""I fail to see the humor in that"". While at the very same time I said, ""That was a f***ing incredible movie"". (My friend on the right commented that I never use the ""f-word"". I said that it applies in this case.THIS WAS A GREAT MOVIE. One of our group is wheelchair-bound, so we waited until the theater cleared out before we left. Good thing, because we might've missed the ""2 months later..."" scene that came on after the credits. There were only about 10 people left in the theater that saw that last scene. As I said, this movie was great, and I highly recommend it. But if you ""fail to see the humor"" in it, then maybe you should go watch A v. P with my buddy.(DISCLAIMER: Okay, I haven't actually seen A v. P, but the whole idea of it seems ridiculous to me. It may well be a good movie. When I first saw the trailer several months ago, I thought it was a joke -- really.)",Napoleon Dynamite
894,redsoxfaneb,One of the worst movies ever made!,1,6 April 2006,"This movie was downright awful, I don't understand why everyone says to go see it, I recommend not seeing it at all! I don't think I laughed at one point during it. There was no plot to this movie either, which I wasn't expecting, I was expecting this to be one of those movies that would just make me laugh but the writing in it didn't even do that. In other comments people said that if you grew up in the 80s or 90s you would enjoy it, I was an 80's child, born in 1986 and I thought it was horrible and as did many of my other friends, I had a few who enjoyed it and pushed me into watching it. Don't waste your money (let alone 2 hours of your time) on this movie, it is not what all the hype makes it up to be. I would rather sit through 2 hours of surgery then sit through this film. The entire time I kept asking my self-""is it over yet, will it finally get to the good part that everyone makes all the hype up to be"". Downright awful!",Napoleon Dynamite
895,skidge,This movie is frickin sweet!!!!!,10,17 January 2005,"I live in a small town,where access to films in the theater is limited, especially when it comes to obscure ones. So I rented Napoleon the day it was released on DVD, I bought it two days later. It has become a conversation mainstay in this small town, most of the young people here have seen it and quote it on a daily basis. I am definitely one of those people. When we're at work, or just sitting around doing nothing, the word gosh! has become much more prevalent in our conversations. This is one of the BEST films I have seen in a long time. How anyone can see this film and not fall over laughing is beyond me. Its ingenious, its superb, its its its well its frickin sweet!",Napoleon Dynamite
896,mulgamutt,A feel-good movie for the geek in any of us...,9,16 January 2005,"I enjoyed this movie, entirely. Initially, when it first appeared in promos, it didn't have my interest at all. Then slowly I noticed this movie popping up in review boards, and flying off the shelves in stores... the other day a lady at Target asked an employee if there were any more copies, since the shelves were cleared. And at Blockbuster, all copies were gone. Finally, I had to see this... very enjoyable!Dang if it didn't remind me of me in some ways, from back in school. I knew I was a geek back then (early 80s), all into computers, drawing stuff, and essentially being a social outcast, in the corners at the school dances. I only wish I knew a geeky gal back then to somehow connect with! If you listen to the commentary, a good deal of the events and setups in the movie come directly out of the writer's personal life, and he mentions ""nostalgia"" especially relating to music of the time. I can relate completely.Great movie. I had to check out the actor's profiles to determine if there was any realism in the personalities coming through... was Jon (Napoleon) really that geeky in real life? Maybe a bit, but pulling all these quirks of personalities off is a testament to their skill... all of them. I do believe Deb is my favourite character... what a sweetheart.I don't buy too many DVDs, but this one is certainly on my list.",Napoleon Dynamite
897,giles_106,Napoleon Dynamite,2,12 June 2006,"That is an hour and a half of my life that i'm never going to get back. What utter tripe. I only gave it two stars because of the interesting use of foodstuffs in the title sequence.Seriously, there is a limit to what you can call art and craftsmanship...but a feature length film devoted to 'a moment in the life of the eternal weakest link' misses that qualifier by a long, long way. I could watch real people lead sad and depressing lives rather than sit through this visual version of mental incontinence on the part of the director. Gee, he breathes through his mouth and has an afro all in the midst of a fetishistic account of 80's kitsch simulacra...inspired.This movie is not just a bad experience; it is one that I am actually going to attempt to repress.",Napoleon Dynamite
898,andersonh-12115,Personally i think you have to have a certain type of humor to find it funny.,10,14 March 2019,"I remember the first time I watched Napoleon Dynamite, the humor was just so ridiculously stupid that it was the funniest thing I had ever watched, the movie is so great that I even have a Kip shirt that says, "" I wanna become a cage fighter.""
Some people hate the movie and think that it is just plain stupid, like my friend Brecken, she said that when she tried to watch she just didn't get the jokes and fell asleep in the middle of it.
Personally i think you have to have a certain type of humor to find it funny. Just the things Napoleon would say or do would make me burst into laughter, like when Napoleon is getting on the bus and he had a action figure with floss tied around it and threw it out the window just to see it drag down the road, or when he's at the nurse on the phone with Kip and he says, ""Can you bring me my chapstick? ... But my lips hurt real bad!"" Like what!?!? The whole situation is funny, he's at the nurse, on the phone with his brother, asking him to bring him his chapstick cause his lips hurt, ""real bad"".
I think this movie might not be made for everyone but i recommend everyone to watch it. Napoleon Dynamite is 100% my favorite movie of all time. Just the setting and characters just make it absolutely priceless.
The movie is set in 1990's to early 2000's, in the middle of nowhere in Idaho. He lives by sand dunes in a tiny little house with his brother Kip ,his grandma, and his pet llama,Tina. Napoleon is a 16 yr old boy who is tall lanky with a short dirty blond afro and wears black snow boots everyday, even when it's hot. His brother Kip is a 32 year old man who still lives with his grandma, has a girlfriend named LaFawnduh, and he wants to become a cage fighter. I truly think that there is not another movie like Napoleon Dynamite. Every little detail about this movie is so witty and well thought through which makes it such an amazing movie to watch.",Napoleon Dynamite
899,bayernfan1898,"A gentle, clean, sweet story with a nice ending....",8,17 April 2006,"Don't go into this expecting ""comedy"" in the sense of the usual fare these days---- it doesn't have vulgarity, body fluids, or drug use stuff in it. It is minimalist, and the characters are, I think, meant to be as little dimensional as possible. That way, you the viewer can add into them what you want as the movie goes on.The setting is also minimalist Idaho. A few high schoolers go through their daily lives, coping with what little (and a lot) is thrown at them. The fact that they are in Idaho. Trying to raise money to go to college. Trying to get through the day as a geek/nerd. Trying to cope in a foreign country. Even the ""cool"" people are minimalized.But the ""story"" is there. It is what you make it. Don't expect it to be spoon fed to you. Let it develop for you.For me, it was that ND and his cast of relatives and friends surely have their problems. And they even fight with each other at times. And as for ND himself, his blank affect was simply his way of shielding himself from disappointment. His ""girl"" saying yes to Pedro. The jocks beating him up. His brother Kip. Uncle Rico. Tina. etc etc.But through it all, he and his family and friends are just trying to find themselves.To find their soulmate.And the way the story develops and ends is a reaffirmation of what is good in all of us. To care for each other in some level is what is important. And all of ND's circle did just that. Even Uncle Rico. vbg. And he is rewarded as well.And the minister who married Kip and LeFawnduh had some very good advice btw.I like the movie very much. It was clean, sweet, gentle, and reaffirming.",Napoleon Dynamite
900,shreddersniper,This movie makes Bio-Dome look like A Beautiful Mind,1,30 April 2006,"When i first heard about this movies from friends of mine i had my hopes set high as everywhere i turned i heard comments like ""funniest movie ever"" and ""i couldn't stop laughing."" And some were true, i couldn't stop laughing... at how bad this movie was. From beginning to end i found nothing humorous at all. All the humor was from this ""special"" kid say ""Gosh"" and sighing over and over again. I found myself dosing off an on through a movie that i could have made with a hand-held video camera and kid from special ed in 3 days tops. All the characters were shallow and stupid and i found it almost unbearable to watch. Aside from the stupid humor, there was no plot until the last 10 minutes of the movie and i just cannot find a single shred of evidence to point toward this movie being a good one. I mean if i wanted to watch something with no plot and paper think characters i would have stayed home and watched Desperate Housewives. If you wanna watch something hilarious pick up a copy of Eurotrip, a Dr. Pepper and enjoy...",Napoleon Dynamite
901,beegee-5,It grows on you,9,13 April 2006,"I didn't like the Simpsons when I first heard about it. I refused to let my kids watch it. I didn't want to see Napoleon Dynamite, either. So far, I have seen it about 12 times.This movie is so quirky that it has to be watched many times. Every time I see it, I pick up on something new. The charm of the movie is its amateurism , combined with unique social commentary. It reveals the insecurities we all harbor and lays them unashamedly out there for us to struggle with.Despite major personality flaws, each character has somehow negotiated life on his own terms and is able to function at some level that works for him. Life is a distraction from the fantasies lurking in their psyches.",Napoleon Dynamite

Here in Italy I haven't got MTV (by choice) and just picked it up in Blockbuster by chance while looking for something amusing. I think I will have to see it again as I obviously don't ""get"" certain things, having never been to the States, but it has universal appeal - there are Napoleons everywhere. All the acting is excellent, but it is the writing which is so perfect. There are just so many excruciatingly embarrassing lines, but which are so believable and so quotable. I can see this becoming a bit of a cult thing as word gets around. As far as I know it hasn't been in the cinemas in Europe (well not in Italy anyway) but I would have thought it could find a market in more discerning film going nations like France and Scandinavian countries. It has a Northern European feel to it.",Napoleon Dynamite
904,constructioninfo,"No plot, i can't believe i was forced to watch this movie",1,25 April 2006,"I've heard that the teenagers love this movie. After watching it, i realize why. The movie is just like a teenagers life, pointless, plot less, and completely sidetracked from reality. This movie is a minus 7! I really can't believe they make movies like this. The fact that the main character never opens his eyes is just like the typical teenager of today. They don't know what is going on around them. This movie should be banned from all video stores and all copies recalled. The school scenes are unrealistic, as the dummy gets banged into the lockers constantly, and where is the adult supervision? Not realistic at all.",Napoleon Dynamite

However,Napolean Dynamite is one movie I cannot accept..There is no plot. Although, the classic sitcom, Seinfeld, has absolutely no overall storyline but is one of TV's greatest shows.The comedy is entirely bland making me want to smack the director's upside the head. ""Tina, eat your tots you fat lard."" How the hell is that funny!? If you think the way Napolean(Jon Hader) says it, you take a good look at your self in the mirror then at the characters. They are making fun of Mentally Ill people. Mental conditions like this are not something to poke fun at.Using the phrase, ""You don't need something deep"" does not work here. The movies ""Dodgeball"" and ""Independence Day"" are not deep movies but some of the larger blockbusters of the past decade.But I digress......People will still be buying the DVD only further funding a future franchise with...*sighs*...sequels.",Napoleon Dynamite

It was hard to concentrate through, deadly boring, I didn't laugh once, completely confused, just a horror. Thank god I borrowed this for nothing off a friend, I wouldn't want to spend a euro on this, let alone whatever my friend paid to acquire this trash. Through the first hour or so I felt myself drifting off into other thoughts, even falling asleep at times. There are few saving graces in this film, the only part that I could have tolerated watching would have been the dancing at the end, otherwise it was a complete and utter mess. So, in summary, a complete horror that I wouldn't recommend to anyone unless you're into over-hyped, under-baked horrors such as this. :)",Napoleon Dynamite

I like a whole range of films but I have to say this is one of the worst I've watched for a long time, it just drags on and on and on.

909,xingyi_sifu2005,The real reason.............,8,6 August 2009,"I can tell you all why there are so many negative reviews of this movie. Te simple fact that Napoleon Dynamite completely IGNORES the bulk of the 1990's While mixing a collage of late 70's/early 80's style and music, married with modern day evidences such as high speed internet chat. Do a little research. Most of the people who gave this movie terrible marks are probably the same ones who would laud 1998 as the best year in cinema(gag!)and probably list the ""Truman Show"" and ""American Beauty"" as their all time favorite films. By totally snubbing the artistic wasteland that were the years between 1992 and 2000(aka. ""The nineties""), Napoleon Dynamite has earned my nod as one of the most ground breaking films in recent history. Or as the little 90's kids used to say when one of their movies sucked (meaning most of them) ""BRILLIANT!""",Napoleon Dynamite

It looked really weird but funny at the same time. I thought that it would be a classic, great movie. Well I forgot about it for a while because it hadn't come out yet in the cinemas, DVD or video. So one day my best friend tells me that i have to see this movie. She was telling me parts on the phone and I was in stitches! It was so funny. So we watched it on a Friday night and at first I was like this is really weird but (knowing us) we watched it again and that is when it really is funny!!!!!

Not everyone will get the humour as it can tend to be a bit off the wall (so you tend to have to like that kind of thing).The subtle comments and expressions from a great and talented cast bring it all together.In summary, it's worth seeing at least once and if you like it , its worth seeing again and again!My whole family liked it from teenagers aged thirteen to nineteen and us parents in our forties.It's a great movie - funny!!",Napoleon Dynamite

Hey It's about a complete idiot, how can you not love it?

I would like to comment that I am not like, a big town girl who cannot understand the situation and relate to it, I grew up in rural South Dakota. Yeah. So please, I beg you to not judge my motives. Then again, one could argue that my traumatic childhood which in so many ways resembled the agonizing pointlessness of the movie, made me initially disposed to HATE the atmosphere of the movie.

I was also in my mid fifties and was less than enthusiastic about taking time to seeing a film about teenagers in a remote high school in the middle of nowhere. I was prepared for the worst.Suffice to say, I was blown away by what I witnessed. This film was made with almost no budget, actors you've never heard of, and yet it remains one of my favorites movies over the past 30 years. Why? Because I could identify with this film from my childhood. I was not the most popular kid in school. I had little to no money to spend. I did well in school, but because I was not in the ""in crowd"",
I was almost non-existent. This film is about people like me and many others, who struggle with relationships, and who try to be accepted without much success.End the end, Napoleon and his friends come out ahead, while the popular group is left to lick their wounds. There are so many funny scenes in the movie, that you hardly go more than 2-3 minutes without laughing.It is one of the most unique, funny, and low budget films of all time. I don't know how they did it, but the script and direction was right on. You weren't looking at a movie. You were experiencing life with the characters, and going back to your childhood. Getting bullied, picked on, forgotten, made fun of, left by your date, being embarrassed in public, being shy with girls, etc. It's all there. Yet, in the end, all is well.I've watched it many times over the years, and laugh like I always do. It seems to get better with age.",Napoleon Dynamite

Napoleon Dynamite is an hour and a half of random jokes and childish humor, but for some reason, it has captured the small and undeveloped brains 18-25 year-olds. The only explanation for its success could be that all of the crack babies and brain damage hospital patients make up the cult following for this movie. If you stand up against this movie, you're told that you ""just don't get it."" Let me explain this for you in terms that you might better understand: you're not 5 years old anymore and calling someone ""idiot"" isn't funny when your vocabulary should now include words with more than two syllables.

It's incredible how well constructed and strangely likable the characters are. This film just keeps you watching through a combination of great writing, great acting, and flawless directing. Jon Heder is excellent as Napoleon and it's hard to imagine him as anyone else, which for me is a true sign of a great acting performance.This is a real feel good movie and an absolute must see!Vote Pedro!!",Napoleon Dynamite

I think the title 'Naploleon Dynamite' was very smartly chosen and fitted this film quite nicely. I think the use of characters and the phrases they used were very funny and excellent. My favorite part would have to be when Naploleon calls Kip his brother to ask him to bring him a chap-stick because his 'lips hurt real bad'. Very funny indeed.

923,PlaidBuford,Worst Movie of the Year!,1,21 December 2004,"Sure, there were some terrible movies that came out in 2004 including both Cat movies: Catwoman and Cat in the Hat, but Napoleon Dynamite has to be the very worst movie that not only came out this year but maybe has been made at all. There were no redeeming qualities to this film, and I use the term ""film"" lightly. There was literally no plot, and not one single likable character in the whole thing. This was not realistic, nor did any of the characters remind me of anyone I went to school with. None of the performances were memorable, and the quality of the film-making was amateur at best. Napoleon doesn't get picked on in high school because he's a nerd; he gets picked on because he's a jerk, and treats people like crap. I went to see it and the theater was pretty packed, but there were really only a few sparse bursts of laughter here and there. It didn't sound like the audience enjoyed it one bit, and you could tell they all heard from word of mouth that it was funny. I just want to know who's supplying the mouth on this one.The two stupidest things that happened in 2004 were the reelection of George W. Bush, and the success of Napoleon Dynamite, and I can't decide which one was stupider.",Napoleon Dynamite
924,mgmou,Napoleon Dynamite Sucks,1,20 July 2006,"I am so glad to finally find this message board with so many normal people. Napoleon Dynamite might be the worst film ever made. I rented it only because of how everyone kept telling me how damn hilarious it was. It is almost like everyone else is crazy, how could so many people find this movie funny? I feel like maybe I am in the Truman Show and surrounded by paid actors who have assembled a plot twist to get me to react.I wanted to laugh. I waited for the time to arrive...but it never came. ND is annoying and a completely unlikeable character. I actually found myself rooting for him not to succeed. To be completely honest, I couldn't finish it the first time. Only later, on cable, was I forced to sit through the second half with my roommate, who finds it funny mind you. The dance scene at the end that everyone seems to find so funny was just stupid, not funny, stupid! People who quote lines from the movie, as if there is even a titter of humor should be shot...for real. People that believe this movie is funny are the same ones who believe the Bush administration. Save the 1.5 hours, this movie is 100% not funny, I didn't even crack a smile. Not funny! Not funny! Not funny!",Napoleon Dynamite
925,phylisssawyer7,Film budget?,10,23 July 2006,"I have heard the budget for this film was anywhere from $1000 to $600,000. Does anyone know what was really spent to make this hilarious movie? I give it a 10. I was any eighties kid and this movie brought back memories. My favorite part of the movie is when N.D. has the tater tots in his pocket and he won't give any away. I live in a small town with guys who are trying to relive the moment they ""missed"" to make their life great. Many of them are now living vicariously through their children. All I can do is watch in amazement when uncle Rico thinks he is so athletic and sexy--grody. It's funny to watch this movie and know their may still be people living like this somewhere in the U.S.!",Napoleon Dynamite
926,taz-kruger,I loved it... but I grew up on British comedy......,10,24 July 2006,"Seriously, this movie isn't for everyone. Ever since I was young I've watched the BBC and public television. I have always been a fan on the dry, thoughtfull humor that I guess some people can never even bring themselves to even try to enjoy. Many people are against Napolean Dynamtie because it is so dry and truly a monotonous movie that shows you raw life. You see how other people survive their day, fighting their way through a lack of popularity and oppresive family. This is a good offset to the unrealistic scenes of M:I:III and action movies such as that. But, don't get me wrong. I'm not an elitist indie fan who thinks that different is the only way. I'm a huge Star Wars, Cady Shack, Itallian Job, and Lord of the Rings fan (to name a few).I guess to get back to my point, people need to stop expecting a slapstick humor to make a movie good. Look at it for what it is, then judge it.",Napoleon Dynamite
927,stace69,This is pretty much the best video ever made.,10,4 March 2005,"It's interesting how some people react to this movie. I think it's one of the funniest movies ever. Some people I know hated it and even turned it off before finishing it. The humor is a particular style that hits some people right on the head and others just don't get. For me and most of my friends it's a classic. We are constantly quoting the movie and running like Napoleon down the aisles at work. The thought of someone being so geek that their eyes are closed all of the time to me is brilliant.As far as a plot, it is pretty simple but a complicated plot wouldn't make the film any better.",Napoleon Dynamite
928,ginger_pig10,I have seen more exciting angle grinders than this film.,1,29 August 2006,"My friend lent me this film to watch. As usual with UKL evening television, there was nothing on that was worth watching so I thought that I would give it a try... It started slow and went down from there. Even from the opening credits sequence where we see the food on the plates is drawn out to which becomes a bore. The plot leaves little to the imagination... Oh sorry, there is no solid plot. The story of a high school nerd that no one can relate with is a poor start. Add poor acting, a feeble story line mixed with some extremely unimaginative comedy (where is the humour? Did it land on the editing room floor??) and what we are left with is a slow boring film that lacks three key features: a beginning, a middle and an end. Personally, the only way to prevent myself from not turning it off was by strapping myself to the chair. Verdict: If you are undecided on weather to watch this or Big Brother Live (YUK!!) I would opt for Big Brother as at least it can be slightly comical in a pathetic sense in a way that this film should be.",Napoleon Dynamite
929,TeamLionHeart,A Work of Genius,9,16 May 2004,"Every once in awhile, a comedy comes along that aims to do more than make you laugh. Napoleon Dynamite, by newcomer Jared Hess, definitely seems to do just that and succeeds in every way possible. The characters, the dialogue, the setting, the story, even the camera-work, all functioned exactly as Hess intended, and you can tell.I've seen this movie twice already, both times for free, due to a new kind of marketing strategy being employed by Fox Searchlight. It seems they are having multiple free screenings of the film in multiple cities throughout the country. What's unique about this is that, not only are they giving away [AWESOME] free T-shirts at every screening, but they are actually encouraging their viewers to return for multiple viewings as much as they are encouraging us to tell our friends. If anything, the strategy shows just how much confidence they have in the film, and it's working. After all, I gladly returned for a second screening, at which time the audience had more than doubled- many people didn't even get in. Now, to the movie.The film tells the simple story of a misunderstood boy growing up in a strange and absolutely hilarious family in rural Idaho. If the film has any flaw, it may be that there is no actual plot or rather conflict until slightly more than halfway through. However, the movie was so hilarious and unique throughout that this did not even annoy me in the slightest. Never during the film was I bored even once. Nearly every line delivered by each character in the film feels so perfectly dead on, even though the characters are so original and bizarre that we've probably never known anybody like them. The ONLY film I can think of that might bare the slightest resemblance to Napolean Dynamite is Royal Tenenbaums, in that both depict a world different than any we've ever seen, while simultaneously dealing with subjects that are remarkably true to life. I don't mean to sound like the film is a drama, it by NO means takes itself seriously, and I don't think I stopped laughing for more than a minute all the way through. I just mean that it distinguishes itself as far superior to other recent comedies that made me laugh non-stop like Old School. The difference between the two can clearly be found in the passion (and personal experience) put into the screenplay and the film-making, as well as the intent to give the film a certain feel or atmosphere. See this movie if you're under the age of 50 (when I saw it a middle aged couple walked out, apparently not understanding its humor). You will not regret it.",Napoleon Dynamite
930,Relsis,This is a masterpiece created out of nothing.,10,26 August 2021,"From its extremely low budget with next to nothing to work with, the way this movie was made is not only uniquely funny, but also immerses you in the town and with the characters in the film. This represents ingenuity at its finest. With the opening credits in particular, it's also a fine work of art. It feels almost like a live-action and cleaner-cut version of Beavis and Butt-Head.",Napoleon Dynamite
931,edownham,Napoleon rules,10,26 September 2006,This was the best film I have seen in a long while. Many people told me that I wouldn't like it the first time I saw it but contrary to their beliefs I thought it was fantastic as soon as I saw the opening credits. Genius.The comic timing and simplicity of the story line touches so many people. I always love films that are set it backcountry America as having been bought up in London I just can't relate to that and find it fascinating.The highlight to the whole film just has to be the fact Napoleon wears moon boots. Awesome costume touch.I cannot fault it!,Napoleon Dynamite
932,jlmonier,Unique!,10,26 September 2006,"This is by far my favorite comedy (and quite possibly my most favorite movie)!! Jared and Jerusha Hess have totally challenged Hollywood's typical comedy and have created something so unique and fresh- I look forward to seeing more ""Hess films"". I say that Napoleon is unique because there is no over the top profanity (i.e. no cussing, no sex, no overt violence, and no death; O.K., they say, ""crap"", there is slapstick, and a cow dies, but that's about it). This movie is also very realistic. We can *all* relate to at least one character in the movie and maybe ourselves were very much like one of them (let's just hope there are not too many Uncle Ricos out there!!!!!!!). TEN STARS for the ""flippin' sweet"" movie!!",Napoleon Dynamite
933,graciewilliams-56558,The Perfect Mindless Film,10,22 September 2020,"The first time I watched Napoleon Dynamite, I was on a charter bus crammed full of teenagers from my 4-H club, headed for Washington D.C. on a cross-country trip. If that's not the best context in which to premiere this film, I don't know what is. This movie is gawky teenagery at its finest, especially for folks who grew up in small, middle-of-nowhere towns. Remember riding the bus to school and being pestered constantly by the younger children? Remember the queen bee of the school who really had no redeeming qualities aside from being blonde and pretty? Remember the ladies who would do Jazzercise in the basement of the Elks Club? This movie brings to light all the weird little niches that exist in ""boring"" isolated communities... in the best of ways.
This movie is not complex in the issues it addresses, nor is it overly intelligent in its humor. It's mindlessly funny, and gives you the best feelings of childish nostalgia, remembering when you, too, tried to pull your brother behind your bike as he wore roller skates. It's an everyday movie filled with everyday happenings, finding the joy in the small things. After watching this movie, I couldn't help but notice the weird little niches of folks around my own town, and how these things seemed completely normal to me, but may seem ""hick-like"" or odd to outsiders.
Watch for some good, clean fun. You won't regret it.",Napoleon Dynamite

(Nu-poll- ee- un die-nu-mite): DUMMBEST MOVIE SECOND TIME AROUND,1,17 October 2006,the first time i watch the movie i hadnt herd ANYTHING about it... i was going to a movie that could've been about neapolotin ICE CREAM for all i knew...anywho i went to the movie sat down watched it a little and before i made any other statement i realized that this guy in idaho is simular to some geek you might find SOUTH of idahos border....

Napolean dynamite... well i saw the movie before that and realized that movie was NOT as good as what they were describing. I watched the movie again at a friends party.... with a friend who had never seen it before. now of course i told her my favorite part... we watched the movie...WOW i did not see at ANY point in that movie that it was the LEAST BIT FUNNY. IT WAS LIKE I WAS WATCHING A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT MOVIE!!!!! well as i watched it a different time i realized that one of the reasons people HATE this movie is because their friends BUTTER IT UP!!! anyways if next time you are at BLOCKBUSTER....

IT IS WITH OUT A DOUBT THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!!!!! better ACTING better SCRIPT better EVERYTHING.PERIOD!!!!!! i would recommend it to ANYONE!!!!!! GET U-H-F!!!!! NOT NAPOLEAN DYNAMITE!!!!,Napoleon Dynamite
936,fionnaredhead,No.,1,17 August 2007,"This has to be the worst film i have ever watched. I saw it with my friend and we didn't laugh once because this was so bad. The jokes are very random and the point of the movie is to try and get us to laugh at the strange things that the main character, Napoleon, does. The plot is really basic, doesn't really go anywhere and the film becomes boring because of the slow dialogue. The stories of the different characters are confusing at times when there are only a few minuets of each one at a time. A few plus points for the movie are: The actors are not bad and seem to fit the characters that they have been given but it is the plot that fails them, and it is an interesting strange type of comedy which is good because there doesn't seem to be a lot of choice now a days. At first sight this film seems interesting and different from others but then when you sit down and watch it, it is a disappointment.",Napoleon Dynamite
937,megantweddle-16603,I don't now where to even begin...,9,18 January 2021,"Napoleon Dynamite. What an interesting movie. I truly believe that in order to enjoy this movie you have to be a certain type of person. I took me over a month or two to finish this movie, as it simply did not interest me, (I do that with a lot of movies, to be fair) but I won't let that affect my rating.Personally, the life that Napoleon led is one of my worst fears. A mundane life, where you can only look back on the ""good old days"" too the point where you can't even enjoy the life you live. Uncle Rico is a good example of this. Constantly trying to change things that can not or will not change, trying to be something/someone he is not, always looking back and/or trying to regain his youth, etc. Napoleon has the type of life that is realistic for a lot of people, and it is the type of setting and vibe, that anyone can relate too. Everyone will think ""I have done that before once"" or ""I know someone who has that kind of house"" and I think that is something that we should credit the director for (this was also the first film she ever directed), she was able to make it relatable to everyone.As relatable as it can be, pretty much the entire movie feels like a fever dream. It is so perfectly fit into the 80's ""vibe"", that i was shocked to find out it was filmed in the 2000's.This movie does not rely on a plot, there is no climax to the plot, or build-up. It is just a genuine movie. It shows you Napoleon, a witty and dorky kid, who shows no genuine interest in life, but gets on with it because ""meh"". He is a good character because he is realistic, and a lot of the scenes in the movie can happen to anyone, which is great! There is Uncle Rico, who is a man obsessed with re-living his youth, and trying to change the past. He is the type of guy who believes in the whole ""You control your destiny, but also just go-with-the-flow!"" gambit. As you get further into the movie, you actually feel sort of bad for him. We also have Pedro, a Mexican who wants to keep up with his culture and finds some aspects of American culture hard to adjust too, but he doesn't seem to mind. Pedro is great with girls, and is well-known for having a fully-grown moustache. And last, but not least, we have the brother of Napoleon, Kip. Kip is in his 30's and stays at home on chat rooms all day, talking with ""women"". He is a fairly mundane character, but definitely adds humour to the movie and Napoleons life. These people are what I believe to be the main characters.All-in-all it is a pretty good movie, definitely a must-watch movie though!Favourite line:
Kid on the bus: ""What are you going to do today, Napoleon?""
Napoleon: ""Whatever I feel like I wanna do, GOSH!",Napoleon Dynamite
938,deathbot6789,funny movie with lost of fun,10,6 November 2006,"ND is a totally different than any kind of film I have ever seen before. It truly is a cross between Monty Python and Tommy Boy. Many people hate it with a passion. I can understand that. It's not the kind of humor that many people like. My parents do not get ND at all. However, all my friends think it is one of the best comedies ever made. This is much like the movie Easy Rider. I think it is one of the most pointless movies ever made, but I also did not live through the 60's, so the whole point of the movie is lost on me. For those of us who grew up in the 80's/90's, this movie makes more sense. Yes, the humor is VERY dry and it is a slow movie (which I think makes it better.) I would say if your over 30, it's very unlikely that you will like ND, but give it a try, you might like it. If you don't like it, then don't bad mouth it, it just wasn't meant for you.",Napoleon Dynamite

My sister couldn't wait to show me this (film?), but I sat there perplexed the whole time waiting for something funny to happen. I thought it was gonna explode at any moment into something, anything. Then my sister told me I had to see the Big Dance Scene. Oh boy! Just as bad and unfunny as the rest of the (film?). What a complete waste of time.

Everyone else who watched it with me made it out to be the God of all comedies. I think the movie is extremely overrated and is a pathetic excuse of a comedy, I realise that people have a different sense of humour which is why a lot of people might disagree with me but I stand by my opinion, the movie is a load of rubbish not worth watching and definitely not worth buying. Look at it this way, if you had the opportunity to see either Sin City or Napolean Dynamite which would you choose, I know which I would choose, i'd choose the one that was worth watching.",Napoleon Dynamite

My favorite quote is "" Get off my property and Gosh Idiot"". napoleon seems to be your typical kid growing up in a typical environment with the exception of being typically unique. He's quite a character and so is that friend of his Pedro. All in all its just this totally wacky guy who just seems to have a lot of fun.It definitely deserves a five because most of the things that happen you can't exactly relate to and you think he makes things up like the word ""liger"" only to find out it actually exists.So its like a balance of reality with Napoleon's own wackiness combined with that of the family and Pedro makes it totally original.",Napoleon Dynamite
943,info-11352,Napoleon Dynamite is a funny movie.,5,14 February 2007,"Napoleon Dynamite is a good movie that suffers from too much hype. People are often let down when they have high expectations. That isn't necessarily the fault of the people making the movie. It just happens. There is a new movie coming out called ""The Unauthorized Autobiography of Charlie Godart"" and it is very funny. We will see if hype sells it too and if it lives up to the buzz. It has quirky characters as well. You see everyone from Abe Lincoln to midgets to Fat Elvis. The difference between the two movies is there is actual thought to having a funny script rather than just acting weird. Too many films today think they don't have to have comedic lines. It's almost like they're being lazy and just throw strange at you with throwaway improve and call it art. What's also sad to see is when an older celebrity comes on a talk show with a Tee Shirt that says Vote For Pedro and makes a point of trying to look cool and hip to the young viewers. There was a time when people like Bob Hope and Jack Benny paid their dues and had real writers write funny stuff. They also had the luxury of years of trial and error before becoming famous. Their work still holds up.",Napoleon Dynamite
944,matt6380,The movie sums up great,9,3 May 2005,"At first the movie looks like it doesn't have a point, but i took away a life lesson. Napoleon thinks he doesn't have skills, so he gets off his butt and does something about it (the dance tape). Pedro is not a ladies man, but that doesn't stop him from asking out girls. Kip and Lafawnduh may get weird looks from people, but they don't flinch. Uncle Rico dreams of going back in time. SPOILER WARNING- The whole movie, everyone is trying to better themselves, but in the end, they find success by being themselves. Pedro's prez, Napoleon finds someone to play tetherball, Kip has Lafawnduh and Uncle Rico gets his woman. The message i got was be yourself and things will come your way.

It's the most hilarious movie I've ever seen, and it has substance --- it's not a ""deep"" movie, yet it certainly has stayed with me. One reviewer said, ""I would say if your over 30, it's very unlikely that you will like ND, but give it a try, you might like it."" Yes!! Give it a chance. I don't think you have to be under 30 to ""get"" this movie... I am 50 years old, and it's one of my favorites. No doubt I'm out of my ""age-group loop"" as far as my liking this movie is concerned...which explains perfectly why I love this movie. I've never fit in with what was and is considered ""the norm""....In my opinion, Napoleon and his brother Kip are the two stand-outs in ND.... two brothers who are so thoroughly immersed in Dork that they think they're like totally hot stuff! And *maybe* they're right!!! Examples: _Napoleon: You know, there's like a butt-load of gangs at this school. This one gang kept wanting me to join because I'm pretty good with a bo staff.__Napoleon: Do the chickens have large talons? Farmer: Do they have what? Napoleon: Large talons. Farmer: I don't understand a word you just said._ _Napoleon: Stay home and eat all the freakin' chips, Kip. Kip: Napoleon, don't be jealous that I've been chatting online with babes all day.

946,XdorkX,Most original film this year,10,1 August 2004,"Napoleon Dynamite is probably one of the funniest films I have seen all year. It is basically about Idaho being technologically challenged. It has all the elements of a great comedy. The main character Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Herder) is a genuine dork. He knows that he is not cool, but still has his own agenda and does not let anyone try to out him down. His whole persona is a joke; his slow reactions and over-emphasising everything to his clothes and hairstyle. Matched with his new Mexican friend Pedro (Efren Ramerez) who is very timid but still tries to be what he wants to be, they make a dynamic duo. The other characters in the film, Uncle Rico, Kip, Deb, and Grandma all make a hilarious situation that makes us ask ourselves, why did we dress like that or what were we thinking? Granted this film has many recurring jokes, but the art direction is intricate and amazing. If someone cannot see the minor jokes in the surroundings of this film, then you must have not lived through this period in time, or you just don't understand humor.",Napoleon Dynamite
947,touchbellini,Misses the mark,2,13 December 2007,"When people mention this film they inevitably mention Wes Anderson's ""Rushmore"" in the same sentence. But where that film had a quirky protagonist whose subtle mannerisms and zealous overconfidence formed a three-dimensional character, the namesake of ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is so over-the-top as to be unbelievable and so unpleasant as to be unlikable. The rest of the characters in the movie fail to illicit sympathy or relatability either and since there's no plot to this film the characters have no opportunity to change at all. For a truly good portrait of the awkward teen years watch ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" and leave this one on the video shelf.",Napoleon Dynamite

I got out and I liked it but I didn't know why. I went home expecting it to be one of those that you just forget about but found myself thinking about it, then thinking about it and chuckling. I took my girl friend to see it the next week and came out with us both in stitches. It is a great film because it is nice. It is brave, bold and foolish at times but it gives you an insight to the forgotten America where I used to live. It is a wonderful feel good film that will grow on you even if you don't want it to. I inflicted two of my friends who on my recommendation went to see it to a second watch and both laughed a little more, then a lot more and now both consider it a classic. It's not Hollywood. Its not thrills and explosions. Its not guns and guitars, but it is something that you can show your parents, your kids your friends and if they get it great if they don't... it's their loss.Let's have less of the slating.

I watched this movie with my mother, and at one point, she said to me, ""I'd rather watch paint dry."" This is a perfect assessment of this pile of filth posing as a motion picture. The movie is boring and unfunny, and the dialog makes Carrot Top's ""Chairman of the Board"" sound like ""Hamlet."" Jon Heder's Napoleon is one of the most unlikeable protagonists I've ever encountered. Every time I hear one of my friends tell me about how much they love this movie or see its merchandise in the mall, it makes me feel like I'm in some alternate universe where everything is turned around.

After watching it a few more times, it really does grow on you. The only thing that really bothered me was you have to wait for all the credits to roll by and then there's an additional scene where Kip marries LaFawnduh and Napoleon comes out of nowhere riding (like a nerd) a horse for his brother and sister in law to ride off into the sunset. I wish they would have put that right at the end of the movie or else used it in a sequel. I still hope they make a sequel.

Yes,I even lived in a small western farming community with my Grandmother.) This movie, besides being very funny, allows us into the world of the outsiders, the out-crowd, the ""didn't make the A-list"" set. The treatment of these lost souls was not always gentle or sensitive. If it had been, the movie wouldn't be funny. This is not one for the bleeding hearts club.

It used to be my belief that if you were younger than 25 or older than 55 you just wouldn't get it. although I still hold this opinion I think there are other criteria for the lovers vs the haters. Very rarely do you meet someone who thinks this movie is just OK, or in the middle. I've also come to find that most people who are materialistic seem to hate this movie. If you need to have the latest name brand stuff like clothes with huge brand names on display, or a car that is considered stylish or sporty and overpriced you're probably gonna hate it. If you own an I phone, yep, yer probably gonna hate it. If you take yourself way too seriously, and being cool like you were in high school is of utmost importance to you, don't even try to watch it. If you love to ride motorcycles but a Harley is the only motorcycle you would ever be seen on, just forget it. I think that a lot of these materialistic things kind of go hand in hand with a high school mentality, (peer pressure and acceptance) which is why I think the younger crowd just hates this movie. Hey, I had to have a Members Only jacket too, but I was in 7th grade. And so I'm still sticking to my under 25 theory. The over 55 theory may just be that silliness of this calibur is just beyond the older crowd. I'm still trying to find the root of that one. If you have the ability to laugh at yourself, give it a go. If someone calls you an idiot and you respond with ""yep, sometimes that happens"", watch this movie. If you think it is silly to pay twice to four times as much for an equally comfortable/functionally attractive article of clothing for its brand name, even if you can easily afford it, you will dig this flick. If you are in a relationship whether you're a guy or a girl and aren't afraid to fart in front of your significant other, especially if you're a girl, watch this movie. And no, there aren't any stupid fart jokes in this movie. Yeah, this is one dumb movie. At the same time it is genius IMHO. I could be wrong about most of what I've said, but I'm only giving my personal experience with what I've observed. Yeah, it's just a dumb movie, but your opinion of it might just define your personality. But again, this is only my opinion like the rest of the reviews here. Being cool just isn't cool anymore, and i'm cool with that...wait, what!??!!",Napoleon Dynamite

955,edvard-ekstrom,"If you ""get it"", you'll love it.",10,20 March 2011,"When discussing over-rated movies, this movie is mentioned pretty often. Most criticism I've heard stems from the movies hype as ""indie classic"" and the annoying fan base. I agree, some what. Comparing it to Juno and the likes does the movie a disservice, as did the great number of people spouting lines like ""vote for Pedro"" and ""Tina eat the ham"". However. This does not change the fact that - when viewed in the right mindset, and the ability to let the movie stand on its own - it is an extremely beautiful and touching story about teenage life. Napoleon is himself the very epitome of the high-school outcast, shunned by the ""popular"" and taking refuge in the back of the bus. We've seen that before, in various forms. Neither is his transformation, which culminates in the famous dance scene, original. But it is portrayed in such a perfect way. From the choice of music and the cinematography (my two favorite scenes are the ones with Napoleon and Deb dancing at the disco, and also the final scene with the two of them playing tether-ball - the music and the camera work makes these two scenes truly spectacular) - to the great work the directors/writers did with portraying the world that Napoleon, Deb, Pedro and others live in. The dialogue is delivered stilted and monotone. There is no real drama to speak of. It is slow. But it fits. Everything fits together and creates this backdrop of an endless land, stuck in time, never moving forward. To me, that's why the comparison with i.e. Juno falters - nothing in this movie is in there ""just because"". There is no pop culture references made just so the audience can get the cheap thrill of saying ""hey! I remember that from my childhood!"". Everything is a piece of the puzzle. The dry way the characters act and speak, the scenery and backdrops, the deliberately aged soundtrack. Maybe that's why it's so uplifting to see the journeys the characters make, from nothing out to something - Napoleon, Pedro, Deb, Uncle Rico, and not to mention Kip - whose journey mirrors Napoleons but ten times more bizarre.I could write more about this, much more, but I'd rather just encourage everyone who didn't like it because of the supposed ""indie""-ness to watch it again. Don't mind the fan base. There is so much more to this movie than some ""hilarious quotes"" to repeat over and over again. Just give it an honest try!",Napoleon Dynamite
956,RubyDoobie22,Loserville Is Overrated,2,3 June 2008,"I'm sorry, I just didn't get this film. It didn't make me laugh, it didn't even make me angry that is was a complete waste of time- it just made me confused. Everyone who loves this film says it's supposed to be something different- some say a comedy, some say it's supposed it be artistic,understated humour, some say a nostalgic look of being a dork in high school, some say it's just stupid laughs. I don't know anyone who actually gets this film- they just mainly follow the hype, which is pretty tragic. The people who love it say everyone else doesn't 'get it', but what's to get, honestly? I like humour that isn't in your face as much as anyone, but I found this film a little pointless. Everyone says that Napoleon & co. are the classic misfits, but I don't really see that either. I don't think I've ever met anyone nearly half as tragic as anyone in this film. And they shouldn't really be ostracised in their school, because everyone looks backward and/or messed up in the whole town. Even if you overlooked the fact it's pretty much pointless, it's also technically a bot of a shambles- the acting just looks and sounds like a bunch of people reading lines- once again, people try to defeat this point by saying 'it's ironic', but even if it that is true, it's not entertaining. Furthermore, the amount of continuity errors is shocking (see the 'Goofs' list for proof)- it's like playing 'Spot the Difference' with each frame! And if the quality of the camera-work is also supposed to be 'ironic', then lets not overlook the fact that this film has no substantial plot. It just blunders along at the pace of a drunken snail, shamelessly cramming in 'humour'- if this movie didn't try quite so hard to be funny or appeal to a broad market, it could have had potential.In the world of understated comedy, this film is easily the most pointless I've seen.",Napoleon Dynamite

Cause the guy looks and acts like a retard.How about this i will put a camera in my basement for two months. I will capture all the stupid idiot things my friends do.

A better way to spend two hours would be go out and cut the grass with a scissors. I saw the reviews and though, cool cult classic. This should be good. Read the outline of the plot which seemed OK. Then watched the movie. Awful rubbish.In fact I challenge anyone to show me a worse movie. I could make a better one myself with a digital camera.

If you crop the Mormons out of Idaho society, what's left?There didn't appear to be a script, they just shot it as they thought it. No acting skills, no camera skills, no good music, no plot, no believable dialog... why would anyone pay to see this? Because some idiot said it was good, so the rest of us are getting snookered into it, is why.

I know it doesn't really have any specific storyline or plot to it, but I think that is why I think it is such a cool movie, it is just weird! It has such a big cult following for an indie film too, it must just kind of reach out to people with an odd sense of humour.

Growing up in that setting would have made me commit suicide a long time ago. Gosh, sweet, bow hunting skills...horrible..I wanted to punch every single character in this movie right in the face..including hilary duff's ugly pathetic sister.

962,thwarted_artist,*shrugs* Meh. *flips to next title on movie rack*,5,5 February 2005,"I just finished watching this movie after no less than three of my friends mentioned its title in the same breath as words like 'awesome', 'funny' and 'riot'. When I wasn't chuckling, my shoulders remained firmly in shrug mode for most of the film.Part of me wants to throttle them and hereafter question their taste. It is funny, but only in spots: absurd scenes, unconnected to anything, like the milk-tasting 'guess what the cow ate' test; the farmers drinking raw eggs and eating egg sandwiches for lunch; the children who accidentally witness the shooting death of a cow. And the scene where Napoleon unexpectedly pulls a Beck and shows off his extremely cool dance moves on stage almost redeems the past eighty-five minutes. Almost. Mostly I pitied Napoleon his pathetic, vindictive uncle and useless older brother, and felt slightly unclean for being invited to share in poking fun at his misfortune. Napoleon may be an anti-hero, but he DOES NOT speak for those who were outcasts by choice or chance in high school. I know; I was one: the 'quiet, weird girl' in the back of the class who mostly kept to herself (and still does) but occasionally had something pithy and relevant to add to class 'discussions'.The other part of me almost wants to thank them for pointing me to another fly-on-the-wall attempt to 'show life as it actually is' on film. Yes, 'Napoleon Dynamite' moves like molasses on a glacier, though it only lasts for 90 minutes. Yes, cardboard cutouts rival most of the characters for sheer personality. But to those of you who object to these things: real teenagers don't always speak like characters on 'Boy Meets World' (yes, I'm a child of the nineties) or 'Dawson's Creek'. And the pace of life (which I suspect this movie aimed at capturing) is often random and slow, filled with events that signify nothing; but if one strings them together montage-style and examines each frame under a lens after the fact, one can see clear trajectories to the present. That's true in 'Napoleon Dynamite' as well.I applaud the Hesses for trying to show us the humor and value in the quotidian, but there are other movies that do a far better job. Here's one: In Czech filmmaker Ivan Passer's 1966 film 'Intimni osvetleni' ('intimate lighting' in English), two failed musician friends play Mozart badly, engage in long drunken conversations, and utterly fail at even making cocktails. But every minute of it manages to be captivating. Worth it for those who aren't automatically put off by having to read subtitles.",Napoleon Dynamite
963,jcmcalister,Great Nerd Film!,10,15 July 2004,I just went to see Napoleon Dynamite today. It was so funny. It actually was better than I expected because of all the mixed reviews. I laughed so hard. The characters were brilliant and ordinal. My favorite scene was when Napoleon danced at the school assembly! That was priceless! The tater tots scene was also really funny.This film is definitely one of the better nerd films because its not too over the top and the characters could be real.The only thing that I would have like to see was Napoleon's room. That's a shame that we only got to see a small piece. oh well. I love to see something that is different than what's mainly playing at the theaters. I would definitely recommend this film to everyone!,Napoleon Dynamite
964,vicmicjam,very funny and well developed movie,10,14 November 2009,"Napoleon Dynamite was a very funny movie that I would recommend to viewers of all ages. This movie is about a high school student that just wants to fit in but he has to face many hindrances, such as peer ridicule and parent conflict and people make fun of his un attractive physical appearance.This movie is important to me because it shows the hilariously terrifying high-school life of a social outcast with equal parts of raw, firsthand-experienced truth and oddball surrealism. The underlying message of the movie is that always accept your past because if you can't move on from the past then there is no way you can truly continue forward you must accept the past.The acting of the movie was splendid, the character was always intact with the audience and that makes the movie very understandable because viewers wouldn't get lost, the character of the movie are believable and they play there parts to perfection. The movie dialogue was good because all the line spoken in appropriate way that matches portray the appearance of the character, for example the geek talk and act like a geek and the dense like the dense.Napoleon Dynamite stayed in a low class region that farming is the back bone of the town, Napoleon Dynamite would have you laughing till you can't feel your mouth, and this was one of the best movie that is very funny and also have an overall premise to the viewers.

I have nothing against sex and profanity in a movie, but it was very refreshing to be able to watch a movie with your kids and laugh hysterically with them. We now own the DVD and continue to work on memorizing the lines. Negative comments about lack of plot are ridiculous. This movie reminds me of past great comedies like American Graffiti and Fast Times at Ridgemont High. No great plot but a good look at a slice of life. I would really like to understand the general psyche of the people who hated this movie. Can you not laugh at yourself? (We all have a little nerd in us I think). No, this is not Citizen Kane/Schindler's List/Goodfellas/Fargo (all great movies I love) but have fun with it and watch it more than once . It will keep you grinning.",Napoleon Dynamite

968,echoside_juggalo,Genius,8,21 March 2005,"Pointless humor at its prime, Napoleon Dynamite should serve as the template for everything meaningless. Awkward silences and pointless acts may frustrate those unaccustomed to this type of masterpiece, but I think that's the point. Rather than the type of early character development governing today's Hollywood productions, we are immediately thrust into the inferior world of Napoleon - in its entirety. Along with his foreign sidekick Pedro, Napoleon battles his way through the day in his own crude fashion. Pedro plays an integral role in the movie by providing an alternative brand of humor that bonds seamlessly with Napoleon's. One last note about the movie before you go watch it (if you haven't) - the reason this movie is so funny to me is because it is quite apparent that these people are not trying to be funny. It's just the way they are. They do it all straight-faced! Don't we all love people like that? 8 out of 10, it's worth an hour and a half of your day. Thanks for reading!",Napoleon Dynamite

But I can say that I was busting up several times throughout this film.  It is a bit of a trifle and the plot might be thought a cliche: a few outsiders who somehow find each other and find that if they stick together they can do pretty big things that make a difference.  Still, there is nothing cliched about the performances or situations in this film.  It really feels as unique and novel and fresh as, say, Rushmore did when it appeared on the scene.  I happen to have lived quite a bit in the rural west, and the characterizations are right on the mark.  But they manage to achieve this without being derivative -- at the same time these characters seemed very familiar to me as one who has lived in the rural West, but they also were like no one I had ever met.  Very nice job, Jared Hess, and the rest of the cast.

Any single line of Pedro's or the great Uncle Rico is instantly classic comedy gold. If the perfect timing of comedy and dead-pan humor is your thing, NAPOLEON DYNAMITE is totally your film and, as I've seen myself, good for days and days of ""remember the part where . . ."" recollections.

I appreciated it even more when I watched it with the director's comments. Its almost like they just took some very funny childhood memories and put them in a film. Having grown up in the Midwest I could totally relate to some of those scenes! The movie is also very pretty with the huge expanses of country landscape.

My taste in movies ranges from classics like Pulp Fiction and Scarface to really quite mindless films like Super Troopers. I definitely wouldn't classify ND as a mindless film, but it is one of the funniest I've ever seen! The rural life pictured is something I can relate to, not actually living there but visiting family from time to time. The characters were so obscure and bizarre yet I found myself easily believing their existence in the film. The scenes were choppy, and some of them were random, but I truly believe that there were many reasons for that being so. I think the choppy scenes were meant to keep the viewer guessing (and show that Napoleon's life is as unpredictable as the scenes in this movie!) and the random things Napoleon encounters just shows how crazy and ridiculous life in rural farmland can be. The acting was fantastic!! I could see people complaining about the lack of a major plot, but it wasn't the plot that was the focus, it was just the aspects of Napoleon's life. It's not a movie for everyone (keep an open mind), but I can at least say that I loved every minute of it and rate it a 10 out of 10.",Napoleon Dynamite

As much as i hear people talk about how great and how hilarious it was, i've never heard anyone ever reminisce about really memorable moments in the movie with much enthusiasm (napolean's dance scene being the one exception). i wanted to like this movie and in spite of some small funny bits, here and there, i was pretty disappointed.

(Minor spoiler in the next paragraph)The plot never really developed and the resolutions with the various characters at the end with the exception of Napoleon were incomplete and Rico's made absolutely no sense - where was that female interest earlier in the film?It seemed to me as if the film was made as an excuse to put a bunch of funny scenes together that had no relation at all and the story itself served as an asterisk. Too many of the scenes had nothing at all to do with the plot development (IE the milk tasting and chicken scenes.)Of course, like everyone else I enjoy humor in films, but a mistake is often made when comedic scenes are included in the movie that serve no purpose in the plot development - Napoleon Dynamite had too many of these.
I must say the performances were great and the characters hard to forget. Not a bad film for a rookie, but it did have its share of flaws.",Napoleon Dynamite
983,beanerjuic,this movie sucked,1,20 January 2005,"i am sorry to all of you that liked this movie. I love stupid pointless humor and i hated this. i found it a waste of my time, the best part about the movie is maybe using quotes from it with friends, this is all this movie is good for, a couple of funny moments to make this hour and a half enjoyable. But even quoting this movie gets old fast. no offense to anyone who liked this movie, i just don't see it. Hey if you liked this movie, congratulations, you actually got some entertainment out of this movie. The lack of intelligence and humor in this movie is amazing and i really don't understand why this movie got such a good rating on the IMDb scale. If you liked this movie, don't instantly give it a 9 or 10, i can see where many people enjoy this movie because many of my friends have explained why this movie is ""so good"", but when i look on this site to help me decide if i want to watch a movie, i want a little more general rating. Either people love this movie and give it a 10 or people hate it and give it a 1, here the 10's beat out the 1's to help this movie out.really didn't like this movie",Napoleon Dynamite
984,dtgraham,Awful,1,21 May 2005,"The second worst film in history. I haven't seen every other film ever made, so I'm reserving number one in case I find one that is even worse than this hopeless effort. Almost every character in this film is entirely unlikable. The only one who even comes close to likable manages to be merely pathetic. John Heder as Napoleon Dynamite is two-dimensional: either dull or rude. Efren Ramirez plays Pedro with a completely flat affect; cardboard has more texture. Tina Majorino as Deb is cute and has moments of sweetness, but mainly comes across as pathetic and has an inexplicable crush on Napoleon. On a positive note, I borrowed the DVD so I didn't waste two bucks on it. Then again, I'll never get back those two hours I wasted.",Napoleon Dynamite
985,mrobison-1,Napoleon IS Dynamite,9,28 May 2004,"This movie is hilarious. I saw it last night in a packed auditorium on the Stanford University campus. Everybody laughed their heads off. At the end, a very large, very loud cheer went up. The director, actors, and production crew seemingly all come from the same innocent, hilarious world as there is a real unity of vision in what these folks have accomplished. What this movie needs now is a good sequel. I hope they will continue to follow Napoleon as he moves into adulthood and beyond. What a hoot. See it early. See it often. Just see it. The music, costumes and sets all add to the crazy nature of this picture. Who could have thought all this stuff up? I think the director and the lead actor have great futures ahead of them. For some reason, I believe either or both of them could pull off serious cinema, too. We'll just wait and see. Sweet!",Napoleon Dynamite
986,Redwing125,Lucky!,10,7 August 2004,"This movie is absolute comedy, Napoleon gets his ass kicked everyday and you almost feel bad that your laughing at this kids horrible life yet you cant help but laugh. When i saw the movie with my friends there was probably like only 30 people in the theater yet some parts were so funny that i didn't get the hear the next couple of lines because the the theater was so loud with laughter. I also liked the underlying comedic parts in this movie, like the fact that this kid whose name is Napoleon befriends a new Mexican student at school. if you have passed the 7th grade I am sure you know what Napoleon did to the native Mexicans when he landed there. (they don't like him down there too much.) I give this movie a 10 and if you like laughing you should go see this movie.",Napoleon Dynamite
987,pak989,Absolutetly awful!,1,10 March 2005,"Napoleon Dynamite has got to be one of, if not, the worst films i've ever seen. Its a real shame that this film got so much positive recognition, now sun dance will be filled with half-A$$ed crap like this. The acting is appalling, the plot is practically nonexistent, and although there are a few laughs this is a comedy and should have been a lot funnier. I originally saw it because i was told how funny it was. I walked out of the theater halfway through and asked for my money back, or at least a small soda to get the awful taste of the ""film"" out of my mouth. But i decided to give it a 2nd chance so i rented it and was equally dissatisfied. Too bad so many people think this ""film"" is ""so awesome and if you don't like it then your an idiot, god!""

I heard about this movie from a friend who had seen the short film that it is based on, 'Peluca'. I didn't really know much about the film going in other than that it would probably make me laugh. Well, I've seen it 3 times now and I laughed myself silly every time. Everyone I've taken to see it laughed. Everyone I saw in the theatre was laughing. In fact, I haven't met one person (in real life, mind you) who didn't find this movie hilarious. I imagine there are people out there who 'won't get it'. In fact, my dad claims he didn't understand what made most of the jokes funny (he's kind of old-fashioned) but he laughed throughout and even quotes this film often. So, I guess what I'm trying to say is that if you enjoy a few (well, a lot of) really good laughs, you owe it to yourself to see this movie.",Napoleon Dynamite
989,robstl70,Make up your own mind,8,25 February 2005,"The movie is quirky and off center. It is character driven with a thin plot but deliberately made that way. It has a somewhat Coen brothers vibe to it in my opinion.You won't see any Hollywood b.s. No explosions, no special agents, no aliens or car chases, no 'stars'. No emotional moments where the music crescendos over and over to try and invoke a tear or swell of happiness from the audience.Don't listen to those who say it is a great movie or those who say it's the worst (especially don't listen to those who dissect and critique every element to a gnat's ass).It doesn't matter if you're 12 or 65, it doesn't matter if you're from New York city or Goober, Alabama.

990,grae_d,This movie is as much fun as hunting wolverines,8,11 June 2004,"I'll start with the bottom line: Napoleon Dynamite is a WAY fun film. Although the humor really only shines through to those completely in the mood for it, the film is overall an off-beat surprise. The performances are consistent, the script is tight...and let's face it: Who DOESN'T want a liger? I'm a big fan of everything from Citizen Kane to Major League, and so far this summer has been pretty depressing movie-wise. Jared Hess has bestowed upon us all the gift of charming quirkiness--and now I have something worthwhile to give my money to! This film will succeed on word of mouth only, so see the movie, go to the website, join the fanclub, and spread the word! Support filmmakers who are doing something a little different! And vote for Pedro!",Napoleon Dynamite
991,sidouj,Funniest movie in years,10,16 August 2004,"This movie made me laugh so hard I had tears in my eyes. I have seen a large number of movies and this movie is one of the best comedies in years. This movie was refreshing and hilarious and I would suggest it to anyone looking for a movie to go and see. The great thing about this movie was that it did not resort to crude bathroom humor or gross acts by the characters to get a laugh like many of the comedies released now. The characters themselves made this movie hilarious. Napoleon is such a dork that he reminds anyone out of highschool of some one they went to highschool with. Pedro, Deb, Kip, and Uncle Rico complement Napoleon so well and make his world even more bizarre. This movie was an ingenious creation and anyone who has seen it will most likely agree with me about my assessment.",Napoleon Dynamite
992,reedwilliams_,Artistic Genius,10,14 June 2004,"I have seen this movie three times and the thing that I keep noticing is the incredible level of detail. From the character mannerisms to the dialogue, I have never seen a movie with this level of detail. It really is a work of genius and has everything you could ask for in a movie. It is original, incredibly realistic, tells a great story, makes you see things in yourself you have never seen before, or forgotten about, and makes you laugh.The true geniuses in movies create something. Usually a character, for instance Harry Potter. Napoleon Dynamite is the most incredible character that I recall ever being created. It is artistry at its best.If you are looking for violence and sex, this is not the movie for you. But, if you are a true movie file, or like to have a good time and laugh, you cannot go wrong! Enjoy.Reed",Napoleon Dynamite

I loved her in all the other movies she played in. She truly is an ACTRESS and deserves all she gets. And Pedro, his slow speed really made him great. I hope I see more of this actor in movies. He really is great and the movie was great. I saw it twice and I am definitely getting it when it comes on DVD. My husband even loved it. it was his idea to see it again. And he usually doesn't like movies like that. I am glad and I went and saw it. I recommend this movie if ur lookin to laugh really hard. Some people might not like it and some do. I know I do.

994,pancakes2141,A brilliant representation of comedic genius,8,21 March 2014,"I decided to see this movie out of sheer curiosity and boredom. I'm going to be honest. I checked on all the usual channels I watch (History, SciFi, Discovery, the like), but to no avail could I find anything worth watching. That's around the time when I decided to sink to the unholy depths of ""XFinity On Demand"". I was scrolling through the usual stupid movies I didn't care anything about when suddenly, something caught my eye. Napoleon Dynamite. When I was a kid, my parents wouldn't let me watch this movie because when I was seven, ""frick"" and ""crap"" were the most explicit words to ever venture into mankind's mind. Anyways, out of curiosity I pressed the button on my remote to order the movie and it began.I was able to understand the premise pretty early in the film without having read the description on IMDb, a high-school nobody venturing through the daily struggles of life, all throughout offering an inquisitive dash of comedy to the mix. ""Seems pretty cliché"", I thought. I'm going to flat-out say that I do, 100%, regret thinking that. At first ""Napoleon Bonaparte"" just looks like another uninteresting comedy flop, but as you get into it, you get to understand more than that such as the complexity of Napoleon's mind, the intricate details that the writer and director dedicated to the film,Pedro and Napoleon's friendship, and much more. All in all, Napoleon Bonaparte accurately portrays the ""not-so-perilous"" journey from teenager to adult, the friends you'll meet along the way, and the ups and downs of life. All the while taking us on the hilarious ride. This movie was a giant ""Heck, yeah!""",Napoleon Dynamite
995,bopgun22,Funniest I've seen in a VERY long time.,10,16 June 2004,"This film is great. If you're looking for a good time and a lot of laughs look no further. Jon Heder's performance as Napoleon is spot on. Jared Hess has made a 'nerd' film about as charming as it can be. So often these types of films are painful and agonizing to watch, but this one's a joy from beginning to end. And I'm a tough sell at comedy flicks, I hardly ever crack a smile at the typical Hollywood fare, but I laughed constantly throughout this film, and harder than I have in months. After the film for days I had the great lines and comic moments running through my head and through my conversations.So basically, I would recommend this film to anyone, I know my age group (25) will love it, but I also can see my mom and dad enjoying it as well.",Napoleon Dynamite
996,m_shernock,year's best movie,10,6 August 2004,"I thought this movie was terrific, if you're into that kind of humor. Some people don't enjoy sitting for two hours and laughing at pathetic loners, but since I am one of those loners, I thought this movie was great! It has great acting by the main character, lines that are funny as hell, and perfectly portrays those ""unicorn-loving liger-drawing losers"" that fortunately, are rarely seen in high schools anymore. This movie has the same type of humor as seen in films like ""Rushmore"", ""The Royal Tenenbaums"", and ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"", so it really a love it/hate it situation, but I thought all of the actors did an awesome job at making their characters as well-thought out as possible. Also, this movie has the best dance sequence ever...see for yourself.",Napoleon Dynamite
997,semis1,I loved the pointlessness,10,17 August 2004,"I loved this movie. The whole reason why it was great and enjoyable is because it WAS pointless. You're not supposed to think about it, just have fun watching it. I honestly was upset when the movie was over because it was one of the only movies you could go to this summer to enjoy and have a good laugh. And Jon Heder can dance like no other white boy. I hope that we see these actors in more movies, because they were honest and hysterically funny. They all did extremely well with understanding their characters and the script. I really loved this movie and I give it a Ten. If you didn't like it, loosen up a bit, go back and see it, and see what you can enjoy.",Napoleon Dynamite

You don't have to be 17 to really enjoy this story.....Its even better the second time you watch it. Give it a chance......you will enjoy.......Jon Heder did a great job in this movie......If you buy the DVD and listen to Jon and Jared Hess narrate, you really get a feel for what they were trying to accomplish. This movie proves that you do not need millions of dollars and tons of special effects to create something entertaining. There was no cursing, nudity or explosions, nor were they needed. I hope that Jared Hess has a Napolean 2 in the works......The casting director deserves quite a bit of credit as each actor was casted perfect for the role that they played. Enjoy the movie as good family comedy's are hard to come by. Actually, this movie is deeper than a comedy as it draws on your emotions. How can you not feel bad for Napolean, or repulsed by uncle Rico. i repeat a great great movie which I highly recommend.",Napoleon Dynamite
999,shavian1,I found this film refreshing,8,2 April 2005,"I had no idea what kind of film this was. My son who is 18 told me that it was a film about nothing. Kind of interesting but not really. He was surprised that I enjoyed the film and I am planning on adding it to my collection.First of all I think it is great that a $400,000 film could make over 40 million without a single curse word or cleavage shot. I had no preconceived notions about the film and never even thought of it as a comedy. I saw it as more of a look in to what it was, a fly on the wall look the lives of everyday kids just being what they are. I found it interesting if for no other reason than the fact that the kids were real. By real I mean that hadn't been brainwashed by MTV, Britney Spears, American Idol and all of the other crap that kids seem to have their lives dipped in to. If they drink Mountain Dew it is because they like the way it tastes, not because some kid on a skateboard tells them to.Their feelings were real. They were living their own lives. They weren't trying to be Mr. Bling Bling or the school hottie. They were just trying to live their lives while the people with the real social and emotional problems tried to beat them down to raise their social standing among the rest of the herd.Pedro was my favorite. He didn't say much but what he said came from his heart. I also liked the quiet tone of the whole film. Minimalist for sure. I also think that this is a film for people that enjoy film and don't have to laugh out loud or be on the edge of their seat the whole time just to think it's a good movie.If you try to stuff this film in to preexisting hole it will fall flat I am sure. Open your mind. View it like it is the only movie ever made. Don't expect anything. Don't want anything. Enjoy it for what it is, not what you want it to be.",Napoleon Dynamite
1000,sbsqrulez,Funniest movie ever!,10,25 July 2004,"Napoleon dynamite is one of the most funny movies ever to be released. Jon Heder's performance as the stereotypical dork/geek is incredibly dead on that even people who did not like the movie have to say he did a good job. It's plots lack of severe importance allows the movie to expand to other realms and create ""side plots"" thereby creating more and more opportunities for the laughs to show up. Right now it seems as though most people either hate or love napoleon dynamite, with there being no in-between. I personally loved the movies integration of randomness and physical comedy into a movie that people can actually stand to watch and/or laugh at. There seems to be few hardcore fans right now, but eventually, however, I believe that this movie will slowly evolve into a cult classic.",Napoleon Dynamite

Or better yet sleep through the whole movie, The plot just never got to the point and the movie just seem to go no where. I am sure that the movie could have been great with a lot of rewrite and an actor that would enjoy doing a movie like that. Jon Heder just didn't have what it took to get the movie going so it was stuck in slow motion the whole time. Maybe with a different cast and a rewrite of the whole movie it might be worth watching.

1003,elementsrock,"Napoleon has the ""skills"" to make the grade.",10,6 August 2004,"This is quite possibly one of the funniest films I have ever seen. The entire cast has something great to bring to the table but Napoleon, Uncle Rico, Kip, and Pedro, surely have the standout performances. Jon Heder's 'Napoleon' character is perfect from the clothes he wears down to the fact his eyes are so squinted it seems as if they are closed. His perpetual annoyance with everything, whether just or not, is hilarious. Jon Gries 'Uncle Rico' is a picture perfect high school football player that never left the game. The character is so well done that I'm sure if you check what year the clothes he wore were made, that it would be 1982 the same with his van. Aaron Ruell who plays Napoleons uber-nerd brother 'Kip' does one of the best transformations I've seen in any film, I won't spoil what it is.If Napoleon wasn't awkward enough on his own, insert 'Pedro'. Pedro and Napoleon really work well together and feeding off each other's presence, allow for the other to shine. All in all, the film is better than any other Mtv film to date (Dead Man on Campus, which I loved as well, Varsity Blues, and The Perfect Score.) and has the 'skills' to make the grade. If you can, stay through the credits until you reach the hidden ending.",Napoleon Dynamite
1004,carlyidema,"For a ""Dumb"" Movie, Napoleon Dynamite is Incredibly Smart",10,3 June 2019,"One of the best things about Napoleon Dynamite is its ability to be what seems like a simple movie made for laughs while actually being incredibly well-crafted. I'm not saying it's a masterful piece of art that deeply examines human nature (its purpose is absolutely to be a funny and lighthearted good time), but I can't think of a comedy that does a better job connecting all of its parts or treating the audience as people with brains that don't need everything explained to them. The other best thing is the quotes. And the acting. And the tater tots.
An interesting thing about the plot of the movie is that there kind of isn't one. The movie functions on its characters, especially when it comes to its titular character Napoleon (Jon Heder), and has many smaller, interwoven plots throughout the course of the film without having an overarching goal. Most of the time spent with just Napoleon is random sequences that serve to let the audience know who he is without furthering a storyline. The main stories we follow are Napoleon's Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) and older brother Kip (Aaron Ruell) being door-to-door food storage container salesmen, Napoleon and his new friend Pedro (Efren Ramirez) trying to get dates for the school dance, Kip's relationship with a girl he met online (Shondrella Avery), and Pedro's run for school president against the generic popular pretty girl, Summer (Haylie Duff).
I consider this to be one of my favorite movies. I love the humor: in the dialogue, in the movements of the actors, in the choices for shots and transitions, and in its crazy mess of a plot (or lack thereof). It was only from watching it while trying to really pay attention and analyze it that I realized how spectacularly well-thought-out it is. Almost nothing happens in the movie that hasn't been referenced beforehand in a way that makes the actions of the characters very believable. It's a movie that is great the first time you see it and better the next when you pick up on a character mentioning something that we later see. Even the introduction credit sequence is great, as it is shown in food that is all eaten by characters later in the movie.
Something that the script of Napoleon Dynamite does amazingly well is treating the audience like smart people. Everything makes sense, but very rarely is anything explicitly explained. The film knows that we are able to figure things out on our own and doesn't waste time having a character explain their motivation for an action when the audience knows it just by watching. For example, one sequence shows Pedro stopping at a drinking fountain under a poster for class president elections and wordlessly looking up at it, and the next scene has him asking Napoleon if anyone would vote for him and what his platform should be. They don't need to show him saying ""I'm going to run for president."" We can figure out that that happened. It feels good to watch a movie that jumps into a conversation at a point that adds new details (and adds a healthy dose of hilarious non-sequiturs).
The work of the actors in this movie, especially Jon Heder as Napoleon, is spectacular. It is very impressive to be able to play a low energy and almost monotonous character in an engaging way. Every actor in the film does an amazing job truly embodying their character and making the audience feel like that is just who they are.
This movie has something of a coming-of-age feel to it. It's made to be a comedy without a strong message, but it wouldn't be hard to change a couple of things to make it about a nerdy kid finding his way, like if The Breakfast Club only focused on Brian. As it stands, Napoleon Dynamite is basically a John Hughes movie with weirder characters.
I get that this movie isn't everyone's cup of tea (or plate of tots). No real person is as quirky as these characters, there isn't really a point besides comedy, and if you like outlandish physical comedy, this would be a really boring movie. But if you look at the heart of the film and its creativity in making comedy, you end up with one of the most funny, clever, and well-crafted comedies around. If you watch Napoleon Dynamite, all your wildest dreams will come true.",Napoleon Dynamite
1005,clayton-29,Speaking of Emperors...,1,26 January 2005,"This one has no clothes either. Although there were some amusing scenes in the film such as their election process, overall this movie is slow-moving. It would not have annoyed those of us who are panning it so much except for all of the wannabe hipsters who are raving about it. It's a mildly entertaining movie, that's all. To speak of it like it's the next Citizen Kane will only ensure the people you suggest it to will take your next review with a grain of salt.But there's hope for MTV's production company. There are still plenty of secondary characters from the 1984 classic Revenge of the Nerds to make a spin off from besides Timothy Busfield's Arnold Pointdexter.

It's a poorly acted film (except for Pedro) that delivers one unfunny scene after another. Napolean is portrayed in such an obviously overacted way that you start to hate him after a while and cheer when bad things happen to him. A terrible ripoff of Slackers, with tries to show the bored and distant Gen-X POV. There was nothing likable about this character. He's a wormy woman of a man. I don't understand the hype behind this film. Believe it or not it even rips off Road Trip towards the end with the whole interracial love subplot. The whole feel of the film seems like a bunch of kids who got some money together to film a movie they thought would be almost avant guard, but it really misses.

The thing about ND is that everyone has met or knows someone LIKE Napoleon Dynamite, which is what makes it all the more funny.

This film is on the same level as Monty Python or Woody Allen; it clicks with a certain audience and they love it. Nearly every line of this masterpiece is quotable, not just because of the words of the lines themselves but because of the performances.

Maybe a little weak on the story, but I came for the funny, and wasn't disappointed! I felt that other movies that are just trying to play on random comedy, like Office Space, can't hold a candle to N.D., especially for the laugh factor. The best part of the movie may have been the way that Jon Heder, Efren Ramirez, and Aaron Ruell play off the lovable loser characters, and leave you walking away like you just watched the coolest geeks ever to walk the face of the earth!",Napoleon Dynamite
1014,lehenne-1,ha ha ha ha i LOVE this movie!!!,10,18 January 2005,"BLOODY BRILLIANT! pardon my British. i swear this movie is the BEST EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! bid ye fair warning- go into it knowing that it isn't a drama. it has what some of my more close-minded friends would call ""no plot"". i think that aspect of the movie was artistic and the single thing that made it so fabulous. everybody who watches this movie will know at least one of the characters. (i mean that figuratively of course.) this is such a real movie, and the characters are real people. they live in a real world with real conflicts and real relationships. and a real llama. no fairytale endings, no near-death experiences (unless you count when uncle rico throws a steak at napoleon's head).... i laugh my butt off every time i see it. believe me folks, this one will be a classic someday. GET OFF YOUR BUTT AND GO RENT NAPOLEON DYNAMITE. even better, just buy it. and get an extra copy for me. peace out.",Napoleon Dynamite
1015,ShadoMaster,Mentally Retarded,1,5 January 2005,"Oh my god, I just got done watching this movie and I still can't believe that MTV (as already lame as they are) would put out such a completely retarded movie. If a mentally retarded person smoked a bag of pot, and then wrote a script, it would turn out like this. Like the only thing it has going for it is that it is so stupid that it can make you laugh at it's stupidity before realizing that it's kinda sad too. Its like if you were to take a stereotype of the most boring people, put them together, and then point cameras at them. Like an idiotic Real World. I think this ranks down there with the only people who will like it are people who like movies like the original black and white Night of the Living Dead. Sadness :'(",Napoleon Dynamite
1016,metzgersf,Vote for Pedro!,10,9 June 2004,"This film is bizarre and not for everyone. But if you're interested in what is sure to become a cult classic, you must check this out. You may leave the theater wondering why some people like this so much, but you'll know that you've seen something totally individual. Surely the filmmakers made decisions hoping for the audience members to look at each other and say, ""What the heck?"" A synopsis of the plot may sound like a standard teen film. It includes social cliques, a popularity contest masquerading as a class president election, the underdog teens, and adults who are too dysfunctional to avoid making the young character's lives harder than they already are. In addition to these standard devices, however, are emasculating time machines, hunger-striking llamas, an Idaho nerd in a doo-rag, and the most surprising dance number ever. Gosh! So weird. I loved this movie.",Napoleon Dynamite
1017,imikix,So bad it's bad.,3,20 September 2004,"I found the humor dated and shallow, and was disappointed with the movie.* I'm not saying that I don't enjoy a cheap laugh (which is what I entered the theater expecting, at the very least), but that implies that the material induces laughter in the first place.If your friends are hyping this movie up to some kind of a transcendental experience, wait until they buy a copy and watch it on their dime. People have pointed out that it's a love-it-or-hate-it movie, and I couldn't agree more. I see how a lot of people find this funny, and that's frustrating to me.I've seen this, Garden State, and Sky Captain in the last two weeks--all of which are first features by writer/directors. I was disappointed by all three, but Napoleon Dynamite is the only one of the bunch that I would deem atrocious. All three have a few memorable scenes, which were probably imagined by the writers at various stages of their lives as they lived in the material, but essential elements like a set of characters and storytelling are added merely as a means of turning this bricolage of cool little ideas into a ""cohesive"" feature-length film.I have a feeling that one needs to have lived and/or traveled in Idaho to find any humor in this movie. On the other hand, Alexander Payne creates scenarios in Omaha, Nebraska and makes them funny and entertaining. Having never been to either territory and as yet having no desire to change that circumstance, I have to say that Payne's execution of high school life in the modern agrarian city is vastly superior to Hess's. Election is a fine film that zeroes in on high school politics, but in comparison to Napoleon Dynamite, it's a masterpiece on the level of The Godfather.It's not the ""worst movie ever""--but it's past the point of being so bad it's good, when you find humor in the carnage and wonder at the backstory of how such a disaster was made in the first place. It's one of those films that's so bad it's bad. You'll want to expunge it from your mind before every time you hear the word ""GOSH!"" (especially explicit reenactments of Napoleon's vernacular) triggers migraine headaches and/or destructive fits that end with you on death row and the Napoleon-wannabe wishing he/she were already dead from the injuries.It's worth my time to point out that it's a pretty crappy way to spend your time and money. It's too late for me to walk out of the theater in the middle of the movie now, but not too late to make my dread of the film clear to the world (at least those who read IMDb) and get some sleep at night.*Before I get clobbered about the usage of the word ""dated,"" it's one thing to mock decades past by appropriating their more absurd and embarrassing trends in a present-day story, it's another to recycle jokes and scenarios that've been better delivered in other films and TV specials.",Napoleon Dynamite
1018,moonloverz,fantastic!,10,16 March 2005,"This movie was absolutely hysterical! It's a shame that I missed it on full screen so I could have heard the comments of disgust as well as the guffaws of full-blown appreciation from other viewers. I understand some of you may not have understood the fine quirks of the comedy presented - my own fiancé didn't quite get why I was laughing so hard, but then again he looks at me oddly when I am doubled over laughing at the Pink Panther/Gods Must Be Crazy movies - but to each their own. It takes a fine appreciation of 'different' humor to realize how brilliant this movie is. It's not a movie that makes fun of 'nerds', but rather helps realize that they are just like everyone else...perhaps showing that they are even more of an ""individual"" than the other stereotypical teenage girl or guy. Admirers of the movie, unite! DANG! What a great movie! I think I'll have to watch it again tonight to catch the subtleties I missed while laughing.. Rock on Napoleon!!! Peace..",Napoleon Dynamite
1019,PerfectlyNormal,I laughed from beginning to end - instant cult classic!,9,19 June 2004,"A rare movie that made me laugh out loud repeatedly - I left the theater with my cheeks hurting, and it wasn't because the seats were uncomfortable. I get the feeling some people will hate this film, perhaps because it is not fast-paced enough for them and there are no explosions or gun battles, but it is a must-see ""indie"" for those with the patience to sit back, relax, and allow themselves to be entertained. It has ""instant cult classic"" written all over it.This flick is a light-hearted, nicely paced view into the life of the ultimate teenage loser-nerd. Napoleon and friends are such superdorks you feel no compunction about laughing at their bizarre conversations and antics, yet you also can't help but sympathize with them, possibly due to their incredibly childlike natures, or the fact that they are trapped in washed up, washed out, middle-of-bloody-nowhere Idaho, with fashions and mind-sets apparently stuck in the mid-80s. Napoleon's appearance, mannerisms, and speech are enough in themselves to make you laugh, but add to them the strange situations he ends up in between his attempts to entertain himself, acquire some ""skills"", make some money, and deal with his also dorky brother and uncle, and you have frequent reason to at least chuckle, or more often laugh out loud, sometimes until your eyes water. Halfway through my first viewing I was already thinking of about 10 people I knew who simply had to see this movie - who would love it and laugh as hard as, if not harder, than I did. If you need a break from dramatic indies, but still want a good ""non-Hollywood"" laugh, go see this film right away.",Napoleon Dynamite
1020,smithnwesson,Don't WASTE Your Money on this 1 laugh BORING 'comedy',1,24 August 2004,"I actually laughed, maybe a chuckle is more accurate, ONCE. Too long, too NOT funny, way TOO DUMB. If you wait until AFTER the credits roll, you will get the final end of the movie. This could have been a 5 to 10 minute short had the editors done their job, heck, just make it a full length 7 minute trailer and save us some time. The two main characters have a ""blank drugged out stare"" with semi opened mouths during most of the movie. Gets old and BORING really fast. Maybe if you see this movie drunk or late at night when you are giddy it may be slightly humorous. Otherwise it is humorless.My daughter heard it was a good movie that didn't get much attention or under rated like October Sky was. WRONG! It is an over rated TURD.",Napoleon Dynamite

1022,Club_Silencio,pretty funny,6,25 June 2004,"+might be SPOILERS, i haven't thought that far ahead+The first time I saw this movie, i thought it was HILARIOUS, easily one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I didn't think it had much story, plot, or depth, but I didn't dislike it for that.After seeing it a second time, when I wasn't laughing quite so much, I started to feel that the movie has more depth and meaning than i thought. There is very subtle body language from all the actors that doesn't convey emotion as much as it conveys the presence of emotions that aren't being shown, which works for the film. The acting itself is also done very good, and if done by more well-known actors, it might have been over-exaggerated. The story is just a snapshot of the lives of 5 or 6 people as they dwell in a small town, and nothing that will change the world happens, just some things that people might talk about for a few weeks or months (especially Pedro's ""skit"" at the end).I'm not trying to say Napolean Dynamite says something important or is full of depth. Its a comedy that extremely funny, and it doesn't get heavily involved in love stories or villains. I still think its hilarious and one of the funniest movies I've seen, but now i appreciate it even more for its well-balanced elements and subtleties.",Napoleon Dynamite

The dance scene was the best, too. Like when he's flippin out in his bedroom, fine-tuning his skills for Pedro's skit. Besides, his fly 80's moon galoshes are HOT.The soundtrack is amazing as well. I just bought it the other day, and it's even got clips from the movie in between each and every music track. It's great background / driving / being lame and sitting in front of the computer...music.",Napoleon Dynamite
1024,nathan-144,Unexplainably great film,10,29 June 2004,"Napoleon Dynamite is one of the kind of films that has no real plot, but that's the whole plot. It's just humor and trying to get people to laugh. If you are looking for a movie that's an actual movie, don't see it. It's as simple as that, the way it looks is the way it is. When I saw it the first time, I was questioning how funny it would be the way the beginning credits were, but the lack of effort in the acting and the overall mood of the movie make it what it is. Had there been at least some effort in the acting, Napoleon Dynamite would just not been nearly as good of a movie. At one point, it seemed as Napoleon was going to fall asleep while talking, and it made that part hilarious.",Napoleon Dynamite
1025,seanholliday,Fantastic!,9,11 August 2004,"Despite the comparisons to other directors' styles that seem to crop up in most of the reviews I've read, Napoleon Dynamite is completely unique. It is its own blend of heart and humor. And it's not for everyone. A few will find it slow and---remarkably---unfunny. Most people, however, will appreciate it and agree that it is---at the very least---pretty funny. And then there are the chosen few; the other 20-30 percent for whom Napoleon Dynamite is fall-out-of-your-chair, slap-your-neighbor hilarious. I'm in that group. I don't think I've ever laughed so hard at the movies. From the opening monologue about a band of Scottish wizards coming together ""to protect our underwater ally"" from the devises of ill-intentioned Japanese scientists, to the side-splitting, climatic finale I was rolling. As was pretty much everyone in the capacity-filled theater. It's just funny. And despite the attempts of a misguided minority, I don't think that can be argued. But putting the comedy aside and looking at Napoleon Dynamite as a film (studying it for its technical merit) it is still a gem. Do not believe the reports that the characters are impossible to care for or that they don't develop. They do. And their development is one of the most endearing things about the film. The final scene is one of the sweetest and most genuine moments in recent movie history. Everything is baby-steps; plot, conflict, character-development. The entire work (including most of the humor) is an exercise in understatement and subtlety. The screenplay is clever. The direction is refreshing. The acting is superb. It's delightful. And it's hilarious---a rare combination.",Napoleon Dynamite

Roughly 2/3 ""get it"" and love it, others trash it as if it was meant to be ""Gone With the Wind""- it's definitely not. It is what it is, and it's hilarious.Perhaps Letterman seemed to sum it up best by calling it strange, then saying repeatedly that you had to see it at least twice, and that it was immensely enjoyable. If you need f-bombs and/or boobs flying at you to keep you entertained- save your money, you won't find them. If you want a tense plot, Oh well- go rent ""The Pelican Brief"".

Wow, original.This movie is essentially the best example of whoring yourself out to make money. Yeah, lets sell this movie to MTV, then the masses will like it.

1029,bigtommyg,Everything but the plot,5,15 January 2005,"First off, let me say that I can see why some people, or even most people, would like the elements of this movie. The characters are mostly decently-rounded and have memorable, endearing qualities (Pedro excluded, unless you think terrible minority stereotyping is a good/funny thing). The gags are numerous and, for some people, will work.But as a movie, Napolean Dynamite simply fails.I would argue that ND's success has relied primarily on the aforementioned characters and gags. This movie has exploded recently as a pop culture influence, its various gags and colloquialisms making their way into ""underground"" high school and college speech (note the dramatic disparity between how younger and older audiences rate it). And it's not the first movie to do so: Pulp Fiction, The Godfather, Donnie Darko, The Big Lebowski, and arguably the bulk of IMDb's Top 250 movies have gained popularity and cultural significance for their dialogue (""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse""), random gags (Bring out The Gimp), and unforgettable characters (Walter, Jules, Marcellus Wallace). But the reason we've stuck around for that fluff in each of the above is, there's an actual story to follow, to stick around FOR.While ND has a number of plot lines -- Pedro's run for the presidency, Napolean's grandmother's accident, the dynamic between Napolean and Deb -- the directors do absolutely nothing to keep us interested in any of them. It's not just that they're predictable, it's that we're too distracted by the fluff to really even notice them. And it's a good thing they don't draw us into what few plots are there, too, because the resolutions are all predictable and poorly-played (are we ever actually told WHEN ND's grandmother got back? No, she just shows up with her alpaca).Someone on the message board described this movie as ""one big deleted scene."" I would tend to agree. If you took half of Napolean Dynamite as-is, spliced in some actual plot lines, and put the rest of it as DVD extras, you'd have a LASTING pop culture phenomenon, and one worth watching. But as it stands, the only reason to watch ND is so you'll understand what your friends are talking about when they say ""Vote for Pedro."" 5/10.",Napoleon Dynamite

I can't even begin to imagine what the producers were thinking. The movie had almost no dialog, the pace was poor, if anything, and the worst of it was it felt like a celebration to stupidity.It's like we're encouraging the meaningless of things, like it's something to be proud of. The TV and the movies are filled with this kind of crap, you see it everywhere; in the soaps, jackass, MTV, TV contests.Frankly, I'm sick n' tired of it! The creators of this movie should be ashamed, they haven't accomplished anything with this flick, they didn't make me laugh, they didn't make me think, cry or anything.. They just left me empty.

1034,kylebradley3-1,This is pretty much like the best movie i ever saw.,10,22 July 2004,"This can probably best be described as my generation's ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High."" When I went to see it, I got two very different opinions of this movie, which were total opposites. I had heard that it was the best movie, and the stupidest movie ever made. I believe, as with fast times, that if you knew someone in high school that reminds you of Napoleon or Pedro, or Summer, you'll enjoy it a lot more than anyone who's already been to their 10 year reunion. The movie takes place in present day Idaho, and is centered around an antisocial angry misfit named Napoleon Dynamite who believes like many of antisocial angry misfits in the real world that he has magical powers and other super human skills. What's interesting is that the movie has absolutely no plot. It follows the events of Napoleon's life from his grandmother getting in a freak ATV accident to the school election where Napoleon has chosen to back an unlikely candidate. I thought that the length of the movie was perfect, it didn't drag on so long that the characters got old and the novelty wore off, but it was still long enough to be satisfying. In short, it was the most fun I had at the movies in a long time, but it's definitely something for younger audiences, but I doubt anyone that isn't in high school yet would appreciate this movie to its fullest extent.",Napoleon Dynamite

For example (and I hope I don't ruin the movie for someone) when Napolean's friend, Pedro, asked Haylie Duff's character to the dance and she wrote back ""NO"", I felt sad. I thought at the end of the movie, I was going to cry for Pedro. The movie was great. You could find some type of meaning if you watch it from a different angle.

The wedding scene at the end is a great bonus, and luckily the credits aren't long.

The film is not trying to be the best, most thought provoking movie ever made, its just funny and different. Anyone that goes to see this movie, and honestly does not laugh at least once (I was laughing the whole time) is ridiculously boring and serious. It's just a really goofy movie made with a small budget and it produces lots of laughs. Don't try to hard to look into it here folks, you're ruining the movie. It's okay to just laugh and not try to win 10,000 dramatic awards with every film you make.

However, after the first half I realized that this movie had none of these things. There are no new jokes and no new quirks. I know this movie has been compared to some of Wes Anderson's films, but there is one main difference here: When Anderson made his films they were original. This film features characters and jokes that are only funny when the audience feels something for them. In this case there is a complete lack of interest in these characters. I was constantly looking for something to make me fall in love with any of the characters, but there was nothing. Also, there are many moments in the plot that do not make sense and are never explained. Some people say that it isn't necessary to the film and just to enjoy it for the humor. But there's my problem...there is no new jokes. Its like hearing the same knock knock joke for the 100th time. You might kind of chuckle, but you think back to the first time you heard it and it will never have that same impact.

To attempt to judge this movie as a serious piece of cinema is toolbox-ish. Dynamite provides the viewer with 1 1/2 hours of awkward brilliance. Yes, this movie has no discernible plot, and lacks many laugh out loud moments, but what Dynamite does provide is an endless barrage of quotable quotes. From the one liners (""Gosh!"") to the exchanges between Kip and Napoleon, this movie leaves one with a myriad of quotes to bust out on friends and family. You may not thoroughly enjoy Napoleon while you are watching, after you have left the theater, you may begin to get it. It's not your normal ""boy meets girl"" teen movie garbage, or your ""action thriller with a love interest crammed into the story to give female viewers something to relate to movie"", and those are the good things about it. I would rather watch Napoleon Dynamite then the contrived, brainless garbage that Hollywood excretes on the mainly brainless viewing audience, which they in turn greedily gobble up (these blights on society are better known as blockbusters). Dynamite does not seek to grab your heart and pull at its strings; it simply portrays the king of all high school nerds.

The fact that there is no plot does should not deter anyone from enjoy this amazing show. Going with friends will only and to the humor and you'll find yourself quoting ND for hours. Lame cookie cutter comedy come out all the time, but only once in awhile does a truly creative and original comedy hit the big screen. This film relies on clever acting and tremendous dialogue rather that sexual references, foul language, and special effects to achieve a much more successful bread of humor.",Napoleon Dynamite
1044,reedontheradio,I want 2 c it again..,10,31 March 2005,"I too thought that I wouldn't like it because so many younger people were saying how good it was.(I'm pushing 40)I even read that Usher, who I have little respect for, loves the movie. But,I gave it a shot and boy was I ever glad. In a movie world full of ""super heroes"", it was refreshing to bring some ""real people"" to the big screen and show that they too can be compelling figures. I'm not very easily entertained. My girlfriend gets movies all the time, and tries to get me to watch them. But honestly I usually can't make it to the end of most of them. There's so much crap out there right now , but this picture was a delight. I highly recommend it to those of all ages. The music is great too. I bought the soundtrack.",Napoleon Dynamite
1045,becky_loves_you,Funny... definition: Napoleon Dynamite,10,26 December 2004,"This is probably the funniest movie ever.Not like anyone can know that...Those comments would be a lot funnier if you've seen Napoleon Dynamite... and if you haven't... IDIOT!This is the funniest movie I have ever seen. The characters are probably the funniest ever. I laughed so hard at this movie, and continue to every time I see it. I watched it 2 1/2 times yesterday and once today and it still cracks me up. I recommend it to anyone and everyone. But as a warning, this movie lacks plot. But it MORE than makes up for it in hilarity.",Napoleon Dynamite
1046,mirsha,Terribly tedious,2,18 May 2005,"Whether this film is funny or not isn't a point, it definitely got a chuckle out of me at a few moments however the whole film is just so terribly tedious. It drags itself along at a snails pace and is one of the most painful to watch films I've ever seen. At least a bad film can normally still be entertaining, either because it's that bad or it has it's moments, Napoleon Dynamite has neither of these attributes, it's the video equivalent of white noise.The gags in the film are amusing in places and strongest at the start of the film but after a while you have oh so very quickly become desensitised to the humour of the film that the rest of the gags pass without a slightest nod of the head. The film is rather amazingly devoid of all sense of energy, the main character as a withdrawn and downtrodden teenager struggling to cope with his own life is fine but every other character of note in the film seems to have the ability to exude the same air of indifference. This film is in my opinion, one best to leave alone. It won't help to pass the time on any level and it's entertainment is weak at best. The film isn't trying to say anything clever or do anything clever visually and the film trundles along under it's own inertia in an irritating manner. I find it hard to believe that this film produced as an MTV film seems to be completely lacking in any of the sense of style of humour present in their other films which obviously appeals to their core demographic.",Napoleon Dynamite
1047,Ricardo-101,Napoleon Dynamite,10,24 January 2005,"This movie pushed all the quirky buttons I love. The flick's somewhat slow pace adds to the comedy, rather than detracts as some of my friends have whined. I love the comic plight of the various characters, they were mostly believable, stretched only in a delightful, humorous shade. I have personally known people in real life, that reminded me of almost every character in this movie. I knew a friend of my father, that would be a dead ringer for Uncle Rico, right down to the toupee with bangs and door to door gimmicks. Spare me the cries of Latino stereotyping, Pedro was no more bizarre than any of the other characters. Tina Majorino doesn't steal the movie, but she comes close with a performance that keeps you smiling at her endless accepting optimism and adaptable spirit. She becomes Dork War's Princess Leia. Napoleon's character, is an odd jangle of classic dork, odd jangly genes, and teenage angst, wrapped into a package of hilarious self-doubts. His nuances are comic, but understandable by all who have tread the high school halls. You recognize all the themes and characters in school, whether you were one of the in-crowd or relegated to the outskirts like the heroes here. A great script and fantastic cast, culminating in a film that could weirdly be described as a rural hinterland where Revenge Of The Nerds,Office Space and Sling Blade meet Mary Hartman in 3/4 time.",Napoleon Dynamite
1048,mere_coincidence_,Brilliant,10,7 August 2004,"When I saw this in theaters, the crowd started cheering at least a dozen times before it was over... and then for a while afterward. Like myself, Napoleon Dynamite is not a cool guy. That's probably why it's so easy to identify with him. A lot of times Hollywood gives us the sweet-but-shy underdogs, the nerds, the goofy sidekicks... but this guy is a LOSER. The kind that you talked to in High School but were always a little embarrassed to be seen with. He's not smart, he's not talented, he buys a suit for the dance (one of the coolest suits I've ever seen, by the way) at Deseret, which is basically a Mormon version of the Salvation Army. He's a big fan of unicorns. I've seen a few bad reviews for this film, and I really don't get it - this is one of the best movies I've seen in years! It's funny in a way that never gets tired and never tries to be too clever. The setting is (sadly) accurate, the plot is engaging and the acting is perfectly believable. And there's a llama! Maybe you have to actually be _in_ Idaho to appreciate the kind of pathetic, self-deprecating sense of humor that we cherish here, but I hope not - for your sake.Favorite line: ""Tina, come get some ham.

1049,deeloo_chen,Worst Movie Ever,1,28 May 2005,"My friends and I couldn't stop swearing at the TV when we sat through the entire 85 minutes of this crap, dull and UNfunny movie. Sure there were a few laughs at the silliness and absurdity of it all BUT.. it was a WASTE of time. After the movie my friends and I just looked at one another blankly, saying ""WTF was that all about?"" I want my 85 minutes back. Sure, it portrays the high school life perfectly and is funny at times, but so what? Other movies have done this. And its being original? please, if thats what you call originality, I put a pile of turd on the floor, film how people react to it, and release a movie of 2 hours. HA! That can top the box office.",Napoleon Dynamite
1050,Rolex_Tharsus,Awful awful film...,1,30 November 2005,"As a connoisseur of both US high school movies and brain-dead slacker films, I simply want to to say that this is the worst example of either genre I have ever seen. Don't believe the hype! It makes Dude Where's My Car look like Citizen Kane. That poor. In fact, this is the first time in a long while I have given up watching a film before the end - I did scan through the remaining 3 chapters on the DVD in case it looked as though it got better, but it did not. Poor characterisation, lack of plot, lack of jokes, a bad attempt to try and imitate Beavis & Butthead that fails (ie. the staring forward blankly with simple dialogue that reoccurs throughout this film), and of course commits many cardinal sins in the realm of High School films - NEVER make your geeks/ nerds into idiots, and if you fall into that trap NEVER make them the main characters, and even if you go that far you could at least introduce some other characters as characters rather than plot devices (ie. Summer could easily have been expanded into an interesting character to play-off against Napoleon & Pedro)! Imagine Weird Science with Gary Wallace & Wyatt Donnelly as two geeks who don't do anything particularly interesting, and Chet Donnelly appearing once, which says to the audience ""oh look Wyatt's got a brother"", or the Breakfast Club where they sit around and stare without any conversation, or Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back where they do nothing! Sorry if this sounds overly harsh, but Napoleon Dynamite to me was a bitter disappointment.",Napoleon Dynamite
1051,4junk,what's not to get?,10,9 August 2004,"For those IDIOTS who wonder about the mental health of those us who did get (and loved!) Napoleon Dynamite, let me try to explain it to you.First of all, this is not a depressing movie. We are not mocking nerds. This movie is a celebration of Napoleon and all that he stands for...that is, it is cool to be yourself no matter what the latest trends might imply. What ""Ts"" him off is that no one around seems to know how cool he is. So he continues in his pursuit of great skills, not to impress the so-called cool kids in school, but because he wants to have skills...he couldn't care less about what others think of who he knows he is (he just hates that some of the people around him, i.e. Kip or Uncle Rico, might reflect an image that is just not Napoleon). That is what makes this movie such a triumph! It isn't the typical Hollywood tripe where we see the nerd, take pity on him, see his miraculous transformation into a carbon copy of the 'beautiful' people and happily see him fit in with the mainstream. No, what we see is that Napoleon actually likes what he wears, where he shops and especially what he draws. He doesn't try to change who he is so instead of conforming to an image that might make you (and you know who you are you idiots!) more comfortable, he just is who he is. Second, for those who think the characters are contrived or 'not real'...where did you grow up?? I totally knew these people! I went to school with them and they were, by and large, ignored by most of our classmates. That's probably why we don't ever see their characters in movies; they are simply outside your narrow periphery, therefore, you probably considered them beneath your notice. Well, guess what? The Napoleons of the world didn't really care whether you noticed them or not. They probably knew who you were and were aware that you put yourself above them, but they still dressed how they liked, said what they thought and lived how they wanted.I, for one, am happy to finally see a movie about Napoleon and Deb and Pedro instead of the same cookie cutter garbage that continues to flow forth like the milk from a cow that got into the onion patch.Rock on Napoleon! We've got your back.",Napoleon Dynamite
1052,dravenfrost,What a waste,1,8 February 2005,"If you are above the age of 25 avoid this movie at all costs. This is a an insult to even be considered a motion picture and truly shows the quality of entertainment that todays generation is willing to accept as long as it has the MTV name connected to it. The only reason people find any of these characters entertaining is because they pull the same type of ""stunts""(throwing an action figure out the window, etc) and make the same pointless unfunny comments themselves and think they are funniest thing out there. The actors are so horrible I truly believe the director had everyone act as if mentally retarded and say there lines in the same monotone voice in an attempt to cover lack of talent. One can only hope once the fifteen minutes of fame is up, we never see any of the ""star"" again. Don't waste your time paying to see this, wait until it's on Showtime or something.",Napoleon Dynamite

I barely went through it, nearly fell asleep twice and what is the worst - I have no bloody idea why did this movie gest such high votes ?!It's so poor.. and the script ? no words for it.. I got the feeling that the director wanted to laugh at disabled people because, apart from the ending - you can barely find a moment the main character would not have done anything stupid like I even do not know what ..My advice - save your time - movie is worthless, we've seen tons of such movies which bring nothing to the cinematography.I'd give it 2/8 3/8 AT MOST and i'd think twice before I'd gave 3/8",Napoleon Dynamite
1054,GhettoNinja,Funniest Freakin' Movie Ever Gosh!,10,6 October 2004,"Wow if u really want to see a really funny movie with complex characters u should definitely check this out. The plot for this movie is really just a backdrop to see Napolean(perfectly played by John Heder) in action. There has never been a better nerdy character. We are taken into his world and its just so funny and real. The supporting characters also shine brilliantly. Pedro, Kip, and Rico are extremely likable characters and also very well played. Also this movie is PG which i think means a lot. Its rare that u find a really good movie with any thing lower than a PG rating these days. It just seems a lot harder these days to find a good movie that doesn't use sex violence and profane language still find a way to be mature and not be catagorized as kiddie movie. Its just such a welcome change of pace from the movies i normally watch where at least 20 people get killed and every other word is a four letter word. Its a very relaxing and entertaining movie that i think everyone should see and enjoy. i give it a 10 out of 10 because its extremely funny and even a bit heart warming.

1055,krishnan2784,Utter rubbish,1,11 March 2005,"In my 20 years on this paltry earth I have never seen such rubbish. The plot is terrible, the characters weak and the actors would be better described as Alabama hillbilly redneck trailer trash. To those readers from Alabama my sincerest apologies if you are from Alabama, because that is the only state in the South that I could think of. I have realised that there is a serious lack of good comedy writers in the US. Since the fall of the great but rather boring teen comedy movies such American Pie series and Road Trip and others, the comedy writing has been targeted toward the white middle America. People whose level of ignorance is match by the amount they eat. Also you Yanks are big fans of seeing the geeky, socially retarded half wits such as the character Napoleon, in this movie succeeding. Why? The movie's mentality is trying to reflect the nation, USA, as a geeky weakling. Because white America thinks, after 9/11, that it is weak. But yet your sitcoms are pretty much untouchable, even the darker comedies such as ""Desperate Housewives"", which in its own right is amazing. Do I have to mention ""Friends"", ""Will and Grace"" and ""Cheers"". they are all funny and the writing is good or excellent. Why can't American writers produce stuff like that on the big screen? To all those producers and directors and movie moguls, in Hollywood, if you want a funny movie come to me cause i will blow your brains out with the stuff i can write. give the foreigners and non whites something to laugh at, do something based on a bunch of Latino gangs in LA. comedy is, and can be, controversial and politically incorrect and that is why its funny. Not some white boy with really bad hair, specs and looks trying to be cool. MAKE ME LAUGH. NOT THE CLOWNS IN MIDDLE WHITE America.BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO TASTE. Finally if you really want to watch something funny go and watch ""Be Cool"" because at least the actors can act, not 2 bit ham actors like in this movie. Krish2784",Napoleon Dynamite

1057,ihavecomputer,Might have been cool if released in 1991.,2,30 August 2004,"From the opening credits to each character's unremarkable, forced eccentricities, it is clear that Napoleon Dynamite is nothing more than a trite attempt at emulating Wes Anderson's signature style (but it tries so hard!). Needless to say, writer/director Jared Hess does not accomplish his frivolous task - matching neither Anderson's bright, complex aesthetic nor his knack for coaxing tight, nuanced performances from his actors. The film is a self-purported tapestry yet its threads never seem aware of one another - they're all lacking confidence, stabbing half-heartedly and blindly, mostly damaging each other (and the audience) rather than whittling out an impressive whole. The lack of consistency is the result of extreme sloppiness, not artistic license. To take a miniscule step on the positive side, Jon Heder (Napoleon) appears to make good with what he's given (given that he's given a one-dimensional script it couldn't have been that hard). Because of Heder's delivery there are a few hearty laughs hidden in all the muck but by the end you may feel so diseased that it's not really worth it. Napoleon Dynamite comes off as a set of twelve-or-so self-conscious faux flourishes that'd be better off as Saturday Night Live filler.",Napoleon Dynamite
1058,chigirl68,I want my money back.. even though it was free,1,24 July 2005,"I heard about how funny this movie was, original, brilliant, etc and all I could say it was the most boring movie I have ever seen. I couldn't believe I was only 15 minutes into this thing when it felt like 45. The ""jokes"" aren't quotable, the characters are annoying, cant convey any emotion, and if I wanted to watch vegetables, I would stand in front of my microwave. Every character mumbled, showed no expression, and there was not one likable person in the entire movie. I couldn't stand the lead character, a High School Student acted like he's a bratty 7 year old. Was he supposed to be mentally challenged as well? I know others on here wrote that they knew people like this, which is scary, I think this is the same pool of actors they get Jerry Springer guests from, and who in their right mind would want to know these people? I understand that they were living a boring life, but why should I be bored watching it.When I saw the one character buy a time machine off the internet, I was thinking they should have gone back and started this movie from the beginning, with different actors, a different script, (I am assuming there was one? I didn't see it) and dumped this whole movie altogether.Others have said this was like Monty Python and South Park. Monty Python and South Park are great, the humor is on many levels, so intelligent people can get it, as well as those whose humor is that of Napoleon Dynamite. While watching those shows people are laughing for different reasons.

Laughter is infectious (hence the introduction of the laugh track) and therefore a truly funny movie should evoke laughter even without prompts from around you. I saw Napoleon Dynamite at an early afternoon matinée and of the eight or so people who were there, we were all busting up about every few minutes. This film is a statement on everything insane about popularity, about self-esteem, about the culture we live in...

The seemingly trivial experiences pictured total more that the sum of its parts. I think this movie is definitely being added to my permanent collection. I recommend if you are a fan of independent movies and open to new, though subtle, approaches to film making that you consider watching Napoleon Dynamite.

Generally movies have at least one redeeming feature, Decent sets, Charming characters, Moving Plot, Moments of beauty etc Unfortunately It lacked all of the above, the props being too cheap to be quaint and the sets too back water to be lovable. The characters were poorly fleshed out and they're acting more irritating then endearing as the Synopsis would have you believe.

It's so dry my skin started flaking after it was over.It definitely isn't going to hit you like a ""Fast Times"" and it may even take a couple of viewings to truly appreciate how dead-on it is portraying the fact that there is something fascinating and ultimately redeemable about being not being all that talented, good-looking, popular or interesting.

This is a great movie for anyone who appreciates dry humor, subtle humor, and satire. Most of the people who diss this move are either A. Unitelligent, or B. Failed to recognize that that is truly how small town rural life is.The story follows Napoleon(played by Jon Heder) as he goes through life one day at a time. His first day of school is terrible. He is in the happy hands club and gets beat up. He stumbles on his current events presentation(last week Japanese Scientists explaced...Placed explosives on the bottom of lake loch ness to blow nessie out of the water). He is asked by Don what he did last summer( I told You already I spent last summer with my uncle in Alaska Hunting Wolverines). And calls home because he doesn't feel good( Can you bring me my Chapstick, My lips hurt real bad). But he does end up befriending the new kid Pedro(Efren Ramirez) who has a sweet bike and a mustache. When Napoleon gets home he is asked by his Grandma to feed the llama( Tina you fat lard come get some Ham) and asked by his brother to hit him( Let me get that *SMACK*). Pedro decides to ask Summer to the dance but she says no. So he ends up asking deb. Napoleons Grandma gets in an ATV accident and Uncle Rico is asked to stay with Napoleon and Kip while Grandma is at the hospital. Uncle Rico is a sleazeball who is stuck in 1982 and has a get rich quick scheme involving Nylon Polymer and Breast enhancers. Uncle Rico ends up ruining Napoleons life(And eating all their steak). Then Pedro realizes that he should run for School president( Heck Yes!) against Summer. Kip Ends up finding his soul mate in Lafawndah and Napoleon learns to dance really well from picking up a tape at DI. He also ends up doing odd jobs to get money like cooping chickens(Do the Chickens have large talons). Pedro gives his speech and Summer gives hers. They both have to do skits(Summers set to backstreet boys music even though its O4). No one told Pedro about the skit, so Napoleon Dances for the skit. Pedro ends up winning and the movie ends with ND playing tetherball with Deb(I caught you a delicious bass). The movie has a good message and is very funny and refreshing to see a teen Comedy that doesn't rely on Fart and Sex Jokes.My Final Review 9/10In the immortal words of Kip Peace out.PS. if You stick around after the credits you see a scene two months later that was cut out of the final Cut",Napoleon Dynamite

Then the characters started coming into focus and each one is as kookie as can be and takes the film on a wild ride through Nerdsville. As the camera focused on each scene I found the set design and placement of objects so clever. Scale was interesting. Placement of the kitchen phone was funny.

1073,b_man-1,Unbelievable crap,1,4 January 2005,"*SPOILERS*.. here and there... This is a surely THE worst, most obnoxious, retarded piece of junk i ever seen, and i'm not that picky. I gladly swallow 3/10 flicks, as long as there's something to lay eyes on. But this one made even me to react with some non-pleasant spasms somewhere near my stomach. No story.. well little, but not nearly enough to keep me occupied for 82 minutes. No brain activity is required, even strictly prohibited to get at least near to enjoying this *************** (no words, just emotions). All characters behave in more or less retarded way, the school looks like a prisoner camp and that little ball-on-a-wire-thingy made me fall of my sofa. The Only positive thing i have to say about this movie is the acting. Must have been hard to achieve such level of brainlessness... Anyhow, what's one mans opinion. If you have 82 minutes of your life available, see for yourself. Otherwise go see... well anything... 1/10 (zero is not available... )",Napoleon Dynamite
1074,ericeisenmenger,First Movie I Ever Walked Out On,1,14 January 2005,"This so called movie was the second worst thing I have ever seen. The only movie that sucked more then this was the Blair Witch Project. If the lack of a story line, the horrible horrible improved script or the lousy acting did not make every person walk out on this I don't know what would. I stayed for about 30 min of the movie and just could not take it anymore. I have no idea what made a studio even pick up this garbage let alone think it would do well in theaters. The only think I found remotely funny about this debacle was the pathetic ""fighting"" scenes which were little more then a literal sissy slap fest. I am sure to avoid anything done by anyone who acted, wrote, or directed this movie.",Napoleon Dynamite
1075,Mithrandr,A different kind of movie...,9,1 October 2005,"The first 10 - 20 minutes of this movie, I wasn't sure what to make of it. After watching the entire movie though, I decided I really liked it. It's kind of slow to start, but the movie builds and tells a great story. It isn't your standard Hollywood type blockbuster, so if you're unable to look past that, you're probably not going to like it. Also, I read some comments about having to have been a part of the 80s to get the movie, and I believe that may be true.As part of the DVD also, there are some special features, including deleted scenes that are worth watching. They enhance a few parts of the story that I would have actually liked to see incorporated into the movie. This is definitely going to be one of those movies you either really like, or really dislike, so take the chance, and give it a shot!",Napoleon Dynamite
1076,tankgirl-6,social misfit/loner who would actually make the best friend in the world!,10,31 May 2007,"Many people feel disappointed when they watch this film because its fans are so enthusiastic. They perhaps expect a comedy like American Pie or Scary Movie. Well, this is way more subtle than that. It is a unique character-driven film where the oddball characters take precedence over the plot. There is a plot, despite what some might say. It centres around a misfit called Napoleon and his efforts to help his friend Pedro become school president. Either you will love this film, or hate it. Either you will 'get' the humour, or you won't. If you watch this film and don't like it then wipe it from your memory and get on with your life. If you love it, like me, you'll find yourself a happier person for having seen it.",Napoleon Dynamite
1077,daraskas,Raising Napoleon..,7,27 December 2004,"I watched a DVD of 'Napoleon' yesterday with my high school / college age daughters, they had seen it several times and said, ""Dad, it's about teenage life, and you may not like it"".But I did.The character development reminded me a little of one of my favorite films ""Raising Arizona"". Taking our human foibles beyond the limits, 'Napoleon' was a brilliant piece worthy of the Cohen brothers' landmark cinemas.The audience who enjoyed it took away a wider understanding of life's cruelty as a parody. Those who hated it have other problems to deal with.",Napoleon Dynamite
1078,barrettsallee,I want back the hour and a half that this movie stole from my life.,1,22 March 2005,"This was the worst piece of garbage that I have ever seen. I heard so much hype about this movie and have never been so let down in all my life. What are you people thinking? This movie had no plot, no comedy, no drama and no story whatsoever. It is NOT a satire of life in America. It is NOT a satire on high school. It is not ANYTHING! It is only a waste of time. It is different from other movies, that is true. But, just because it is different, does not make it good. In fact, in this case, it makes it much more worse than other movies. Don't believe the hype, this was a waste of an hour and a half of my life and it will be for you too if you watch it. But, I really don't wish this type of torture on anyone.",Napoleon Dynamite
1079,JohnJPorcaro,Napoleon Dynamite is a breath of fresh air,10,10 October 2004,"I am sick of Hollywood comedies. I just got done being forced by my wife to watch a bootleg of Hillary Duff's ""A Cinderella Story."" It was a totally unbelievable load of crap. It seems every movie, from the tween Duff flicks to, well, just about every movie targeted for the 12-80 year old demographic, is totally unbelievable crap. Mean Girls, crap, Van Wilder, crap, What a Girl Wants, crap, American Pie I, II, & III, crap, All Hollywood comedies, crap. We have the ""teen movie,"" full of sexual perversion and the message that youths should always question authority because they will always be right in the end. Then there is the ""older teen movie"" which is basically only sex jokes and the message that you will eventually end up with the most unbelievably hot person. There is the ""tween movie"" which teaches us that no matter how bad things get, you will still end up rich. And then we have Napoleon Dynamite. The meek will inherit the earth. That's the movie's message. What Napoleon Dynamite, both the movie and the Dynamite character himself, does is teach us that...well, what does it teach us? Rather than teach us a lesson, it reveals the real world to us. It is hilarious, and not in an outrageous ""former-snl-member-movie"" way, or an overly sexual ""do-you-kiss-your-mother-with-that-mouth"" way, or in a brain dead ""farley-brotheresque-humor"" way. This movie makes us laugh at the real world. Who, after watching the movie, says ""I don't know anyone like that""? Everyone knows a Napoleon Dynamite. Everyone has been to the high school dance that they were just a little out of place at. That scene after Napoleon says ""are you guys having a killer time?,"" where Pedro, Napoleon, and Deb are standing in silence watching everyone else dance is an excellent show of cinematography: it captures the essence of high school, that no matter how 'popular' you are, you are still a Pedro or a Deb or a Napoleon, on the outside looking in. We all wish we had a time machine. We've all had a bad haircut. But in the end, we all still have to live.And the Napoleon Dynamite world is the real world, not the Hollywood world. The world does not consist of good looking white people along with slapstick fat people and token minorities, like Hollywood shoves down our throats. I don't want to give away the movie for people who haven't seen it, so I won't talk about that, but the way people get along in this movie is much more realistic. And speaking of realism, you know how at the end of most Hollywood movies you end up feeling a tinge of unhappiness, that ""I wish that would happen to me"" feeling? The gorgeous people, the money, the bliss that the main characters felt? That's not the ending of Napoleon Dynamite. You leave the theater with nothing but a smile and a content heart. You know that you don't need money, hot people, and lots things and property to be happy, you don't need to prove anything to anyone to be happy. That, no matter how mediocre things might be in your life, you are still happy. And so is Napoleon.",Napoleon Dynamite
1080,daveandamymc,Best Movie I've seen since Raising Arizona,10,24 December 2004,"I fell in love with the characters and their foils. It was a melting pot of similars--such as Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Raising Arizona and Better Off Dead. Although it reminded me of these movies, it was indeed unique. I laughed hysterically but felt connected to the characters. I grew up in the 80's and 90's and felt like I was being transported back in time. The costuming was excellent, down to the little white square earrings Deb was wearing with her ponytail sticking out of the side of her head. The DVD has a lot of great extras and you gain more insight into the mind behind the movie when you listen to the commentary. 5 GOSHES for this movie!",Napoleon Dynamite
1081,avbaker,Not funny.,1,5 January 2005,"Everyone had been saying this was the best film for years, and that it was side splittingly funny, so I turned up to Napoleon dynamite expecting a complete laugh. Instead all I got was some obnoxious guy I instantly hated milling around his pitiful existence for a couple of hours. There were about two bits in the whole film I chuckled at, Hardly ""The funniest film for years"". Just to comment on what some people are saying: I'm 20, so there isn't the whole ""Age difference"" thing going on, and yes it is realistic. I don't want realism though, I get enough of that without having to pay a fiver for the pleasure. So to summarise, the only thing that could have lifted ND out of the dank pit of mediocrity would be to have some semblance of a plot, and/or interesting and likable characters. Seeing as the only characters that were remotely likable were deb and pedro, Dynamite remains a bitter disappointment.",Napoleon Dynamite

1083,FunWithJess,Either you love it or you don't get it.,10,22 February 2005,"This is easily the most quotable movie that I have ever seen. I have seen this movie so many times now and I think it gets funnier each time I see it. I can understand why some people don't like it, but I can't understand why they have to BASH it so much. I guess it makes them feel better. It's like all of those giving poor reviews are saying ""Darn you Jared Hess for making a movie that not everyone in the world loves!"" Be serious.There's one thing that I don't think I've seen anyone comment on before which shocks me. The little details that those who don't like this movie must be missing. The facial expressions, body language, and comedic timing of all of the lines that were delivered in this movie were amazing! I thought all of the actors did an incredible job on all of those things! Except for Don (the main cheerleader's boyfriend) whose reactions were always pretty lame and fake. Also I wasn't really big on Rex - even though I think Deidrich is a funny guy I didn't think he belonged in this movie.I tried to think about some of the reasons why others would not like this movie and came up with some ideas. I have shown this movie to several different groups of friends and we all laughed together. This movie is so easy to quote and re-enact scenes from with your friends. This movie is not going to be nearly as funny if you watch it by yourself, so if you have not friends, you will probably not like this movie. I am about the same age as the director, so maybe that's another reason I like it so much. All of the youth that I work with seem to love it too. Someone previously mentioned that people over 30 would probably not like this movie. Though I know several that do, I would have to agree with this comment in general. (The older people I know who liked the movie are young at heart.) If you are too old you will probably not like this movie. Many people say this movie has no plot or no conflict or no whatever. Though I could argue slightly against those ideas, I rather just say boo hoo, cry cry. I'm sorry the director forgot to read that chapter in ""how to make cookie-cutter movies that please everyone."" I thought it was great. If you can't handle movies that are different from the norm, you will probably not like this movie.Many people seem to be making comments about other 'similar' movies being much better, such as Rushmore or some others. Good grief, I'm about sick of hearing that. Apparently people are only allowed to like 1 movie from any given genre? (Although I like ND better than every single other movie mentioned as being 'better'). And what about this - say I have two friends, Johnny and Tommy. They're both funny guys. Johnny is widely accepted as being wittier with his humor, he's funnier on more levels. So I guess I'm supposed to go to Tommy and say, ""Tommy, you're too one-dimensional, and Johnny is funnier. Therefore you SUCK and I HATE YOU. I can no longer be your friend."" Get real. Even if I did like Rushmore or whatever more than I like ND (which I don't) that wouldn't mean that I couldn't also like ND.So anyway, for those of you who like this movie, you will probably REALLY like it. If you don't like it, you will probably REALLY not like it. But that's OK because not EVERYBODY has to like it. If you don't get it or you're too old or you have no friends or you can't handle the 'plot' then I guess you won't like it. But it's still a great movie, apparently just not for you; which is too bad because to someone like me you are really missing out.",Napoleon Dynamite
1084,gemboy186,2 hours of my life wasted,1,19 October 2004,"I just can't believe that I survived watching that movie till the end.I guess there are people being paid to choose good movies for our viewing. But I'm certain that someone had to be paid behind the scenes so as to pick this movie. I watched it after i saw a 7.3 vote on this site. i think that someone is playing with those vote. I can never believe that someone can give that film a vote of more than 2 (and that's being generous)It doesn't make sense at all. the editor couldn't decide on which side he was. The script, acting and story were hopeless. Conclusion: a total waste of time. take my advice, spend two hours looking at the wall but not at this movie.",Napoleon Dynamite

It is one of my top ten most funniest films that I have ever seen. But yet you can still connect with all of the characters trying to fit in and trying to figure out what they want out of life. I love all of the characters like Napoleon, Deb, Pedro, Uncle Rico, Kip, and Tina. The events that happen in the film were actual things that happened to the director Jared Hess while he was growing up in Preston, Idaho. Thank you so much for bringing back these characters in the Fox animated series. This world really needs Napoleon Dynamite.

I laughed so hard I cried, and I will see it again. This isn't a film for everyone. If you are into big mind-numbing action, don't see this. Also, if your looking for ""hollywood humor"" you won't get it. This is definitely for the movie connoisseur. It did however remind of the kid in high school that everyone bugged, but was probably the coolest one there. I t also made me realize that all those people who made fun of people like Napoleon were totally shallow. It also was a perfect portrayal of the painful teenage years.A must see. Especially the ending. You'll die laughing (I know I did).",Napoleon Dynamite
1087,punkrock1727,Didn't come across well on screen,1,27 December 2004,"I understand what the writer and director were going for. A comedic dry humor story with no point really and random happenings throughout the film. However, I'm going to have to give this flick a thumbs down. I have a very dry sense of humor, and was expecting the dry humor to work in the film. Sadly, I don't think it did. There was meaning behind the random happenings, which makes them not so random at all. Everything is up for interpretation, and everyone is entitled to their opinion. Napolean Dynamite tried it's hardest to pull everything together and work. I must say the set and the whole feel of the film worked well, but the story line was horrible. The only scene that remotely intrigued me is when Napolean dances, beyond that I didn't like it. See the movie and make your own opinion.",Napoleon Dynamite

From Pedro to Tina the lama this is pound for pound the funniest movie that I've ever seen. This comment must be ten lines long so I am going to describe my favorite scene. It occurs when Kip and Napoleon go to a dojo to check out a new type of fighting style called Rex Kwon Do. Rex, the leader of this fighting style, asks for a volunteer and Kip raises his hand. Rex picks him. Then Rex says, ""All right, I'm going to give you just one shot, give me all you've got."" Instead of punching him or swiftly kicking him, Kip first poses with his head cocked down and then goes for a slow motion roundhouse sweep kick. Not that funny here, but you will appreciate it when you see it.",Napoleon Dynamite

1090,john-doty,You either get it or you don't,7,17 September 2005,Why do you have to love this movie or hate it? Why is there nothing in between? Napoleon is such a cool nerd. His family could not be more dysfunctional. The action could not be any more wanting. The goal of being president is such a bold statement it is actually plausible. When they come up with the idea to protect all of the other nerds by using Pedro's cousins you have to fall in love with this movie. So the answer is: if you did not like this movie then your sense of humor is not as sophisticated as it needs to be. If you cannot enjoy the the e-mail chat coming to fruition with LaFonda then you are such a loser.....How about the piñata of the presidential competition (Summer)? Why would you possibly ever do a skit after your presidential speech? He even gets the girl! You gotta love it. Bling? This movie has it all.,Napoleon Dynamite

Although each seems to be exaggerated, they are truly relatable to someone you know. While the actors maintain that their portrayals of the characters were not made to be funny, the movie is simultaneously true to life and outrageous. This is what brings the humor to the film. Napoleon is not the only character in the film; I believe that it is the other actors and actresses that really bring the film's humor to the point of being hilarious. Well recommended for any who wishes to catch a glimpse of Preston, Idaho's strange but lovable residents.",Napoleon Dynamite

The theater that I saw it in wasn't the best around, but it was the first theater to be showing it in this area because they weren't sure how well it would do. I was very uncomfortable in my seat and that made me enjoy the movie much less than I would have. The next time I saw it was 2 weeks later when it had gained popularity and it was in the nice theaters. I laughed from beginning to end and actually lost my voice from it. I was laughing so hard I was CRYING!! I've seen it 4 times since then and I love it every time. I can't get enough of it.

It was, quite frankly, depressing. It had some funny moments (such as when Nap slaps Kip and runs to get the door), but overall, I would definitely say, if you're suicidal DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. I'm not even suicidal and this movie made me want to kill myself. This movie is just horrible. There's not even words to describe how horrible this movie is. I'm telling you, go watch Pollyanna instead. Next time they want to make a movie with no plot and a loser character I'd suggest they lay off the medication.",Napoleon Dynamite

A little slow and the humor is quite dry, some people just don't 'get it'.Very well done, and had me laughing out loud a few times (a rare thing with movies) but its a pity how its just so slow. I guess thats the point kinda like Napoleon himself, slow and a little hard to 'understand'.If you go to high school or uni then you will kinda see how the director has captured this interesting yet boring at the same time character, its done very well.Like others said there is no real story line as such, just about him and his mate hanging out.",Napoleon Dynamite
1096,rodowobo,Oaky; but not up to the hype,4,21 January 2005,"Here is My General Theory of Independent/Underground/Underdog Films: Because most of them are not very good, when one IS marginal, word of mouth blows it up into blockbuster proportions. It worked with the Blair Witch Project; and it works here with Napoleon Dynamite. I have read that if I am a child of the '80s, and/or living in the west, and/or familiar with small town life, that I would be splitting my sides with laughter. Well I am; and yet I wasn't. It is filled with so many oddball characters that I found it difficult to really relate to or care about any of them. This movie has funny moments/lines/scenes, but it doesn't hold together as a whole; it seems more like a collection of snippets than a whole concept. Additionally, scenes that are supposedly laugh-out funny ARE at first. The famous dance scene IS funny; but overlong, as is the whole movie. Subplots abound, and their resolutions seem forced (Kip gets a girl), far fetched (Pedro becoming Class President), underdeveloped (Uncle Rico's girlfriend returns), or unsatisfying due to a lack of ""closure"" (Deb ends up with Napoleon). A rental, but don't expect much.",Napoleon Dynamite

However, I left the movie with a headache and sore abs from laughing so hard. People who don't get the brilliant and obscure humor created through great (yet simple) scripting and strong character roles, will fall in that class of movie-goers that ""just don't get it""! Poor souls! This move was appealing because it offered us what we all can relate to in ourself, family, friends and even those strangers we come in contact with throughout our lives. I saw this movie on a Sunday night and then again three days later.

The movie has a ton of fun quotables and just about everyone in the movie was laughing the entire time. I think that sometimes it's just fun to laugh at others whom you know that you're not hurting by doing so, and believe me, the fashion sense of the characters alone will give you more than enough to laugh at. Basically, the movie is utterly ridiculous and you find yourself asking how any people could actually be like that, but that's the fun part.

I laughed at times and mostly just stared not believing what I was really seeing on TV. I'm not sure but their must be things I didn't get that maybe other people did. It looked like it was a fun movie to make, i would love to make a movie like this. It was made low budget i am sure, but that made it better then all these high effect movies. And their wasn't even kissing in this movie, which keeps you more into watching the movie rather than a sex scene....yea something like that. I am kind of a dork so i found it funny in those ways.

This movie is painfully bad and boring!. The characters are one dimensional, and with such exaggerated geekiness it can only come from having an IQ of about 50. It pretty much is about a bunch of mentally handicapped people who can barely get through the day.In fact no one in this movie has any intelligence. It reminded me of one of those soft porn naked cheerleader movies from the 80's. The only thing missing was the naked cheerleaders. In fact,now that I think of it it was about as good as a porn movie, but would have been better with some nudity.In fact, the only redeeming quality is I watched this movie with a bunch of friends and it did provide fodder for comic sarcasm.

""Well you see this guy named Napoleon Dynamite says funny stuff like 'sweet' and 'lucky', but really whiny, ya know... No, he's not annoying he's funny, like when he busts out dancing it's so funny, I was laughing so hard, I....what? No he doesn't want to be a professional dancer he's just helping Pedro...no, Pedro doesn't want to be a dancer. He does shave is head though, ohhh, good times."" And so went every failed attempt to describe the greatness that is Napoleon Dynamite. Only people who had already seen it could understand how a movie in which so little actually happens, could be filled with so many unforgettable moments.

The superb to the awful. Americans for me are the leaders when it comes to comedy, and this movie proves it. This is by far the funniest film I have seen for a long time (along with Anchorman). Napoleon is the hero we have all been waiting for, the loser who somehow comes out on top. A somewhat diluted version of ""The American Dream"". See this movie now......its a must for any comedy fan.

You want to know what is going on in his head just to find out what makes him tick. You feel sorry for him and respect his tenacity all the while you're laughing out loud.I can't wait to see the extra footage on the DVD!Get the DVD on 12/21/04 and from the inspired words of ND...""Just follow your heart.

1105,wundafo,Random and hilarious: Napoleon Dynamite,10,18 December 2004,"Having seen this movies twice in the theatre (it is rare that I see a movie even once in the cinema), I am an enormous fan. I applaud this movie for being a G-rated movie (and sticking to it, not treading the PG line) and yet being able to pull off humour that can be appreciated by almost everyone. Although its plot can be filed under ""Random,"" Napoleon Dynamite is easy to follow. There was not a minute in the movie where I was not laughing (and belly-laughing at that)--there may have been moments, but within a few seconds, I was roaring again. Jon Heder is absolutely brilliant as the title character; it is impossible to distinguish where the actor ends and Napoleon begins. There are many ""quotable"" moments and lines in this movie that are truly original and not at all cliché. I recommend this movie to everyone I meet and am tensely anticipating its DVD release with glee.",Napoleon Dynamite

I can not for the life of me see what so many saw in this movie. Firstly, it just is not funny. I am a child of the 80's and grew up in a rural area, but still this isn't comedy. The acting was good for what is was supposed to be, but the script was awful. The characters had all the depth of mud puddle. I cannot figure out why this movie was made, why anyone financed it, and why I spent valuable hours of my life watching it. If you haven't seen it and you are reading reviews to decide, DON'T SEE IT.

The 'nerds' were hilarious, not to mention excellently acted, the shirts that Napoleon wore were remarkably familiar to my school's. I couldn't stop laughing. I don't even know where they could find shirts like that but they did it. And the pants! Everyone I've talked to who has seen it thinks it was really great. The characters had so many dimensions unlike most Hollywood movies. Everyone was so...REAL. It portrayed the real teenage society for once. People can actually relate, or at least I definitely could. Even the popular girls acted real, they weren't overdone. This movie truly amazed me on so many levels. It was a good movie inside and out.",Napoleon Dynamite

I've spent the last hour reading reviews and for those of you who think it was "" a waste of money "" or ""bad. bad. bad"" I don't fault you for not liking this movie. I pity the fact that you don't have the depth to enjoy it like many of us. The brilliance of this movie is it's simplicity, and that it is SO INCREDIBLY accurate in its description of small town America and the class weirdos. You start out laughing at the guy, and you end up loving him. One reviewer commented that the characters have the depth of a mud puddle. EXACTLY!. Do you think Napoleon cares about the war in Iraq, terrorism, the Laci Peterson verdict, etc etc???? Hell no! In fact, his current event was what he read on the cover of STAR magazine. His biggest concern when his grandmother broke her ""cock-six"" was why grandmother was at the sand dunes. There is a part of Napoleon that everybody wants and that's complete carefree stability.

I found myself leaving the theater after the film and immediately calling old friends and telling them they had to go see this film because of the connection to our childhood. The filming location of Preston, ID was a great choice for this movie with its small town feel, but beautiful landscapes. The writing and improvisation is hilarious providing numerous lines you and your friends will be quoting for months. The DVD features absolutely riotous cut scenes; one of my favorite scenes of the entire movie was the kickball cut scene. The DVD's commentary feature is also very intuitive, and answers a few minor questions you may have after watching the film. You will laugh out loud and it only gets better each time you watch.

1114,vmvandev,Fabulous!,10,23 December 2004,"Napoleon Dynamite is the hottest thing since Wes Anderson. This film struck gold with its portrayal of heartland America; anyone who has ever had a taste of the Midwest or its surrounding area and been disenchanted by it should see this. It shines light on and adds flavor to all that is ordinary about middle America and will leave you amazed that it is able to accomplish all this without using a single expletive or PG-13 rated scene. I thought the character portrayal was hilarious and the disgusting cafeteria food throughout a perfect addition, tater tots and all. The first comparison that comes to mind is Waiting for Guffman (for subject matter and location), the second Bottle Rocket, Rushmore, and Office Space. It also compares to Happiness or Welcome to the Dollhouse, sans all the deep dark stuff. If you didn't like any of these, you might not like Napoleon--if you liked ANY of these, don't miss it.",Napoleon Dynamite

I ask anyone to find me a movie that incorporates the A-Team theme song and when in Rome's ""The Promise"" into 1 movie.

It is very hilarious... but it doesn't really have a plot. It just shows Napoleon's day-to-day life as it happens, and the way he acts. I'd recommend this movie to anyone with a sense of humor, and anyone that enjoys some laughs. I watched it 3 times during a time span of a few hours; it doesn't get old!! For those of you who love to really get into a movie & it's plot, this isn't the movie for you. In every town, there's a guy like Napoleon, so this movie is easy to relate to. I'll admit, there are a few boring parts where it's like ""okay so what's the point of this?"" but the way ND acts is just priceless.",Napoleon Dynamite
1117,mountndewgurl12,"Disliked by some, Liked by some",7,24 December 2004,"When I first heard about Napoleon Dynamite, it was when I overheard two girls and a guy talking about it at the mall. One girl said ""that is the stupidest piece of crap i've ever seen"" and the guy said ""Oh my gosh, no it isn't!ITS HILARIOUS!"" and so on. A month later, I was at Blockbuster trying to find a movie to rent since I was having some friends over for dinner. I saw NP and thought ""what the heck, i'll give it a try."" When I watched it with my friends, some of them laughed the whole time while others just rolled their eyes at the dry humor. I personally couldn't really decide if i liked it or not. I found Uncle Rico very annoying, and I thought that Kip and LaFwanda's relationship moved way too fast and was unrealistic, and Napoleon was just plain weird (especially his boots). But on the other hand, I was deeply touched by Pedro. For some reason he just got to me. I think it was because he was always so innocent. He wasn't mean to anyone, and he tried his hardest. I was nearly in tears when Pedro gave his election speech and no one applauded. But while there were many emotional parts, there were also parts that I didn't like. One thing I thought was very dumb was when Kip and Napoleon go to Rex's. It had nothing to do with the movie and was very random. But when I think about it, the whole movie is very random. There are several parts that made me think ""What does that have to do with anything?"" The entire 80-something minutes of ND is not really a plot, just Napoleon living his life and putting up with whatever happens. I couldn't tell you whether or not you will like this movie. Its not like most movies; it doesn't make much sense and it kind of leaves you hanging in the end. While watching it, don't look for a point. Keep an open mind. Some parts may make you laugh, while others may make you groan with annoyance. I personally watched it several times just because it does that to you: it really catches your attention and makes you wonder what Napoleon is going to do next. There are a lot of things I missed watching it the first time that I didn't notice until about the third time through. The average person will chuckle occasionally and probably enjoy most of the movie. You may love it, you may hate it. It all depends on your sense of humor and personality. I have seen many reviews for this movie: some saying how awful it is and not funny, others saying how hilarious it is. As for me, I'm just saying that you should give it a try. Its not overwhelmingly hilarious, but I wouldn't call it stupid. It's simply the story of a young geeky guy who, in a way, relates to all of us.",Napoleon Dynamite
1118,wilfred-hebden,Funniest film of the century - so far,10,28 January 2005,"In an age when movies like ""American Wedding"" and ""Along Came Polly"" pass for comedy, it is extraordinarily refreshing to see a movie like ""Napoleon Dynamite"" that stands alone as a great movie without having to rely on shocking excretory humor.OK, the first time Stifler drank a glass of semen or Jeff Daniels (Dumber) had explosive feces in the ski lodge, it was shockingly funny. When Ben Stiller laid the tracks in ""There's Something About Mary"" it was shockingly funny. But now it's 2005 and these poop and pee jokes have been done to death, to the point where nothing is shocking and no bodily fluid remains unexploited (except perhaps eye goo). Does anyone find it funny these days when yet another hapless fool accidentally ingests urine or has an emergency that destroys his girlfriend's bathroom? I'm not offended by it, just bored.Then out of nowhere comes ""Napoleon Dynamite,"" a movie that doesn't contain a single excretory moment, does not even contain a single word that could offend a nun, and yet stands alone as a non-stop laugh fest.Most of the credit belongs to Jon Heder, whose performance deserves an Oscar nomination. It has been said that the key to enjoying this movie is that you have to have known a freak like Napoleon, and indeed growing up in the 80s and 90s I knew quite a few  Heder's performance is dead on.The movie delves into the private life of the ultimate outcast. Some call him a nerd, but that is somewhat inaccurate. He is one of those kids that doesn't even attempt to fit in, is consumed by his own world of Ninjas and Ligers, and seems perpetually angry and annoyed. There was one dude in my school named Josh who always used to brag about how he owned an AK47 and his father was going to buy him a refurbished F15 for his birthday. Other days he would claim his watch had a special virtual reality game built in or that his mother was an international spy. This is the type of guy Napoleon is. A nerd would turn and run away from Napoleon.It is fascinating to watch all these weird characters interact and achieve their goals. Their methods seem doomed to fail but end up succeeding in the end. Napoleon's effeminate older brother finally marries his chat room lady friend, LaFawnda. Napoleon and Pedro sweep the election thanks to Napoleon's secret weapon. But more than anything, it is Heder's exasperated performance that shines throughout the film. Every single word uttered by Napoleon is hilarious without ever having any distinct setups or punch lines. His constant anger and heir of superiority make him one of the most unique and interesting characters in recent memory, from any genre.Probably the best film of 2004 and most definitely the best comedy so far this century.",Napoleon Dynamite
1119,gcarey-1,Possibly not the worst movie ever,1,19 January 2005,"After seeing this movie, my girlfriend and I decided that it wasn't the worst movie we'd ever seen. But as for just what was worse, neither of us could think of anything.Basically, the actors can't act, they speak in monotones. Nothing happens. Cause and effect relationships do not always exist. And apparently there's some misunderstanding as to the definition of a ""skit.""As for plot, quite simply, there isn't one. The ""story"" focuses around one loser, his friend (who might actually not be a loser, if only he didn't hang out with one). It follows through one or two escapades in stupidity perpetrated by loser #1's family. Suffice it to say, in the end, no one wins, least of all the viewer.Don't see this movie. Please.

The clothes, music, attitudes, and actions of these characters are tremendous. Please buy the movie -- no need to rent because you will want to buy it after you see it. If I had tree thumbs I'd give it 3 thumbs up. Oh and contrary what people with no sense think it is based in the present. However, the characters are such dorks they dress that way.

It was frickin' funny as heck. I've never watched a movie that was so funny it made me watch it over and over again in one sitting. I watched it a total of 7 times this weekend (but I was also stuck at home with Mono, so I didn't have anything else to do). But really, I wouldn't have had a better time doing anything else. It reminded me of school in Southern MD, way down there where there's only one grocery store for 25 miles, and everything around it is farmland, all owned by the same family. We all had a kid in our school that reminded us of Napoleon. You kinda felt sorry for them, and wished you could be friends with them, but then that would make you the one people looked at weird. But at the same time, you knew that they could handle themselves, cuz they had that certain way about them. The Characters in this movie were so believable it was crazy. I think people sometimes forget how hard it is to act. I've read some of the other comments, and they said something like ""the actors seemed like they forgot their lines"" or something like that. What they fail to realize is that the actors did that on purpose, making it look normal, like real life. Do you say everything without messing up all day everyday? I don't think so. Tina Majorino and Aaron Ruell were also excellent. And Jon Gries. I thought it was funny that the movie was based in the present time, but had an 80's kinda theme because of where they were located. Not everybody keeps up with the joneses. Anyways, I loved this movie, and I'll keep sayin that. Y? Cause I'll say whatever I feel like I wanna say!! GOSH!!! ;-)",Napoleon Dynamite

But, the movie leaves it at that -- they show a quirky character, but do not place him into enough situations where his quirkiness is illustrated. There are a few -- but there should have been so much more. The DVD has deleted scenes which do in fact do this -- and if those scenes had been left in, I would have given this movie a higher rating.Contrast ND with Fast Times. Like ND, FT had great characters that we can all relate to -- and then put those quirky characters into situations that were funny. ND just presents the characters and does not go to the next step to have them interact in humorous or entertaining ways.

He sits in the back seat of the car and recites lines from the movie. His favorite is the wolverine scene.

1130,djdeeyem,"I think we tried too hard, Hess'...WARNING possible Spoilers",3,27 December 2004,"In order to give you my full experience, I will have to admit that I was duped by television! I'm not usually one to fall for these things, but the TV promised me the funniest movie I'll see in years. COOL!And it has a catchy title, ""Napoleon Dynamite"" When I said I was duped, I meant it. This movie had some of those funny moments, Ie: the Plastic and the Van incident, Ricos tiny scream when his van was hit by an orange. Things that made me smile and giggle. But for the most part I waited for something to happen, and it didn't. I wanted to smash my hands for RUNNING out and renting it, and break my TV for lying to me! Some things need to wait for IFC broadcast.When it was said and done, I felt that the Hess' brothers had tried entirely too hard to make a film that focused on character development but with characters of no substance. I'm thinking it was too much of an inside joke. They need a lesson from P.T. Anderson in making a film with little plot and all characters.Production value was crisp. Nice camera work, good looking scenery, use of animals, (Although only a tied up Llama) and decent interiors. But we had some really screwed up time lines. It's like the Hess' wanted to show you everything that was cool about the late 80's and early 90's but forgot that the film was less than a month in storyline. We didn't pay attention to our trend times! None the less BRAVO technically.I've heard the usual Buzz about this film being a Mormon movie. The Hess' did attend BYU, but I don't think its cause for alarm. I think people should be more concerned it was an MTV production more than anything. They love your money, and have unlimited marketing budgets to make you want to go out and rent or buy the Funniest movie of the year.Love always! xxoo",Napoleon Dynamite
1131,Stefburford,Honest Summary with references,7,29 December 2004,"Firstly, this film is very enjoyable indeed however I would say that like many 80's style high school movies it is instantly disposable. Like a chewing gum it is fun while it lasts but does not leave a lasting impression !The acting is good ( not outstanding) and considering it is the directors first movie, it is well put together and quirky. The real element of the film that makes it stand out as a cult classic in the making is the spot on portrayal of Napoleons and Pedro friendship. It is both touching and entirely believable. It is very true that in a school hierarchy, the 'losers' and 'outcasts' do tend form lasting,real friendships.These relationships are just as meaningful as the ones developed in American Pie etc.. The one major criticism I would have is that the era it is set in feels very mixed and I left feeling confused about when it was actually set. At some points it feels late 80's in style and dress ( particularly clothes, fashion etc...) but the music is taken from the 80's ( the prom scene) and 90's ( particularly obvious in the dancing scene when Jamiroquai is the backing track).The jamiroquai track 'Canned heat' was released in 1999 !The use of the internet and more importantly Uncle Rico's mobile phone points towards the fact that it is set in the late 90's or present day?Now there are two reasons why the director did this 1)he wanted the audience to feel as though the characters are stuck in the 80's/ early 90's whilst in fact it is set in the present ( which i believe is probably the case) OR he just didn't research it very well !Another criticism is that is full of clichés ( not all bad I might add) which do not inspire laughter because it has been done before so many times. The character of Kip ( N's brother) is riddled with clichés particularly his meeting with internet love Lafawduh and his transformation into a wannabe homeboy. This is a very long standing joke in teen flicks and sitcoms etc..I would recommend that anyone who liked this watch Fast Times at Ridgemont High which is more enjoyable, just as funny and will leave you thinking much longer than ND ever does. In fact I don't think it is even comparable to films such as Dazed and Confused or Fast Times.Overall, enjoyable but in places tries to hard !",Napoleon Dynamite
1132,HMMurdock,Shock!,9,9 August 2005,"I was amazed and 'shocked' that this movie was so good. It has all the elements of a bad, 'b', or just moderate film. Low Budget. Lots of inexperienced talent. Dry humor, as well as some slapstick. However, at least for Napoleon Dynamite it really worked itself into an incredibly enjoyable movie. It's cute. It's geeky. Slow in parts. But it has real heart and a very nice surprise near the end.I'd watch this movie again and again. I happened to see this and another movie, being sold as a pair for the low price of $20 at Kmart. The other movie, The Girl Next Door was quite good, too. However, I feel most of the bargain for this pack was Napoleon. All in all, I really hit the jackpot, with the lion's share of enjoyment going for this quirky indie film.This also has one of my favorite child stars in it. She's still adorable and I think she should be in many more films. Tina Majorino. Good to see her at it again, some more.

Some of the things were just SO random, it was really weird. like when Napoleon hooked the fishing line to the plastic toy and threw it out of the bus window, does that have anything to do with anything?? my favorite character had to be Pedro because he did some pretty funny stuff. but i don't think that this movie had much of a point to it. i think that it shouldn't get rated over a 6 because it has absolutely no point to it. so if someone could help me out with the whole plot, that would be greatly appreciated.",Napoleon Dynamite
1134,gawkman,"You have to ""get it"" before you find it funny. And it is VERY funny.",9,30 December 2004,"The love/hate reactions I've seen do not surprise me at all. This movie is very different, it's own style... and it is PURE GENIUS. But it's definitely not for everyone... you have to back off and understand the mood and general feel of the movie before you have the context to find the actions of the characters funny. Then you will ""get it"". And what is this context I'm referring to? This movie explores the very essence of boredom and mediocrity as you follow the daily life of a dorky guy doing uninteresting things in a small, unexciting town. Napolean's constant, open-mouth, blank stare says, ""I'm only tolerating this monotonous existence because I've got nothing better to do."" It took me about 15 minutes into the movie and then I GOT it. The movie has no real plot because it isn't about an interesting story, it's about the real life that exists BETWEEN the interesting stories. Ever call up your bud because you're bored, then talk about what you're not doing, then decide to get together and be bored together, and spend the remainder of the evening trying to think of something to do to no avail? This movie is about this very type of thing... a tribute to the ordinary every-day stuff that you have no reason or desire to remember... like eating reheated leftover Hamburger Helper, or that old shirt you wear when you're working that you're not afraid to get dirty, or some magazine you flipped through to pass the time in the dentist's waiting room.I constantly found myself saying, ""This all seems too strangely familiar. I knew a guy like that. I've done stuff like that. I've been to a store like that. I've been in a house like that."" This isn't the kind of movie to make you suddenly laugh out loud, it's a movie that will first make you chuckle, and then chuckle some more, and pretty soon you can't stop laughing as scenes and characters continuously remind you about the absurdity of watching random, stupid pointlessness. Why would something boring be interesting to watch? You'll just have to see it to understand.",Napoleon Dynamite
1135,Samos74,best movie i've seen in a while,9,2 January 2005,"i'm not sure if i have ever seen a movie put out so much subtle, true-to-life humor as this one, all without using sex, violence or profanity. finally, a ""take me back to high-school"" movie that i could watch with my seven-year-old if i wanted to. the acting couldn't have been better. the characters are played perfectly as is the music. in fact, i'd have to say this movie is already one of my five favorite movies of all time. i only own about ten DVD's but i went out and bought this right after i saw it. i recommend this movie to anyone with a good sense of humor. i would say it compares slightly to ""Bottlerocket"" or ""Safe Men"" but it's really a pretty original movie.",Napoleon Dynamite

Kip married his soul mate, LaFawnduh, Pedro was voted class president, Uncle Rico got back together with his girlfriend Tammy, Grandma was reunited with Tina the lama, and most importantly, Napoleon found his babe, Deb. ""I'm sorry but I'm just thinking of the right words to say. i know they don't sound the way i planned them to be but if you wait around awhile i'll make you fall for me. i promise."" i'd recommend this movie to everyone! even though hes out to prove hes got nothing to prove, he makes a hard and clear statement: people judge, and people underestimate you, but in the end the under dog always comes out on top.... rent it if you haven't seen it. and after watching it once go out and buy it! a movie you should not be without.... check it out... peace out",Napoleon Dynamite

It had no plot, and was simply just random events that these dumb people carried out. The thing that REALLY ticked me off was how the producers of this movie drug the good name of the FFA into all of this. It made all of US see like social rejects-especially to those who are not familiar with the organization. My deepest sympathy goes out to the members of the Idaho FFA Association, who had their name mercilessly defamed in this movie. I will never recommend this movie to ANYONE, and I will make sure that my other FFA friends know about his travesty. Anyone who is not familiar with the leadership skills learned by students in this organization will see those jackets on this movie, and associate anyone who wears one with those blithering idiots on the movie.

1139,oso_martinez,Great quirky movie about the power of friends + Cute cholos in a lowrider!,7,31 December 2004,"My boyfriend and I see many movies and we are usually disappointed by lack of story and character development. Too many movies depend on car chases, sex and explosions to carry the story. This was a rough gem in usual pile of mediocrity that Hollywood dishes out. It's a nice story about a bunch of people who aspire to greatness or at least good-ness and are not ashamed of trying and looking vulnerable and how even though we may not recognize our talents our true friends do. Anyone who was in high school in the '80s will enjoy all the subtle references.For those you that find young cholo looking guys to be hot then you won't be disappointed with two excellent examples who have some minor roles in a few scenes including one in a lowrider.

A series of random events makes for a great movie. I love this movie and recommend it to anyone. Jon Heder is the next big star. With this performance, he deserves to be. Awesome movie. Very good.See this movie! I, at first, thought that it looked kind of stupid because there didn't seem like there was much of a plot. After seeing it, I love it. I've watched it several times and still laugh at the simplest things. My brother, who doesn't really like movies, loved this. It's easy to connect to the character because he goes through stuff like bullying, being left out, and other stuff. I was inspired by his sweet dance moves. Heck yes it's cool!",Napoleon Dynamite

1142,freakytoad1,Delightful,10,28 December 2013,"Napoleon Dynamite is a movie that anyone, who was in high school in the last 20 years, could relate to. Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder) is an awkward nerdy guy that wears snow boots all year long and tucks his t-shirts into his pants. He has an odd family; his 30-year-old brother (Kip) lives at home and ""chats online with hot babes all day"", his grandmother has an interesting side-life, and his uncle (Uncle Rico) is stuck living in '82. He gets beat up a lot and laughed at for being nerdy. Preston High School, where Napoleon attends has the typical ""jock"" and ""popular, pretty girl"" like every high school. But, this story speaks truer than most high school movies because it isn't about sex or popularity. This movie is about real, boring, typical life. The kind of ""joke"" of the whole movie is that it doesn't really have a story. Every scene is just a part of Napoleon's boring life. But somehow the awkward, boring, and unrelated adventures all come together to create a really comedic movie. The movie was filmed on scene in Preston, Idaho and is set in the 90s. It starts off with Napoleon getting on the bus to go to school. You immediately notice that Napoleon isn't exactly a ""cool kid"". His mouth is wide open, his hair unkempt and he has huge glasses. When a kid on the bus asks ""What are you gonna do today Napoleon?"" he responds ""Whatever I feel like I wanna do, GOSH!"" He then throws an action figure tied to a string out the window and just lets it drag behind the bus. The hilarity and weirdness only escalates from here. The next ten minutes of the movie are different scenes of Napoleon at school. Every scene is funny but in a nontraditional kind of way. For example, in one scene Napoleon gets up and gives a speech about the Loch Ness Monster and how ""Sir Curt Godfrey of the Nessie Alliance summoned the help of Scotland's local wizards to cast a protective spell over the lake and its residents, and all those who seek a peaceful existence with our underwater ally."" Jon Heder's delivery and comedic timing are just priceless and spot on. Another scene is the Happy Hands Club (sign language club) signing The Rose by Bette Midler. Everyone in the club is together and in time except Napoleon. One of the most iconic parts of the movie is when Napoleon signs the bird flying. He just looks so completely ridiculous doing sign language with a bunch of girls. A few more scenes like this follow and are also scattered randomly throughout the movie and somehow make sense. During school Napoleon meets the new kid, Pedro Sanchez, and shows him around. This is the first instance of Napoleon having a friend. Pedro and Napoleon start to get close and eventually they add a third to their posse. Pedro runs for class president against Summer Wheatley, the popular girl. This is one of the major events in the movie but it is coddled with side stories since this movie doesn't have a traditional plot. There are two other main events in the movie that I recognize. One being a high school dance and the other involves Kip finding love online. Any of these three events could've easily been their own movie. But the style of this movie drags a lot of unanswered events together.The acting in this movie is very well done even though there are no ""A"" or ""big-time"" actors in this movie. The characters in this movie are more relatable than realistic. They are a little more complex than a one-dimensional character. The director (Jon Heder) is the main character and he plays the nerdy teenager perfectly. Maybe he has some previous life experience to help him? Kip is played well by Aaron Ruell. He is very convincing as a skinny, white computer nerd. Efren Ramirez plays a stereotypical Mexican-American. All of the minor characters are played well when they are given screen time.Enjoying Napoleon Dynamite is usually hit or miss with most people. If you don't get the joke of the movie or if you expect a deep morally correct message, you will be sorely disappointed. People can easily relate to this movie in one way or another. It doesn't matter where you are from, every school has at least one of the high school characters depicted. Or, they could relate to the realization that most of life is boring and that the exciting and fun times should be celebrated. This is a fun watch that people of all ages can enjoy. It's full of one-liners and scenes that people still recreate today, 10 years later. Be sure to keep watching through the ending credits for a surprise ending!",Napoleon Dynamite
1143,nerybrowne,Napolean Dynamite is Genius,10,3 January 2005,"I hesitantly allowed my 14 year old daughter to select this movie through our mail order DVD service. I gave her the green light because it's rated PG and figured it wouldn't have too much profanity. Just the title alone seemed so absurd that I figured I would never actually sit down and watch another teen coming of age movie. When it arrived on new year's eve my daughter wasn't home but my Spanish speaking 65 year old father who is wheelchair bound was here for the day. I offered to play it for him in Spanish and prefaced the experience by saying that if he hated it I would turn it off. As I worked around the house I could hear laughter coming from the family room. This is a man who doesn't even flinch during the climatic scenes in big action films. I decided to sit down and check out what was so funny. I never got back up and mind you I was watching it in Spanish which isn't my primary language. It might as well have been in Japanese comedy knows no language barriers. I'm a middle aged woman, OK, I just turned 40, but there are no age guidelines when it comes to appreciating the small details. On New Year's day I played the movie again for my brother and his family and my mother. It was much more entertaining than the Rose Bowl and we had a blast. My boyfriend and I also watched it together and he just rolled and replayed many of the scenes over again. I later watched the director's cut and was captivated by how they used real people from Preston and actual site locations, including interiors of homes. I can only imagine that it wasn't very expensive to produce unlike some of high budget low entertainment movies that sometimes come out of Hollywood. Today I will put Napolean Dynamite back into it's self addressed postage paid envelope and it will go back to where it came from in DVD heaven, but Napolean Dynamite will live on forever! Enjoy...",Napoleon Dynamite

1145,krage_2003,Not a bad movie,8,3 January 2005,"Well... Very unusual movie. I read a lot of comments and noticed that many have strong opinions about it. The reason for it is that movie is about real life, so different opinions reflect different experience with (attitute of) the viewers the life depicted. For some that existence is just humor for others it is sad reality existing in the middle of (small-town) America.The noticeable feature of the movie is the viewer's ability to believe in what he/she see on the screen, despite weird personalities shown.With a bit better play of the actors and directors work it could have been a cult movie. Still, it is worth it to see it and experience your own wave of emotions.",Napoleon Dynamite
1146,alexa-24,This movie was horrible!,1,4 January 2005,"After watching this movie, I honestly felt dumber. The characters and their interactions were dull, making the film similar to a boring rendition of nightmarish high school memories. The female character was far too attractive and not at all convincing as a ""loser."" This movie is comparable in my opinion to Punch Drunk Love. It was not as horrifying as Adaptation, but equally as repulsive. I continued to watch the movie with hopes that it would get interesting, but only succeeded in lowering my expectations after numbing my senses for over an hour. The last 10 or so minutes were kind-hearted, but overall the entire movie was pointless. Don't waste your time or money on this mind-numbing movie.",Napoleon Dynamite
1147,mrsc_j,A really great film!!!!,10,16 February 2005,"This is an awesome film. It is one that you either really like and can totally relate to, or really dislike, and just don't get. If you like films that just take you to someplace and let you experience it, you will like this one. Not every film has to be cool, or have fast action and dialogue, or sex, or any number of the things that seem to be requisite in modern films. In fact, you cool people- just go away. You won't get it, you'll be just like the jock in the movie that just shakes his head, laughs like an arrogant jerk and thinks it's all so stupid. You'll never understand why we like the Happy Hands Club, or join FFA, or build cakes for the one we love. Go watch some Name-Branded Hollywood Blockbuster and think you're cool- we won't miss you.",Napoleon Dynamite
1148,uwlax_sax,Don't Judge A Book By Its Cover Or A Movie By Its Previews,9,5 January 2005,"I was hesitant to rent this movie because the previews made it appear to be a waste of time and money. At one point, I even went so far as to vow to NEVER watch that movie...EVER. Finally, while in the video store one day, my friend (who felt the same way) and I buckled and rented it. When we watched it, we found ourselves laughing through almost the entire movie, and later quoting it. I can relate to Napoleon. It was much better than expected. It was nice to see a movie that wasn't full of swearing or just like the other movies in Hollywood that come out at about the same time. Napoleon Dynamite is unlike any movie that I've seen, and I'd gladly rent it again. All in all, the movie rocked my socks.",Napoleon Dynamite
1149,vanka-2,Awful,1,15 January 2005,"This movie was just plain awful. I regretted renting it 10 minutes into the movie. As I was watching it with my friends, we kept hoping it would get better; but it never did.It claims to be character driven, yet the characters could have been better played by cardboard cutouts; and the cutouts would have had more depth than the actors.The movie itself appears to be a collection of vaguely connected scenes that were thrown together in a chronological order. Nothing resembling a plot is anywhere to be found. The scenes themselves manage to fall flat every time and have a feel of being unfinished about them. Even worse, the non-plot moves along at a snails pace and I found myself wishing that it would just end.This movie is a waste of the five dollars to rent it and a waste (if you are into that kind of thing) of download time. Watch at your own risk!",Napoleon Dynamite

If you like to laugh WATCH THIS! This is a very cleaver movie! I think I will go home tonight and watch this, after O.C. of course. I would say this is a good family movie, very clean. But my friends that I watched it with were all in their mid 20's. The annoying part is that now everyone keeps repeating lines from it and mimicking the movie. There is a lot of subtle jokes that you have to pay attention to in this movie. I think this is why we keep watching it, because we hear something new each time. This is the first review I have ever posted for a movie, this is how strongly I feel about this one.",Napoleon Dynamite
1151,gusgus36,Great movie,10,7 January 2005,"This movie is a great example of classic story telling... there's not always a need for multiple twisting plots. This is just plain and simple GREAT acting, along with great casting by the director. This movie goes in my book as a classic... I highly recommend this movie for those who are tired of all the computer animated special effects, and want to see some quality acting. Entertaining for all ages, this movie ranks up there with ""Office Space"" for its worthwhile value, one of those movies that will not collect dust on my movie rack, like a lot of my collection.

1152,corinfabinger,Best comedy since Dumb & Dumber!,10,7 January 2005,"Napoleon Dynamite is by far one of the best movies ever made. Next to Dumb & Dumber, this has to be one of the best low-budget slap-stick comedy movies within the past 15 years. This movie may not even really have much of a plot, but how many movies do you see that can interest people sooo much that doesn't have a plot. What made this a great movie were the people in it, and I think the stars are going to have a long business in show biz. Take Dumb & Dumber, they would have a piece of crap movie if they wouldn't have gotten Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels. If you have read the original script you will see what I mean. You know why...cause it sucks!! Jim and Jeff MADE that movie what it is, and that is that.Almost every aspect of Napoleon Dynamite comes from the writers child hood. I strongly encourage you to watch the commentary to this movie. It has the 2 writers and the star ""Napoleon"" talking. The fact that this movie had so few actors in it is awesome. They had no sets or anything, the director just went to his home town of Preston, Idaho, and was like we would like to do a movie, what can we use?I don't know exactly how much they had to work with, money-wise, but I would like to see someone else make a movie that awesome with such little money. They didn't even pay for the rights of the song for the intro to the movie. They wrote a letter and sent a copy of the movie and asked if they could use it.If you haven't seen this movie, I very much encourage you to go rent it. And I wouldn't watch it by yourself, it is best with at least 2 or more people. Keep an open mind...Peace out.",Napoleon Dynamite

I have now watched it like 10 times.So whichever people say that this movie sucked they are just wacky!!!""What are you going to do today Napoleon?""

1154,van_haalen,Don't be fooled by the IMDb rating!,1,17 January 2005,"I certainly thought that a teen movie about a geek, would be entertaining and bring about many laughs. But with Napolean Dynamite, I was completely disappointed. The movie was horrendous. Firstly, the characters blurt out just a couple of lines in every scene. By the first 20 minutes I realised that this movie was completely dull, it's humour was blunt and typical. This makes it seem as if all the actors are mindless zombies. Secondly, the entire movie has no plot! I was utterly shocked and felt cheated when the movie ended.But why then would this movie receive a user rating of 7.3? It's simple because it's indie movie. Hence non-conformist teens feel that it would be cool to like the movie instead of liking something much better like Mean Girls. These people just fail to see how much this movie really sucked. The only way to real to see if this movie was a success is by looking at it's box office earnings, the real evidence is there. Many people would have never heard of this movie if it wasn't for the internet or IMDb.",Napoleon Dynamite

This might not be your humour and you might say ""it sucks"", but for those of you that get this kind of humour, you'll find a true gem. I can't come up with one thing I dislike about this movie. I am not sure where this movie is supposed to take place (year and location). The cloths and music is like late 80's - early 90's. They play music like Alphaville's Forever Young, the dude is wearing snowjoggings (which explains a lot) - but still they have Internet access.. This was a bit confusing to me.. But maybe there are places like this somewhere in the US. Anyways, all I can wish for now, is that they make a sequel. Go see this movie today!",Napoleon Dynamite
1156,xeovani,Loved it t'was the best movie ever!!!,10,9 January 2005,ND was such an awesome movie. It was full of humor and great characters. My favorite characters were the Chiles and La Fawanduh. Overall the movie was one of the best I've ever seen because the cast did such a great job of playing their roles and the dialog was priceless. I watched it with my mom (who is 43) and she got a kick out of it!!!!! I don't know why people say ND is bad because it was great!! I don't know anyone who has seen it who hates it. People say independent films are boring because they are low budget and bad. I think that independent films are awesome. You cant compare Nutty Professer-type comedies to this film because it is like comparing apples and oranges.,Napoleon Dynamite
1157,kurt-123,Just a horrible waste of time,1,13 January 2005,"I know it's ""cool"" to like this film for some unknown reason but let's be honest for a moment and hop off the bandwagon. This movie is just not good. There's no plot, horrible acting, annoying speech patterns that make you want to slap the taste out of certain characters (especially Napoleon, blah blah blah, GOSH!) and by the time this movie simply ends, nothing has taken place. This clown's last name is Dynamite yet nobody finds that odd. All the stereotypes are in place in this film, the nerd, the shy geeky girl who's actually really cool, the mean jock, the blonde popular bitch, the can barely speak English foreigner with the funny cute accent, the bossy (cousin/uncle/brother.....), the over the top tough guy, etc. Don't look for any breakthrough's. Unfortunately the one thing this film was missing was an actual story. Sorry but when the biggest thing that happens in an entire movie is a nerd does a stupid dance on stage in front of the entire student body to help get his friend elected class president, that's just not gonna cut it. Sit back and really think about this movie. I mean REALLY think about it. If you don't admit it's just plain awful then I assume you also like everything else that the media and your peers tell you are cool. So go listen to your Ashley Simpson CD and throw Napoleon Dynamite into the DVD player and be cool.",Napoleon Dynamite

This is the plot of the movie. When misfit Napoleon meets some misfit friends he vows to help one of them become class president even though that means that they have to get more votes than the popular girl. The movies main strength is not the plot but the characters themselves and their interactions which range from hilarious, to humorous, to over the top.

I mean what a genius can create such a movie with dry humor and such comedy! My school to its entirety (all of the pupils) can not stop talking about this movie. Its like the flu, everyone gets it. Well sort of, once you've seen this movie, you can't help but watch it over and over (for me 10 times in a row) and then mimic everything you have seen. It starts off a little slow but as soon as Napoleon gets on the bus and that little kid goes ""Hey Napoleon what are you gonna do after school?"" and Napoleon replies ""Whatever I wanna do Ga!"" from then on its non stop laughing. How in the world do they keep straight faces. Especially Kip when he is at the diner with Uncle Rico and says he is ""t.o.ed"" BC he hasn't gotten a full body shot yet from his online babes. I mean how great. Even all my teachers crack up about it. I love when they are performing in class to that stupid song and Napoleon is moving his hands like a bird or whatever they are doing. Its just comedy, pure comedy. This director or whoever made the movie up deserves a Nobel Peace Prize or whatever they give nowadays. So many people try to make funny movies using jokes and all but this is just everyday life of outcasts (who by the way Rock!) and it in itself is hilarious.

They whole family in the movie is so original and funny the way Kip says anything makes you laugh and combining his non-violet character with Napoleons outrageously comedic character was a great combo! I bought the movie after i rented it twice and I'm positive it'll be watched tons. Its so much funnier to repeat the lines and actions that Napoleon, Kip and the uncle do after you watch the movie! It is a MUST SEE!! i would recommend it to anyone of any age!",Napoleon Dynamite
1162,patrick-macaluso,Waste of time,1,28 June 2005,"The only part of this movie that I found even remotely enjoyable was the scene where Napoleon was dancing to Jamiroquai. Other than that, the movie was a complete waste of time, contained no story line, made no sense, and perhaps made me stupider every minute I watched it. I found no point in watching a movie about a strange out-of-touch weirdo with a strange out-of-touch family pursuing a strange out-of-touch girl. Quite honestly, I get enough of strange out-of-touch experiences in my own life and I watch even more strange out-of-touch people on more creative, more entertaining, and overall better shows such as Six Feet Under. To sum it all up-- This movie, Napoleon Dynamite, was perhaps one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and it took an out and 1/2 out of my life that I'm never going to get back.",Napoleon Dynamite
1163,punkqt047,Funny and Unique,7,13 January 2005,"I have seen this movie twice now, and i think the second was even funnier than the first. This movie will only appeal to those with that type of sense of humor. I feel that if one doesn't like it, than they don't enjoy movies of that nature....for example, for all of those out there who like ""Office Space"" or the ""Jay and Silent Bob"" movies, this is right up your alley. The humor was really dry and i like movies like that. Its unique and not like every other comedy out there, which is why my rating is so high. It contained clever remarks and complete random dialogue that added to the movie's comedic content. It is really hard to predict what is going to happen next and what does end up happening is always hilarious. It is definitely a winner, one of those movies u just have to say u own if u like movies. Go watch for yourself!",Napoleon Dynamite
1164,aksupercom,"If you get it, you'll love it.",10,13 January 2005,"So many people go to a movie in order to see excitement, slapstick, gratuitous nudity or violence, or characters and situations that stretch beyond the boundaries of normal life. This movie has none of that hype. Napoleon Dynamite's humor is so well-timed and subtle that you won't even catch it if you're not ready for anything other than the usual Hollywood showboat.Nowadays movies are all mass-produced and feel like the same movie I've seen hundreds of times before, just with different scripts. Napoleon Dynamite is like a breath of fresh air. Apparently there must be more than a few people who agree with me, as this movie got over 7 stars out of 10.If you really think that Dumb & Dumber was a better movie about social misfits, then you must think Napoleon Dynamite needs some more slapstick or dumbed-down blatant humor. That's not what this movie is about.Seriously, if you want another big-budget Hollywood production, don't watch it. If you want a movie that isn't trying to prove that it has what it takes to be big, see Napoleon Dynamite.",Napoleon Dynamite
1165,BeStInTeXaS67,good times,9,13 January 2005,"OK, i just saw this movie recently and in the beginning i thought it was stupid and boring, but as soon as i heard a funny one-liner of Napoleon's, i was glued to the screen. I definitely made the right decision because i was laughing every few seconds. I thought it had a great ending and was such a funny and good movie. However, it takes a certain sense of humor and you shouldn't expect anything inspiring, meaningful, or thought-provoking. But if you're just looking for a good laugh and some funny one-liners to say with your friends, this movie is so perfect for you. The characters are so different and unique, yet blend together so well. The setting of the movie isn't really clear though because some material is from the 80's yet contains other material from the late 90's. Either way, it's still a really funny movie, especially if your an 80's child since it brings back trends, hairstyles,and clothes from back in the day and that's always fun to look back to.",Napoleon Dynamite
1166,Hailthequeen,I was surprised!,9,14 January 2005,"My husband rented this movie for us to watch one night and at first I wasn't to happy about it. As I watched the movie I found myself laughing and enjoying it. Napoleon Dynamite has such a simple story line but it can take you back to the days when you were growing up. Of course if you weren't part of the ""Popular"" crowd then you would understand. Anyway,I have watched it a couple of times and still laugh. All the actors and actresses couldn't of done a better job portraying their characters. I think I could of known those type of people back in the days. It feels quite short in length but I think a movie that can make you remember it's dialog is a good movie and I've only watched it twice so far.I say this movie is SWEET!",Napoleon Dynamite
1167,michelle-277,Love it or Hate it!!,9,2 February 2005,"My preteen son asked me to buy this movie on a whim. Neither of us had even seen preview for it. We brought it home and watched it. He and I both laughed all the way through it. My teenager hated it. I have let 4 others at work watch it, all male, and two loved it, two hated it. Do you see the theme here? There does not seem to be an ""ok"" opinion. The two that did not like the movie, did not even finish it. I love the way this movie is made. Does anyone really know what year it is suppose to be set in? Why are there so many questions raised by the movie, even if they may be irrelevant? Napoleon is a lovable geek. If nothing else, you have to be able to identify with him to laugh at him.",Napoleon Dynamite
1168,jedi_metroid,This movie is flipping sweet,10,14 January 2005,"Gosh, I can't make you watch it. You just gotta like movies not full of some guy taking the lord's name in vain every five seconds.It also helps if you think stuff like Monty Python is humorous, the comedy is brilliantly unique, and like a classic python skit, everything ends very anti-climactic.This movie is really for anyone who is the least bit nerdy. Nerds everywhere and Christians everywhere can finally come together, this explains why I like the movie so much because really I am both. This movie was so good, it is only the third movie ever that I have watched all the special features for it.",Napoleon Dynamite
1169,osu696982,Didn't care for movie,2,15 January 2005,"I rented this movie without knowing much about it, but was told by three people this week it was hilarious. My wife and I didn't even finish it. Perhaps it is not our style, but we found it awkward and annoying. From the comments, I see it is quite popular, so we are judging that the humor is not that funny to us, although it must be to others. I believe the movie to be unique in its approach, and will appeal to many but not all.The dialog, was for us, awkward to listen to and the characters were irritating. I am writing my thoughts, and not judging others, but I would tell those interested in watching they need to see and judge for themselves.",Napoleon Dynamite
1170,foggy_nelson,Interestingly amusing,10,15 January 2005,"I never paid attention to this movie when it first came out, but for some reason I decided to rent it the other day. What a hilarious movie! If you know a nerd, love a nerd, or are a nerd, you will love it. The characters were believable in such a way that you felt you have once known a person like that, if that makes sense. It is also interesting to see how some people like that would live. You see goofy people in your life, some so bizarre, but this movie shows you how some might live and learn, so believable and not too outrageous. Their quirky behavior makes them lovable. My favorite characters were Napoleon, and of course Pedro, such a great team. It is now one of my favorite movies! Watch it, it may surprise you.",Napoleon Dynamite
1171,mattm591,This Movie Has No Plot!,10,7 May 2005,"Yes, this movie has no plot! And doesn't that just make it brilliant.Napoleon Dynamite is a series of beautiful interlinking jokes making a gorgeous film that will have you in hysterics.For the more miserable people it does tend to be a rather dull film because not too much happens, but a bunch of friends watching this film will then find themselves quoting it for months.If anyone is in need of a good laugh then this film is definitely for you. It doesn't make use of jokes about sex with plastic woman, or use boobs to get a cheap laugh like most teen comedy's around now, but instead uses classic voices and witty phrases and expressions to produce pure gold! 10/10 for sure!",Napoleon Dynamite
1172,ichthus1,it gets funnier every time i see it,8,17 January 2005,"Napoleon dynamite is the most quotable movie since princess bride. Most of my friends have seen it, and we quote lines from it in our regular conversations almost constantly. And it never gets old. The more you see it and the more you quote it, the more you'll laugh at it. Before you watch it, you need to be in right frame of mind: it is EXTREMELY dry. The humor is based on how melodramatic Napoleon is and how much he romanticizes things like martial arts and ""skills"" of any kind. And you have to love his moon boots! If you've never known someone at all like that, you may not think its funny. I know a few people who didn't like it, and those who don't like it, absolutely hate it. But those of us who like it, love it. And most people like it.",Napoleon Dynamite
1173,Xanthra,I didn't like it...but...,3,17 January 2005,I didn't like it...but I have never laughed as hard or as much!) as I did while reading all the posts for this movie!! Each to his own I say!

1174,rodgerlyle,Another great under-hyped movie!!,9,18 January 2005,"I simply loved this movie. All of the characters are perfect for their roles, and although it moves a little slowly at times, it's hilarity makes up for it. Looking at the demographics, it's pretty easy to see that this movie is for the young or the ""young at heart"" (like myself). The coolest thing about this flick is the fact that it wasn't another cookie-cutter Hollywood over-hyped movie that makes you feel like you got suckered into wasting $15 for another crappy DVD! Another great thing about ND is the fact that it's only rated PG, and that someone out there who is making movies has enough talent to write something that's funny without using ""the F-bomb"" 20,000 times! A cross between Clerks, Dumb and Dumber, and Revenge of the Nerds, this movie will not disappoint, as long as you're not looking for a movie with deep meaning. If you are looking for meaning, then lighten up, or go watch your Richard Gere flick with your girlfriend!! This film is meant simply to entertain, not to make you ponder the meaning of life!! This movie is certain to become a ""cult classic"", and people will be quoting lines from Napoleon for a long time! Lines like ""sweet bike"", ""I'm training to become a cagefighter"", and ""numchuck skills"" will be heard years from now. One more piece of advice...if you get the DVD, make sure you watch it all the way through to the scene at the end, it's hilarious! I gave this film a 9/10 because it's flippin' funny! GOSH!",Napoleon Dynamite
1175,jsewell-3,Brilliance,9,17 January 2005,"This movie is better in my opinion than ""Welcome to the Doll House"" against which it is frequently compared. The subtle genius in this film manifests in the characters. Unless you've known people like this, you're not going to get it. The choice of words, the movements, the demeanors, are all perfect. Being somewhat of a nerd growing up, I was surrounded by guys like this.The plot is slow but deliberate. I think this is intentional, and works to produce a very relaxed, very funny movie. I found myself bursting out with laugher in almost every scene.Make no mistake, this is very subtle humor, and the movie as a whole is somewhat of an in-joke. But if you get the joke, you're going to love it.",Napoleon Dynamite

I wold no doubt give this movie a 10... and I really want to learn his dance moves...there the best...I really don't know what else to write so I'm just gonna randomly take up more space so I can submit this....your mom goes to collage...Napoleon, we both know I'm training to become a cage-fighter.... yeah right Kip, your reactions arn't quick enough...so hit me...what?...I said come dwn here and try to hit me then...",Napoleon Dynamite
1177,elgordo152000,"Non-Southeastern Idahoans might not ""get"" this movie",10,17 January 2005,"ND just plain captures the insanity so prevalent in Southeastern Idaho perfectly. I'm on the South side of fifty and couldn't stop laughing at the startlingly recognizable characters in the movie. I saw everyone from beloved but eccentric aunts to high school chums to the insufferably arrogant footballers and prom queens I knew from 30 or more years ago. If anyone watching this movie thinks it is far-fetched at all, he or she should spend a few days among the good folks of that part of America. Everyone in this brilliant movie can be found not only in Preston, but Montpelior, Malad, Bancroft, Soda Springs, Lava, Downey, even Pocatello and Blackfoot! And if you're looking for Napolean, I had to seek no farther than my own bathroom mirror. If only I had bright red hair!",Napoleon Dynamite
1178,cornelieus,Good Stuff,9,18 January 2005,"This movie was a real good one. I felt that it was a good mimic of real life and that is what made it so funny. I have viewed the film 3 times in three separate instances and every time the response by those watching was much laughter. I won't say that i was rolling off my seat because it was so funny because i wasn't, but it was good enough that I had a smile on my face the whole time. It keeps you entertained with nonsensical humor and will definitely be a movie that people will remember for years to come. Its creators were definitely on to something and they have been well rewarded. I give this film two thumbs up and an A for a grade. Good job.",Napoleon Dynamite
1179,vadir81-web,Lethargic Reel,1,18 January 2005,"This movie would have been funnier if they had just shown footage of someone burning the original film reel....it goes nowhere slowly, and the dialog between characters could have been carried on with large rocks. You may get a tickle or two on your fingernail if you experienced a day or two in the eighties. It leaves you in stunned silence as it hops from scene to scene leaving you wondering what in the world did you just watch and why did you watch it. I could not decide if the lead character was exposed to limited oxygen at the time of birth, or if he was hit by a firetruck in his youth, either way, if you desperately need 82 minutes of sleep...this is the one for you. I have asked several other people who have seen this film what their opinion was, some said you need to watch the movie THREE, yes THREE times before it becomes funny, now...I'm missing something here, It's not funny the first time ?.....or the second time, just the third time ? ""Please see back of box and follow directions to watch Napolean Dynamite"" 1st Run: Drink 6 pack, 2nd Run: Drink 2 Martini's, 3rd Run: Drink entire bottle of Vodka... HEY...GUESS WHAT ! IT'S FUNNY",Napoleon Dynamite
1180,srallred-1,Nice to see Idaho's scenery and small town feel,10,21 February 2005,"Napoleon is in everyone's school and most can relate to one or more of the characters in the movie. This movie is especially funny to the those that understand South Eastern Idaho culture. It's not meant for everyone. You will love it or hate it. Some of the things in the movie are meant for a younger generation. For example, ""your mom goes to college"" is a phrase I didn't get. I had to have an 8th grader explain it to me but most of the humor is dry and just the way some like it. The film was made in Preston, Idaho in the summertime and the viewer is presented with beautiful scenes from that area. Napoleon is a film in which you will either laugh your head off or be disappointed in the time it takes away from your life. I happen to think its great. GOSH!",Napoleon Dynamite
1181,Jendarith,Exceptional comedy about youth finding themselves even when they didn't think they were looking,10,19 January 2005,"Napoleon Dynamite was a very unique film for me, taking me back to high school on a totally new perspective. Rarely do we see in film our younger selves from the focus on the deep individual quirks, oddities, and shy intense strivings outward we all exhibit as youths searching for ourselves (even when we have no intent) as we are emerging in High School hoping for identity in a bolder world somewhere close or further beyond. Having received no preview information whatsoever, I decided to view this flick after my nephews ages 15 and 19 viewed it and then later purchased the DVD.After missing the film at the theater, but landing at their home for the niece's birthday in Houston this past weekend, I saw this long awaited and greatly hailed movie. At first I enjoyed mostly the jovial airs, smiles and laughs that my nephews exhibited while they viewed ND with me. It was amusing yes, but not earth shattering as far as films go. However, as the next day came, and the day after, and then another, I found myself reflecting deeply on the characters in the movie. The film had already began growing on me in an indescribable way. I began humming and singing some of the music from the film, both the published hits and those written for the characters. Also, I began reflecting on my high school days, how much alike in my own quirks I was to some of the players here. Even the older 'Uncle' relative of Napoleon I found some kinship with now, his reflections of bygone days of youth. Napoleon Dynamite has an uncanny way of gripping you first comically and then in a 'larger than life way' making you face the facts that though we are all unique or strange in a multitude of ways, even ways that are typically accepted or unaccepted as the norm, we as youths are greatly impacting creatures, not only to others as we see in the film, but to ourselves. And through our comical journeys of life, what makes us unique in our quirks, is usually what gives us identity and in that gives us a very solid form mainly for ourselves and our confidence. Not only does it give us the sure knowledge that we are real people and not just nerds, or jocks, etc., but it often times makes us heroes and figures to look to within the circles we travel.Who would've thought that such a quirky comedy with a clean rating of PG could move us so much in this day and age. My nephews say that most of the youths at school have the DVD already and hold it up as a cult favorite; thats saying a lot in today's film market of violence, sex, and foul language not to mention portrayal of destructive lifestyles. This may be the most poignant message of all in the end. I am looking forward to more films starring Jon Heder and also those by the writer/director. I highly recommend everyone see this movie sooner or later.",Napoleon Dynamite
1182,jadedchick85,I can't help but wonder if other people noticed,10,19 January 2005,ND is a great film that caught me by surprise. At first I didn't like the previews but the more I saw of them the more I wanted to see it.After seeing it I have to say it caught me by surprise. Parts that others laughed at didn't always amuse me and parts no-one else even noticed I found hilarious.However my bf pointed something out that caught me by surprise.The movie is about a 10-12 yo.Nothing caused me to doubt that thought for a moment. The school is a junior high and the first scene on the bus is full of that age of kids. The way they act and the scene at the school is just that of a grade school.The only difference is that the actors are all in their teens and/or early 20's.Does anyone agree or disagree?,Napoleon Dynamite
1183,lamanda_hilty,Perfect!,10,20 January 2005,"When I first heard about this movie I didn't care to see it, however, when I finally watched it I couldn't stop laughing! For the next few days all I could think about was how awesome the movie was and how I had to see it again. I honestly believe that this is a perfect film. The actors were exactly as they should have been, the setting was beautiful and fitting, the language was hilarious and each character had their own quirk that made them endearing. This was a film about real life. There wasn't hint of Hollywood magic and that made it all the better. I have been recommending that all of my friends see Napoleon Dynamite, I think everyone should, it's a really good laugh. I give this movie two thumbs WAY WAY up!!",Napoleon Dynamite
1184,poke0003,Comedy doesn't get better than this.,10,20 January 2005,"ND is arguably the best movie of the year. There are few movies that so perfectly capture the futile struggles of daily life, and are so realistic while being completely fantastic. It is the ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" of comedy, proving both heartwarming and entertaining.In particular, i felt that the sound track far outstripped the quality of most comedy tracks. The score matched the mood of every scene, and the music independent of the movie is good as well. Beyond the music, the story is engaging, but the quotes make the movie. Every little comment is hilarious. You have to see Uncle Ricco talk about how far he can throw a football to really get it, but if you've seen it, you just have to smile.I recommend it to everyone, since there is a little Napoleon in all of us.",Napoleon Dynamite
1185,nick-788,Best movie in a long time,10,21 January 2005,"Watched this movie, then had to watch it again straight away. I was still in tears of laughter the second time.A movie which won't offend anyone, is funny, heartwarming, uplifting and funny again without being sugary sweet or mawkish. You could take your kids or your Gran to see this, they'll all laugh.The guy deserves an Oscar for playing Napoleon himself, but his family and friends are also top drawer.I believe Ealing Studios would have been proud of a movie of this quality.Watch it! Even if it's not your favourite movie, you'll laugh and feel better for seeing it.",Napoleon Dynamite
1186,lizzygal,Hilarious,10,21 January 2005,"Napoleon Dynamite was hilarious! When I first bought it my parents thought it was one of the strangest things. My mom used the word ""disgusting"" to describe it, but I think she was completely wrong. It shows how ""dorks"" or ""nerds"" are, but it humanized them for me in a way. I never really thought about it until I saw this film. A lot of the characteristics displayed in the movie and how ND moves and talks, is really the way some people are. My sister calls it ""stupid humor"" but I think it was genius and don't know how someone did not think of it before. It is always in my DVD player and I'm always watching it and know most of the lines by heart, that's just how good I think it is. ND is one of the most realistic, funny movies I have seen, but as others have said, it is not for everyone, however I think anyone looking for a good laugh should try it out.",Napoleon Dynamite

Jon heder did an excellent job portraying him. there were a lot of original quirks that made napoleon so lovable. and him and pedro make a really good team.,Napoleon Dynamite
1188,demjohn,The joke gets old quick,3,22 January 2005,"The whole point of this movie is, ""look at these people - their so pathetic its funny!"". It reminds me of the National Lampoon ""Vacation"" movies. The first movie was funny, but eventually you get sick of everything going wrong for the Griswalds. While I did laugh quite a bit in the first 30 minutes, the joke gets old. By 45 minutes into the movie, I was checking the DVD case to see how much more I would have to sit through. They could have at least included a plot to try to hold an audience's interest!. Thankfully, the movie was less than 90 minutes. I literally just got done watching it, and felt compelled to write this as a warning to anyone else who might want to rent it.",Napoleon Dynamite
1189,PinkyTheSnowman,Hilarious: A Winner,8,24 January 2005,"If you're looking for a story with a plot, suspense, and lots of heroics, this is not the film for you.But it satisfies any need for randomness, stupidity, and hilarity that you could ever need. Feeling down? See the movie. Feeling stupid? See the movie. Feeling anything at all? See the movie! The story is very funny, the characters are so lovable, and if you can't relate to anything or anything in this story, then you're probably in denial.It's a PG movie, and it's safe to watch with kids. No scary moments, no profane things, just pure, adorable humor. If you haven't seen this already, go see it now!",Napoleon Dynamite
1190,golfergal07,best movie on earth,10,24 January 2005,"Some people said they hated this movie and they believed it was really poorly written but I believe this is the perfect movie to appeal to teenagers. It doe snot have the usual things a teenage-directed movie has in the way that fighting and bad language are used. Instead, it takes a nerdy guy, the average underdog at any high school and sees his life, which is filled with hilarious events. This movie is definitely one of my top five favorite movies of all time and I think everyone should give it a chance. My entire school quotes every line from this movie and it is definitely a movie to quote. Lines like ""Flippin' Idiot"" and ""I see you're drinking 1%...is that because you think you're fat?"" are so hilarious that it is hard not to repeat them.",Napoleon Dynamite
1191,fastriter19,a fresh comedy,10,25 January 2005,"This movie is a fresh, clean comedy much better than most comedies being produced today. Despite being a very small budget film, the film is well made and well thought out. The movie's lack of plot makes this film a new age cult status comedy (ie, office space). I would recommend this to anyone, any age, though some would not like it. This film is still far from the norm and anything with a fresh view, idea is worth your time of day. Also, notice the camera angles, camera movement, and the opening sequence. This is definitely a funny movie!

I split a gut every time he said something. Truly original..dang it!! I like how this movie addressed the problem of kids bullying in school, and how this need not give one a complex.Napoleon rose above all of the problems in his life including bullying, learned the ""skill"" of dancing and knocked the socks out of all his schoolmates that saw the performance, and built up his self esteem.Thank you for making this movie...Do you wonder if David Letterman wonders if his newborn son will turn out like Napoleon, they both have red hair...hope there is a sequel",Napoleon Dynamite

I've found everyone else in your class thinks that you're that kid, whereas you think that they're out of place all of the time. I found his character mesmerizing because he was just that kind of kid.... only trapped in a high school. The character was really awkward in conversation and resided in his own world. My favorite scenes were the ones when he would just boot off out of the frame for no reason, those shots really are the basis for any text above this. Napoleon is an awkward character that finds solace in dancing.",Napoleon Dynamite

I can say that living in Utah, some of the smaller towns are frightfully like Preston and so the movie hit pretty close to home. I have yet to meet a student that did not like the movie. I honestly think those who dislike the movie are just trying too hard to analyze it. Evaluating ND in terms too complex for what it is, or tries to be. Sort of like trying to compare Sponge Bob to the West Wing, there just aren't enough commonalities to justify it. When I want something to stimulate my mind I pick up a book, when I want to be entertained I rent a movie.Just thought I would put in my two cents for all those who, ""are just jealous because I have been chatting with babes online all day, besides you all know I am training to be a cage fighter...""",Napoleon Dynamite

Did you know they made this movie in 2000? well they did, and so far they have made 40 million, yes, MILLION dollars on it. I would start saying how i wish i could go back in time and star in the movie, but i don't want to sound like uncle rico. its funny because it reminds me of when i was in 7th grade when this kid would always wear his moon boots with his pants tucked in.",Napoleon Dynamite
1196,cjluther,"A Clean, Funny, Original Film?HECK YES IT IS",10,13 February 2005,"I can't remember the last movie I watched that I thought would be suitable and fun to watch with my whole family. Maybe it was ELF. That was pretty good too, for anyone who wants to watch a family friendly gut buster. Anyway, this movie was like nothing I had ever seen! I had all the things a good film should have, a struggle, a climax, love and diversity. It was even lacking the things that often pollute a good movie, i.e. excessive profanity, suggestive innuendo and sex. I brought the movie home over Christmas. My mother, the non-laugher, was struggling to catch her breath. My dad, the sleeper, was awake and paying attention the whole time. And my little sister, who seems to spend most of her time in front of the television, but cant sit in one place for more than ten minutes didn't move the whole time the movie was playing accept to hunch over from laughing so hard. I even watched the movie with my skeptic friends. They got a good laugh and I can't get them to quit quoting the movie. Today while walking through the dorms that I will call home for the next three months, I heard ""heck yes"" in someones best Napoleon voice. My junior high sister and her friends get a good laugh whenever someone says, ""Tina you fat lard, come get some dinner!"" A line from a scene in the movie where Napoleon has to go feed his grandmothers pet lama. Napoleon's current event for schools is ""Last week, Japanese scientists explaced... placed explosive detonators at the bottom of Lake Loch Ness to blow Nessie out of the water. Sir Godfrey of the Nessie Alliance summoned the help of Scotland's local wizards to cast a protective spell over the lake and its local residents and all those who seek for the peaceful existence of our underwater ally."" Funny on paper, but even better when a taller than average, scraggly carrot top with big glasses and the most bizarre shirt you have ever seen is reading it. Maybe now you are starting to get the idea. Maybe not the favorite film of a Frasier fan but they could still get a good laugh if they have an open mind. Here in the United States, there seems to be a template for all movies. I was so excited to watch a movie, actually in theaters that looked so student film. It broke all of the molds. It has a mostly unknown to little-known cast. That really helped to set the personalities of the characters without a lot of background since there were no preconceptions entering the theater with me. The camera work seemed very unique, almost armature, with noticeably interesting camera angles. The story is a true thing of beauty, so simple yet so deep. So, not only was the film fun for the whole family and all of my friends, but it was also original and innovative, an instant classic in my movie collection. A must see for anyone who can set aside 82 min. of their, not nearly as funny as Napoleon's, life.",Napoleon Dynamite

I will always put this movie on at home if I am in a funk and having a ""not so good"" day! I would love to go to Preston Idaho, if that is what it takes to go back into the 80's like the movie portray's. My 5 year daughter is insisting that she wear her hair in side ponytails now, its rather funny, the kids at school ask her whats up with pony's and she talks about the movie, considering that she goes to a military school. I really hope that they make a sequel. , I wish that this movie was put out there better, or more people would have went and saw it, but the good part is that A lot of people are loving the movie and buying it!

I was skeptical because it doesn't' look like much...Face it, high school sucked for everyone. Especially the outcasts. Unlike the American Pie teen comedies of late, where only the hot and popular have lives and they're totally unrealistic, this movie focuses on the LEAST popular, and feels very real.The movie actually FEELS slow-moving... but you soon realize you're laughing harder and more often than you do any of today's carbon-copy goofball comedies. In most comedies, you hear all the good jokes in the trailers and commercials, then wind up disappointed because you just paid $8 to see a 90 min. re-run! ""Nappy D"" can't entice you with its hilarious one-liners because its humor is enhanced by the character development.As other reviewers have said, this movie isn't for everyone. But that's mainly because it doesn't follow a formula. (aside from the obligatory ""happy ending."") It's realistic, deadpan humor at its finest. You don't even realize Heder (Napoleon) is acting! The characters are based on people you either knew... or WERE... in high school, and are portrayed so well you feel like you're at your own reunion!Two enthusiastic thumbs up for Napoleon Dynamite!",Napoleon Dynamite

It is just really, really, really, funny! He reminds my a lot of my friend Tori with his whole attitude. Napolean gets annoyed by a lot of things. My favorite character would have to be either Lefawnduh or Tina. They are definitely not the main characters. But, they are the cause of a lot of the funniest parts of the movie. For those of you who haven't seen this movie, it has nothing to do with the French midget conqueror. it is about a geek with attitude who lives on a small town in Iowa with his 30-year old geek brother with high socks and plays bowling with the gutters up (i think he is a bad influence lol) Tina is the llama.",Napoleon Dynamite
1200,joevilla10,The Greatest Film Since Spartacus!,10,1 February 2005,"This is the type of movie that is bound to become a cult classic. I am happily an avid member. The set design by itself is attention grasping, not only does it have a unique throw back to the eighties personal and nostalgic flair, but the colors are reminiscent of Technicolor film days. Think Ghost World for some of the consideration of era specific set design and dry humor; although much more upbeat, comedic, and altogether a lighter funner film. Remember there are additional minutes of footage after the credits to be watched as was done in Ferris Bueller's Day Off, however in this movie it's actually a continuation of the plot(not just Ferris popping up and telling you to leave). If you enjoyed this movie and review some other highly recommended comedies include:Johny Stecchino, The Party, UHF, Ghost World(comedy/drama)",Napoleon Dynamite

It was made to be realistic or like a home movie and I can't stop watching it.,10,2 February 2005,"Napoleon has become a part of my everyday life now. Everyone I know quotes the movie as their second language. It's like a craze that no one can get over. People have criticized it for it's ""poor"" direction, plot, and and camera style, but that is the point of the movie- to be realistic. I love this movie and still watch it often. Napoleon says these crazy things that I catch myself saying such as "" Gosh!"" and ""Heck yes I am!"". My friends and I sometimes have entire conversations in Napoleon talk. I think that everyone can relate to Napoleon in some way or another and that is the reason for it's popularity. The director actually had scenes in the movie be events in his life when growing up.

It is the same world as ""Welcome to the DollHouse"". Making the unglamorous glamorous. Seeing the movie on DVD is probably a lot different than having a theatre full of people antisipating every seen and yelling out things before they happen. Like ""Yessssss!"" and ""Goddd"". Jon Heder has his character down and we care for him because he takes risks and he's so believable. Among many my favorite scenes, one that stands out is when he tries on the ""Time Machine"". Also when roommate Kip changes his image for LaFawnduh. The open titles are very clever and draw you right in. I'm sure the director and the writers new just what they wanted when they made this film but I'm sure it wasn't easy. A must see for everyone who deserves a good laugh.ERIC M.

All of you that say it is stupid or whatever, you just need to lighten up and just laugh at it. Its not made to make you think. Thet just want you to laugh at how stupid it is and thats what makes it so funny. I mean i think these people are geniuses i mean who would think of making a movie about a nerdy guy in the middle of Idaho! Who is also involved in FFA! (which me and my friends thought was the funniest thing in the world cause we had just got done learning about FFA in Ag class and we were making jokes about how we want to join to get the awesome jackets lol) But anyway if you haven't seen this movie you have to because it is hilarious!",Napoleon Dynamite

The worst film ever, nothing else is even close. I can't believe someone put up the cash to have it made. It's not a comedy or a drama or a documentary, I guess we'll just file it under wasted film. I have never agreed with Ebert before but this film was all he said it was and less! Good acting, good camera, work but there is nothing to like about the story or the characters.

His interest was piqued so he decided that we would rent the movie.We were a little skeptical going in, but I must say it certainly was a refreshing change of pace from the standard ""Hollywood"" fare. It was a delightful film about a ""boring"" life. There is no sex, violence, bad language, smoking, drinking, in other words for a lot of people this would be boring. My husband and I were quite pleased with this movie and laughed hard. A nostalgic feeling came over us. We knew people like Napoleon Dynamite when we were in high school. We graduated in 1974, so the theme is ageless. Napoleon's character is quite genuine. I personally felt a soft spot in my heart for his ""best"" friend Pedro.We liked the movie so much we watched it again the very next day.

Much like Punch Drunk Love, Dynamite lacks many laugh out loud, obvious jokes, but operates on a deceptively sophisticated level. The title character, played marvelously by Jared Hess, embodies the universal geek in all of us, and is surrounded by deeply flawed characters who each represent, in an extreme way, various basic individual components of the human psyche (Napoleon is insecurity, twisted to a point where he exist in his own world, while his Uncle Rio represents regret for what might have been, forever reliving his high school football glory days). While there are several scenes that drag somewhat, I rate Dynamite a 7, or a couple of clicks above average, assuming 5 on a scale from 1 to 10 is average. Check this movie out, especially if you ever felt like the odd person out during high school.",Napoleon Dynamite

This film is incredibly subtle in it's humor..filled with moments of absolute hilarity for those who can understand it. Just face it, the writers are smarter than you. they have created a film that you cannot simply understand, therefore you instantly hate it.

The characters are there, and they are quirky enough to make a good movie - pity this isn't it. The situations are there, but are not used to any advantage.

I can not comprehend how it's been so successful, with Independent films you do have to accept that the finished product may not look as polished as a Hollywood blockbuster, but this is ridiculous; the movie is nothing more then a series of overused phrases spouted out by horrible actors with no emotion to speak of. Watching it once was torture, multiple viewings seem excessive and idiotic, just like this move.It's not even slightly funny, it is pointless, and anyone who truly enjoys this movie must have an IQ of 3. It is unimaginative, boring, and is a waste of an hour and a half of your life. If anyone is considering spending money to watch this, save the cash, for the same effect stab yourself in the eye and then bang your head on the wall for an hour. This movie grossing over $40 million in the USA alone is just an example of how easily Americans today are entertained. It is amazing I even managed to stay awake throughout the whole movie. It is boring, shallow and brain dead, watching it is a serious threat to your intelligence.The movie starts with four minutes of credits with food, not inspired or funny, or even enjoyable, and unbelievably the credits are the best part. The whole movie is filled with unbelievable occurrences, even for a comedy, the movie requires you to lower your intelligencer to the level lower then that of a dog's.",Napoleon Dynamite
1210,hoopz10588,Sadly addictive....,7,6 February 2005,"Seriously, the movie sucks. Even those who quote it nonstop have to admit it. Apparently, the plot was a nerdy high school outcast helps his odd Hispanic friend become president of their high school. That's news to me. I thought the plot was nerdy high school outcast has a weird family, and his life at school isn't much better. Finally, the oddball makes a friend! Anyway, I saw the movie in theaters and laughed out of the utter stupidity of the jokes and scenarios. As far as the movie itself is concerned, it looks like it was shot with an antique video camera and spent as little money as possible on actors. The older Duff sister was in it as the stereotypical ""high school snot"" and it was a role that her younger sister definitely wouldn't take! Diedrich Bader from the Drew Carey Show was the only actor anyone had seen before, and his part was ridiculous. Rex Kwan Doe and his huge body builder wife. And than you get the nerdy brother Kip and that odd Uncle Rico who start becoming businessmen from hell, going door to door selling Tupperware before moving on to breast enlargements. All of the above comments are negative, obviously. The truth is, the movie is sadly addictive! I find myself rewinding numerous times because I can't believe I just witnessed something so stupid and funny. The directors of this movie are geniuses!

I admit there are SOME parts that aren't extremely awful, but most of the movie wouldn't even deserve a 2! I advise any lovers of comedy movies that are thinking about seeing this movie to see some other movie, chances are that is it at least 5 times more funny than Napoleon Dynamite, no matter what movie it is. 1: The same lines are used over and over again, they get really old really fast. 2: This movie ruined Jon Heder's career, he will never get out of this role, every time someone sees him in a movie, they be like, ""Hey, thats Napoleon Dynamite!"" 3:Waste of Money! This movie wasted and hour or so of my time in the theater, and wouldn't watch it again unless i was bound and gagged in a dark room with it playing in front of me!

Someone wrote that the whole cast and crew must have been on Prozac, I fully agree, but that is what makes the film excellent! It's so bizarre, ""your mum goes to college""! what? lol! The whole LaFawnduh (lol even the name cracks me up!) and Kip relationship is so funny, and Napoleon slapping his brother before he leaves...brilliant! The characters are all so stereotypical it's untrue, I definitely recognise most of them! And Napoleon's dancing! The guy is a legend! Watched it last night and it still cracks me up... I would rank it in the same league as Spy hard, Naked gun, etc, it's that kind of humour. Just thought I'd stand up for the film since nobody seems to have liked it!!

They have a movie night for some of our teams showing that movie to raise money for the school. One time someone asked our English teacher what he's going to teach, our teacher said 'Whatever I feel like, GOSH!' Even a guy at our school dressed up as him with a 'Vote for Pedro' shirt on.

It is definitely worth your time and money. But, also keep in mind that this is a breakout film from an up-and-coming director. So if your expecting something along the lines of ""Titanic,"" then this isn't a film for you. It is what a breakout film should be-simple with a clever script. And let's not forget that this is show business. Yes, film is an art. I know, I am a TV/Film student myself. But it is all about the bottom line. It is about marketing your product and making money. This is why I think this film was brilliant. Its a low budget film that's making money. I am not talking box office sales. I am talking DVD sales, foreign markets, and other products. Have you seen stores like Hot Topic? People are going crazy over Napoleon Dynamite memorabilia. That is where the money is. Don't get me wrong. I also loved this film for the art that it was. It was just plain funny. I put it in the same category as the movie ""Office Space."" If you like that movie, you'll probably like this one. They're both simple, low-budget comedies.

1216,coral-lashea,A film where you will consider the Lama's life more interesting.,4,6 November 2013,"In 2004, Napoleon Dynamite was released. This film had a cast I had never heard of before. Some friends actually recommended me to watch this movie. The whole plot of the movie is for some nerdy guy to help his friend, he just met, win an election for the school. The friend is a Mexican who no one will be friends with except Napoleon. This film is in the category of comedy which I kind of see. The reason I say that is the film is so stupid it makes you laugh. In a way it kind of makes me feel bad for laughing. It's a socially beyond awkward kid and a Mexican riding bikes to school. The two boys actually are not even friends. They mostly stand close to each other in the halls in silence. This movie seems like it was trying to go for a high school experience but failed, miserably. I have never in my life seen a friend with a pet lama that gets fed slop everyday after school. Of course he has a crush and she gets stolen by Pedro, his Mexican friend. Instead of getting mad he lets Pedro help him find someone else. Everything Napoleon does in the movie is so lifeless. When the actor does that it makes me not want to watch. I find that this movie has no point to it. For example Batman saves the city, even Horton from Dr. Seuss has a point to his movie. Iam certain I have heard more people complain of how bad this was than how good it was. I think you should at least try to make something funny if it sucks anyways. Overall I am pretty disgusted with this movie. It definitely fits into the category of ""le bad cinema"". Thissummary was a shortened version but nothing was missed. Like I said the film's only point was for Pedro to win an election. The rest of the stuff was just added in junk about a online dating addicted brother and an uncle stuck in his teen years. Honestly when I finished this movie, I felt like I was as ignorant as him. In my opinion,money and time should not be wasted on this kind of entertainment.",Napoleon Dynamite

She and I managed to sit through about four fifths of this film before throwing in the towel and taking it out of the DVD player in pure disgust. This is a TRAVESTY!!!! The actors (irregardless of their REAL potential) were TERRIBLE! The plot was completely irrelevant! To top it all off, every single moment of this film was simply....BORING! I consider myself picky about many things, movies though do not normally apply. For example, I love the ""Ginger Snaps"" series of movies. MOST people consider them ridiculous B movies with a budget (well, sort of) that are stupid and pointless. I read the other viewer remarks on this film and just chuckle. ""Don't go into this expecting a plot or any deep meaning."" If, for nothing else, when I sit down to watch a movie I expect a bloody plot. When you sit down to watch ""Queen of the Damned,"" don't expect it to stick to the books by any real means....THIS is an acceptable comment and form of advice. To watch a film with no plot, horrible acting, no entertainment, and meaninglessness....a normal person would expect a PORNO!

1219,kiers194,Freshly does it...,8,13 February 2005,"Having watched Napoleon Dynamite I think it is fair to say that there are going to be people who don't like it and for a fair few reasons. To begin with, its confusing; characters aren't developed and we are given no contextual background - is it the 70's, 80's. 90's or last week? The character of Napoleon is hard to like, hes obstinate and gawky, he appears to be the geek people dislike without the redeeming qualities. And then there is the story-line which could be described as a poor pastiche of many teen movies that have gone before it; it feels tacked on and it too jumps and jerks leaving the viewer bewildered. One minute we are led to believe the movie is about Napoleon and his brother, the next teenage friendship, then teenage romance and then finally a take on the revenge of the geeks. But its none of these things and all of these things at once. It does deal with all the clichéd teen plots, but in a fresh and novel way. There are no clear definitions of good and bad guy, Napoleon suffers very little in the way of bullying and the Director doesn't beg us to sympathise with him. The romance that is promised between Napoleon and Deb never blossoms, but, instead of suffering because of this the movie attains a place above the clichéd ""teen geek"" movie. Although the movie feels a little like a series of ""skits"" (which is partly taken up by the directors in reference to Napoleons dance), it works because it portrays dull, simple and amusing life. The sort of thing that makes us laugh everyday because it jumps out at us as abnormal. I challenge anyone to keep a straight face at RexKwanDo! The best advice is to watch it with an open-mind, if you expect the new ""American Pie"" you'll be disappointed. If, however, you want a quirky and off-beat, almost Beckettian piece of comedy then this is for you. Jon Heder carries the character superbly and is ably assisted by the likes of Tina Majorino and Aaron Ruell. It won't win many awards and will have Hollywood seething at its sheer audacity to be a commercial success, but I for one think it is one of the most refreshing comedies on the new millennium to date!",Napoleon Dynamite
1220,mindeezhere,So stupid it's funny,10,14 February 2005,"This is one of those movies that's so stupid, you can't help but laugh. Come on, don't tell me you didn't have experiences in high school that you'd rather forget. This is the movie for all of us who weren't the Barbie and Ken's of our high schools. Okay, so maybe we weren't all quite this geeky, but we felt like it. I love that he's got enough self esteem that he doesn't see the depth of his awkwardness. Made me laugh like the old Pink Panther movies did. This movie has become such sleeper hit that it boggles the mind. I hear teenagers quoting the movie all the time.

1221,joeywillbe,my ideas,9,15 February 2005,"Arriving from within the ever seemingly formulaic genre of the ""quirky"" film, the hero(a Campbellian archetype)Napoleon conquers. This film celebrates the innocence and awkwardness of adolescent growth as a potential, powerful force of character not yet fully manifested while keeping us laughing at the hilarious stereotypes we may all identify with in various chapters of our own lives. Napoleon like Forest Gump share a naivety that lends itself to a certain humility of character which in turn provides the vehicle for their relatively unscathed transport through the selfish ""me"" world, the one full of Heather Wheatleys, Uncle Ricos, and the like. ""From the heart"" Nap advises Pedro whose self doubt has peaked at a time calling for action. This is a timeless message spoken from someone so socially immature that he runs with the awkwardness of a newborn colt yet we clearly see the coming gallop of a burgeoning stallion. The boon returned to the audience is that one's call to action can be accomplished through the purity of love as a motivating force and in turn the revelation of selfless character. Not without their bumps and bruises along the way, our heroes share the testing of their individual ""skill sets"" depicted in the most typical trials of adolescence; getting the girl, peer acceptance, outmaneuvering bullies (with brains, brawn or both)and conquering the generalized fears that accompanies social inexperience. This snapshot in time reveals a part of Nap's life journey that will eventually prove to be its most clumsy yet laughable period.",Napoleon Dynamite

Here are some little quirky things that I enjoyed that you should look for: Watch for: Napoleon's little ""cool"" head jerk as he walks onto the bus. The bus kid's expression when Napoleon bites his head off. Napoleon's body movements as the action figure is dragging behind the bus. When Napoleon gives his current event about Nessie, watch his expression when the other students chuckle. Not to mention that it appears as though he has his eyes closed throughout the entire presentation. A popular scene is when he calls home from school. To me the humor is not in what he says but when he first asks to use the phone. As he stretches the phone cord to get privacy, he looks back at the nurse/receptionist twice as if he had something so important to discuss and he didn't want her to hear...almost a look of contempt but more a look of ""geeky neurosis."" The scene where he is checking out Pedro's bike: after Napoleon utters the word ""Lucky"" watch the Mexican Flag attached to the bike flutter briefly in the wind. Pay even closer attention to Uncle Rico's expression when he reminisces about playing football back in the day and what he could have been. It's such a pained and pathetic look....obviously executed by a great actor. Also enjoy the scream when Napoleon hits Rico's van with the orange. There are so many details that could be discussed. With this movie, you have to watch it a few times and try and remember that one kid in high school or perhaps even remember yourself back in the day to get the full meaning. If you must have a plot it could be: A socially misfit boy making his way through home life and school life and finding a couple of friends along the way. The music is perfect. If you want a more complete list of the quirky things that I find make the movie so funny, feel free to email me. ""Vote for Pedro!""",Napoleon Dynamite
1224,mrfuzziwig,Funnier the day after,7,18 February 2005,Sometimes the mark of a good comedy is not how much you laugh during the film but how much fun you have the next day with other people going over the scenes and throwing out lines. Napoleon Dynamite is a classic example of this. I was mildly amused while watching this movie but laughing hysterically when my friend and I were talking about it and trading lines. If you have someone with a good sense of humor to talk with about this film then I would recommend watching it. Also be sure to watch the deleted scenes on the DVD. As is usually the case they are some of the funniest scenes in the movie. Watch these scenes with and without the commentary.,Napoleon Dynamite
1225,CBAVOUS,An Incredible movie,9,18 February 2005,"This movie is one of the smartest movies that I have seen. The writing is great, the acting is great and the chemistry among the actors is wonderful. This movie is not a high budget film, just a short film that turned out to be so much more. It is refreshing to see a movie without any profanities or sex that is so frickin funny. This movie is a cult classic, you either love it or you hate it. And I am definitely a lover. If you like great 1 liners, you will love this movie, because ever since I have seen this, my friends and I cannot stop quoting it. Not only is the writing great, but Napoleon has some of the best costumes I have ever seen. They are sweet. Any one who can appreciate this movie and understand the humor is Lucky!!!! Make sure you stay until after the credits for a little bonus!!!!!!",Napoleon Dynamite
1226,mbh0429,We liked it a lot,7,21 February 2005,"The reason we like the show is because it is down-to-earth. We liked all the actors. There was no foul language. We liked Kip's song at the wedding. Lafawnduh wasn't indecently exposed. The grandmother played her part well. Uncle Rico did his part well, especially for being vegetarian. Deborah did her part well. We liked having the alpaca in the movie, and the idea that the grandma cooked meat casseroles for it even though it's a vegetarian. Napoleon looked good in his suit. We liked how he got indignant with Uncle Rico. We loved how Pedro's cousins car went up and down, especially for Tricia's parents. We enjoyed how Uncle Rico got an attitude adjustment by Rex, as well as how Pedro's cousins happened to come by when Pedro was being bullied at the bicycle stand. Lyle was something else. The music seemed to fit just right. We appreciate the newlyweds riding away on a honeymoon stallion and that Uncle Rico caught the garter. We mostly liked how Pedro had a friend do something at a moment when things looked dismal for him. If someone has a moment, I would like to know the make, model, and year of Pedro's cousins' car. Some people might find Napoleon's solo dance great for the most part but containing a few suggestive movements.",Napoleon Dynamite
1227,doktordave,Napoleon Dynamite - Wild lives of the Mildest!,10,21 February 2005,"A classic! Not for everyone, but if you want to see where the new millennia's answer to the Cohen Brothers might come from, this is a film to see! There are small laughs, uncomfortable laughs,and if you are patient - some huge belly laughs to be enjoyed here! Warning: If you are not yet beyond those awkward teen years, you may find this movie harder to smile at - It's not a typical teen comedy and could likely hit a little too close to home with many who are still working on feeling comfortable with their own teen memories. Generally this movie takes the very ordinary and somehow makes it surreal and slightly exotic at the same time. I won't give away the scenes, but stick around for the tack-on ending that appears after the credits begin to roll. It alone was worth adding an extra 2 stars to my review! I feel sorry for anybody who walked out or switched off at the first line of credits, you possibly missed the best part! We've generally all met people who could of fit in here as an offbeat character in this film. Very rarely though, in film or in real life will you see some many of these characters in one place! I've read a few negative reviews of this movie and I think I know why people either love it or hate it. There is a germ or realism in each of these characters that despite their collective sea of insanity, reminds the older of us of the awkwardness of youth in the geek world. If you can get past that, you can savor the bizarre situations and responses. If it is too real for you, or bears little resemblance to any of your own memories, then you may just fail to connect with the people who could easily be from another world.Those who have grown past that awkward phase in their lives, or who simply knew people like Napoleon or Deb can see past the loud, annoying or embarrassing characters and appreciate the fire that drives these people just below the surface...(even if they haven't got a sweet clue as to how to channel it constructively.)All of these characters are grabbing life and giving it all they've got even if they don't appear to have much that anyone else would envy. This film has characters every bit as well written as many in the Cohen Brothers's films. (Raising Arizona or Brother Where Art Thou, but with an oddness that we may all have seen or felt as ordinary kids.) I loved the acting in places, but it took a lot of getting used to the idea that some of the comedy came solely from a lack of reaction. The deadpan here goes beyond deadpan and the loud inappropriate responses seem all the louder because these actors make the characters real. It's the sort of movie that you watch and wait for a direction to take shape...and, if you are patient, and can just enjoy the characters, you are rewarded in the second half of the story! It's because you feel closer to characters, who through their own shyness or strangeness, would be hard to identify with normally. Though these people do things that we might find sad, pathetic or desperate - it is the quiet desperation and willingness to live their lives by their own rules that makes these characters so entertaining rather than pathetic. Totally original, hilarious but admittedly, not for those seeking a more familiar type of comedy.",Napoleon Dynamite
1228,Dixiedahling,Why rent when you can buy this movie?,10,21 February 2005,"Those who are children of the 1970s will especially appreciate the subtle nuances this film has to offer. For once in my life having been president of the nerd-herd paid off big-time with laughs aplenty in this movie. I mean even the ""cool"" kids depicted are nerds! To paraphrase Seinfeld fans, this is a movie about nothing, but, yet, about everything.Be warned, though, this movie suffers from Lays-potato-chips-syndrome. In other words, you can't watch this movie only once. You will, rather, you must watch it again and again. And each time you will laugh harder than the time before.My suggestion is to run not walk to the nearest store and BUY this movie. Your friends and family will thank you! Needless to say, Napolean Dynamite is by far my favorite movie of 2004. K' Bye!",Napoleon Dynamite
1229,brian-826,A great family movie,9,21 February 2005,"Okay, I read the reviews. But listen...we watched this movie as a family and thought it was hilarious. We all got it. Even my 6 year old was cracking up. This movie isn't supposed to have a plot, it is just comedy. The characters are VERY funny, the paused looks on their faces every time a scene starts, is classic. If it wasn't enough, then it had to be the uncle throwing the steak, or the phone call asking for the chap stick. Even though we only saw it once, we have recited lines from the movie for over a week. I recommend this to any family who just wants a good laugh without any language or sexual overtones. A must see! GOSH.....YOU'RE SUCH AN IDIOT!",Napoleon Dynamite
1230,hbrann,Napoleon Dynamite is Amazing!!,10,22 February 2005,"I saw Napoleon for the first time last weekend and I thought the movie was amazing! The actors use of subtle humor is very good. In my opinion, the use of this type of subtle humor is not easy to pull off and yet all the characters were very consistent and believable. I felt that the actors in this movie, especially, Napoleon, Kip and Pedro did a great job of capturing their characters. For a movie that looked very basic in the filming, it has accomplished great things. Everything from the film location to the music, right down to what the actors wore was just great! Congrats guys! I thought it was a excellent job! Very funny! Heather",Napoleon Dynamite

My boyfriend and I had heard so much about it that we just went and bought it without ever watching it first. For the first week that we had it, we watched it every day, now we watch it about every other day. It is very simple but in its simplicity it is hilarious. My friends and I constantly act out parts that we have seen in the movie or make references to it all the time. I also listened to the commentaries while watching the movie and its great to know that some of the events are actually based on things that happened in real life to the creators of the movie. I recommend everyone watching this movie at least once. I have never seen a better movie and I love Jon Heder!",Napoleon Dynamite
1233,erin-159,From a small town?,9,23 February 2005,"I am and this film was HILARIOUS to me. So many truths. Friends and I discussed how the director must have followed us around in high school while taking notes. Things others thought were stupid were exactly what we did (specifically two-wheel/eight-wheel towing combinations). My boyfriend thought this was rather asinine but he is from NYC so he was surrounded by culture and did not have to make it up. Although parts were unbelievable, the characters were weirdly enjoyable and the setting was frighteningly similar to the one I grew up in. I would recommend to any poor rural sap who grew up in the era of FFA and ""hydrolics"" on cars.",Napoleon Dynamite
1234,anonymous_davis,Great movie!,8,23 February 2005,"A fun and silly movie that you just can't get out of your head. Napoleon Dynamite is NOT your regular Friday night movie. It's different from anything you've seen lately. Take a trip back to 1995, and then dress like you're in 1985. Also, lots of flippin' cool quotes! Vote for Pedro! Tangofetish! Tots! These guys are hilarious--this is one of those movies that you can't think too hard about, though. Don't see it if you need a plot to keep you entertained. Otherwise, go see it NOW! Just sit back with some tater tots and enjoy! There are no curse words, so it's pretty family-friendly. For some, the lack of a plot and Napoleon's constant ""Gosh!"" may get on your nerves. But for most, this is just a fun, funny movie worth the price of a rental.",Napoleon Dynamite
1235,SONYAALT,This is the best dang movie I have seen in a long time!,10,24 February 2005,"Kudos to Jared Hess, Jon Heder, and the whole cast of Napoleon Dynamite! I laughed through the whole movie. I live in Idaho, and I especially love the scenic backgrounds that display this wonderful state! I truly believe that this movie is one of the best I have seen in my lifetime!! This movie reminded me of the super times I had in High School, even though I graduated in 89'. The soundtrack was also sweet!!!, love the ""When in Rome"" song, ""I will"". That was a big favorite in the '80s! Can't wait to see more of all of your work!!!!!!!!!!Sonya",Napoleon Dynamite
1236,rucabadfish5446,Flippin' Awesome!,8,25 February 2005,"I realize that this film is not at all mainstream, but if you have a love for 80's culture and a quirky sense of humor like me, only then can you fully appreciate the craziness of Napoleon Dynamite. The humor is EXTREMELY dry and subtle, but it's there in blazing color. Watch it again, you'll change your mind. Napoleon is such an incredible dork with a heart of gold, how can anyone resist his charm. Everyone that's been in high school can appreciate a character like him. You know the one, that doesn't realize how uncool they are? You gotta love the cool geeks. The only drawback to this movie, if you can call it a drawback, is that Napoleon, his family, his home, and his friends are all circa 1980's, but the rest of the surrounding world, including LaFawnduh, were more modern characters. I saw a comment that called the wedding scene racist, I though it was anything but. As off the wall as it may be, I still recommend this as a nonsensical good time.",Napoleon Dynamite
1237,mareeah32,A great film to be appreciated,10,26 February 2005,"I found this movie hysterical in the sense one viewer wrote; not the knee slapping comedy of every day. These writers are geniuses. Maybe it's just my weird sense of humor that can appreciate the little details of the hilarity of this movie. It's an original. If you grew up during the trapper keeper era, you appreciate the little details more. And who's high school DIDN't have a Napolean or a Pedro? Tons. Everyone has an opinion, which I respect. But, for those people who found the movie 'stupid', I feel sorry for them; assuming they don't 'get' the humor. Either you either love it or hate it, no in between. Thanks for finally putting out an original idea. It also has a great message about friendship, geeks and those who judge them who are forced to change their minds. That's the more 'make sense' perspective. I say BRAVO!!!!!A+. To me, it possesses that Quentin Tarantino type originality , creativity and hidden comedy. Loved it. Picks me up out of crummy mood too. I just pop in the DVD and speak the upcoming line, laughing and rewinding ......good times.",Napoleon Dynamite
1238,hutch_138,Simply Terrible,1,30 August 2005,"This is by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I actually felt my IQ drop as I watched it. I watched it because I had heard it was funny, but it could hardly manage to get me to crack a smile, let alone make me laugh out loud. Thhe jokes were probably stupidest I have seen in any movie ever. I see people quote phrases from it constantly, but they aren't even remotely funny even in the context of the movie. I wish I could say the acting made it worth watching, but the acting was the quality of bad porn at best. Even the characters that weren't suppose to be losers were horrid.

I am now officially considering this the biggest movie watching mistake of my life. The whole movie comes off like a series of 30 second scenes that have nothing to do with each other. I'm shocked that it's gotten as many stars as it has. 30 minutes into the movie we were questioning whether we wanted to keep watching. We watched all the way to the bitter end simply out of morbid curiosity. We thought that *somewhere* along the way that something funny would happen. Nope, it never did.This is coming from someone who loved Six-String Samurai so I do like the occasional ""pointless"" independent movie. This just had nothing going for it.",Napoleon Dynamite

The whole story was funny and it was so true about teenagers and how they go through life. If this movie was more made public when it was coming out they would have made a lot more money then they really did i loved the movie and would encourage everyone to buy it cause i watch it every day and it is awesome. This let me and my friends have fun and have some new lines to use when we are talking to each other it is just a great movie and it is a family movie it shows that u can make a movie with out having all this vulgar language and just have comedy it is just an amazing movie.,Napoleon Dynamite
1243,popcorn111,Why I liked this AWESOME movie,9,28 February 2005,"Yes, in the beginning of Napoleon Dynamite everyone thought... wow this is really the stupidest movie i'v ever seen. Even so, many of us watched to the end and realized how good of a movie it really is. The reason most people i've talked to liked it is because there probably is some kid in Idaho really just like Napoleon. A boring life, living with his brother and Gramma. Sad yes, but true. Everyone loves this movie. My English teacher who's in her 60's loved it, my parents both loved it, and all of my friends and i loved it. So even if you think you're not going to last the whole movie, hang in there. You'll realize what a good movie it really was in the end. And just a tip, don't watch it alone. Its more fun with like a group of people. I'm pretty sure you'll be reciting your favorite lines from Napoleon Dynamite for at least the next week.",Napoleon Dynamite

Reminds me of my brother so much. The location looks like it was filmed in California, not Idaho, not that I've ever been to Idaho. Classic! I recommend it to all my peers. If you don't get it, too bad, your missing out on incredible dry humor. It's a story of hope and strength of the human spirit to overcome adversity. Could be anywhere, anyone.",Napoleon Dynamite

Napoleon has to remind you of someone you went to high school with. When i watched the commentary i was amazed that the director was still in high school in the late 90's! The movie has a real 80's retro feel. This movie will definitely end up being a cult classic. Maybe it ranks along the genre of Rocky Horror Picture show? You'll want to watch this movie over and over again! Even my 70 year old mother in law was drawn into the movie and was laughing so hard her stomach hurt. I gotta say Uncle Ricco rocks! I love his dialect.,Napoleon Dynamite
1248,daledurnell,Worst Movie I've Ever Seen - Positively Pointless,1,1 July 2005,"This review contains *NO* spoilers -- there is nothing to spoil!I just saw this ""film"" (there has to be a better word) at a high school youth camp. The staff got the film for entertainment at an evening activity they called ""dive-in movie). I'm also told that there is a ""cult"" following among young people, but they were more interested in swimming or playing volleyball than this pathetic offering.By half way through the movie, I wanted to find a sharp stick to put in my eye -- anticipating that such an act would have to be more fun than this film.In college, I took an advanced humanities course on foreign films -- the worst I ever saw were overexposed, and contained untalented actors portraying unintelligible roles -- the best I ever saw were at least on a par with the best from Hollywood within the past five years. Additionally, each of them (from the worst to the best) was superior to this meaningless effort, which is fraught with atrocious acting and plagued with poorly filmed scenes. This was like Tommy gets the home camera and films some stuff in and around the neighborhood, and then peddles his work to a studio that actually buys it.The authors of the work were obviously bored when they wrote the screen play -- else, why would anyone bother to develop something so inane? I've been led to believe the work was originally written as a joke (but apparently, someone took their job too seriously). I'm also told that MTV thought this was a wonderful work and then agreed to produce and release it (I cannot prove these assertions, so I stand to be corrected). On the other hand, considering some of the tasteless products that have come out MTV, this would not surprise me either.The actors (is that what we should even call them -- how about ""would be"" or ""wanna be"" players) could not act their way out of a paper sack. The dialog is amateurish at best, and with no socially redeeming value at the other end of the spectrum. On the other hand, I would argue that these players should have been doubly compensated for having to subject themselves and their careers to having this piece of garbage in their repertoire. There is no perceivable plot to the film except boredom and senselessness personified. IMDb lists the genre as ""comedy"" which should imply that the film would elicit laughter or at least a chuckle. Sorry, try as I could, there was no laughing or chuckling from this viewer.I knew that when I got home from camp, I would have to remember the name of this movie so I could assure myself I would not spend any money to buy, rent, or view this again.",Napoleon Dynamite

Me thinks has the potential to be the next generation movie. I'm 31...my son is 12...He loves it. we both go around citing...""gosh"" ""It was a freak in 12 Gage..what do you think?"" ""you ever take it off any sweet jumps?"" "" I like your sleeves"" lol to funny. kudos.

It might end up as some kind of ""cult classic"" though. You also need to have gotten well past your teen angst years and it would help if you went to high school in the 80's.I finally saw this movie because of all the hype it got. I was sick of people doing movie quotes to me while I was oblivious to the jokes. I found the movie very stupid at first, but then I started to enjoy the humor. I now find myself quoting lines from the movie- Gosh!I would like to see more ""Napoleon"" movies in the future. This was an independent film and I think they did pretty well considering the constraints. Napoleon Dynamite offers a unique sense of humor that some people may not enjoy.

Each character is played with a sublime honesty that forces you to question your own idea of whether someone could actually be that innocently moronic, and yet the characters win out.The direction, script, music, design and location all help to push the film forward and create a whole ""retarded"" world.

There was no story, no interesting characters and certainly nothing on the lines of great cinematic skills on display. I cannot see how this movie was in any way humorous or even worth spending time or money on.If this was supposed to be a portrayal of typical American High School culture ( it is the only plausible explanation behind making such a movie that I could come up with ) it is either an awful portrayal or there is something really wrong with American culture.Such movies are a pure disgrace for any film industry; to think I wasted an hour and a half hours watching it....I feel angry ....

I've watched it over and over now, and you can't believe how many times I find myself quoting Napoleon every day. ""Gosh"" ""Lucky!"" ""Idiots!"" (long heavy sigh).I know Napoleons. I am Napoleon sometimes. My son is Napoleon...almost all the time. If you don't like it, you don't get it. And no one can convince you that its funny unless you get it. If you must have over-the-top slapstick, you may be a little bored. If you're so analytical that it has to be 110% real life , you might be disillusioned.

Napoleon's underestimated confidence and sparky attitude is sure to keep you laughing throughout the entire movie. Set in the 80s, Napoleon is left alone by his grandmother and has to deal with his steak loving vegetarian - Uncle Rico and lazy older brother. Pedro helps Napoleon to win the heart of a couple high school babes while running for school president. If you just want a good laugh, watch this movie.",Napoleon Dynamite
1255,zadmando,"Tina, eat your ham.",9,12 March 2005,"I saw a free preview of this film and had no expectations. The lights went down and I laughed. And my wife laughed. And everyone around me laughed. Then we left and they gave us stuff. I thought it was the funniest film I had seen in a long time.I started to recommend Napoleon Dynamite to everyone. Those that saw it in the theater thanked me. Then, it came out on DVD. Again, I recommended it. But, something happened. No longer were people thanking me. They were questioning my taste. Family, friends, pets, and the like. ""So boring"" ""lame"" ""woof"". What the hey? The problem: The DVD watcher saw the film alone, or with maybe one other person. Wrong! The mob mentality helps you laugh at people you know you shouldn't. There. It's out. This is a GROUP movie. You can't watch it alone and laugh at Napoleon Dynamite and his family. That would be cruel. You know that. They are less fortunate than you. Less ""cool"" real ""Melvin."" But, get ye to a crowded theater and watch the giggles ensue! It is easy to be mean in a crowd of folks who are also bastards. So get going! OK. So, maybe I'm full of bok choy. I don't know what people hated about this film. Maybe they're just stupid. Remember this, Napoleon Dynamite does not think he is pathetic. He's got skills. He knows the ""score."" He is happy being him. So don't feel bad for our hero. No. Laugh at him. Laugh long and hard. And if you walk away from this film feeling even the tiniest of bonds with the boy, then you are a bigger loser than I've heard.",Napoleon Dynamite
1256,cee7243,A Very Serious Movie,10,13 March 2005,"I love Napoleon Dynamite. Notice the use of present tense? I've watched the DVD 5 times so far. The first time had me with mouth open because it was so not Hollywood. I just could not believe I had remained so attentive the entire time. The characters are really believable. The actors are so not glamorous ... they seem like barely average people. I really love the director's scene transitions too ... even the unexpected ones ... like, when Napoleon is showing the new kid Pedro about the lockers and Napoleon asks Pedro what kind of bike he has and there they are at the bike stand as Pedro tells him ""it's a Sledgehammer."" This is followed by similar transition to the ""sweet jumps"" in front of Pedro's house. The scene tie-ins are good too ... when Grandma says they're getting low on steaks and that Lyle will take care of it tomorrow, we soon see Lyle, with a shotgun, standing in front of a cow. The arriving school bus blocks the action but the children on the bus verify it and then we're in class with the Happy Hands Club. Everything works together so nicely. Simply a truly lovable film. Gosh, yes!",Napoleon Dynamite
1257,muthafxuxcxka,This movie definitely hits my top 10,8,13 March 2005,"Personally, I enjoyed the movie. Napoleon had a dry sense of humor that only the audience could recognize. I loved his nerdy personality and the pathetic plot line. The movie was so incredibly stupid, it was hilarious. As I can see, not all others agree with me. I am a teenager myself and don't appreciate the categorization that you have made.""Yes, I agree it was a poor movie with poorly developed characters and a pointless story. Most people who like and support this film are teenagers who think it is ""cool"" to like it, so they say it is good regardless of how they really feel."" Not all teenagers think that. How can you possibly make an assumption like that when you don't even know all of the people who like it? Yes, you are entitled to you're opinion- but why don't you just stick to that instead of making an assumption of what the majority of teenagers think? I liked it, because I enjoyed it. Not because everyone else does. You are simply being ignorant and contradicting. Read your posts- stick to the same opinions. ;)",Napoleon Dynamite
1258,skateguy0,Napoleon Dynamite: Unlike Many,10,14 March 2005,"Napoleon Dynamite was an excellent movie, in my opinion. I don't think that it was really meant to be funny, or seen as a comedy, but it did a lot of things today's movie's don't. There are a few 80's references and not being entirely from the 80's, I understand them perfectly. In Napoleon's world, no one thinks of him as weird or different because the whole city is that way. To us he is. Pedro is just a kid who wants to have fun and be known in school, and Deb is just a kind person. So, yes, this movie is great. I recommend that everyone watch it at least twice (as you should do with all movies) and if you think it sucks, that's your opinion, if you think it's great, that's also your opinion.",Napoleon Dynamite
1259,lilyflagg,Your elders may find it funny...,10,14 March 2005,"Though I'm ancient (46), I loved the odd style of humor in ND. I think it's great when screenwriters/directors don't think that you need every little thing to be explained and they allow it to be mysteriously weird. It's an incentive to watch the special features - see if you can learn a little more about the reasons behind their choices, such as ""why did the students use such odd ways of asking each other to the dance?"" or ""Why were there so many flies?"" I thought that the casting was fantastic; all of the actors were a lot of fun to watch. The actor who played Uncle Rico was particularly funny. I'd recommend ND to anyone who is not too hung up on traditional movie styles and would enjoy some laughs.",Napoleon Dynamite
1260,Deadpool31,Not as good as I thought it would be.,5,19 June 2005,"I had no clue what or who Napoleon Dynamite was, I had heard from friends what a great film it was and then Radio one continued the hype, but they did warn that it was heavy going in the middle.I still had no clue what it was about, but my curiosity had been piqued, so on a trip to the Video shop for my monthly purchase of DVD's I noticed it on sale for £7.95 so I thought ""what the hell"" and picked it up along with Team America.I learned that Napoleon was in fact a teenage boy who lived with his Grandma and Brother in Idaho. The film follows this social misfit as he tries to get a date for the dance and gets his friend elected as class president.There were bits that did indeed make me smile and chuckle, but on a whole I didn't really let out a belly laugh like I had been told I would. Napoleon I really couldn't feel any empathy towards as I found him dis likable and his brother finding his soul mate and turning all ""gangsta"" could have been foreseen as soon as she stepped off the bus and was revealed to be a big busted black lady.Deb was another character who I assume was meant to warm our hearts, well maybe I'm heartless as I found her as one dimensional as Napoleon and I just couldn't have cared less whether they got together or not.There were however some good parts to the film, Uncle Rico was just enough of a sleaze and a has been to entertain me every time he was on screen, Napoleon and his brother going to Rexkowndo and his brother being abused was a scene in the film where I couldn't help but chuckle to myself and the dancing finale also made me smile.All in all this film wasn't bad, it did entertain me and I didn't find it hard going to understand, Napoleon is the weird kid that sat at the front of the class in every school everywhere, it was this fact that I to had grown up with a kid like Napoleon, that made this film an OK way to spend 82 minutes.More of a plot and a better back story (in fact ANY back story) would have rated this film higher in my eyes, but if your looking for a film where you can switch off your brain and have a giggle then this may well be the film for you.If your expecting a deep and meaningful journey then you will be very disappointed, my advice would be don't believe the hype and judge for yourself, I will be watching it a second time and maybe a third, so I don't feel like my £7.95 was wasted, however had it been on sale at full price my opinion would probably differ.In conclusion rent don't buy unless its on sale and don't expect to much as I did and you may well be entertained.",Napoleon Dynamite
1261,jeff-852,Funniest movie I've seen in a long time,10,16 March 2005,"Odd but amusing...I don't understand the people who say the characters are not realistic - I know far more people like those in this film than in practically any other I've seen. Hmm, maybe that says something about the place where I live.Anyway, Napoleon's monotone delivery and all the other quirks of the characters is half of what makes this so funny. It's kind of surreal, but I think that's because it's so close to reality, at least as I remember it from the late 80's.By the way, Napoleon Dynamite was FAR funnier the second time I watched it.",Napoleon Dynamite
1262,professorjean,Better than 99% of the standard Hollywood fare,9,20 March 2005,"I didn't go see this one deliberately, it snuck up on me while I was bored to death on a transatlantic flight. The in-flight magazine had no info on the feature film, so I had no idea what I was watching, what it was about, nothing. So, no preconceived notions. I LOVED it. It is weird, the way that ""Secondhand Lions"" is weird. And as far as having to have grown up in the 80's to get it, well I didn't and I still loved it. Dunno what somebody was saying about calling people ""retarded"" has to do with dating it. (Now if they had said ""grody to the max"" or something like that....) I actually had a hard time figuring out what time this film was supposed to be set in, and guessed early nineties from the phones they were using and the music played at the dance. Napoloeon looked exactly like a friend of mine in high school in the mid-seventies. The cheerleader bimbos and jerk jocks? Timeless. But what really got me was the nature of the film. I wasn't sure if these were real actors or if somebody just asked a bunch of their friends to make up a story as they were going along. I found the dialog REAL, I mean, that's how kids talk to each other. It seemed like half of the actors were underacting (like Napoloeon and Pedro), about the way grade-schoolers ""act"" in a school play, while the other half (especially Rico) were overacting). I thought it was great and I would recommend it to anyone age 20-60. Hey, after sitting through the ""Passion of the Christ"" (I can't believe we paid good $$ to rent that lousy overrated movie) I would gladly go out and rent this one to see it a third time.",Napoleon Dynamite
1263,shorsham,This film is like marmite - You either love it or you hate it,9,13 September 2005,"I'm English and I know a fairly small hand full of people who've actually seen this film. It was recommended to me by my mum and her boyfriend and I watched it with out actually knowing anything about it, which in itself, is unusual because I tend to look things up on here before watching them.Anyway I loved it - the humour was drier than Ghandi's flip flop and I loved the costumes, the setting, the pace pretty much everything.I thought it was a very conflicted sort of film. It was subtle at the same time as being bold, totally dark in some ways and really sort of light in others and it was both subversive and oddly familiar. It was a story we've seen a thousand times told/made in such a way that it was different to anything I've seen before. I loved the pace as well because for me although the actual action if you like was quite slow it seemed to be finished really quickly.Not everyone will get it/like it but I recommend seeing it and making up your own mind - it's like Marmite I think. You either love it or hate it.",Napoleon Dynamite

The only good thing about the whole movie was the dance scene, and it too was pretty corky. The only funny thing in the whole movie was the moon boots the main character wore while dancing. The brother couldn't have been more bland and boring. I have seen a lot of movies, but this one takes the cake in putting you to sleep. With the high ratings, I expected something pretty spectacular.

It had so many great points and it was really funny at the same time! So, what's wrong with that? Who can criticizer this movie with no profanity and nothing close to being unnecessarily stupid or inappropriate, when there are so many movies that actually are pointless and have all that crap that no one wants their kids watching?! For example, Napoleon was a complete loser, but he stayed true to himself and followed his heart and, in the words of Pedro Sanchez, ""made all his wildest dreams come true"". I think that's a pretty good point. So, try and consider these points and think about it before you call a movie stupid and pointless.",Napoleon Dynamite

Although the movie has little plot, lots of scenery and some funky actors, it's a taste thing. Just as Napoleon sees fit to carry tots in his pocket, some prefer a movie with a little more substance.The film is, however, enjoyable. With some quite memorable lines (which have been repeated time and again) and an awesome dance sequence, it's got a few notable high points. The movie is a bit slow, though, and at times, quite boring (at least in this writer's opinion).No matter what, it's worth seeing. Considering much of today's cinema is, well, the same story with different actors, this movie chooses to break away from that and tell a different tale...",Napoleon Dynamite

BUT, the more you watch it, the funnier it gets because you start to notice things that you didn't notice before. There are several little jokes that you get if you grew up in the 80's. I especially loved this movie because there are no sexual innuendos, no curse words, and there is nothing that I wouldn't want my nieces and nephews to see.The costuming was perfect right down to the ""moon boots"" and puffy sleeves of the prom dresses. AND the plastic braided key chains?!? Oh my gosh! We TOTALLY made those when we were kids! This movie is a complete flash back to my childhood in the 80's!""VOTE FOR PEDRO!""",Napoleon Dynamite

I recommend watching it with friends.This movie is great because a lot of teenagers can relate to it in that Napolean is kind of a nerd who is trying to help a friend and getting laughed at because of it. I related to Napolean in that I fight with my sister a lot just like Naplolean does with Kip. Uncle Rico is a typical weird uncle. He is convinced that ""if coach put me in 4th quarter we would have won the championship no doubt."" I think that is HILARIOUS! I love it when Uncle Rico throws the steak at Napolean. My Favorite characters are, of course, Napolean, Deb, Pedro, and LaFawnduh. Another way teens can relate to Napolean is that he has to deal with a major prep (Summer) and EVERYONE has to deal with that at least once in their life.",Napoleon Dynamite

I wanted to see just what was so special about this movie. Best I can say after watching the whole thing is....Huh? This movie seems to be one of those ""If you don't like it, you are just too un-cool"". Hence, all the kids at school are jumping on the bandwagon since they want to be cool for seeing ND. I wish all of the praisers of this film would quit making it out to be something it isn't. There is NO deeper meaning or abstract message to be gleaned from it.This has to be probably THE stupidest movie I have ever seen! I am even more troubled that my kids and their friends like it. It is completely void of ANY redeeming qualities. Brainless dialog, disgusting food and bizarre situations abound. I kept waiting for the ""funny part"". It never came.Unless you're on serious drugs or your brain is comatose or extremely unexercised, I recommend you NOT waste your time or money on this MTV hyped film.",Napoleon Dynamite

I usually don't go around marking fun of movies but with this one i had an uncontrollable rage to go out and destroy it's ""good"" reputation Don't go to see Napolean Dynamite unless you have nothing to do and need something to hate. believe me you'll regret watching it i said to myself the whole movie ""When will this get funny?"" it never did I'm sorry but this movie is 4 no one so don't waste your time-Bob the dancing Panda-",Napoleon Dynamite

My kids 8 and 13 absolutely loved this film and it reminded me of kids I went to school with. It has appealed to a very wide audience, including elementary, middle, and high school students and parents. There doesn't need to be a dramatic storyline for every film made. I mean Seinfeld was a huge success with story lines that were essentially about nothing.We now own Napolean Dynamite and my 13 year old has impersonated Uncle Rico, Kip and Napolean at parties and the school playground - I have personally found this little gem of a film to be a breath of fresh air in an industry full of violence, hate and sex.

It's also refreshing that this film can make you laugh without profanity, heavy innuendo, etc. I agree that not everybody will ""get"" this film, but age may not be that relevant. I'll admit my high school and college-age kids had my expectations high, but I'm 45 years old and I think I probably would have liked it a lot anyway. Think of this film as kind of a two-man ""Revenge of the Nerds"" interspersed with a lot of humor in the Christopher Guest vein (""Best in Show"", ""A Mighty Wind"", Spinal Tap, etc).

1274,chevy-8,Simply: I liked it!!!!,8,2 April 2005,"I am amazed at the huge number of negative comments about Napoleon Dynamite! At this writing it is 78 pages! I am stunned that such a vast number of people have seen this movie and taken the time to register and comment negatively about it. Usually, a bad, or boring movie does not rack up such a huge number of comments on IMDb. And, since the majority of comments are negative, if not all, it makes me wonder: why, have so many commented negatively, BUT, still sat and watched the whole movie to the end?? Was this because Napoleon Dynamite hit a sensitive, and personal memory from the past for each and every one that they just don't want to think about? Or, are all the negative comments written by all the real-life, ""high school popular"", Summer and Don types from Napoleon Dynamite, that just can't relate to the movie?! People wrote that they were bored with this movie, but still watched it in it's entirety? Hmmmm... The first couple of minutes of this movie had me wondering if I would like it, but I thoroughly enjoyed Napoleon Dynamite. I can relate to its characters, since I was the geeky, underdog in school in real life. I can remember being rejected by the popular girls in school when I asked them out. **SPOILERS** Many funny moments are in this movie, and there are subtle hidden moments of hilarity, like the mound of grated cheese on the nachos magically growing by itself while Napoleon is on the phone with Kip... Or, the hilarious, horrible drawing of Trish.... I think we all have been irritated when annoying relatives come to visit and stay, just like Uncle Rico. LaFawnduh is funny and also sweet at the same time as she romances nerdy, Kip. My goodness, a great, feel good movie!! SEE IT!

1275,tragicalmirth,No Deliberate Humor means Good Humor,9,2 April 2005,"Despite its low-budget (or because of it), 'Napoleon Dynamite' has garnered hoards of loyal fans, providing humor with its deliberate lack of it. The movie is refreshing because of the absence of cool special effects and stirring music -- the movie has a loose plot at best, dorky but lovable characters, and is entertaining in that it does not seek to 'wow' its viewers.I found the characters funny because they're so stereotypical. Napoleon is a stereotypical geek and nerd, and his character appeals to viewers because of that. He doesn't try to be cool, but his style ends up being cool. Since the movie's debut, teens all over have picked up Napoleon's lingo. Quips of ""Whatever I feel like doing, GOSH!"", insults of ""freakin' idiot"", assurances that ""ligers"" really do exist, and long, drawn-out ""yessssssses"" with a small arm pump have become very popular.The humor is situational and circumstantial. The characters are not intending to be funny, but most times they are. Fans of the Monty Python might enjoy this one ... maybe. However, if you prefer more ""high class"" movies, 'Napoleon Dynamite' is not for you.",Napoleon Dynamite

Essentially, he said that if you were unpopular in high school then the movie would be funny to you. I tested this theory with several people I know. First, my wife only liked certain scenes in the movie..like Napolean's dance at the end. Overall, my wife thought the movie was stupid and didn't like it (she was popular). Another couple we know also saw the movie..they hated it (both were popular). Finally, a single co-worker loved the movie and he admitted he was not popular (he loved the movie).

The idiot uncle with the football? I know so many idiots like that from high school. The tetherball, the liger, the dance, the Mexicans, Pedro's hair, happy hands, the steaks, the bike and ramp, the koolaid drinking, the DQwon's dance grooves, oh my gosh. If you want to laugh til you cry, this is a movie for you. Anyone who likes really dumb movies like Naked Gun or Airplane, I'm pretty sure you'll love this one.

It really has no point to it, but the jokes can be so funny. Every time I watch it, I always hear or see something that I didn't see or hear before and I think it is even funnier!

1280,RYBERG31-1,why people fall in love with this movie,9,8 April 2005,"napoleon dynamite reminds me of days when i was in junior high. I knew someone just like napoleon, who wasn't popular, liked D&D, and they always had stories to tell, which you knew weren't true, but they wanted to think they were cooler than they really were. All characters in the movie remind you of someone you knew back in the day. The part I think is hilarious is how uncle Rico tries to make a quick buck. We had people on our street in the early 80's who would sell scissors that could cut pennies and tupper-ware stuff, and my mom bought everything they had to sell. This movie portrays the 80's very well, with the trapper keepers, bus rides to school, TV dinners, TATER TOTS and the word flippin'. This was a great film, if you don't like it the 1st time you watch it, watch it again, you will keep coming back to it...I did!",Napoleon Dynamite

To me, this movie tells me that there is someone out there for everyone, that you cant judge a book by its cover, and that it takes all kinds to make this life interesting. All of the one-liners are so funny, too. My 13 yr old son and I use them frequently, and laugh about this movie a lot. (I'm 35) He is a strait A student, and plays sports and I consider him a pretty smart balanced kid who has an awesome sense of humor. If you just don't get this movie, then I think you're either too preoccupied with your problems, or you cant relate to kids or the simple things in life.

ACTORS are all superb and under-rated!It is casual and slow paced but not at all boring, and we were able to think of people we have known who remind us of this character or that one and sometimes even saw a bit of ourselves. We find it sad that it did not get the credit and acclaim it deserves.

1283,Fat_man_x,Underplayed and sublime,9,12 April 2005,"This is the most beautiful, understated and sympathetic movie i have seen for a long time. Truthfully it is completely devoid of a main narrative in which all the characters are involved but this, like Withnail And I or Fear And Loathing in Las Vegas, is a piece about a character and their life, their own unique way of dealing with it and the strange situations that arise. Contrary to other reviews which compare it to South Park and say that it has no message i think this has many beautiful moments and explores many ideas - ideas of family, friendship, identity and growing up in rural America.It is shot beautifully with these strange depictions of the American landscape as this odd, almost alien setting that is full of space - large blue skies, long straight roads and flat open expanses of field. And the script is fantastic. Napoleon himself is a strange, at first quite unlovable character but he really does grow on you, especially when we see how most people treat him! The relationships between him and his older brother, his friends and the more than slightly antagonistic relationship between him and his uncle are insightful and quite accurately portrayed.The acting is brilliant - everybody plays well in this - its hard to say anything more or to criticise or acclaim any one actor because they all perform stunningly, filling the script with depth and that all important feel of space that this film creates.This is not an easy film to get into, it isn't full of action and it isn't a laugh a minute. But it is gorgeous, textured and very lovingly made. If you enjoyed it half as much as me, you will absolutely adore it.",Napoleon Dynamite

This is the general consensus of everyone I know who loves this movie. My friends and my bro's and sis' and I quote the lines all the time. My 25th birthday cake had a liger on it! It's pretty much my favorite movie. I figure John Heder is an excellent dancer in real life, to make Napoleon dance like he does to save Pedro's election. His dance scene was my favorite part in the movie, except when he calls Tina a fat lard. Who thought of putting a llama tied to a fence in the movie? Genius!",Napoleon Dynamite
1285,mcmom-2,Give it a chance,8,13 April 2005,"I have to say, the first time I saw this movie with my 10 year old son, his friend, and my 12 year old daughter, I DIDN""T GET IT. I was annoyed and irritated. It was SO high school. But since then, I have watched it several times and it is a hoot! It becomes more funny, the more times you watch it, especially if you take to QUOTING the movie. I am reminded of many people I went to school with. What a trip down memory lane. Also, I was nervous that there would be something unhappy in the movie when the jock and the popular girl made their appearance, but I was rewarded with a gentle, sweet story with a happy ending. We live in such a jaded world that everyone expects the worst. Great flick! Suggest it to all my friends.",Napoleon Dynamite
1286,AuntSara,"Preston, Idaho 83263",10,16 April 2005,"I had to write and tell everyone that this movie is hilarious. It could be because I actually grew up in Preston, Idaho. For those of you that think people don't really live like this....I hate to burst your bubble. I moved to Seattle, Washington right out of High School because I couldn't wait to get out of that backward town. Now I watch the movie and realize what a great childhood I really did have. Yes, we may be a bit slower than some and don't really know the ways of the world, but I'm proud of the way I was raised. Preston IS still stuck in the 80's, but the good neighbors, friends and sense of community outweigh that!! Of course there was no llama when I lived there so apparently I missed out on that bit of adventure!",Napoleon Dynamite
1287,Bugma789,"Great movie, family friendly, a good laugh",10,17 April 2005,This movie was pretty funny. I really enjoyed some of the hilarious lines the characters had. I recommend this movie to all people who enjoy having a good laugh. This movie is fun for the whole family. Peolpe of all ages can enjoy this in every way. Its about a geeky kid and his life. Kind of a mockumentary of Napolean's life. If you have the chance of seeing this movie then you should definally go for it. Even if you have to go to some out of the way movie rental place in like some abandoned town then its still worth it. It is a movie that you will never forget as long as you live. You should then buy the movie if you can.,Napoleon Dynamite
1288,stevman22889,stupid..but awesome,10,18 April 2005,"I was expecting this form this movie. Truth is Napoleon Dynamite is the stupidest, plot lacking movie that I've ever seen. If you heard someone talk about this movie you would say to yourself oh my gosh this sounds dumb.But under the stupidity there were jokes. They may have been some of the lamest jokes ever, but this is what makes this movie great. Its just so old-fashioned and simplistic. The character roles that a revealing the jokes are genius. It hard to explain why this movie is such a hit. It has no plot line and is not really funny. The thing that the directors did was take lame, worn out jokes and make seemingly retarded characters to say them. I have to say myself, i thought it was hilarious. Behind the lacking plot, i thought Napoleon Dynamite was and enjoyable movie experience.",Napoleon Dynamite
1289,aladybug1978,not sure if everyone saw the same movie,9,19 April 2005,"I don't know if I agree with either the pros or the cons. I neither thought it was one long gag that plays itself out to early, or a movie thats ""just"" funny...with no meaning. I loved this movie for its hilarity but also for its awesome story. Come on, usually Hollywood ends the movie with the nerd winning over the school by becoming a popular kid, changing his style, looks, etc. This ends with the school realizing that the people in charge only have power for as long as we let them. Inside each one of us, like those Preston High kids figure out, is a Little of Napoleon Dynamite. With that said, I'll add that fox searchlight screwed up with that ""extra"" scene. That is definitely over the top or too much or whatever you wish to say, the movie stands much better without it.",Napoleon Dynamite
1290,carissa_ockey,Hooray for Napoleon,10,20 April 2005,"what I loved most about this movie was its complete lack of inappropriate content and swearing! I didn't cringe once. It was hilarious and just so gosh darn clean! Some people may not enjoy the movie claiming that it has no plot, no point. I have to say that it is true... there is little plot but that is part of what is so funny! Others will see the movie and love it! In my city it has inspired a new way of speaking even... replacing foul words with the new, not vulgar ones (gosh, darn, idiot). Overall, if you want some cheap laughs without compromising your standards for raunchy comedies this is a show for you!!",Napoleon Dynamite
1291,wdhimes,Simply Awful,1,21 April 2005,"This movie was so boring and meaningless that I almost feel asleep during it and I wasn't even tired. I kept waiting for something funny to happen and it never did. Did the guy in the field shoot himself or the cow when the kids on the school bus all screamed? I kept trying to look for hidden meanings or dark humor and could not find any. The best part was seeing Kipp in clothing like some rapper homeboy, other than that the movie was a complete waste of my time.If you are on drugs, alcohol or just leave the sound off, maybe it is funny.If I paid anything at the movie theater, I would have been very angry. Got the DVD from the local library and all it cost me was time which would have been better used washing dishes.",Napoleon Dynamite
1292,vivalabamrocks2004,Napoleon Dynamite is flippin' sweet!,10,27 April 2005,"I think Napoleon Dynamite was a very good movie. I think it's one of the funniest movie's I've ever seen in my life. I definitely pick this movie as my favorite movie so far. For those of you that would like to watch the movie, but heard that it's ""horrible"", don't believe the hype. I think you'll be laughing so hard that milk will be squirting out of your nose. It is true that ""Napoleon Dynamite"" has no plot what so ever,but it's very funny. I think the quote from the movie are the funniest. For example, "" Flippin' sweet"". That's a phrase I use everyday, and everyone says, "" Napoleon Dynamite"". They know it's from that movie. No matter if it's, "" Get your own tots!"", or "" Freakin' idiot, gosh!"". Everybody knows where it comes from, and they love it. My dad has a, "" Vote for Pedro"" T- shirt, and wears every chance he can get. He's a 50 year old man, and loves the movie very much. It doesn't matter how old you are or where you come from, but a lot of people I know love this movie as much as I do. For those of you that say this movie is ""horrible"", open your eyes. Live a little. Laugh it up. If you don't like this movie, then you don't have a sense of humor what so ever. I hope there will be a,"" Napoleon Dyunamite 2"". If and when it comes out, my father and I will be the first in line to get in with our tickets.",Napoleon Dynamite
1293,blondie2271,Cracked me UP!,9,21 April 2005,"Everyone that I know that has seen this movie walks around saying the lines. Gosshhh! Yeah it's funny. People have to see it for what it is. A story about a kid that gets picked on and maintains his sense of self and its a story about friendship. I was surprised to see people say it was horrid. I wonder about that persons sense of humor or lack of. Watch it again with an open mind. Yes, in the beginning you feel sorry for him but it gets better and he wins in the end. It's classic on liners, teenage angst, and just overall a good movie. The popularity of it speaks for itself. I see tshirts online that say vote for pedro etc. It's good.",Napoleon Dynamite
1294,phamberg,"Quirky, clean, delightful fun.",10,22 April 2005,"Napoleon Dynamite breaks the mold, at least for movies that have hit the mainstream. Billed as an offbeat MTV inspired comedy, this odd gem looks more like a character study. The movie's lead, Napoleon, is played perfectly, from his nerdy lope and funky 80's era stylings to his dialect that just can't be placed. The opening credits are colorful and creative, and the movie follows this theme both cinematic ally and in mood. There are few characters in the movie, and each one has oddities that might make you laugh hysterically or just tilt your head like a puzzled dog. Either way Napoleon Dynamite will engage you to the end. If you're looking for an evening of clean fun for the entire family, Napoleon Dynamite is the movie for you.",Napoleon Dynamite
1295,talkingsticknow,i liked this movie,10,23 April 2005,"this is a great movie .cult status. if you don't 'get it' then you just do not have a diverse sense of humor! a must see not just once .I loved it. I hope these writers create more movies. these actors were way better than you get in the so called block buster movies.this movie is not all hype, name and advertisement. It is simply real good entertainment, not famous actors promoting their little personalities.the soundtrack is awesome too. listen to 92.3 for more fan moments.this movie is fine entertainment for the whole family.I liked the location, preston, Idaho, it was different to get to see a different part of the country.",Napoleon Dynamite
1296,buttmunch24,utterly horrific,1,23 April 2005,"i hated this movie so much, and i really hate how everybody keeps quoting it and how they love it. when i watched it, i had been told that there was no plot, but i didn't no it wasn't relative to anything, including what was going on in the ""story."" this wasn't funny at all, yet people find it hilarious, and i just don't know why. it has made so much money, and has gotten incredibly famous, and I'm just perplexed as to why this is. whenever i think of this movie, i just get mad. it wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't as famous as it is, and if everyone would just stop quoting it and thinking its funny. if you are a big fan of this movie, i just don't know what to tell you; i just guess you're a fan of nothing.",Napoleon Dynamite
1297,dancervon99,No point to it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,3,24 April 2005,"There is really no point to the movie, if somebody asked you what this movie was about you wouldn't be able to tell them. I think the only reason people watch it is because they are curious about whats in the movie. The only reason anyone would laugh is because it's so stupid! First of all he has a really strange voice, he complains about chap stick and expects everybody to know what he is talking about. Napolean Dinamite is the name of the main character, a high school nerd. His brother is also a nerd but is 32, lives with Napolean and his grandmother, and has an online girl friend that he chats with all day. All these different things happen but they never explain why or what they mean. I did not like it because of these reasons.",Napoleon Dynamite
1298,piraeus72,Napoleon BORINGITE,1,18 July 2005,I watched this movie with two friends who are both in their early thirties and all three of us couldn't stand to watch this movie till the end. It was the most DRY humor I have ever seen in a movie. Totally not my taste. I will say that the three of us have completely different tastes and yet there was not one of us that could stick around till the ending. I really feel like WHO CARES about Napoleon and his dopey friends!! I think I would rather see something as lame as Revenge of the Nerds than this. I have seen all the positive reviews and am in awe as this was one of the reasons why I purchased this movie. To each his own I guess.,Napoleon Dynamite
1299,hhgarfeild,love it,10,24 April 2005,"Napolean Dynimite is awesome. there is absolutely no point in the movie. Which is why it is so awesome. Napolean is so funny and kip, kip is so awesome also, i didn't really like the uncle that much though. Like when Napoleon first got on the bus a kid asked him what he was going to do today and Napoleon is like ""WHATEVER I FEEL LIKE! GOSH!"" ha ha ha i love it. Kip turns to a wigger when he finally meets his online girlfriend and they hang out together for a few days. He's not a really good wigger though. They both live with their grandma and have a 10 ft. phone cord. lol. The uncle is funny too. He makes videos of him throwing a football into mid air with no one there to catch it.",Napoleon Dynamite
1300,jaded_wench,Absolutely boring,3,26 April 2005,"I had heard from a friend of mine that this is the best movie of all time. He had paid to see it 4 times in the theater and reserved a copy to buy it the day it became available on DVD. So it was with much excitement that I went to the video store to rent it the day it came out.Disappointment to the nth degree. I watched it all the way through thinking, it has to get better, it will get better any minute now. Well it never did. I found this movie so incredibly boring. It's not entertaining. It's just dialog between a group of very lame, boring kids who define the word ""nerd"". The only thing good that came out of this movie was the fact that we have new catch phrases we can use...""heck yes"" ""Tina, ya fat lard, eat the FOOD!"" ""you're such a freakin' idiot!"" ""we both know that i'm training to be a cage fighter"", OK these might not be exact quotes, but they are what we usually say. I refrained from giving this movie a vote of 1 only because it is a clean movie and I do appreciate that.If you are curious about this movie that so many people have talked about, wait for dollar day at your local video store. Better yet, borrow a copy from someone else, don't spend your buck.",Napoleon Dynamite
1301,smithm-7,Gorgeous,10,27 April 2005,"I loved this movie. Obviously, it's a character driven movie. But that doesn't mean it doesn't have a plot. The plot is simple but that enables the movie to showcase its bevy of wonderful characters who are all struggling with their uniqueness. I disagree that the movie has no uplifting ending. I thought it was incredibly uplifting as the two of the major players, Napoleon and his brother Kip, found their soul mates. The movie does not exploit nerds, what rubbish. It celebrates their individuality and gives them hope and transformation.The movie provides us with acres of satisfying character analysis. The actor, Jon Heder, who plays Napoleon is so very talented, and inhabits his character beautifully. Instead of portraying his uncle Rico as an flat-out unlikeable rogue/ladies man, the actor and director give us glimpses of a sad man who desperately wants to be transported back to his glory days of 1982.I can see the similarities with Wes Andersen's films, with the attention to detail such as unique songs that are prominently displayed throughout the film, the styling of the characters clothes, the general wackiness of the personalities, and their alienation in society. One striking difference that comes to mind is the characters are so much more polished and affluent in Wes Andersen's films (especially the last three). But so what if the filmmakers are similar? There are plenty of film-makers that share common qualities. Perhaps it's more useful to think of these two directors having a unique viewpoint of themselves and humankind.Only see this film if you have an offbeat sense of humour, can stand to see something different and don't need to watch Hollywood drivel to have a good time.",Napoleon Dynamite
1302,woods_in_a_city,Why did I take time out my life to watch this?,2,28 April 2005,"Before you may think, exactly like I did, ""Oh this looks pretty good, it's made under MTV productions so it must be quite funny"" think again! This film has no point what-so-ever. There is no relevance to it at all. Normally in your regular run of the mill MTV production film there is some kind of goal within the film, in this sadly there isn't. The characters lack definition and any sense of comedic value. I think this film is for all the geeks out there, not trying to sound too harsh, but it really is. ND's whole family are geeks, and so is his friend. These are the characters in the film that we are meant to relate with? No thanks MTV productions, you can keep this film locked away.",Napoleon Dynamite
1303,catherinelee10,Flippin' Sweet!,10,30 April 2005,"Napolean Dynamite isn't your typical movie. It has almost no plot, and is really random, with cute and quirky one liners like, ""Tina, you fat lard, come get some dinner!"" and, ""Do the chickens have large talons?"" Napolean Dynamite doesn't really fit into a genre of movie, but it's originally hilarious! So, basically, the story is about your average high-school nerd who doesn't care about fitting in. He only has two friends (both misfits also) Pedro,with the sweetest bike ever, the ability to hook up with chicks, and the coolest mustache ever, and Deb, who takes glamour shots of people to make money for college and has a tiny crush on Napolean. The first half of the movie is mostly about Napolean's regular life and the upcoming dance, and the second half is mainly about Pedro running for class president (he wins, of course). Napolean Dynamite is a really funny movie, and is suitable for almost anyone, ending in big laughs. Flippin' sweet!",Napoleon Dynamite
1304,spudfairy,First review I've attempted,8,2 May 2005,"This film surprised me, and my friends who I watched it with. I expected it to be a film filled with awkward lifelike dialogue and I wasn't disappointed. However, I also expected it to be satirical, fast paced surreal comedy and was pleasantly surprised. This film is slow moving, never really packs any 'laugh out loud' humorous punches but it is quirky, intelligent and delightful.The hero, Napoleon Dynamite epitomises everything that everybody tries not to be at school for fear of humiliation. He is socially inept, unconventional and makes unpopularity and art form. However, he is such a likable character that when things do go well for him I smiled not only for him, but for everybody out there who good things happen to just for being individual.It's slow in parts, uneventful in others, but the superb acting from Jon Heder as the title role only maximises the sense of awkwardness you get from Dynamite's actions. Everyone who watches this can be reminded of everything we did as teenagers we'd sooner rather forget. This film is not annoying or irritating, but charming, and I certainly believe the underground hype it has received is well deserved.",Napoleon Dynamite
1305,SeanHoughton2,"Really funny, and great movie.",10,2 May 2005,"This is a great, and hilarious movie that is fit for any audience. It's extremely funny, and has amazing characters. You should Definitely watch this movie! The best part of the movie in my opinion is the dancing scene at the end. This is the kind of film that makes you laugh out loud. This is definitely in my top five list of movies, and I will never forget watching this movie. Its just completely awesome! (If you think I'm a bit bias, ten lines is the minimum for a comment, so I had to drag it out. )A REALLY brilliant film that everyone should watch. But don't take my word for it, watch it!",Napoleon Dynamite
1306,dtbajita64,Hilarious in an off way,10,7 May 2005,"This movie was so ridiculous, that it was worth it to buy it. I bully everybody into watching it, and no doubt about it, they all start quoting the movie right along with me. Be warned that it has NO plot, but that's just one reason that this movie was so good. Silly parts will also bring back some memories of the late 80's and early 90's. Great movie...I would watch it with a group of friends, though, not by oneself. The characters are so different from each other, but yet they compliment each other. Every once in a while, you may find yourself and a friend or two quoting whole segments from the movie and then laughing about it after you make it through...though not without a few chuckles and grins in between. Have fun with this one.",Napoleon Dynamite
1307,jhofmann-3,Can you still laugh at all the stupid things that happened when you were a teen?,9,9 May 2005,"If the above is true, you will love ND. The movie is basically one long collection of stereotypes getting put into various awkward moments, or blurting out ruthlessly honest (if immature) remarks, such as: Napoleon: (approaching girl's lunch table) I notice you drink %1 milk. (pause) Does that mean you think you're fat? (pause) Cause you're not. You could be drinking whole if you wanted to.There isn't much of a story or literary element to go on, just the continual repetition of this sort of scenario. So if you can't identify with the characters, it's going to feel as slow as molasses, with little payoff.",Napoleon Dynamite
1308,don0v4n_7,you'll either like it or you won't,10,13 October 2005,"Frist off let me say that this is a great movie. the acting the directing the script the music everything about it is perfect for the effect it conveys. I want to say this to the people who just don't get this movie because if they could just step back from their reaction nd see the movie for what it is then they would have to admit that it is well acted and superbly directed. Just because you don't like something doesn't mean it wasn't well made or undercooked. If you don't get this movie you just don't get it. Don't worry about it, it's just not for you. I've only had a chance to see this film twice so I don't know all the deep symbolisms all I can tell you is that it is really really funny. It starts out so dry that for the first fifteen or so minutes all I could do is stare in shock horror as this absurd boy goes about his inane life in this nowhere town in the middle of nowhere America, but as it goes along I found myself chuckling and then laughing out almost nonstop. This isn't your typical movie which is probably why I gave it a ten. Because ND gives you something that you can't find in most movies nowadays a real plot. Not a typical Hollywood idea of a plot. But a real plot like ""raisen in the sun"" or ""chacher in the rye"" but where these movies took you to the serious side of life; in racial tragedy or personal anguish. Napolean Dynamite let's you laugh and takes the real very day issues of our lives and puts them in satire. Well just slightly accentuated these characters are very real and the comedy is in their very real life like situations and reaction s to the events in their lives. It's not a list of over done jokes or obvious physical humor but an everyday ridiculousness that just keeps getting funnier and funnier as the story unfolds. If you can't see the humor in ND I'm sorry because your missing something great. But just because I can't see the image in a 3-d painting doesn't making a bad painting I't just means I don't look at it right. God bless",Napoleon Dynamite
1309,alexmounsey,Heart in the right place,10,20 July 2015,"A couple of weeks ago I blew the dust from my DVD copy of 'Napoleon Dynamite' and I've viewed it twice since. I recalled an amusing but self-consciously quirky film about a clutch of kids in small-town America; but in fact it's a dead-straight, light drama about some genuinely odd but very realistic teenagers. This is honestly one of the sweetest, funniest, most charming films I've ever seen and I had a massive smile on my face all the way through it. The scene at the dance is so tender and bittersweet, it's really touching to watch and I think I even shed a tear as the Cyndi Lauper song started.The performances are great, the music selections inspired, the jokes are deadpan perfect. It's refreshing to watch a teen movie with no swearing, and I love the fact there's no sense of retribution to the movie. Happy endings all around. A massive handshake to 'Napoleon Dynamite': a thoroughly good-hearted film that makes me feel absolutely terrific. I may watch it again tonight.",Napoleon Dynamite
1310,chanique,Ingmar Bergman come Paris Texas with a dash of Zoolander,9,16 May 2005,"Ingmar Bergman come Paris Texas with a dash of Zoolander. It is an absurd film, that made me cringe & cry with fits of laughter. The dead pan acting & the slow camera work create a surreal yet intriguing plot that just calls for more. The main character's performance is brilliant, he is like a cartoon character that is completely oblivious to his inadequacies. He has no friends until he befriends the new boy, a Mexican that has a little more of that Latino drive that will push him to want to become the next school captain. Napoleon will stand by his new found friend & the two of them get into all sorts of mischief. They are so uncool that they are the ultimate definition of ""Coolism"". The film takes you into their lives and enables you to relate to this surreal character and his friends in a scary way that will make you cringe. The film is not predictable, you are constantly waiting and anticipating the next scene only to be surprised!",Napoleon Dynamite
1311,ComputerBlue,this movie was really bad,1,16 May 2005,"The only reason this movie was made was to sell crappy t-shirts at hot-topic. I don't think the debate should be about if this was an accurate portrayal of nerds. Who cares. What about the fact that the jokes weren't even funny. For instance, the fact that Napoleon's brother was a computer nerd who found a girlfriend on the internet. (wow! that is really original)Then when they do hook-up, Surprise. Shes a wild and crazy black woman! What a miss-matched pair!(Guaranteed to get laughs from people with low comedy standards!)As for sticking up for the characters in this movie by saying they are supposed to be normal or average. How is that supposed to be interesting or funny to watch. You need dynamics to make a movie interesting. You need irony to make something funny. This movie was lacking both and was just a one dimensional comedy with cheap jokes aimed at the masses and, was generally insulting to ones intelligence. You may as well watch American Pie 2.",Napoleon Dynamite
1312,alexvilleroy,"If you like zombie movies, you might just like this one too.",1,8 July 2005,"But take that opening line with a large grain of salt. All the actors in this movie act and behave like zombies, and that's it. By the way, I wouldn't even call it acting. There hasn't been a single human emotion displayed in this entire film. What a lousy and cheap way to make a film, a film about nothing at that! So if you look for a story, you won't find any. If you look for acting skills, nope. Humor? Well, maybe, if you're stupid and amused by any sorry excuse for a joke that comes along. I myself only got a few chuckles out of the entire movie, and that was only because I was trying really hard to actually like this film. I figured thousands of IMDb voters out there can't be wrong. But I think the score is biased. This is one of those things where many people feel the need to label it ""cool"", ""different"" or ""indie"" or whatever term one could use. Something ""you don't understand but we do"" kind of nonsense. Well, not this time, believe me. This is just another film that sucks bigtime. Don't waste your time any further!",Napoleon Dynamite
1313,supa_sta01,What Year is it?? Help,10,21 May 2005,"OK, so I love ND. However my man and I have this huge disagreement over what year the movie is suppose to take place in. First you think late 80s because of the clothes and slang terms.Then you think early 90s because of the Uncles need to revisit 82. And that maybe Idaho is just one of those states that is way behind the times,( this is not a stab I do live in Louisana same can be said.) Then at the end they throw in a song from 1999? I'm starting to think its done on purpose. (all that last over the ages without a ""tied down"" date blah blah) Mainly because a movie that was trying to place itself in a time period would have had a Class of ____ sign for the elections. And the dialog seems to avoid that at all costs. Is it 80, 90 or today? What do all the ND gurus think???????",Napoleon Dynamite
1314,charles_temporary,Good Dialogue and Good Camera Work,9,21 May 2005,"This is an interesting funny movie with realistic-sounding dialog. It's definitely worth watching.In addition to comments made by others, the camera work is interestingly unique for nowadays. Almost all shots are done with a non-moving, non-zooming camera, so the only action is the movement in the scene, not the camera movement.This is a welcome relief to the recent trend to have cameras constantly moving.As mentioned earlier, this is an interesting funny movie with realistic-sounding dialog. It's definitely worth watching.",Napoleon Dynamite
1315,soberpat,Funny and Original,9,25 May 2005,"I am so tired of seeing all of these remakes and TV shows/comic books being made into movies and I was starting to give up on going to watch movies altogether but then Napolean Dynamite came out seems like out of nowhere came this new kind of hero it is so much different and so original that it is intoxicating to watch, there are so many catch phrases taken from this movie that you can't seen to ignore it and why would you want too I would highly recommend watching this film no matter what age you are, it shows a different point of view from a misfit, that would otherwise just be ignored..You might not get most of the humor if your a bit older, but this movie explores more than that, it exploits once again all the stereotypes in high school, and finally we see the outcast or misfit take a stand and make a name for himself, great idea and concept and a great film.",Napoleon Dynamite

Then I saw it again and I was cracking up. It is a stupid movie and it should be celebrated for it's lack of intelligence. It's in the Seinfield category... a movie about nothing. It does have an awesome soundtrack and a great dance scene. Watch it the third time and you'll be hooked.Th characters are hilarious. I especially enjoyed Kip and his funny lisp. His girlfriend the hip chick (who couldn't be anymore opposite to him) La-Fon-Duh, is also a hit. I really think there should be a sequel though to explain Napolean himself. Where did he come from? Where are his parents? Just give some background to the story. A movie about Napolean as a kid would be hilarious.",Napoleon Dynamite
1317,tamvelasquez,Great film,9,15 October 2005,"I loved this film. It had a great sense of humour, very dry and offbeat. What I also liked was that it proved that comedies don't need swearing, gross-out or sex humour to be funny. Everything was great and perfectly appropriate for the film: The acting, the music, the character development, the storyline(or lack of), etc.But perhaps, what I found more surprising about the film is the fact that it was such a hit with the teenybopper/MTV crowd, I'm surprised that it was a hit at all in the U.S. Definitely a comedy classic (What a shame that it was never released here in theatres.)",Napoleon Dynamite

As a movie lover i usually find, even in the worst of movies, positive attributes so in turn i can at least ""defend"" (i guess is the word) a movie from the evil bashers in the world. I believe every movie in one way or another has its pros and cons. Unfourtanly my theory was ANNIHILATED when i came across this treacherous ""movie"" (i dare not call it a comedy). Not to bore everyone with another repetitive list of why this ""movie"" is so horrible i would just like to agree with all the basher comments.I also would like to say that my faith in the public taste for movies has finally Died.",Napoleon Dynamite
1319,mark-plumb,Have you been to Idaho?,10,27 May 2005,"This film has a late 80s feel, but for Idaho it could be present day which may not be a bad thing with the gap between cool (Don and Summer) and geek (Napoleon and Pedro) not being that far apart. How classic was Summer in modest dance dress doing ""Happy Hands"" and Don sitting center audience posing as cool as one can in his small town Idaho world. With entertainment being sparse and the characters of this school portrayed as good moral kids, who can blame Don's personal enjoyment by getting Napoleon to describe/exaggerate/lie about his summer vacation killing wolverines with his uncle in Alaska. I graduated HS in 87' in Oregon and attended college in Idaho - scary to admit the film hit home. I just wished I could dance, then things would have been different. Man if I could only go back to 87'. Has anyone out there found any information on time travel? The movie will become a cult classic, I'm just not sure if it's OK/healthy for my kids to be constantly quoting lines from it.",Napoleon Dynamite

There is nothing appealing about this movie, and, the characters, oh the characters! By the time you start to understand the characters, who cares. I couldn't believe the amount of interest in this movie when it first came out, but now that I've seen it, I thoroughly wished I hadn't. Watch paint dry, watch grass grow, watch the traffic lights change, but God almighty, you'd wish you had a life, any sort of life, than to waste anytime watching this drivel. Hedder is not funny. I've seen him in a couple of movies now, and each time I'm left scratching my head wondering...... well.... why? It appears he hasn't made a movie for some time, and, Hooray for Hollywood. I'm thinking which comedian (and I use that term loosely), is worse! Pauly Shore, Carrot Top or Jon Hedder? I feel that it would be a three way tie. However, that would be cruel, it would only serve to give them hope. And I wouldn't want to do that!",Napoleon Dynamite
1321,x-static180,What a waste of my time.,1,26 June 2005,"I can't believe that Napolean Dynamite is getting any positive feedback at all. I found it very dull and at times, unbearable, to watch this boring kid meet boring people and do boring things. I think there was one or two laughs in the whole movie, slapstick typical busting of groin on a bicycle... and even those were just snickers.Answer this simple question: What was this movie about? Nothing really. In the end, do you feel as if you are further ahead than when you started? Do you even feel that a story has been told?! I felt like I was waiting for something to happen the entire movie.... and it never did. I felt no attachment or sympathy for any of the characters in this cast.Before you think ""he doesn't get it""... I was an outcast in high school, I wasn't a jock or a socialite. I get it, trust me, and it's still pointless. You can argue all day long that ""you have to watch it more than once for it to be funny"". No thanks, it wasn't even remotely funny the first time. Should a comedy be so hard to sit through? Should the ""story"" (or lack of one) be so minimal that the whole movie simply relies on appealing to losers with quotable lines? If a comedy has to be watched more than once, it seems that you'd be trying to make it funnier than it really is. Take your 86 minutes of life and spend it elsewhere. Cult classic? Psh. Rocky Horror is a cult classic. This is garbage.",Napoleon Dynamite

It was so amazing and so funny and will SO appeal to today's late twenty-somethings and early thirty-somethings who grew up in the U.S. Napoleon's character is phenomenal and the awkward presentation of all the characters is to-die-for. It's unbelievable that most of the actors and the playwright for that matter had very little experience before making this, because it's a masterpiece. Every other minute there's a laugh. The style of this film has not been done by other movies I've seen of late from the costuming (moon boots, stirrup pants, asymmetric ponytails, puffy prom dresses) to the intro sequence (so clever and original). And one more thing -- you WISH you could dance like Napoleon.",Napoleon Dynamite

God help me through the flash backs I have whenever the name of this so called movie is mentioned. What in the hell was the point in this movie? After it was over (by the grace of God) I could not believe I had wasted so much of my time watching it! Do not get suckered into watching this...it does not get better the longer you watch it...it sucks from start to finish.

1325,yofjell,Under par movie,3,20 August 2005,"This is an MTV production, which is probably the first problem. Even so, the movie surprises me in how it is able to sustain the feeling of the story and humor improving, but lacking to do so during the entire film.The plot is to an extent surprising, but it is not interesting enough to hold my attention, unfortunately the characters are nothing more than slightly funny and in turn makes this a mediocre comedy not really worth the time.I am surprised to see others give this movie any acclaim at all, it is not a memorable movie and misses it's own genre totally. To recommend a similar, but better, movie I can mention Road Trip, American Pie or almost any 80's college movie. Even ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" is more entertaining, and I hope that makes everyone think twice before declining alternative offers to watch this MTV production.",Napoleon Dynamite
1326,jpeters99,Steer clear of at all costs,2,16 November 2014,"Napoleon Dynamite is a 2004 film directed by Jared Hess. The film revolves around an awkward, blundering teenage boy named Napoleon (Jon Heder), in his attempts to survive high school and his own embarrassing family. Seemingly detached from reality, Napoleon leads a strange, bland existence which, for some unjustifiable reason, appeals with audiences. Personally, I found this film boring, tedious, and at times, down-right stupid. Some of the one- liners gave me the occasional laugh, but overall, not an enjoyable movie. The film uses bright colours, retro music and cheap jokes to distract from the fact that it has a very thin plot, with next-to no character development and little in terms of a proper story. If you are looking for a good way to waste 2 hours, by all means give this film a watch. I may be biased, seeing as this far from my regular taste in cinema. This movie may leave you in stitches, but personally, I will be sure to steer clear of this movie in the future, and anything similar.",Napoleon Dynamite
1327,oscia3,Watch it more than once...,10,30 September 2006,"This is not your typical comedy here, and I suggest that you watch it more than once. The first time I viewed this movie I just sat there with my mouth agape and my head tilted sideways (kinda how a dog looks when it is confused). I really didn't know what the heck to think because this movie was so different. After repeated viewings I can fully appreciate how sophisticated and funny this movie really is! The director, actors, etc. had accomplished an extremely difficult feat. They created a hilariously successful movie without the Hollywood formula. Furthermore, there is not a sexual innuendo nor a profanity uttered throughout the entire flick! Teenagers and adults (by the way I am 37) just flocked to it. Try accomplishing that in Tinsel-town today without going bankrupt or using computer graphics...I dare ya!",Napoleon Dynamite

1329,charmella,The inner workings of the nerdy kid summed up in one hilarious movie!,10,9 June 2005,"You know those movies you just can't help quoting in day-to-day life? ""Napoleon Dynamite"" is one of those movies. The true value of this movie comes in the form of the characters. Each character is so wonderfully unique and charming which allows you to be drawn into the plot and the lives of these exceptional people. Although some say the plot is ""non-existant"", the plot is not what makes this movie a piece of cinematic genius. The camera techniques, the locations, the tacky keyboard soundtrack and the character dynamic contributes to a movie that captures your heart in one swift glance at this nerdy boy in moon boots. I can strongly recommend this movie to anyone with a unique sense of humour and a place in their heart for a charming, witty, kid with a heck of an attitude. ""Napoleon Dynamite"" gives you an insight into the inner workings of the nerd and why, above all, they should be a cherished part of every community.",Napoleon Dynamite
1330,MadE1019,"Bore me once, shame on you; bore me twice, shame on me....",1,14 June 2005,"I quite possibly cannot find words to describe the intensity with which I loathe this Napoleon Dynamite. I saw it in theatres with my friend, and we walked out of the theatre wanting the last 88 minutes of our lives back. We have now determined that the best part of the movie was knowing that it would end eventually. After hearing it was better the second time around, I watched again with a few friends at a New Years' party. I took that time exchanging bored and annoyed looks with the only person in the room who felt the same way.With a multitude of ""football-in-the-groin"" type jokes (well, actually, bike-in-the-groin, for the movie), the humor of the entire movie is less than satisfactory. With lines like ""Your mom goes to college!"", ""Bow to your sensei!"", ""I like your sleeves; they're real big."", ""Ever take it off any sweet jumps?"", and ""Gosh, idiot!"", shows that grammar of the characters does not extend first grade. Oh, right, the mom joke. Okay, second grade.It seems that, from a graphic point of view, the studio did absolutely nothing with colouring at all. The entire movie, ironically from Uncle Rico's POV, seems to be stuck in the 80's, with the exception of the internet by which Kip wastes his life.As many flames as I may get for this, I don't care. If I need to watch this movie a multitude of times in order to get the jokes, I'd rather watch a movie where I can understand the jokes the FIRST time. If given a choice of watching Napoleon Dynamite or being tied to a bear for ten minutes, I'd take the latter.",Napoleon Dynamite

The MTV Movies awards were raving over this movie, so, I rented it, thinking it would be hilarious, and it was just plain boring and dumb. No wonder why MTV was raving over it, it was a MTV production film. I should have known. Please don't rent this movie, it's a waste of money. If you do, you'll wish you hadn't.

While this movie is touted as a comedy, that's not what it is to me. It's a masterpiece in cinematography, art, history and psychology. Growing up in the 60's and seventies myself, I appreciate the detail by the set director, wardrobe and hair stylist, etc. It was flawless. Next the dialog and attitudes of the the characters is also spot on. There is an air of awkwardness throughout the movie. While it's a bit overplayed, there certainly was an air of awkwardness in those days that this movie captures oh so well. Of course, the big shots of Idaho are both eerie and breathtaking. The expansive openness is just so big and quiet that it can even upset our sense of balance. Lastly, is the directing and editing that is just so artful. There's not a single shot that doesn't reflect the awkwardness of the time. In the end , it's not a comedy to me, but like Dazed And Confused, is a serious glimpse into the painful life of a typical teenager growing up in the 70's and 80s.",Napoleon Dynamite

The first time i watched it i was like...what the hell?? but the second time, it was funny and i began loving it....everyone watch it twice and then you'll like it more lol. Napoleon Dynamite is the absolute best dancer in the entire world!!! I hope that there is more of Jon Heder in future movies because i think that he is an awesome actor after watching him on SNL the other day. He was hilarious...and now apparently Efran Ramirez(Pedro)is a DJ but my cousin said he isn't really that good.

Funniest movie I've seen in a while.",Napoleon Dynamite

There just isn't a whole lot to do and even less if you don't fit in with the ""in crowd"". ND and his friends are a bit naive and just do the best they can. ND gets frustrated, but jeez, look at his family. He doesn't have the luxury of just packing up and leaving, like his brother, and he deals with his situation. How he goes about solving problems is funny (like his slogan ""Pedro will protect you"") and I think the underlying message is: don't give up - keep going. Who would have thought that a movie without cursing, smoking, drinking, drug use, or nudity can be so entertaining. Oh yea, it's called family entertainment. What a concept.",Napoleon Dynamite

1339,jack_thompson-04622,A Dynamite of a Film,7,9 March 2017,"Napoleon Dynamite, directed by first time filmmaker Jared Hess and written by Jared Hess and Jerusha Hess. The film released in 2004 which became an instant cult classic.The character of Napoleon (played by Jon Heder) is a stereotypical nerd, the anti-social kid who sits in the back of the class, but believes himself to be a suave cool and talented guy, but this anti- social high schooler from Preston, Idaho isn't one that tries to be cool, but tries to be anti-social, one that just doesn't care about what others think, especially his Uncle Rico (played by Jon Gries), a perpetually trapped footballer from the 80's , who just can't seem to get over his lost game.Another great character is Kip (played by Aaron Ruell), Napoleon's older brother. Kip is arguably just a more intense flavor of Napoleon, he believes himself to be a suave, sophisticated ladies man, talking to Lawfundah and his 'Babes' over the internet. Kip tells Uncle Reco about these ladies, Reco being the inept, uninformed perpetually stuck footballer seriously asks about time travel through the internet, another quirky aspect of the film, that it gives a serious tone to laughably bizarre moments.The surreal world of Napoleon Dynamite radiates an oddly familiar situation, even if you haven't consciously thought about it. The innocent Pedro who runs for class president is a great example of this, he is the friend you kind of make, when you don't even realize it. Pedro even goes to the prom with Napoleon's crush Deb (played by Tina Majorino). This so called love triangle in itself is innocent, and when you view it you can see it isn't one of jealousy, just of oddly charming competition. Some may argue Napoleon isn't a nice character, and to great extent he isn't, but this doesn't mean we cannot relate to him, or believe him to be likable. Napoleon seems to be the part of us which wishes to tell every person we meet to 'Gosh, Shut up', but we don't due to what people would think, unlike Napoleon, the guy who dances for Pedro, and *spoiler alert* makes Pedro win the class presidency.The film has the awkward quirkiness that you just can't look away from. It's comedic satire of the nerdy individual gives us a emphatic approach to the story, one that is oddly heartwarming.Everything from the high school romance to the obnoxious bully trope contributes to a great, family friendly and independent piece of cinema unlike any other.In short Napoleon Dynamite is a film that can be re-watched over and over again, it's zany characters, it's bizarre structure and world melds together to become a extremely charming and entertaining piece of cinema.I give this film a 7/10.",Napoleon Dynamite

Endearing high school friendships with equally misunderstood souls and triumphs over adversity are to name but a few of the cleverly written observations in the film.

Napoleon is a teenager who is somewhat out-of-place in high school, but will this year be different? After making friends with the new Mexican kid, Pedro, and laughably tacky glamour photographer, Deb, will this year prove to be a memorable one for Napoleon? Armed with pockets full of tater tots, a pair of moon boots, one amazing ginger 'fro and some sweet moves Napoleon Dynamite has definitely got the skills to become a favourite of most comedy lovers.

1344,tonyd_51,Gosh!,2,18 July 2005,"I was gob-smacked to find that this movie had received such a high rating. Perhaps my comments are biased as I feel that the sudden rush of popularity for this movie is totally unjustified. Too bad. First off, this might be absurdist comedy sure, but so what? That doesn't excuse it from being dull. Even absurdist comedy should surely have more substance than this garbage. I read someone's review which drew parallels between this and South Park. Well the writers of South Park should take offence to this as their writing is much more funny and (usually) has much more depth. Matt Stone and Trey Parker are always busting to comment on religion, inadequacies of modern parenting, education, Barbera Streisand's nose and so forth. There is something behind these shows. Therefore this was a bad parallel to be drawn. Even if Napoleon Dynamite wasn't SUPPOSED to have depth, it could have at least been more funny. Don't be mistaken people, unless you like seeing 94 minutes of dorks doing dorky things then you will not find this funny. Napoleon Dynamite is nothing but an attack on an awkward, loveless dweeb. It is so typical of MTV to endorse something which is so mind numbingly empty and talentless. Funny thing is, this movie is without the sex, drugs or rock'n'roll you would normally associate with this organisation. So that leaves it with what?........ Nothing.",Napoleon Dynamite

But then you rewind it and start watching it from the start again, and soon you're practically splitting your sides with laughter!! It's the funniest comedy I've seen in years- why? Who knows!! Is it how every character's voice has a unique (well, peculiar really) sound (napoleon's deep and manly, kip's lispy) ? Or is it just that we can relate so well to these nerds, whether at high-school you were the nerd, or whether you were the popular girl who teased them and ridiculed them? My friends and I couldn't stop laughing afterwards, and we would text each other quotes from the movie, and fall on the floor in laughter! I greatly recommend this movie- you either think its the best comedy you've ever seen, or the most ridiculous piece of crap ever made.

They were awful, they weren't funny. I think I MAY have laughed twice in the whole film! Sure the characters are realistic, we all knew someone like these guys in High School, but that doesn't mean it's funny.(Unless you mocked people like them in High School) Now, I live in Oregon and am LDS, I went to the same school and same church Jon Header did (I didn't know him personally though) so maybe the crap was really over done in my circle of friends. But when my now husband and I went and saw this we almost died from lack of brain activity! It was simply awful.For those few who may not have seen it, it's about a young man who is, to be nice let's say social awkward, his friends who are a bit of social outcasts(they wouldn't have been popular in my school), one of whom is running for class president, and their lives at a particular time is high school. It continues through their ""adventures"" with about as much humor and enjoyment and a sack of dung.

Napoleon Dynamite probably has the worst life ever...A grandma who likes to go ride sand dunes instead of knitting,a brother who likes to chat online with ""babes"",and a Uncle who could care less about Napoleon or how many times he gets beat up at school.Then he meets the Mexican new kid named Pedro and a shy girl named Deb who (in their first scene together)""leaves all this crap""on his porch.This movie basically shows all of the battles of school:Class Presidents,Popular kids,Geeks,Outcasts,Bullies,and Principals who always seem to pick on the weird kids like everybody else.

1348,lilsase1,It Brought Me Right Back To High School,7,22 March 2006,"Lets be honest here this movie gets a lot of really negative comments because the movie in itself isn't what you would call a Oscar type film. Its a typical movie blended with teenage angst and full of stereotypes. The film was, I doubt, ever made with the intention of being an Oscar winner. It was made with the imagination of a few college kids who wanted to make a film. Regarless of whether the film is ''good'' or ''bad'' isn't really the point. The movie lacks a specific plot other than the laments of one Napoleon Dynamite. The plot (if there is an actual plot) is simple and straight forward. Socially retarded geek get tormented by fellow students. Becomes a sorta of geek hero and in the end is triumphant. He gets the respect and the girl. I'm sure many can relate to their high school days on this. There was always a bully, a jock, a good girl, and a geek. This is what makes high school based movies so easy to relate to. We were all like somebody in this movie.The movie however pointless it may seem to some is actually quite entertaining. I'm 35 and just watched it for the first time a few weeks ago. While I find the movie mindless and void of a specific plot, its entertaining none-the-less. The story may be trite and generic in some ways but simple humor and off beat characters make this movie fun and likable. Its not everyones type of movie and I expect that the fellows that made it are surprised by its runaway success.For those that keep bashing this movie on here I don't understand why, even if you didn't care for the movie, its not actually the worst movie ever made. I mean for those that might remember Ishtar is bar none the worlds worst movie. Another product of the 80s...The one thing that this movie is confusing me in is the actually time frame. I mean clothing and music circa 1980s is bringing me way back to my teenage years but it seems as if some of this is sorta not defined by actual time.Overall I wish that those that squawk at this movie would keep in mind that while its not a movie of serious caliber its still funny creative and entertaining. As some movies should be. Not all movies should make one think too much...Rock on Napoleon.",Napoleon Dynamite
1349,x_imdb-158,My Favourite Funny Movie,10,27 December 2006,"I watched this by mistake, I thought it would be Mr and Mrs Smith. When the introduction starts playing I knew something was wrong. A multi million blockbuster couldn't have chose to start with random shots of food. So I started watching the film feeling quite peeved and was full of negativity. The pace was slow, sure... but that's one reason why it was also realistic.I read how you can only ""get it"" if you've been through high school in the 80s. I was brought up in a different culture, a different generation and I still thought it was hilarious. I guess certain type of humour transcends time and place and I'm glad to have a common sense of humour with all Napoleon fans out there. I thought the characters were timeless, exaggerated yet not too over the top that they were utterly unbelievable.There are a lot of people who hated the movie. Many suspect that people love it only because it is different, special. This shows how under exposed they are. There are probably many Avant Garde films that they have never heard of. Pity.I'm just glad that ND had gained some sort of recognition for the brilliance it has. People who don't get it doesn't bother me because I know very well what I love and nothing they say can affect that. Those who haven't seen it, give it a try and decide which camp you belong to. If you hate it, critic all you want. If you love it, welcome!",Napoleon Dynamite
1350,gregpayne-79505,A minor miracle,9,6 April 2016,"This was one of the first indie films I saw that lived up to all of the hype that proceeded it. I know it's not for everybody, but to me it's just about the perfect low-budget, festival darling kind of film.It is incredibly unique and full of characters that you just don't get the chance to see in bigger budget, Hollywood types of movies that are all about non-stop action and hero worship.However, what really sets this film apart from other indie flicks is its innocence. That's right, innocence. It doesn't seem concerned with being edgy for the sake of being edgy or in basking in the darker side of life like so many other indie films do.Here, underneath all of the weird characters and surreal story turns is a simple and sweet story of outcasts finding community, even love. And only a PG rating.Nothing brutal. Nothing exploitative. Nothing shocking. Just unbridled originality and imagination at work. All done with a lot of understated humor and an incredible eye for detail.An all-time favorite for sure.",Napoleon Dynamite
1351,kinki-kiki,not even stupid humour,1,8 August 2005,"well i am a teenager and seeing as the film is set around my age i thought i could relate to this film and find it funny. i did not. there are many different types of humour - clever, dry, black pan, ridiculous and stupid. i can truly say i found none of this film funny. the fact that there is no plot, not even a small plot or any climax whatsoever sent me to sleep basically. a film needs some structure to keep it going, but there are exceptions, if there is humour involved as well. after reading through other peoples comments i really cannot remember anything funny in this film. u have been warned. i must say, however, i did see room for characters maturing or improving throughout the film but none happened.",Napoleon Dynamite
1352,revbruce,Too Funny!,8,15 August 2005,"I don't know why I thought it was funny, it was just funny. Not a single cuss word through the entire film. I've read through some of the previous reviews and to be honest thought that most of them were as funny as this movie. If you took this film serious (as some OBVIOUSLY have), may I suggest that you really do need to get a life...My only disappointment was the deleted scene at the kickball game. Listening to the commentary and watching that scene is like sitting down with an old friend and having a good laugh. About half way through the movie, my son and I got so tickled we couldn't talk. No, I could not tell you why we laughed that hard but for a 44 yr old dad to sit down with his 22 yr old son and have one of those laughs made it more than worth it!",Napoleon Dynamite

It's mission was to take Grace Lutherin kids to school. 926 is a flexible style bus that has a '71 Detroit in it.I used to drive that bus before I left PRT and went to Greyhound and Rimrock Trailways. PRT Rules!!! It was a very good company to work for. I think that it was really neat to see familiar countryside on film. It really gives Idaho a positive outlook to people who have never seen it. The characters in the film seemed genuine and that made the film worth watching. The film was funny, and I would watch it again. The film also identifies with locals that have lived in the country for a long time. Also, it gives hope to those students who would otherwise have no hope of getting the girl. Gosh!",Napoleon Dynamite
1354,linebackerjay62,low budget film with big budget appeal!,10,21 August 2005,one of the best and funniest movies i have seen in a long time.made me laugh and feel pity at the same time!brings out the dork in everyone of us.a must see movie for those of us who grew up in the 80's generation!caused me to feel guilty for picking on the socially less fortunate when i was in high school.even the sound track was totally 80's and brought me back to my high school days.uncle Rico in my opinion really gave this movie the high school quarterback spirit.back in the day i could throw the football three quarters of a mile! lol !i have watched the movie 6 times and i still enjoy it as if i was watching it for the first time.watch this movie and it will make all of your wildest dreams come true!,Napoleon Dynamite
1355,tuffyisback,Great!,9,21 August 2005,I'm way over 30 and loved it ... a series of clichés we've all experienced in life or seen in movies that were given new spins and treatment. The casting is perfect. I can't imagine any other actors in most roles. How do they do that? Kip is a reincarnation of Mr. Peepers (Wally Cox). Just thought the ending could be a little better.This is the kind of movie that gets funnier each time you see it so I suggest buying rather than renting the DVD. It's one of those films that is best not seen in a theater. A sizable percentage of the audience won't get it and mutter comments that will be distracting. Watching it with friends and libations makes for a great evening.,Napoleon Dynamite
1356,CapAmerica,Simply Awful,1,5 February 2006,"You truly know that there is something wrong with our society when people actually say they like this movie. I'm all for Independent movies, Hell I'm a big fan of them I might be one of the few people out there who got all the references in 'My Big Fat Independent Movie' (which I loved). I'm also a fan of B-Movies so I'm okay with bad acting and swiss cheese story.But There is nothing in Napoleon Dynamite that is worth watching. It is simply awful. The story is bottom of the barrel bad. The characters are all 2 dimensional and at no point do you like them, in fact I found that I pretty much hated all the characters in the movie. The acting is pure crap I've seen better acting in a 4th grade play. You spend the whole freaken movie hoping and praying for some kind of redeeming value in it where you can jump up and cheer and in the end all we get is Jon Heder doing his retard dance. I came out of this movie demanding my last 82min back. It was a total waste of time. You'll find more entertainment value in watching paint dry.If you are one of the people out there who ""loves"" this movie, Please seek help, There's something seriously wrong with you.",Napoleon Dynamite
1357,LadyLeopard,Napoleon....HECK YES!!!,10,27 August 2005,"Napoleon Dynamite is,,,, is,,, incredible! i live on the east coast and i flew out to Preston Idaho to see the Napoleon Dynamite festival. it was kind of small, but not many people have heard about it, it will probably be better next year. Napoleon Dynamite language is spoken throughout my house now, because my friend who is always over and i are obsessed with it. she was actually the one who made me sit through it and the first time i saw it, i thought it lowered my IQ because i didn't catch onto the humor, but i watched it again and that is when i couldn't stop laughing. i watched it, like, every day after that, and since school is starting again, ill watch it once a week. i don't think that there could have ever been a better Kip or Napoleon! and also, if you pay attention to one part in the move, napoleon is standing in front of his door, and its funny because every time they go back to look at him the door is opened a different way. its funny because nobody who made the film noticed. and also they didn't state it in the commentary. yeah, that is how obsessed i am. but its still a flippin sweet movie, and i recommend it to everyone...i even made my teachers watch it. The best movie, since tater tots were invented!",Napoleon Dynamite
1358,nebbenoah,Napoleon Dynamite,7,18 October 2016,"Napoleon Dynamite is one of the funniest movies I have seen in my extensive movie watching career. I have been watching movies for 15 years and this film is by far one of the best. Granted, it is one of those movies that gets better each time you watch it. The entire film is just comedic genius, and Napoleon's hilarious expressions throughout the whole movie are almost as funny as the conversations that he has with other characters. In the film, Napoleon is a high school student that attends school in a small town. He also has very galactic ideas and is spontaneous with the actions he takes. He is the ""Nerd"" at his school until another ""outcast"" moves to his school. They become best friends and hang out after school and participate in FFA. They embark on various misadventures without going out of their neighborhood. The overall ""plot"" of the movie is really what makes it different. ""It's so stupid it's funny."" - My father. There are many instances that are cringe-worthy and also,just make you laugh. It is really hard to describe this movie without using quotes and telling what actually happens. ""Ugh! Idiot! Gosh!"" These are just a few of the many quips that are used in this film, the insult to your intelligence after viewing this movie is amazing. You may come away from it thinking; ""What did I just watch?"" Just as long as you can laugh and recognize the jokes you will be alright with this movie. It may need re-watching for you to understand the humor. (I have seen it four times.) If you want to have a laugh, or just try a true comedy without a plot, then Napoleon Dynamite is the movie for you, If you also want to troll your friends recommend this to them.",Napoleon Dynamite
1359,abercrombiekitty46,"If you're boring, and have no sense of humor, don't watch Napoleon...",10,29 August 2005,"A lot of people have determined whether or not you will like this movie by how old you are... I've read reviews where people are saying ""if you're over 30, you probably won't like this movie"". SO not true. My parents (55 and 57) find this movie absolutely hilarious. My Brothers and sisters (Ages 25-34) think this is the best movie ever. My husband and I (21 & 23) watch this like once a week, and still find new things to laugh about. My niece and nephew (Ages 6 & 10) constantly recite lines from the movie. It has NOTHING to do with age. If you want to know ahead of time whether or not you'll like this movie, follow these guidelines...YOU WILL LIKE THIS MOVIE IF... 1. You have a REAL sense of humor. (If you understand and laugh at truly funny, dry comments that people make, then you have an actual sense of humor.) 2. You catch little details, and find them hilarious. (ie, when Napoleon is on the phone with Kip asking for his chapstick, first note the fact that Kip puts down the cheese grater... then keep your eye on the cheese. Dumb, pointless, & of course GENIUS) 3. You can enjoy yourself, even without listening to the F word every minute and a half. 4. You're okay NOT watching sex scenes and murders for a couple hours. 5. You simply want to watch a pointless, witty comedy. 6. Your mom goes to college. 7. And, of course, you enjoy moon boots, parachute pants and side ponytails.YOU WON'T LIKE THIS MOVIE IF... 1. You're boring. 2. You THINK you have a ""sense of humor"", but you really don't (Like when someone tells a joke about a fart, and you laugh uncontrollably, but when someone makes a witty, random comment, you're completely confused) 3. You're uptight. 4. You look WAY too deeply for a meaning to everything. 5. You think you're REALLY cool. 6. You have no friends and/or you're from Preston, so you find this movie offensive.So to sum it up... If you don't like the movie, I wouldn't tell people... It just shows people that you are an uptight, uninteresting person with no sense of humor. Peace out.",Napoleon Dynamite

Hey, you might even relate to Napoleon. Especially if you were a geek in the 80's or 90's High School. Its bittersweet. Its funny, its sad, its weird. If you cant relate to being an awkward teen, you might have had a Napoleon you made fun of in school. I was a female Napoleon, with underdogs as best friends and little girls admiring me for being bold, while my classmates made fun of me.

As a mother of six grown children, four of them boys, I must say that this well-done film truly captures the angst and awkwardness of those dreadful (occasionally delightful) teenage years. I have actually viewed it three times and thoroughly enjoyed sharing it with my kids. Sometimes the best humor is laughing at ourselves. The character development is like an insightful caricature - somewhere among the players you will recognize someone you know, drawn sparsely and accurately. The props are excellent also, depicting the era and place believably. This movie is hilarious and touching. I recommend it.",Napoleon Dynamite

The best thing about this film is the title song by The(marvellous)White Stripes. Did all those people who loved it watch the same thing as me? It maybe because I'm English and our schools aren't like in America but I just don't get the plot of the film. The ending is crap, I'd rather watch a fly whacking a mirror, it would probably be funnier than this. And when is the film supposed to be set? I'd guess the 80's from the clothes but then why are they playing The White Stripes and Jamiroquai? Okay so maybe its an acquired taste, but the hype this film has received led me to think it was a film for anyone, and to be frank I thought it was s**te.",Napoleon Dynamite

I've rated it one star and i still think that is over rated, why cant we have minuses. The settings are awful as well as the characters, whom are lacking any form of personality.

My kids and I watch it regularly at least once or twice a week. Occasionally, we use it as background noise when we are doing something else and ""Tune In"" to it when our favorite parts come up. The best thing about it is how ""quotable"" it is. We frequently crack each other up tossing lines at each other just to get a reaction. If you've seen the movie but haven't watched it with the commentary on - this is a MUST DO. The commentary is so funny and gives really interesting insight into how they came up with plot lines. My only regret is that I never got to see this in the theatre. I sincerely wish I had the chance.",Napoleon Dynamite
1365,mina-39,"Bad Comedy, Great Human Interest",5,8 September 2005,"This movie and the love-it, hate-it camps have truly puzzled me more than any other film I can remember. This movie is billed as a comedy, and if It really was, I hated it. I love quirky, dry, off-beat humor, but rarely laughed here. I saw this movie as a slightly depressing, brutally honest human interest film. I can get into that too, and if that is what is was, I loved it and thought it was innovative and well-done. My 5 rating reflects not mediocrity but ambivalence. I feel the need to clear up the fact that this is not set in the eighties as some are suggesting-- with the internet and chat-rooms, it can't be. When I started college in 1991, people rarely even had email, and some still hadn't heard of it. It was the mid to late nineties before the internet really took off and became ubiquitous. The eighties feel of the film is a play on the fact that Idaho (and Utah, for that matter) are notoriously stereotyped as being 10 or 20 years behind the times.",Napoleon Dynamite
1366,plastic-roses,One of the best films of 2004,10,30 March 2006,"Napoleon Dynamite is by far one of the best films I've ever seen. Its sense of humour is fantastic and I never get bored of watching it. It is so refreshing to see a film that is different to all of the other typical teen movies out there, and I also love the fact that there are no profanities or sexual scenes like most films out now have.Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder) is a high school student who hasn't got any friends and lives at home with his 32 year old brother Kip (Aaron Ruell) and his Grandma (Sandy Martin). Napoleon and Kips Uncle Rico (Jon Greis) comes to stay with them while their Grandma goes away for a couple of days, and doesn't get on too well with Napoleon. Back at school, Napoleon makes friends with the new kid in school, Pedro (Efren Ramirez) and soon meets Deb (Tina Majorino). Rather than focusing on the popular kids in school, this film mainly focuses on the friendship of the three characters Napoleon Dynamite, Pedro and Deb. There is also the story of the relationship between Kip and LaFawnduh (Shondrella Avery) which is hilarious. There is no real plot to this film, which is another thing that I love about it. It is as it is, simple, funny, and not to be taken too seriously. I don't think people should expect too much when they come to watch it, and don't search for a story or meaning behind it because there isn't one.Although this film has had many good reviews, there are people out there who find it boring and pointless. This film can be seen as slow, but this is one of the many things about it I love. Its a great film to watch when you feel like laughing and relaxing.I think everyone will be able to relate to this film. People born in the late eighties/early nineties and people currently at high school will be able to relate to this type of school life, and people who may be older will be able to relate to the fact it is about normal people with normal lives. We all know somebody who is like Napoleon, Kip, Pedro or Deb, and then there is Summer (Haylie Duff), Don (Trevor Snarr) and Trisha (Emily Tyndall), the popular kids we all know.I cant stress enough how great this film is. When you get a chance ,watch it, you'll love it. It is definitely one of the best films of 2004, and possibly one of the best films ever made.",Napoleon Dynamite

Well, with Napoleon Dynamite, I found just the opposite to be true. I kept hearing that it was such a stupid, useless film that I did not see it for quite some time. People even compared its silliness to ""Anchorman"", which I absolutely hated. Anyhow, after seeing NP, I fell in love with it! I was so impressed with the simple premise of a very geeky, unpopular kid who, much like the most popular kid in school, wants to be recognized, cared for, loved, etc. In life, we all want to find our ""special"" person and he as well as the rest of the characters find their special someone. As uncaring and nasty as he seems to be, he is indeed quite the contrary as can be seen when he went out of his way to help his friend win the election. If it were hard for a popular kid to get in front of his schoolmates to perform, imagine how difficult it was for Napoleon and he did it because he cared enough for someone else...someone like him who needed him every bit as much as he needed the boy.",Napoleon Dynamite

1370,JosephVena-1,You'll Love It or Hate It (I loved it),9,28 December 2005,Where do I begin?? First off this movie is very different. You either love or hate it. I say if you are around 10-35 you'll love it because my younger brother didn't get it and my parents thought it was stupid. I must admit it can get pretty slow at times. The fact that the comedy can tend to get pretty dry can turn some people off. I thought it was one of the greatest comedies of all time. It amazes me how this movie was made in 22 days and was made on a very small budget (I'm not sure of the exact amount). It will definitely have you laughing at some parts even if you are one of the people who absolutely despise it. Overall this was a great movie but as I said you have to see it to know whether you'll love or not.,Napoleon Dynamite

Now i understood the humour - most people that told be about ND told me it was my kind of movie. It wasn't. Where exactly was the storyline? Oh - that's right in the last 30 minutes of the film... There was no movie, there was just 80 minutes of one-liners...Although there was no structure and no intelligent humour there were some things i found mildly amusing... 1. Pedro (just generally) 2. When Napoleon tells people to ""shut up already"" or ""IDIOT!""YES... that was it... Overally... i wouldn't hold your breath waiting to see this movie.",Napoleon Dynamite
1372,jonathanwunknown,A movie that shows that outcasts are the ones with hearts of gold,10,3 October 2005,"This is one of the movies that I will probably never forget. This movie was not made for everyone. It was made for those that can relate to it. The many people that are one the sidelines of fitting in. It holds true to the notion that any one ANYONE can be great if they made and effort. I'm not trying to be emotional but the people that made this movie were not your ordinary screen writers and definitely knew what they were doing. I felt so many different emotions watching this movie. Like Nepoleon dancing with Deb,(his first dance with a girl) and just trying to help his Mexican outcast friend, who felt he could not win anything in life. The city setting in which it was filmed awed me. I believe it was Ohio where it was filmed, absolutely breathtaking that the short rolling hills in the back drop of the city. In the movie someone saying a false accusation to one of Napoleon's friends, and later in the film the two are reconciled. The ending has to be seen to believe. It ended beautifully. I have not seen many movies like this and did not think much when i say the reviews, but would like to see many more it. sometimes i believe it is better to be an unpopular person, because when your spoiled beautiful and popular, you take many things for granted. Nepoleon did not have many things we take for granted, but in his life he made two time more. For those who say this is one pathetic movie that made no sense and that it takes cheap shoot a people that are less intelligent, i strongly disagree with there narrowly uninhibited politically correct screwed comments. Do you know what i was thinking when i observed Deb. You know, the one that dressed gunning and was very unpopular. I thought 'man, you know she would make an awesome wife. why? what a big heart. but on the inside, such a beautiful person. she was twice the person than the popular 'summer'Why do i feel this way? maybe i know what its like to be an outcast of the norm of high school society. This movie is not picking fun at Napoleon, but actually shows his pain, trials, failures and great devotion to his wonderful Mexican friend. Yes it is hilarious at time(loll) but that makes it shine the more. It dose not degrade unpopular people, but acutely shows there true Strong's. Can you do your self a favor? If I could recommend any movie, Go See This Movie! I also recommend 'Whats eating gilbert grape' another classic if you like Nepoleon. -jonthan",Napoleon Dynamite

I have watched this movie about twenty times already and could watch it for another thirty. I loved it. It really captures the essence of going to high school and not being in the hip and cool club. It is creative, witty, and the best oddball comedy I have seen in ages. It's a great family movie and I appreciate it's innocence and purity. Too many movies that deal with high school are ""coming of age"" types and I really enjoyed this movie because it was ""coming out of my shell"" movie. It's so nice that my boys and I can all sit down together and enjoy this movie together. Make more like that!!!",Napoleon Dynamite

1375,raleigh-s-1,"A film ""speaks to you"", or it doesn't!",10,14 October 2005,"Napoleon most definitely ""spoke"" to me! There are films like Withnail & I, Big Night, and ND that make me laugh inwardly, as well as outwardly. What speaks to someone depends entirely on one's sense of humour, sense of pathos, and general personality. When I read threads in which people get ""angry"" or upset over whether or not ND is or is not a great/funny/memorable/whatever film, I am surprised and disappointed. ND has characters, situations and dialogue that to me brings back memories of high school. Just one of the ways in which it speaks to me! Dialogue in a film is more or less important depending on the style of film. I found the movie Dumb and Dumber to be a funny, laugh out loud example of film stupidity, reaching to my baser levels. Napoleon Dynamite, Withnail & I and Big Night are more intelligent films, relying on dialogue, situation and character development to get their points (humour, pathos, etc.) across.Napoleon Dynamite is, TO ME, a funny and memorable film. To others, it is simply not your cup of tea. Those whose disliked ND are not ""wrong"", they simply have a different sense of humour and don't find the film funny. To myself and others, the film is hilarious. We are not ""right"", however, we just have a sense of humour that allows us to enjoy the film.In each of the films I've mentioned, almost every line drips with intelligence, barely a wasted word. These are films that I can watch over and over. I saw ND for the first time about a month ago, and have watched it twice since!""Bow to your sensei."" ""BOW TO YOUR SENSEI!""",Napoleon Dynamite
1376,dancediva_jaimie,Napoleon Dynamite....A New Kind Of Movie,10,15 October 2005,"I was never really interested in this movie. Watching the previews it looked pointless. And when I finally did get to see it, it was pointless, but it was also hilarious.I don't think that there was a second that I wasn't laughing. The next morning my stomach hurt. You can't be uptight to watch this movie. You have to really make sure that you are in a good mood, and ready for laughs. Because if you watch it and are in a bad mood, the movie is going to go over badly.The whole point to the movie is to not focus the attention on someone that has friends, and is popular and smart, but to focus the attention on the class loner, someone that no one pays attention too. To show how they cope, and I think that's why it's funny. Because since we never get an inside look at them, we never see what they do differently, it was so funny, because Napoleon did everything, and said everything a lot funnier than what normal people do.I love this movie. The expressions and flat voices and the lines are hilarious, if you really want to laugh.The good thing about this movie is that it is not your everyday sort of movie. It is a different, new kind of movie. And you have to have an open mind when watching it.I give this movie a 10 out of 10!!!! Rock on Napoleon!!!! Dancediva_jaimie",Napoleon Dynamite
1377,JoshCypress,Only Geniuses Understand This Movie,10,15 October 2005,"If you use the word ""plot"" and think that makes you an articulate expert on film, do not see this movie. If you have a part in building Will Smith's retirement fund, stay away. If you think Adam Sandler is a comedic Mensa, Napoleon Dynamite is above you.ND is vintage indie film-making that sticks its thumb in Hollywood's eye. Minimal production cost has translated to hundreds of millions of dollars in box office, while tinsel town begs a brain dead public to continue to pay for big budget retread story lines featuring soulless hard bodied actors.Napolean Dynamite is not a movie. It is an experience. Love it. Live it. If you don't, ""you guys are retarded.""",Napoleon Dynamite
1378,ashpiening,"Hilarious, witty comedy",10,13 December 2005,"I don't know what words to use to describe this movie. I have never EVER laughed so hard in a movie as i did in Napoleon Dynamite. My friend and I watched it right when it came out, and knew straight away everyone would fall in love with it the way we did. It contains no sex or obscene language, therefore it is something everyone in the family can watch and enjoy. I don't know if there is really a plot or not...but that is what makes this movie so fantastic. I so look forward to a Napoloean Dynamite two, and to seeing all the hilarious cast again in more exciting adventures! Even my mum and dad, who have no humor whatsoever, found Napoleon Dynamite funny. Absolutely brilliant.",Napoleon Dynamite
1379,lebrockmontone,A Dirty Diaper Mashed in Your Face: The Movie,1,4 April 2006,"If you're a fan of subtlety, cleverness, intelligent humor and well written dialogue, then you will hate Napolean Dynamite. If it was possible, I'd give it negative stars. Not only is this the least enjoyable movie I have ever seen, but it's probably the worst $8.75 I've ever spent at the movie theater. Or anywhere else for that matter. It feels as though the makers of the film sat there thinking ""What would be funny to see in a movie?"" and then took an hour thinking of a list of things. Writer A:""oh man! trapper keepers! remember those? hahaha"" Writer B:""yeah! what about moon boots!?"" Writer A:""what about a guy on a bike, pulling a guy on rollerblades!? hahaha! that'd be hilarious!"" Writer B:""yeah but how do we cleverly write that into the movie??"" Writer A:""we don't! we'll just have it happen!""The movie plays out like a pile of ""funny"" ideas thrown together into an uneven, aimless waste of 90 minutes. Worse off, people seem to praise this movie for not having bad language in it. Yet the same people have no problem with cruelty to animals or the fact that the vast majority of the ""jokes"" have Napolean at the butt of them. So saying a bad word is wrong. But laughing at a kid for being different is A-OK.You want a movie that is funny, heartwarming, and family-friendly? Rent 'Breaking Away'. It's at your local video store in the section marked ""Greatest Movie Ever Made""",Napoleon Dynamite
1380,MisterShoe,"If you're into some of the worse comedy ever, then you'll like it.",1,30 October 2005,"I first saw this movie's existence in a ten second commercial on Nickelodeon, which was the first sign that it was going to be bad. I was wary not to see it until a week after it had been release. On the twenty first of December when it came out my friends boasted there lack of good criticism and taste in movies and said they were seeing it, while I and another friend went and saw The Aviator, a movie of much higher quality.It was not until another year past, filled with thousands of quotes, animations, and references to the movie that I actually sat down and watched it with my girlfriend who did not see it because she was in Europe at the time of its release.I can say this with no remorse, which this is one of the single worst independent films I have ever seen. The comedy is mostly slapstick, only appealing to those with little comprehension of any real comedy, the kind of person who needs to think about a joke for ten minutes whilst everyone else has already laughed. Many have told me that the movie gets funnier if you keep watching; I only ponder the question, ""If something's not funny the first time, why would it be the second or third time?"" It's as if their intelligence decreases with every watching of the movie.The movies plot is simple; Napoleon is an extremely eccentric pupil at a mundane high school is a very country like part of America. He has many problems, most of which is speaking and acting like a person with more than half the intellect that the average ape has. He wants to help his friend Pedro, who, just like Napoleon, is quite out of the normal boundaries for what everyone expects, win the student body election of Summer Wheatley, a mean, yet, likable character. Though this is quite simple, movies like this anger me. It's basically any bottom 100 IMDb movie, lots of unorganized dialogue and sometimes idiotic, slapstick comedy thrown in to hide the truly simple plot made for the one track mind.If you liked such shows as All That, or Dharma and Greg, you'll most likely love this movie. For everyone else who likes to watch something that actually makes you think, and can be funny at the same time, I suggest a movie other than Napoleon Dynamite.",Napoleon Dynamite
1381,Hayashida,Not My Cuppa Tea,2,31 January 2006,"Jon Heder is the nerdy Napoleon Dynamite, and his acting in this movie comprises mainly of going about with an annoyed frown on his face as his mouth hangs open (even if he's not saying his lines). Now, I've seen Napoleon Dynamite being mentioned favourably several times on the other (IMDb) message boards, and so I watched this expecting it to be funny. However, I found my attention drifting to other matters during the movie, and I wanted to stop the movie. I thought maybe I just needed time to warm to the characters, or perhaps the movie got better towards the end. I tried hard to give this movie a chance: I did sit through the whole thing. Unfortunately, I found it all dreadfully boring, and there was very little to laugh about/at. To me, there was only about two high points in the entire movie: The dance routine and the very brief few seconds of Grandma having fun. Besides that, I also liked how they presented the opening credits, and how each of those dishes was eaten in the movie. I don't hate this movie but I certainly wouldn't watch this again.",Napoleon Dynamite
1382,spicedham-1,Bloody pointless,1,22 October 2005,Very close to the worst movie I've rented in a long time. The acting is so bad it's painful to watch. The schools drama club could have done a better job on the first reading. Have someone you need to get even with? Tell them it was a great movie and make them buy it. No plot or story to be found. The only bright spot to be found was the character Deb you can see the character grow through the movie while waiting for the punchline that never comes. Cute as a button and trying hard she deserved a better movie to re-appear in. The whole thing seems to be a bad excuse to poke fun at all the people you went to school with.... but aside from the wooden dialog nothing is over the top enough to make it satire.,Napoleon Dynamite

I took so many days trying to work out the plot of this film, until i realised that there actually isn't one! i mean, what is the point in that?!? I think i may have laughed the whole of once during this film, so many jokes, so well hidden behind how bad they were. If your thinking about watching this film (which i sincerely hope you aren't) only watch the opening credits because that, along with the cow being shot in the head, is the only good point. And can anyone tell me what the point is in that random cow bit in the middle??? I didn't think so.Please don't watch this awful film! and if you don't trust me, ask all 30 of the students in my class that also had to watch it.

1391,bostakpise,Napoleon Dynamite is a perfect work,10,25 September 2006,"Reality comedy of a melancholic teenager's life style that most people have experienced directly or indirectly at some point in their lives. It made me laugh out loud. I would watch it a few times if I have to. The time period songs and music are fantastic though I don't favor background music in films, but here the director used it to enhance the nostalgia effect of the mid eighties which really had an effect on me personally. I was the same age during that time and listened to the same songs and had similar events with physical and personality developments and social relations. We all did when we were 14-16. you can find yourself in at least on of the characters in the movies, there's the nerds, the mid nerds, the bullies, the popular, charismatic etc...

The love and chemistry in the film never did last, because your friend's key chains does not go under the line of crap. Pedro's humor was fine, better than Napoleans, and the best in the whole movie.

Everything was so dull, so predictable, and infinitely boring that I am actually proud of myself for being able to watch the whole movie through. Typical ""I am a dork, and the other kids make fun of me"" You probably know the rest of the story..

My favorite parts were on the bus when the kid asks him what he is going to do today, when he has to make that speech about Nessie the Lochness Monster, when he tells Don about what he did over the summer,when he tells Pedro about his skills and about the gangs in the school,when he talks to Deb about being fat, when he gets the job with the chickens and asks if the chickens have large talons, when he counts the money he made, when his grandma tells him to make a dang Quesidilla, when he finds out uncle Rico is coming, when his has to feed Tina( the fat lard), when he draws the liger, when he draws the picture for Trisha, when he talks on the phone, when Pedro tells him the story of y he cut his hair, when he does his dance, and many other parts.Tony D.PS.

I almost fell asleep. There was no background music or anything except in the beginning. They must have forgot about sound completely in the editing room.

Just 100% weird, and hilarious. Its a fresh break from BS and the characters are outstandingly funny. I have probably the most open minded view when it comes to watching strange films and i really believe thats why i liked it.....because i let myself. people just sit and say ""what is this"" but they should try and relax and stop thinking about it for a while.

1407,bumblefunk,Worry-Free Anti-Hero,7,4 April 2006,"The second scene of Napolean Dynamite leaves no doubt in the viewer's mind about the nature of Napolean's character: for fun on the bus ride into school, he ties an action hero to a piece of fishing line and throws it out the window, letting it bump across the dirt road. The action hero bears a passing resemblance to He-Man, the blond, buff protagonist of the popular children's television show of the same name [1]. The figurine takes a beating, and Napolean takes an occasional furtive glance towards the front of the bus to check if anyone has noticed his curious antic. Napolean is literally destroying a symbol of a hero, and the movie allows us to make a swift judgment: Napolean Dynamite is an anti-hero, a role his character fulfills flawlessly as he acts but never reflects on his conduct... or anything else for that matter.Indeed, Napolean is the lead of a cast of misfits who cannot be bothered with moral or philosophical questions. The closest we come is an earnest conversation between Pedro, a Mexican new to Napolean's school, and the school's principal, where the young man is reprimanded for breaking a piñata in the shape of his competitor for the position of student body president. Pedro cannot understand the principal's position --- he has broken several piñatas resembling real people in the past for parties. This sort of buffeting-up-against-the-rules does not give Pedro pause. Indeed, we are at a loss to determine if anyone has learned anything by the end of the movie about the burden and trials of adolescence. Napolean's uncle, the burned out ex-football star Rico, plays a poster child for failed dreams whose primary emotional activity is playing back the mental tapes of his high school life. He too never comes to a deeper understanding of his situation --- his wife has to come back to shake him out of his funk.The closing shot (save a bonus wedding scene) frames Napolean and Deb, a young woman who adores him, playing tether ball to the tune ""The Promise."" The juxtaposition of the love song, which gilds the plaintive striving of a young man in love...I'm sorry, but I'm just thinking of the right words to say. (I promise) I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be. (I promise) And if I have to walk the world to make you fall for me, I promise you, I promise you I will ... I will... I will... I will......with the scene of a young man whose free time has changed by the addition of girl... leaves us with the chilling conclusion that Napolean will go through the rest of his life blithely ignorant of any reality outside of his head. He is, after all, deprived of the opportunity to take the first step --- deprived of the opportunity to strive for something outside the confines of his provincial existence.But we are treated to a love-song that elevates romantic striving... what gives? Events have arranged themselves for him in a sensible order that satisfies and stimulates him just enough to keep him from challenging his surroundings.[1] Children's cartoons say a lot about the culture in which they reside, and He-Man is a particularly illuminating example. He-Man is in fact borrowed from the character of Superman --- under normal circumstances, <?name> is a mild mannered country boy with no special powers (Clark Kent) and his sidekick is a cowardly tiger. When put in danger, <?name> transforms into He-Man, a super-hero with superior strength and a magical sword, and his sidekick turns into a ferocious fighter with magical armor. Their arch-nemesis, Skeletor, is an evil wizard who has magical powers by default. The cartoon was conceived in the era of Reagan's re-moralization of international politics, and he left no doubt in anyone's mind that the cold war was a war between good and evil. So He-Man was an ideal hero when the times demanded heroes.",Napoleon Dynamite
1408,kirkosh1,"Brilliant sketches, but it's too bitter to laugh at",7,12 June 2006,"As a great fan of Jamiroquai, I watched it for only purpose - to see the dance sequence. I say it to point - I had no bias, on one ever told me anything of it. And I say - bitter it is. Though I never was that kind of nerd, I'm a loner. And in some cultures it is a norm - as I see, in Japanese it is, but both in US and in Russia it's a curse. So I see the whole picture as a tale of loneliness - maybe less talented, shocking and plot-driven as American Beauty, but same medically accurate. Main mass of the reviews are polar - or they call the ND Funny-to-hysteria, or boring. Probably as partially 'nerd', I feel deep compassion towards Napoleon. I can't laugh, since I've had both experiences - being outcast and being ""the cool guy"", but for the same reason it's impossible to be intact. Disturbing, moving your deepest soul strings - of a shame, anger and pride, that's what it was to me. Now, I can't understand, was it intentionally or not, but as I get it reviews differ because it shows reality, not one's point of view. Maybe that's the reason why there's no noticeable plot, which is major flaw to me. Also, the ending is amorphous, I see no 'happyend' for such a hero. He's or sacrificing something inside, or remain rejected, both painful - and I could't see clearly, what THE ending meant. And such manner of storytelling, realistic to absurd, doesn't go well with open endings. Note: I watched the original version, not the extended one.Also, Russian literature, which is native to me has a long tradition of mixing sad and funny. Maybe this helps seeing different sides.As for recommendation, well, IMHO, if you never suffered from school society - you will laugh. Opposite also correct. But that has no connection to liking - if you had any experience, except being one in the crowd. Without understanding and compassion - which is easy even through phlegmatic, vacant-like stare of Napoleon, this is a waste of time. And this movie needs some concentration to get involved. So - this is not something to relax with. Don't make such a mistake. Oh, BTW, seems a really authentic mid-of-nowhere-late-80s picture. That also is a positive to me - since authors did it properly. Worth watching twice.",Napoleon Dynamite
1409,mlnash73,As real as it gets,8,9 June 2006,"Average looking kids, in an average school, leading very average lives, all told through the eyes of the most unaverage teenager ever to be depicted in a movie.I think there's a little something for everyone in this movie, which lurches from the predictable to the extreme in a flash, but without ever becoming unrealistic.This is not the 'plastic' teens which we have seen in Mean Girls or American Pie. ND is like a character from Shakespere, both tragic and funny, even when he's trying to be taken seriously. Kip is a perfect example why you shouldn't spend to much time on the internet. However the real train-wreck of the movie is Uncle Rico, the fast-fading star, who believes he was destined for greater things on the football field, rather than 'baby-sitting', eating steak, and selling Tupperware to 'desperate' housewives. Now every time someone comments to me about how good an athlete they were in their youth and how they 'nearly' made it, I can't help but smile and think of Uncle Rico !!!! ND's job at the chicken farm is fantastic, from his questions about talons, to the egg-based lunch, and realization that the job earned him just $1 an hour (all paid in loose change !!). Not to mention his description of his summer vacation to Alaska.Anyone who thinks that their life is boring needs to see this film about how boring life can really be and what it can do to your mind !!!!",Napoleon Dynamite
1410,weapondarko,"Bad Movie, few laughs",2,5 March 2006,"This movie was praised by a lot of people who found it hilarious. Okay, i'll give them that. But, this movie was pure crap. I had to watch over several days because I could only stand for a few minutes. The only thing funny in this movie were the way that most of the characters talked. Other than that, the acting was bad, the directing was bad, the story was a complete idiocy to anyone that has a brain, and who ever mentions this as a great movie must be insane. In short, avoid the movie unless you want to know what it feels like to waste your time and never get it back. If you do watch the movie, keep in mind that you are now one of the hundreds who lost part of their lives. Wait for the movie until it's on TBS.",Napoleon Dynamite
1411,kleint55,"Funny, For Certain Ages",9,6 March 2006,"I think this is one of those movies where if you've lived through the 90's forward as a kid or teen, you ""get it"". However, overall older people (over 50) don't seem to get it as much and don't seem to think it's very funny. It has to be one of those ""you have to have been there"" things where unless you knew people like that and went through times like that, you don't get what's funny. However, if you have been there, it just seems to get funnier each time you watch it. When it comes down to it, this is one of those movies where you have to let go of your preconceived notions about what makes a theatrically funny movie, and find the humor in a movie that seems to really touch on how weird normal life can be.",Napoleon Dynamite
1412,elizabethgetsherkicks,Saved by the Bell for the Spaced/ Office generation,8,15 March 2006,"This is a very funny film and slow paced which allows you to appreciate the sheer hilarity that is the concept of red neck America. The whole backwards universe the mid-Westerners exist in provides much mirth throughout (little winks, you know, the old 'I've always thought that!') but the main characters are all so very endearing that Napolean Dynamite is more involving than your average throwaway comedy- which I must admit it sort of is (watch it with a big group of friends), but it's worth every minute in that its truly heart-warming. The music is absolutely fantastic, really cool- sounds like the Life Aquatic soundtrack, and there are some classic pieces of retro design to look out for.I reckon you should see this.",Napoleon Dynamite
1413,RJMason_9,What year are they in.,7,25 March 2006,The way they dress looks like the 80s but I didn't know they had chat rooms back then. In the movie they had a beta instead of a DVD or VCR so it has to be a long time ago. THe movie was good and it got my attention. One thing I don't understand is why they get old people to play roles as teenagers. its dumb because actors should play roles of people their own age. The movie is always on HBO and Starz. It comes on TV too many times the movie isn't that funny. They should come out with a part 2 for this movie and I might go to the movies and see it. I just waited for this one to come out on DVD or pay per view. It looked like a stupid movie but ended up being OK.,Napoleon Dynamite
1414,pnti-1,ND advice,6,11 March 2006,"I watched this movie with a French girl, her comment at the end of the film was 'zis iz zee the most borink sing I 'ave ever seen' obviously the language used in the film is what sets the comedy. Some may definitely agree with her comment but personally I liked it. I did find the movie much more amusing the second time round, unfortunately I think this film has been ruined, the quotes over quoted and the 'vote for Pedro' tops displayed around by people who don't even really know who Perdo is. This movie is slowly becoming a classic because of its popularity and is worth a watch. But I stay a just little above the fence with my rating... The film has a very low key plot and may fail to interest with its dry sense of humour.",Napoleon Dynamite
1415,glitergirl426,very disappointing,2,16 March 2006,I don't know what the rage is about. It was altogether horrible and dreadful to watch. Everyone said it was so funny and i was expecting a great movie but i was very very very very disappointed. To me there was only one part that was actually funny. Even though some stupid can be funny but this was really boring. I remember when i was watching it at home I so wanted to turn it off........but i didn't because everybody said it was so good and when it ended well i thought it wasn't over because nothing funny had happened. The story didn't make sense and i couldn't really grasp what was going on. Many people liked it so you may but i didn't like it at all. I suggest seeing a different movie if you don't like stupidness.,Napoleon Dynamite
1416,hayleybrooks,No one can ever beat Napoleon Dynamite!,10,18 March 2006,"This movie is excellent! Many of my friends think it is stupid, but I have no idea why. When it came out on DVD we bought the very first day and watched all of the extras! My favorite part of the movie is the wedding, when Kip and Lafawnda get married. I was so excited, it's very strange, but that's why I love it. If you love Napoleon Dynamite, there is a fan club that you can enter, on the website. There is also a website that is really funny and is kind of like Napoleon Dynamite, but Napoleon is better! This is the website: www.homestarrunner.com, go to ""toons"" and watch ""Teen Girl Squad"", even if you are a guy, you will think this is very funny! Watch every episode, there is one that makes you laugh hardcore.",Napoleon Dynamite
1417,dmd-35144,Stellar,7,21 February 2019,"Napoleon Dynamite is one of the movies everyone knows. In this indie film, dopey teen Napoleon Dynamite, helps his new best friend, Pedro, run for class President. Napoleon is a sleepy eyed nerd living with his lowlife older brother, Kip, Tina the Llama, and temporarily with his creepy businessman uncle Rico. All of the characters are quirky and weird... even the ""popular kids."" There's something about this movie that makes it a cult classic.
Surprisingly, I found the cinematography very aesthetically appealing. The movie is mainly filmed in static takes, where the camera is filming everything in front of it without any interruption. There are beautiful still shots of mountain ranges, wheat fields, and houses scattered throughout the movie. After Pedro's speech, Napoleon dances in front of the entire school, and it is one of the most iconic yet visually captivating scenes from the movie. The camera is set in place and rolling as Napoleon pulls off one of the best dance scenes witnessed. The lighting is perfect, the music is perfect, and his outfit seals the deal. He is solely lit by an overhead light resulting in a vignette that frames the scene. The color schemes found throughout the movie was also stunning. Many times during the movie, Napoleon and Pedro would stand in front of a set of blue, red, yellow, and orange lockers while wearing colors that complemented this setting. Overall, the still shots and pastel colors were a good contrast to the unusual characters and dialogue.
Showcasing the awkward stages all teenagers go through, Napoleon Dynamite, takes the cake. Napoleon, Pedro and Debby are the epitome of ""awkward high schoolers."" Napoleon considers himself a really good artist and conjures many different drawings throughout the movie such as a ""liger"", or lion tiger which is his favorite animal, and a really bad portrait of a girl. There is no filter in the script which makes the movie so funny. The actors play the roles and make the characters come to life with their body language, voices, and clothing. Napoleon and Pedro have similar stances and facial expressions during majority of the movie as they slouch around school and leave their mouths open as their resting face. For majority of the movie, Pedro is seen wearing a bolo tie accompanying his slightly over sized, long sleeve button-up shirt, while wearing a wig because he shaved off his hair. He rocks every outfit with a small smirk and his fully grown mustache, while Napoleon has a full head of orange curls and tucks his t-shirts in his blue jeans. Kip, Napoleon's brother, has an interesting high pitched voice with a small but noticeable lisp from his braces. Throughout the movie, he spends his time with his online girlfriend and makes side money with their Uncle Rico by selling plastic containers. The acting and costumes were the finishing touch to this cult classic.
Napoleon Dynamite is a movie that all ages will enjoy. The humor is weird and at times the characters might make you uncomfortable with their voices and dialogue, but I really liked it. I would rate this a 7/10. The movie begins with credits made of drawings, food platters, and other unusual items as The White Stripes, ""We're Going to Be Friends"" plays in the background. The opening credits give a small taste of the aesthetic and feel of the movie which immediately captivated me. There is an even blend of humor and beautiful cinematography throughout Napoleon Dynamite that will appeal with many movie lovers.",Napoleon Dynamite
