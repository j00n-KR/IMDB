0,SnoopyStyle,Some fun and some great insightful gags,7,18 February 2014,"It's a parody of all the teen movies with some great insightful jokes. Janey Briggs (Chyler Leigh) is a plain unpopular girl who is the subject of a bet by the popular guy Jake Wyler (Chris Evans) as a send up to 'She's All That'. It also parodies every other teen movies as well.I just can't figure who would like this movie as I do. Basically you have to watch every teen movie. How many people remember 'Lucas'? You have to watch them all, and willing to laugh at them. It seems like a small group of moviefiles who can understand all the jokes.The best and most insightful gag has to be the transformation of Janey. After that big hit, the movie rambles on a bit with the big game and the rest. The last half just flails around a bit. I just wish they had more gags to fill the prom with.",Not Another Teen Movie
1,kosmasp,More than one,7,30 March 2021,"I reckon this can be considered a ""best of"" all those teenage movies and then some put together. Be it the hot Russian exchange student (looking at you American Pie) or all the bets teenage movies included. If you've seen the original movies, you'll know which movie is referred too. And I think the toilet humor joke is from another movie too ... I could have done without it to be frank.Still this has one of the strongest funny-sexy beginnings put on screen ever! And its a girl at the center of it. The supposedly ugly duckling ... which of course is anything but ugly. Not to mention that beauty is in the eye of the beholder.Anyway, so many cliches, so many jokes and many work quite well. Even 20 years later. I personally still don't like all the poop jokes - though in my estimation almost no movie can pull them off efficiently .. no pun intended. The cast is quite something to behold with Chris Evans being the lead male ... it may sound ""duh"", but having such fine actors playing it so dumb, is really helping the movie a lot!",Not Another Teen Movie
2,lee_eisenberg,"Great, even if you don't know too many teen movies",8,17 May 2006,"A really neat satire makes you laugh even if you're not 100% familiar with the material. In my case, ""Not Another Teen Movie"" makes me laugh even though I don't really know all the teen movies from the '80s and '90s (I know some, but I'm no connoisseur by any stretch). Obviously, as a spoof, no part of the movie can be taken seriously, but it's not just a series of gross-out scenes; there is actually a plot: it's a convolution of football, relationships, detention...you get the idea.The only cast members whom I recognized were some of the people in supporting roles: Randy Quaid plays the father, Paul Gleason repeats his character from ""The Breakfast Club"", Mr. T plays a janitor, and Molly Ringwald also makes an appearance. A very perceptive way to do all this.Anyway, it's not any kind of masterpiece, but a fun way to pass time. One day, we're going to look back on all this and think: ""Those teen movies really were meant to get spoofed!""",Not Another Teen Movie
3,jboothmillard,Not Another Teen Movie,1,13 September 2005,"This is a good double meaning title, it can be phrased as ""oh no, not another teen movie"", and ""no, this is not another teen movie"", but both phrases don't come close to how awful this film is. Basically this film spoofs all the teen comedy and drama movies from the recent years, and some from the past, to create a story bringing them all together. So at John Hughes High School, popular jock Jake Wyler (Fantastic Four's Chris Evans) has a bet with cocky blonde Austin (Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd's Eric Christian Olsen) that he can transform ordinary Janey Briggs (Chyler Leigh) into a stunner worthy to be prom queen. Trying to stop him succeeding are the cruelest girl in school, his evil and incestuous sister Catherine (Mia Kirshner), and bitchy cheerleader Priscilla (My Name Is Earl's Jaime Pressly). Also in the story are the common stereotypical characters we see in teen movies, such as naked foreign exchange student Areola (Cabin Fever's Cerina Vincent), good looking weirdo Les (Riley Smith), the only (little seen) black guy Malik (Scream 3's Deon Richmond), desperate virgins Mitch (Cody McMains), Ox (Sam Huntington) and Bruce (Samm Levine), perfect girl Amanda Becker (Mean Girls' Lacey Chabert), Ricky (Eric Jungmann) who is obsessed with Janey but was never noticed, and very old undercover reporter Sadie Agatha Johnson (Beverly Polcyn). The films spoofed in the film are: American Pie, Porky's, The Breakfast Club, American Beauty, Cruel Intentions, 10 Things I Hate About You, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Clueless, Risky Business, Road Trip, The Goonies, American Pie 2, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Footloose, Sixteen Candles, Pretty in Pink, Grease, The Faculty, She's All That, Never Been Kissed, Bring It On, Almost Famous, Unbreakable; Dude, Where's My Car?, Save the Last Dance and Get Over It. Also starring Randy Quaid as Mr. Briggs, Mr. T as The Wise Janitor, The Breakfast Club's Molly Ringwald as Flight Attendant and Halloween: Resurrection's Sean Patrick Thomas as Black Guy at Party. I will admit I did recognise the obvious spoofs to the films you would expect in a film like this, the only problem is they are not funny at all, it is full of stupid and vulgar material, picking on sex toys, albinos, conjoined twins and all sorts of horrible stuff, it is absolute trash that is not worth the bloody effort, an atrocious parody. Poor!",Not Another Teen Movie
4,Quinoa1984,"Basic juvenile humor, sometimes funny, sometimes just too stupid",6,16 December 2001,"Not Another Teen Movie is a, uh, it might just be another teen movie, except this one is directed by Joel Gallen, one of the guys at MTV, so it is a teen movie except with that MTV humor edge to it (plus R rating).  It spoofs movie that in their own way are already funny on their own, so parodying them is not only difficult but lame.  That's why a good chunk of this movie doesn't work.  However, when Not Another Teen Movie does work its laughs, it is actually funny (the Randy Quaid scenes, Breakfast Club spoof, certain parts of the party sequence are the funniest parts.  Overall, it's OK, but it would've been funnier if it was made 5 years ago, or if I was 5 years younger.  Mr.T, Melissa Joan Hart, Molly Ringwald and Paul Gleason appear in cameos (Mr. T would've been funnier if he had better dialogue). B",Not Another Teen Movie
5,wes-connors,Not All That,4,7 February 2010,"Interrupted masturbating, sexy Chyler Leigh (as Janey Briggs) goes to school unsatisfied. Although she is very beautiful, Ms. Leigh is considered ugly due to wearing glasses and a ponytail. At school, she is asked to the prom by handsome jock Chris Evans (as Jake Wyler). He doesn't recognize her prettiness, and is just responding to a pal's bet. But, they just might hook up, for real. Many students at ""John Hughes High School"" are apparently in High School until the age of twenty-three, which is California state law for retention. Perhaps this is why the film is called ""Not Another Teen Movie"". Filled with raunchy humor, this film will be more fun if you're not allowed, but can get your sticky hands on the ""Unrated Extended Director's Cut"" version. Otherwise, it's a flat spoof with some likable performers.**** Not Another Teen Movie (12/7/01) Joel Gallen ~ Chyler Leigh, Chris Evans, Cody McMains, Eric Jungmann",Not Another Teen Movie
6,preppy-3,More hits than misses,7,17 December 2001,"Parody of teen movies in the spirit of ""Scary Movie"". There is a bit of a plot modeled on ""She's All That"". Hottie Jake Wyler (Chris Evans) bets that he can transform an ""ugly"" girl into a beautiful one by the prom. The plot is secondary--there are constant sidetracks to parodies of tons of other films--everything from ""American Beauty"" to ""Risky Business"". Some of the jokes don't work, but they're coming so fast and furious that if it doesn't work, just wait a second...another one's coming. More of the jokes work than don't. No classic, but I enjoyed it. The acting isn't bad--Chris Evans is too old for his role (but then the entire cast is) but he has nice comic timing--and a very nice body too. Mia Kirshner is also funny playing his sister and aping Sarah Michelle Gellar from ""Cruel Intentions"". Also Jaime Pressly is fun as a beyond belief b**** of a cheerleader. All the stereotypes are hit dead on and it even turns into a musical at one point! High points are the parody of ""The Breakfast Club"" (with Paul Gleason cheerfully recreating his role) and a hilarious cameo by Molly Ringwald. Lots of fun.",Not Another Teen Movie
7,Calicodreamin,Ridiculousness,5,4 September 2020,"A parody of the all time greatest romcom teen movies, with stellar cameos and all around bad storyline and dialogue. It's so bad it's almost good.",Not Another Teen Movie
8,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Juvenile, crude and just plain bad",5,5 December 2004,"Parody movies, or 'spoof movies', can be quite educational from time to time; we learned from the 80's spoof movies, those starring Leslie Nielsen, that toilet humor and fart jokes were popular back then. We learned from the Scary Movie films that the Wayans' truly are talentless(well, technically, we already knew that... but those films proved it, once and for all). And the makers of this film learned(I hope) that it's a bad idea to parody comedies. Even if it is teen comedies that you are making fun of... which are(clearly) not among the most intelligent comedies(or films in general, for that matter). So, what is it exactly that we do have here? A plot that combines plenty of comedies that actually did have some(if not much) comedic relief in them originally... stapled together by some writers who were apparently not working together(judging from the disjointed feel of the scenes) and filled to the brink with toilet humor and overly crude gags and jokes... why is it that spoof movies must always put some out-of-place humor into it, instead of just making fun of the original movies? It would be so much more entertaining. OK. Back to the point. What else do we have? A cast of totally unknowns with a few actual actors in cameos. And a director who's done nothing but spoofs(mostly for MTV, which we all know rarely fail to deliver crummy teen-pop entertainment), most of which are short films... meaning that he was given feature film director duties for the first time(and those that have seen this putrid piece of... ""entertainment""... know that he blew it). But that's not all; the film also offers a wide variety of bad puns, poor jokes, racial/gender-related/sexual/age-related/etc. stereotypes, age-old clichés and sight gags that are so bad that they have a serious chance of ruining your eyes and robbing you of your eyesight... which, if it prevents you from experiencing another second of this crap, might actually be worth it. This movie is just... bad. The humor is juvenile and crude, and all of it is painfully exaggerated. I recommend this only to teenagers who will watch anything... a group of people that I wish was very, very small, but know from experience, isn't. Sigh. If you can see this movie for free and/or you are forced to by one or more members of aforementioned group of teenagers, you might as well enjoy the sight of the lovely females... Jaime Pressly and Mia Kirshner are among them, and any guy who has seen them know how attractive they are. Apart from the sight of those two(and a few other young, attractive teen girls), this movie has nothing to offer. 5/10",Not Another Teen Movie
9,view_and_review,Excellent Parody,7,21 June 2007,"The spoof we've all been waiting for and the title was so fitting. This parody was spot on and I liked it a lot. There was every stereotypical teenager you could imagine and in the center of it all was the even more cliché love story. It was great. And what says romantic comedy better than your final scene chase? The one when there has been some miscommunication or some other type of fall out between the love birds so the woman or girl decides to leave or conveniently was leaving at that time anyway. Then the man or boy has an epiphany and chases her down to express his feelings so they can embrace and smooch. Yep, that scene was in there of course. Plus, they outdid themselves by getting the 80's queen of teenage movies, Molly Ringwald. ""Not Another Teen Movie"" was one of the best parodies in a while, certainly better than the last few Scary Movies', ""Date Movie"", and ""Epic Movie"".",Not Another Teen Movie
10,neil-476,Not bad,7,15 January 2012,"I like a good spoof, but dear heavens, there have been some very poor ones in recent years. So I am pleased to report that this is one of the better ones. And there is a very good reason for this - most of the jokes are actually funny. It's amazing how much of a difference that makes in a comedy.if you have ever seen a teen movie (and, if you haven't, why are you watching this?) then the ""plot"" is going to hold few surprises. In fact, calling it a plot is stretching things: it simply links together a series of variations on episodes from assorted teen movies, the main one of which is the transformation of the geek girl from She's All That.As well as the young cast, there are some seasoned players here, and they're not all slumming.This was quite good fun.",Not Another Teen Movie
11,anaconda-40658,Not Another Teen Parody.,5,4 March 2016,"Not Another Teen Movie (2001): Dir: Joel Gallen / Cast: Chyler Leigh, Chris Evans, Jamie Pressly, Mia Kirshner, Randy Quaid: As Scary Movie satired horror film clichés, here is an attack on teen film conventions and the results are every bit as vulgar but less promising. Title seems to voice the frustration of those who sat through Boys and Girls and She's All That. It exploits teen stereotypes such as the popular jock who accepts a bet to make the uncool girl into prom Queen. Well directed by Joel Gallen who obviously knows the clichés but the characters are seen as types with no personalities. Chyler Leigh completely embodies the image of Rachel Leigh Cook from She's all That but she is not given a role that rises above the appearance and cliché. Other characters include the obsessed best friend, foreign exchange student, and the token black guy. Chris Evans plays the popular jock out to win a bet. Jamie Pressly plays a snobby cheerleader who will be opposed by another team in a reference to Bring It On. Mia Kirshner is featured as a jab at Cruel Intentions when her role requires her to want sex with her brother. Randy Quaid plays the bat crazy father to the Leigh character. He is supportive yet mentally whacked. Predictable and vulgar but well aimed on its target. Too bad that the screenwriter couldn't go beyond another teen movie and create something that was actually funny. Score: 5 / 10",Not Another Teen Movie

When the Director of said movie also did not one, but two Ellen DeGeneres specials you're in real big trouble. By the way,why parody teen movies when most of them seem to be parodies themselves? Not Another Teen Movie (or NATM for morons who can't spell or just love acronyms) is one of the most brain-dead ""comedies"" I have ever had to misfortune of watching. And ""Freddy got Fingered"" came out the same year. 2001 had way too much tragedy and we went to the movies to help us forget our woes and THEY give us this horse manure. I openly weep. Why Mr. T had ANYthing to do with this I have not a clue. There's more movie after the credits, but if you can make it that far, you're a better man than I.My Grade:D- DVD Extras: Commentary by Joel Gallen and Mike Bender; Second commentary by Chyler Leigh, Jaime Pressly, Eric Olsen, and Eric Jungmann; pop-up factoids; Teen movie IQ test; 18 deleted/extended scenes (with more topless Areola); 3 production featurettes; 'Car Ride' short film; the unrated 'Tainted Lovie' music video by Manson; Audition reels; stills gallery; TV Spots; Promo spots; Theatrical Trailer; Trailers for ""The New Guy"", ""The Animal"", ""Saving Silverman"", ""Big Daddy"", and ""Loser""; and 2 Easter Eggs (a marriage proposal and a few takes on the kissing scene) Eye Candy: Cerina Vincent as Areola is nude whenever sees on screen, and a few breast and butt shots from various extras",Not Another Teen Movie
13,zetes,A very poor movie indeed,2,8 July 2002,"The film is supposed to make fun of lame teenage comedies like She's All That, American Pie, even back to The Breakfast Club (although I kind of like that one). Why? Those are comedies in the first place. If a comedy is unfunny, then what are the chances that its spoof will be funny? There are maybe one or two small laughs in the proceedings. The opening scene, where the main character is caught playing with herself by first her father, then her brother, then her grandparents, and then her priest is pretty amusing, if foul. That's probably the least disgusting joke of the whole film! The younger boys are pretty funny. Cody McMains, who plays the main character's little brother Mitch, looks like he might be Judd Nelson's son, especially in the homage to The Breakfast Club. The `token black guy' is pretty funny. When the characters all go to a party, he has to approach another black guy who has showed up first. `Excuse me, I am the black guy in this movie.' `Oh, sorry,' the other black guy replies, `my mistake.' Mr. T and Molly Ringwald appear in truly uninspired cameos (do teenagers even know who they are?). Melissa Joan Hart, the star of She's All That, appears, probably to inspire nostalgia from the uber-young audience. I'm just normal young, and I'll always think of her as Clarissa. 2/10.",Not Another Teen Movie
14,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Oh, no, not another teen movie! *pause* oh, this is actually funny? Coolness!",7,21 April 2002,"Not Another Teen Movie, like Scary Movie, this is a parody of what the 1990's had to offer us, the romantic teen comedies! How many of them do we loathe? But how many were also great? Not Another Teen Movie makes fun of movies from the 80's to the 90's and is very clever. I saw this movie with a friend and honestly, while there are a few parts that were a little too much for me, I don't exactly dig potty humor, but there are some really funny scenes. It was fun to see someone finally make fun of the all the clichés that were rubbed in our faces: the nerdy girl turning into the hot girl, clichéd characters that would never be friends but somehow are, the best friend in love with the other friend who's in love with the popular kid, you get the drill.In the stereotypical high school community of John Hughes High sexy Priscilla, a popular cheerleader, separates from her boyfriend, Jake Wyler. After Jake discovers that Priscilla is now dating strange and socially inept Les just to spite him, one of Jake's friends, Austin, suggests seeking retribution by making Janey Briggs, a ""uniquely rebellious girl"", the prom queen. Jake attempts to court Janey's love, but faces adversity from his own sister Catherine, who is sexually attracted to him, Janey's unnoticed admirer and best friend Ricky, and memories from his past football career. Catherine eventually helps her brother by slightly altering Janey's appearance, ultimately making her more attractive to the other characters. Meanwhile, Janey's little brother, Mitch, and his friends, Ox and Bruce, make a pact to lose their virginity by Graduation even though they are still in their Freshmen year. Making fun of movies like: She's All That, Cruel Intentions, American Pie, The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Drive Me Crazy, American Beauty, and Pretty in Pink , Not Another Teen Movie leaves no film left alone to show us the utter cliché that came with every teen movie out of the 90's.Like I said, there are some moments that are a little much, this is a pretty raunchy comedy, but I think it's just making fun of the in your face movies with the sick humor as well. I mean there's potty humor and hard core nudity, but I digress. There are some really funny moments in this movie, wither it was the random song the cast breaks into about their excitement for the prom or the whole introduction of the clichéd characters. The cast looked like they had a blast making this movie and I had a lot of fun watching it as well. I would recommend it for those who love satire and parodies, I did warn you though about the raunchiness, so if you have a weak stomach, you may wanna fast forward through a few parts.7/10",Not Another Teen Movie
15,=G=,Could have been better.,5,10 May 2002,"""Not Just Another Teen Movie"" is another in a string of slampoons which takes on the teen romantic comedy genre with a kaleidoscope of characters, situations, and scenes borrowed from a host of past teen flicks.

16,MovieAddict2016,"About ten years past its prime, and even then its victim to its own satire",4,31 August 2005,"""Not Another Teen Movie"" is an ""American Pie""-style satire of the sex/teen comedies of the 1980s. It includes all the stereotype characters - The Jock, The Geek, The Cheerleader, The Spoiled Stuck-Up Princess (I can't use the real word), The Foreign Exchange Student and the Token Black.It is quite funny at times but once you get past the basics - for example, the obvious stereotypes - there's not much there. It falls victim to its own satire - it becomes another teen movie, loaded with sex gags, stupid characters reminiscent of ""American Pie"" and some lame R-rated crudity that isn't nearly as funny or risqué as it thinks it is.If you're just looking for some skin this has it, and plenty of it, but you can do better by just going and renting any '80s movies - heck, ""Sixteen Candles"" had nudity and it got away with PG, just imagine how all the R-rated movies were. (Maybe you don't have to imagine, maybe you've seen them all already - in which case you're sadder than I am.) If you're looking for a sex comedy, ""American Pie,"" ""Porky's,"" and ""Animal House"" are funnier. If you're looking for clever satire, this isn't it. It's smug, self-conscious and contrived - it's also ten years late and no doubt most teens aren't even familiar with ""The Breakfast Club,"" Mr. T, Molly Ringwald and Paul Gleason anymore.",Not Another Teen Movie

18,bowmanblue,Better than your average 'spoof' movie,7,7 September 2014,"The 'Not Another...' and '...Movie' franchises have just about been milked to death recently, as it has attempted to parody everything from Superhero films to Date movies. Both series follow the same pattern, lampooning more popular movies with a selection of gross-out gags and pratfalls. However, nowadays people may have forgotten that 'Not Another Teen Movie' was one of those rarities which actually worked.If you grew up in the nineties (like me), or just generally watch a lot of teenage 'rom-coms' then you'll probably be able to tell which films 'Not Another Teen Movie' is poking fun at. But, the best thing about it, is that the jokes are actually funny.The film is loosely tied together with a story about a popular boy trying to make an unpopular girl popular, but you can almost consider it a sketch show. Therefore some scenes work and others don't, but more do than don't.If you're as sick as the clichés used in teenage romance movies then you'll appreciate seeing them ridiculed here, or if you just fancy some daft, gross fun, then this could also be for you.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Not Another Teen Movie

The only thing is I couldn't tell which movies. I only saw the American Pie and Breakfast Club parodies. Even so, this movie wasn't as funny as I expected it to be. I did have a few laughs, but not a lot.This film is basically about a high school jock who made a bet to turn an ugly girl into a prom queen nominee.One character I was really annoyed with was that girl's brother. I wanted to punch him in the face because it looked so appealing to do so. He was really annoying.Overall, this is an okay spoof. The Scary Movie quadrilogy is much better though.

All the characters are great, and all of the spoofs are awesome, plus Chris Evans and Chyler Leigh made the biggest impressions on me as Jake and Janey. It spoofs many movies, American Pie, 10 Things I Hate About You, Road Trip,Bring It On,All The Right Moves,Cruel Intentions,Risky Business,Breakfast Club, Grease and more, but my favorite has to be the Breakfast club one, in which Paul Gleason makes a hilarious cameo in spoofing himself as principal Richard Vernon!, plus the whole cast is very likable!. There are some misses, however not that many (in my opinion), and I especially loved the spoof in the opening of American Pie, plus Randy Quaid is a riot as Janey's father. It does have plenty of raunchy gross out jokes to enjoy, and Molly Ringwald has a very funny cameo! at the end plus the ending was especially good. It's quite underrated, and I loved how the whole cast played it straight, plus it has a great mix of everything, slapstick, romance, sex humor, etc , etc. This is a great spoof of Teen Comedies, that's often hilarious and very clever with fun performances and more hits then misses, I highly recommend this one!. The Direction is very good!. Joel Gallen does a very good! job here, with solid camera work and keeping the film hilarious and at a very fast pace. The Acting is a lot of fun!. Chris Evans is outstanding here as the Jock, he had perfect comic timing, was hilarious played it straight, had excellent chemistry together with Chyler Leigh, was very likable, had plenty of charisma, and was just outstanding overall!, I also loved him in Cellular (Evans Rules!!!!). Chyler Leigh is gorgeous, and does wonderful here, she played geeky very well, and was often cute as a button, she also had a very likable character, and also played it straight, I loved her!. Jaime Pressly is excellent and very convincing as the bitchy cheerleader, I really liked her. Eric Christian Olsen is great as The Cocky blonde jerk Austin, and was quite convincing,he did a really good job. Mia Kirshner is excellent spoofing Sarah Michelle Gellar, and made quite an impression on me, she is a very talented actress indeed!. Deon Richmond is good as The Token black guy, I liked him. Eric Jungmann is very convincing as nerd once again, he was great as Janey's obsessed best friend, I love this guy!. Ron Lester is very good as The Fat Guy, and did his job well. Cody McMains is funny as Janey's brother I liked him. Sam Huntington is great as The Sensitive guy I dug him. Joanna Garcia is a riot as the chick who has Tourette's Syndrome. Lacey Chabert is hot and does fine as the perfect girl. Paul Gleason is hilarious in his cameo as Richard Vernon I loved it!.Randy Quaid is hilarious as the father.

So I decided to watch it...and it was a huge waste of time. Not another teen movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. If you think that this is the ""BEST MOVIE EVER', well I'm sorry but I think that you don't know how a good movie -or just a movie -is supposed to be I've heard so many people, preferably younger teens say this movie was ""hilarious, outrageous, and the best movie ever"" If I ask you supporters of the movie ""Why does this movie is the BEST?""

If you say jokes ;I've seen all of them before (didn't like back then either but that's another story) ,so why should I watch this movie or what makes this film that unique? The spoofs in this movie are just annoying and horrible. Also so many things are quite disgusting, disturbing and just plain unfunny.Some gross and disturbing scenes, were how the sister cheer-leading was trying to attract her own brother. That was plain wrong. There are so many scenes in the movie that whose sole purpose is to spend some time to expand the movie to at least 90 stupid. Its just about a bet that the main character (Chris Evans) does which is take a girl into his school and turn her into prom queen. Everything from there goes wrong. After a while the movie just felt like a script as if they were just free-styling. Honestly those movie is horrible and one of the worst films I have ever seen.

I dig the way the director crafts the very well known teen humor used in teen flicks from the past 20 decades and mixing it with some other genres.There are many clichés that are even spoofed and that's where the movie succeeds. Lots of sensuality, sex jokes, vulgarity, racism in a funny way are the elements that make this movie among the best of it's kind.Give it a try and forget about the negative comments; I can say this is a heavily underrated sex teen parody",Not Another Teen Movie
25,Anonymous_Maxine,Yeah exactly. Not another one.,3,18 April 2005,"Not Another Teen Movie tricks you into thinking you're going to get a movie that makes fun of those idiotic teen movies because of it's title and because it's a spoof of them, but all it is is another teen movie, just like it calls itself, but at least it has the sense to make fun of itself. It's a spoof film about movies that desperately need to be spoofed, which should have led to a much better movie. That's why the first Austin Powers was so good (the other two sucked, as you all know), because the James Bond films so badly needed to be spoofed. Unfortunately, there was not enough emphasis on making fun of teen movies as there was on making another one. Yes, the movie makes fun of all the standard teen movie clichés, but only enough to give it an excuse for having them all. Just like in Jeepers Creepers where the sister tells her brother as he crawls down the mysterious hole on the freaky guy's property, ""This is the part of horror movies where someone does something incredibly stupid and the whole audience hates him for it!"" Needless to say, he crawls in anyway, and presumably the scriptwriters sit back and grin contentedly, another day's work done. Sadly, as is the case in Not Another Teen Movie, the direct admission of stupidity is neither an excuse nor the justification for it. That being said, the movie is at least entertaining in the way that all spoofs, even the really bad ones, are, you get a test of your movie knowledge by how many of the movies being spoofed you can name along the way. I have no interest in listing them, as I am sure you have no interest in reading a list of the movies I recognized. Most of them are stupid movies anyway. I have to say I enjoyed the scene at the end where Molly Ringwald showed up, for the same reason I liked the scene at Preston's party where the black guy from Save the Last Dance appeared. As Stephen King pointed out in Bag of Bones, people love seeing characters that they recognize from other stories make appearances in new ones. It's almost like seeing family again. Stephen King does this more than any other author I've ever read, and if you're going to make a movie making fun of a whole genre, it's certainly a good idea to get a couple of the major stars from that genre to come in and make fun of themselves. But sadly, other than that the movie is an almost complete waste. Even Jamie Pressly, who is hardly known for her respectable and powerful performances, is completely wasted here, forced to do such ridiculous scenes (ridiculous even for a teen movie spoof) like the cheer recruiting scene in which she talks about how she's the cheer captain and so she makes all the cheer-cisions and how she's all cheer-cited about getting a new cheergirl since they're one short and are in something of a cheer-mergency. It is certainly telling about the rest of the movie that this is meant to be funny. But like the rest of the movie, Not Another Teen Movie is an exercise in making fun of teen movies in ways that are generally so bad or so tasteless or simply so unamusing that they make you feel more uncomfortable than anything else. Oh, and how's this for a telling little factoid, the funniest scenes in the whole movie are the ones in which the main character cries. Go figure.",Not Another Teen Movie

Thankfully, 'Not Another Teen Movie' transcends the genre.Filled with clever gags and character archetypes that gently prod the teen movie genre of the 80s-90s, 'NATM' is a funny, sometimes hilarious send-up.

I opted for the way more expensive set to have the music video included, even though I had it downloaded. All the time, I knew damn well I was probably gonna fall flat on my face with this as well, for if you encounter during your research here on IMDb those warnings by irate viewers, watch out...! Several times I have told myself, hell, you were warned... but you didn't listen...! The trailer with the long legs and high-heeled feet lured me in. I'm a sucker for that! But something scything said the movie was made for 14 year old boys only. Was I just gonna feel stupid?True to form, I went ahead. I basically thought so low of the prospect, that I opted to watch this one during winter, when the vast majority of my choices are way more conservative subject matter.Yes, the potty humor is abundant. And it quite possibly would find linitless appeal with dirty little boys. BUT BUT BUT it is also WAY WAY WAY too cleverly made to get stranded on those rocky shores.I looked past the potty humor, and by the time I watched it a second time, giggled inanely at WELL if it doesn't bring a giggle you are quite likely dead.

34,aimless-46,Not Another Unrated Extended Director's Cut,5,14 August 2004,"If there was ever a movie that did not need an extended cut this is the one. This type of full-on parody is bound to miss in places. 'Not Another Teen Movie' has about the same number of never-ending jokes as 'Airplane', with a much lower hit to miss ratio. Although the original DVD included a dozen of the worse misses as deleted scenes, the actual movie would have been better if about 50 of the scenes that were actually included had made the deleted category instead. The original cut must have been a post-production nightmare as the editor found scene after scene that just didn't work but was forced to include one horrible segment after another just to build up the running time. The extended cut not only includes all the original cut's weak stuff but supplements it with the mega-garbage that was originally trimmed. So save your money and stay with the cheaper and SHORTER version-you won't be missing anything worth viewing unless you want it to torture your friends.To be completely fair this movie did not stand much of a chance. The teen movies they go after do not lend themselves to this treatment ('Can't Hardly Wait' is already satirical).Instead of being clever, these filmmakers accomplish little more than recycling copycat material from a host of teen films they think they are skewering in a cool fashion. You soon pick up on a lot of negative energy from the cast, they just don't seem to be getting much enjoyment from working with this material, there is no spontaneous merriment.It is not a 'little' movie, Gallen had a large budget and assembled a professional crew who shot a technically (camera-audio-direction) sound film. But when your pre-production phase can't manage more than a few hundred regurgitated inside jokes and clueless dopey references that fly over the head of the targeted demographics, no amount of competent production talent can save the day.A good way to make an objective assessment of a project like this is to imagine which of the participants would actually want this to be a part of their resume. Aside from the camera, audio, and wardrobe people it is a career breaker. A notable exception is Mia Kirshner, who was able to turn what is arguably the movie's worst role into a showcase of her considerable talent as actress. Her part (the incestuous mean girl) is poorly written and totally unfunny yet she finds a way to play it so it actually works. Talk about turning adversity into opportunity.If watching Mia is not enough reason to sit through the film there is also Chyler Leigh and Jaime Pressly-even if their acting is average their decorative qualities are exceptional. One of the few continuing inside jokes that actually works is how Leigh's 'plain Janey' character in glasses and ponytail (referred to as 'the pretty ugly girl') is actually more beautiful than the glamorous beauty into which she is transformed. And Pressly's 'Bring It On' parody is simply the funniest (and cleverest) scene in the film as she denies stealing a cheer from the black girls and then leads the white girls in the stolen routine with words unchanged: 'We are the North Compton Wildcats, we're black and we know it, we shake our big booties and show it, we ain't white, we definitely ain't white!' At 'John Hughes High School' (shot at same school as ""She's the One"") this direction-less parody plays on in the 'Anthony Michael Dining Hall' and on the field of 'Harry Dean Stadium' (these names are some of the funnier stuff). A bet is made on the metamorphosis of the ""Ugly Duckling Girl Who's Really a Babe Underneath"" (Chyler Leigh). Leigh has two especially funny scenes, one where she is frantically painting and another where her entire extended family blunders into her bedroom while she is using a vibrator (much like the zipper scene in 'What about Mary').In the movie's second funniest scene, a naked foreign exchange student (based on Shannon Elizabeth's character in 'American Pie') speaks in her native language and the subtitles work their way around her breasts so as to NOT obscure her nipples.",Not Another Teen Movie
35,raulfaust,Another teen movie,6,14 January 2011,"Well, this movie began with quickly and funny jokes, made me presume it was going to be a hilarious one. The spoof about Cruel Intentions was quite funny and the girl who played ""Catherine"" did a great job, she was identical to the original character played by Sarah Michelle Gellar. The kissing scene was professional and didn't look amateurish as I thought it was going to look (and also funny).I think I missed many spoofs since I haven't watched many of the movies spoofed here, so I don't feel able to say which parts weren't funny. Comparing it to the others ""Something Movie"", I consider this weak. Meet The Spartans, Scary Movie (all), Superhero Movie and Disaster Movie were funnier in my humble opinion, and this movie seemed to be a little racist to me. Still not a bad movie, it's entertaining until 50 minutes, we have some easy laughs and lots of pretty faces to look at.Edit: it's interesting to notice how the pattern of woman's beauty has changed in the last years. In ""Not Another Teen Movie"" we can notice how skinny the girls considered sexy were, and we all know that in nowadays' pattern women are heavier and have more muscles in the sexy parts (I don't know if I can say that words here).",Not Another Teen Movie

This movie kinda mocks every movie with teens in it ever made and does a fine job of it. Till it gets near the ending, because the Molly Ringwald cameo is just really not funny and doesn't work. The rest of the movie however, is a hilarious collection of stupid obvious jokes. You know which gag is going to appear where, but you still laugh for some reason. The most important thing about a parody is to at least stick to one story. Even if it is the absolute least serious movie ever made, don't make the plot go everywhere.

But there are more people in the world than teenagers alone and the question is: Will they love it as well? Well, I'm in my late twenties and even though there were some funny parts in it, the entire movie didn't exactly convince me.Normally I always try to tell something about the story, but with this movie that is rather difficult, because there isn't exactly one. It's a mix of several smaller story lines, all based on popular teenage movies from the past twenty years (""The Breakfast Club"" for instance is one of the oldest, but very easy to recognize). You'll see some teenagers trying to loose their virginity, some jealous cheerleaders, a jock who tries to make a prom queen of a poor and dirty girl because of a bet with his friends... In between you'll get some naked breasts, a toilet 'exploding', a lot of farting, ... you know the usual kind of 'humor' in this type of movies.Personally I'm not really a fan of all that toilet humor, but I know that many are.

39,moviewizguy,Not Another Teen Movie!,5,16 September 2007,"At John Hughes High School, the students are the same as just about every other teenager in a teen movie. The popular jock, Jake, takes a bet from Austin, the cocky blonde guy, that he can transform Janey, the pretty ugly girl, into the prom queen before the prom. But two people are trying to stop Jake from succeeding: his evil sister, Catherine, the cruelest girl in school, and Priscilla, the bitchy cheerleader.So, I think, if I'm not mistaken, this movie are written by two of the six writers from ""Scary Movie"", which had become a successful franchise. This is similar to another two writers from ""Scary Movie"" to write ""Date Movie"" and ""Epic Movie"". Well, we all know taking only two writers of a successful franchise isn't enough to make a funny movie.Although being R rated, this film acts like a PG-13 teen movie. The sex and crude jokes are still in here. The fart jokes and toilet humor is still in here. The only thing different is that it's not funny. Most of them aren't funny.So many jokes in here falls flat while some might give you a chuckle. The reason some jokes won't work was that they were already used in ""Scary Movie"" (sad, isn't it?). Another reason is that some jokes have already been used in other famous comedies (like ""Airplane!"").The only jokes that will give you laughs is the fact that this movie spoofs teen movies, trying to make it obvious the use of clichés used in these movies, which I like. I actually like it a lot, and I wanted a lot of those in the movie. That would've made the movie worthwhile.The last 30 minutes of the movie is probably the best part of the movie, which is why I didn't give it a lower rating. The last 30 minutes of the movie is trying to be like the movie that they are trying to spoof, meaning it's trying to be like another romantic teen comedy, starting from losing the girl, and ending with a happily ever after ending.There's nothing new here, except the blasting of the use of clichés used in other movies. I'll try to be lenient and say give this movie a rent if you have nothing else to do. I especially like the musical dance in one part of the movie.",Not Another Teen Movie

This is what I've noticed when rewatching this. It's a bit heavy handed at times, and the jokes are too clumsy to laugh at it, once the element of surprise wears off. But they really nailed some of the genre tropes and patterns. It is mostly mocking 80s teen movies, but people of « my generation » can find spoofs of ones we grew up with, like Cruel Intentions, American Pie/Beauty, Bring it on, She's all That, Never been kissed, Can't Hardly Wait, Varsity Blues, 10 Things I hate About You and Pleasantville. In a way that don't diminishes said movies. The soundtrack enhances that with covers and iconic songs of the most popular movies of the genre (and a couple of TV shows). It's a shame this spoof, that is spoofing plethoras of movies, can only be enjoyed by the same crowd they were intended to. Unlike other parodies, Not Another Teen Movies, can't appeal to a very large crowd, which makes it the bad pupil of the « class ».

41,oneguyrambling,Look at the title - my sentiments exactly!,4,30 October 2010,"I never loved spoof movies, and since ""Scary Movie"" they have only gotten lazier and lazier. Someone needs to tell the writers that cramming in as many pop culture references as possible isn't a joke in itself.It used to be that a spoof movie would take a well known scene and take it in another direction, with ideally humorous results. Now it seems enough that we the audience say ""oh they mean Hellboy"", or ""this is that bit from American Pie"". It doesn't have to be funny apparently. Worse still is that we now seem to have such short attention spans that referencing a movie isn't necessary, simply a viral video or recent event.I guarantee that (if it hasn't already happened) the next spoof movie will include:Christian Bale's now infamous rant. - Sarah Palin. - Britney. Duh! (Not Paris, she's too powerful.) - Swine flu, only it has been spread through sex with pigs. - Somehow Barack Obama will appear, and breakdance.. (you know, because he is black.)And so on and so forth, if there is an obvious theme there it should be that EASY TARGETS are the norm (just like Eminem. Oooh he's having a go at Kim Kardashian, that'll cost him!).Anyway, now to review this piece of crap, and when I say piece of crap NATM is actually one of the better spoofs in the last decade, that doesn't stop it from sucking though.Alarm bells ring with Randy Quaid's name coming up in the credits, though as one of the leading ham actors around he is ideally suited to this throwaway genre.Set in a high school, there is no plot to speak of, only the plots of other teen movies of course. Put simply it copies all the movies where the hot guy must take a seemingly unpopular and ugly girl and make her popular and somehow attractive.The chicks are normally Charlise Theron, Jennifer Connelly types - hardly ugly ducklings - at least NATM knows this. But once they make this clear there aren't any more decent jokes to come from the premise.I'll try to list some of the jokes derived from stereotypes: - The undercover adult in school who is clearly 50+. - The American Beauty loner guy. - The young guys who wanna get laid. - The cheerleaders. - The eccentric but hopeless friend of the unpopular girl. - The bonehead but still popular football players. - And their coach who swears and shouts a lot. - The sexy exchange student, (who is nude the entire film).Now the three jokes I liked, and really the only three jokes I liked in the whole film.Rather than white guys pretending they're black, one white student spends the entire film pretending he is an Asian guy. (An amusing concept not used in an amusing way.)Every time something happens, a doofy looking guy tries to start a slow clap, only he never gets the support and embarrassingly must give up. (I hate the slow clap in the movies thing so I laughed, and as this was what the writer's aimed for I must give credit.)Mr T appears as the ""wise janitor"" with some sage advice and the A-Team music plays, although most people watching the film nowadays might think ""Oh the guy from the Snickers' ad!"", rather than a pop icon of the 80's.I liked the nude exchange student thing, but it wasn't funny after the initial second. So you might have to guess why I liked it. (Hint – I'm a guy.)What more to say, the female cast is hot-hot-hot, but who cares? Jaime Pressley is the only recognizable cast member who isn't making a ""look at me"" cameo, and she's hardly a big name aside from My Name is Earl.There are about five so called jokes in the movie that you can't see coming a mile off, and when you don't see the punchline it invariably fails or falls flat. I hate the insinuation that we as movie goers should find any of this funny but even the cookie cutter crap Epic Movie, Date Movie, Disaster Movie bullsh*t still make money for the assembly line hacks that make it and have the audacity to release it each year.The fact is I haven't seen many of the movies referenced in NATM, but it doesn't seem to matter as most of the time I knew what they were talking about and didn't just care.Perhaps if you actually love those movies you might find some joy here, if that is the case, you are a sad strange little man, and you have my pity.Final Rating – 4.5 / 10. Better than many similar films in the genre, but that in itself is the faintest of faint praise. Avoid all of these and tell Hollywood to stop making them.If you liked this (or even if you didn't) try oneguyrambling.com",Not Another Teen Movie
42,baumer,A deceptively smart comedy,9,23 January 2002,"Warning: may be spoilersI have often been accused of living in the past.  People tell me that RAMBO, COMMANDO and PREDATOR are not the be all and end all of action films.  If they aren't then I would like someone to show me a film in the same genre that surpasses it for sheer bravado and audacious enjoyment.  Similarly, I have told anyone that will listen that the teen genre, while enoying a healthy recrudescence at the moment, pales in comparrison to the days when John Hughes ruled Shermer Illinois or Bob Clarke took us to that redneck strip-joint in backwater Florida or Cameron Crowe reminded us what it was like to order a pizza to History class.  These were the kinds of movies that stay with you in your youthful years and they still make you laugh 20 years later when someone says to you ""Hey Bud, let's party!""  Movie characters were icons to the youth of the 80's and although there are a few memorable ones today ( mainly from one franchise, AMERICAN PIE), you just can't compare today's teen films with yesterdays pioneers of the genre.  Let's face it, the teen film craze was born in the 80's.Having said that, let's be fair.  There have been some successful teen films to grace our screens in the last five or six years.  Beyond American Pie, we can't forget films like CAN'T HARDLY WAIT, BOYS AND GIRLS, WHATEVER IT TAKES, 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU, SHE'S ALL THAT and a few others. Although I personally wouldn't compare these films to the greats of the past, you have to give them their due.  Kids from today seem to enjoy these the same way I enjoyed the films from the John Hughes Era.  Put all of this together, and it is a perfect time for someone to realize that a spoof of the teen genre is ripe for the picking.  You have the youth of today and the adults from the 80's that can be your core audience.  If you can somehow manage to write a film that takes a stab at both generations, you have yourself a winner.  NOT ANOTHER TEEN MOVIE is a winner.I have to give full marks to the writers.  Mike Bender and Adam Epstein have taken a plethora of films from yesteryear and today and combined them to make not only a fantastically funny film, but a film that is smart and honest with it's jabs.There are references in here to almost all of the movies from the 80's that you can think of.  Fasttimes At Ridgemont High gets poked fun at as does pretty much every John Hughes film.  I am not sure who plays this one character, but the actor that plays the Anthony Michael Hall clone from SIXTEEN CANDLES was a dead on impersonation.  He nailed his mannerisms, his speech, his look and his entire persona.  Another hilarious homage to the 80's film is Randy Quaid's amalgamation of Andie's dad from PRETTY IN PINK right down to making fun of his own character in WILD LIFE, which was Fasttimes poor cousin.Brilliant observations are also made about the lack of African American characters in these types of films.  One personification of perfection comes during a party when ""the black guy"" walks into the kitchen and sees another black guy having a drink.  He then walks up to him with a confused look on his face and asks him what he is doing here?  The guy replies that he is just having some fun at the party.""But I am the only token black guy in this movie,""The other guy then looks embarassed and says, ""My bad"" and then turns and leaves.There are also slo-motion entrances that are commented upon, the deliberate, slow hand clap and the ugly girl turning into another beautiful creature that no one could see coming.  All in all this film has more intelligent insight to teen movies than you could possibly pick up in one sitting.Does anyone remember the films BETTER OFF DEAD, RUDY, The Breakfast Club, FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF, NEVER BEEN KISSED and RUDY, just to name a few? Not Another Teen Movie has fun with all of them.Spoof movies are never meant to be taken seriously.  They are not going to win Oscar's or even gross 100's of millions of dollars.  But if done right, they will entertain those of us that remember the movies it's spoofing. Scary Movie did that and it made a ridiculous amount of money.Not Another Teen Movie is (and this is no joke here folks), easily one of the top 15 movies I have seen this year.  I don't know if that is more of an indictment of the films that have been released in 2001 or if it is a credit to the film itself, all I know is that I laughed the entire time I was in the theater and I enjoyed myself even more trying to figure out all the movies the film pokes fun at.  If you enjoyed teen films from the past or if you enjoy the recent ones that have hit the big screen, this film is absolutely for you.9 out of 10  You will laugh, and sometimes that is worth the price of admission all by itself.",Not Another Teen Movie

46,SanteeFats,Pretty funny,8,21 April 2013,"Typical high school teen comedy movie. The two main female characters are pretty nice although I am pretty much over Jaime Pressly. She acts more and more like a bitch when I see her in roles now. My Name is Earl is a great example of how her roles are now so hatefully bitchie. The ""poor"" teen girl that the high school quarterback says he will turn into a knockout is a little strange but nice looking. Randy Quaid plays her dad and seems to reprise his roles from the National Lampoon movies, still funny but done before. The prom at the hotel where all the studs have rooms is very stereotypical, but the whole movie is kind of that way. I did find it to pretty funny.",Not Another Teen Movie
47,carbuff,The best parody of this genre ever made as long as you're the target audience,10,29 December 2020,"Jeeze, what's with the low rating. If you're familiar with the source material and you went to high school in America at the right time and place (and it likely helps if it was the worst time of your life), then ""Not Another Teen Movie"" is easily the best parody of all those teen high school flicks that started coming out not too long after I graduated. I'm guessing that this totally twisted and hilarious movie only appeals to those of us who were really there at the time and are capable of laughing at ourselves. I'm well aware that I'm about to get way too glib, but I'm still going to say that this was our Vietnam. If you're too much older than me, this movie is no doubt just super dumb and crude, and if you're too much younger, then no doubt you were too sophisticated before you even left grade school, at least from what I've seen. If it hits the target audience in terms of age though, me for instance, then this stuff is both painful and golden.",Not Another Teen Movie
48,tbills2,Not Another Teen Movie is easily 1 of 2001's best comedies suitably hilarious for boys and girls!,6,30 August 2015,"Not too shabby, boys, you actually made it funny! A hot young cast featuring future Captain America, future Lyold Christmas, and a buncha future nobodies including Lacey Chabert, who most likely has achieved nothing in her life since she isn't a giant movie star entertaining me since being a giant movie star is the only thing that means anything in this world, Jaime Pressly, who's actually done so good with roles like Joe Dirt or My Name Is Earl but I feel like she deserves better roles.........because Jaime's so incredibly hot, the 3 underclassmen, who are Wang Chung, a kid looking like he's trying out for the lead starring role in Preteen Wolf: The Nerdy Acne Years, and a Chris Klein's look-a-like. Not Another Teen Movie recreates fine scenes from others of America's favorite classic teenage comedies such as American Pie, Cruel Intentions, Varsity Blues, The Breakfast Club, American Beauty, Never Been Kissed, She's the One, Bring It On, 10 Things I Hate About You, Almost Famous, Can't Hardly Wait, and Road Trip as it perfectly and hilariously spoofs them all which are all teen movies. No reason not to see this really raunchy and seriously sexually exposed teenage comedy from the early '00s with a proper sense of humor that delivers the goods, big time. I first thought of giving Not Another Teen Movie a 5 because it's so shitbrained but then I realized I was just being a shitbrain myself so I changed and now I believe it is a 7. So I'll give it a 6. It's so funny! Watch this high school movie with your friends, over and over again. The voices from the side are terrific as are all the super hot babes doing and saying things really hot like lead star Chyler Leigh, who's intro scene is seriously appealing, Jaime Pressly, who looks hotter than anybody in her cheer uniform plus her next-to-nothing sexy little outfits she wears, Mia Kirshner, who does everything way cross the line sexually, big time, and Cerina Vincent, who is literally just naked the whole time.....with a killer rack.",Not Another Teen Movie

This was, however, fairly novel in its send-up of the stupid teen romance films of the last two decades and clever at times.  Unfortunately, most of the humor and `wink-wink' moments will be lost on anyone who hasn't seen the majority of these films, although I can't imagine someone who didn't have an interest in the inspirations for the jokes actually seeing this movie anyway.While watching, look for cameos by various stars of these teen romances  most are handled cleverly.  --Shelly",Not Another Teen Movie

This is not only very short, but so short on originality that the authors have probably only had to write two pages of it themselves. Teen movie's have always been cheap and cheerful products at the best of time, usually including nobodies that are grateful to have jobs and a range of stock characters. Look over the wall at your local college and see the drab clothes, the acne and the awkwardness of the real thing and you realise that reality wouldn't leave the written page. Teen college movie's are not about teens but life in college if the leaving age was 24 and contained nothing but showbiz wannabe's in make up and wonderbra's.From the earliest intro shots (various kids going to school - rich, poor, stupid, slut, etc.) you know this is going to be a shooting fish in a barrel exercise, with the fish anaesthetised in case they move around too much.Don't think for a second I didn't laugh, because I did, token blacks and cheerleaders with tourettes were both funny.

Chlyler Leigh, Chris Evans, Deon Richmond, Mia Kirshner, Jamie Pressly, Randy Quaid, Eric Christian Olsen, Cody McMains, Samm Levine, Sam Huntington, and Ron Lester make a good ensemble for this movie. They all know exactly what they are making fun of. My main problem is the use of She's All That as the main structure of the movie. She's All That reigns as one of the stupidest movies with one of the hottest ugly girls in the history of teen cinema. It makes being opinionated and intelligent seem like a bad thing that should be fixed. This movie may sink too low at points, covering teacher and students in poop, and leaves some plot points hanging, the reporter, but it's pluses out weight it's minuses in my opinion. If Scary Movie can make 144M and have seemingly everyone love it than this deserves some devoted followers as well. It does do a good job of spoofing the fickle and vain youth.*Bruce: This make me a little happy in pants. (Beat. girl lats out a wet fart.)

53,Isaac5855,A delicious send-up of teen angst movies that provides consistent laughs (whether you want to admit it or not!),7,21 March 2007,"NOT ANOTHER TEEN MOVIE is an on-target lampoon of the teen-angst movies of the 80's made by the likes of John Hughes and Chris Columbus that practically took over the movie business during this period. This hilarious comedy, whose primary plot resembles the Freddie Prinze Jr. movie SHE'S ALL THAT, takes place at John Hughes High School (where else?) and follows the rocky, on-again, off-again romance between hunky jock Jake (Chris Evans)and the brainy bookworm/artist Janey (Chyler Leigh). Janie's perverted, drunken, lazy bum of a dad, perfectly played by Randy Quaid, resembles Molly Ringwald's dad in PRETTY IN PINK and Jake's sister, Catherine, is an on target dig at Sarah Michelle Gellar's character in CRUEL INTENTIONS. If you watch closely, you will also observe affectionate winks at THE BREAKFAST CLUB, ST. ELMO'S FIRE, FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH, 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU,SIXTEEN CANDLES, BRING IT ON, and LEGALLY BLONDE among others. There is one gag after another and they don't all work, but they come at such a lightning pace, the duds can be overlooked. Needless to say, if you haven't seen the movies being lampooned, most of the film will be meaningless to you, but if you know the movies, there is no way you cannot be entertained by this on-target spoof. Performances are energetic and over the top with special nods to Quaid, Jaime Pressley as a bitchy cheerleader, and Eric Christian Austin as Jake's competition for Janey. There's even an amusing cameo appearance by the queen of 80's teen angst, Molly Ringwald. For solid ""you don't have to think about them"" laughs, you can't beat this one.",Not Another Teen Movie
54,moviesleuth2,Some big laughs,7,9 July 2010,"I don't pretend to be well versed in the kinds of movies that ""Not Another Teen Movie"" lampoons. I haven't seen any of John Hughes' teen-oriented movies, but some of the big ones from the nineties have made it on the ever-growing list of movies that I have seen. Still, like ""Scary Movie,"" which started the spoof craze (that has LONG since worn out its welcome) the humor is such that one doesn't have to view every movie that is skewered by the film.""Not Another Teen Movie"" takes potshots at a slew of teen movies, but the story (if you can call it that--it's really just a clothesline to string the gags) mainly follows the plot of ""She's All That."" Jake Wyler (Chris Evans) is the most popular guy in school. After being unceremoniously dumped by his equally popular girlfriend, Priscilla (Jamie Pressly), he makes a bet with his friends that he can turn any girl into the prom queen. The selection is of course Janey Briggs (Chyler Leigh, who is surprisingly on-target in her portrayal of Rachel Leigh Cook in ""She's All That""). Of course, they fall for each other (duh!).Like all saturation comedies, the humor is hit and miss. Some of the stuff is funny, others don't work or are a bit too obvious. Even during the dead spots between the big laughs, there are always some clever asides that are amusing.None of the actors are big names (Mia Kirshner and Lacey Chabert made their names later on), and for the most part, it's not hard to see why. Chris Evans is one of Hollywood's big ""why's?"" He has little to no talent, yet he's making big money. Whatever appeal he may have is not on screen in this movie. He's more wooden (in a bad way) than the Freddie Prinze Jr., whom he's parodying, and he's too fatuous to be funny, even for a satire. More impressive is TV actress Chyler Leigh. She's one to watch. Mia Kirshner is solid, but not as deliciously evil as Sarah Michelle Gellar in ""Cruel Intentions"" (special note about this reference-it points out how twisted the plot of ""Cruel Intentions is). Eric Christian Olsen is annoying (Olsen CAN act, but just not in comedy). Special appearances from Randy Quaid and Molly Ringwald are good.The problem with the movie is two-fold. The film lacks focus and director Joel Gallen makes some of the gags far too obvious. Admittedly, the point of the movie isn't to tell a story, it's to rip other stories to shreds. Be that as it may, the film seems more like a series of comic set-pieces than an actual movie, something that didn't occur with the much funnier and successful ""Scary Movie."" The other problem is more serious because it ruins many of the potential jokes. A degree of exaggeration is key for humor, but even that has its limits. Unfortunately, Gallen doesn't recognize this. Then again, with someone who's background is in MTV, I guess that's to be expected.It's no classic, but there is enough stuff to make it worth a rental.",Not Another Teen Movie
55,cardsrock,Worse than another teen movie,4,13 March 2019,"Why are there so few good spoof films? They always end up being lazy and unfunny copies of what they're spoofing. There was a scene straight out of The Breakfast Club. It wasn't a spoof, it was literally the SAME scene but remarkably less funny and with nothing added to it. You can spoof something and still have some charm and originality. Sadly, Not Another Teen Movie is pathetically lacking in both of those areas.",Not Another Teen Movie
56,Horror-yo,The only ever good spoof film (with Scary Movie),8,21 May 2016,"This film is to its genre and comedy more largely as essential as the films it makes fun of or references throughout its playtime. The jokes are actually funny, the caricatures, the dialog, the concepts...it's just really funny stuff if you know what they're making fun of. The humor isn't over-the-top trying hard to force you to laugh, it's over-the-top in how it makes blatant, unadulterated fun of the movies it spoofs, and it does it really, really well. It also, ironically, serves as a fantastic cinematic catalog or compilation that reminds us of all those teen movies, that late 90's/early new millennium era, cheesy as hell, with all the nu-metal bands and Britney Spears, American Pie, the seminal days of the internet and that teen culture that expressed itself ever so awkwardly and vainly. The cool cliques at school, the nerdy feminist girl, the white guys who think they're black or Asian, the utter idiocy and thickness of the teen movies...it's all there, and in good taste and strong satirical work - and however one may be biased in a generational way, this film for what it is, in its context, is really a gem.",Not Another Teen Movie
57,Horror-yo,MUCH better than you'd expect,8,18 December 2017,"So the first thing to say here would be that this film suffered tremendously from context and generic reputation: all the such spoof movies made shortly after this one have been horrendous in quality and of the utmost imaginable complacency not worth anyone's time, not for the cheapest most intoxicated laughs. Just abominations. This one actually achieves the set goal. It's a perfectly well written, perfectly paced parody of all those terrible teen films in the late 90's early 2000's that somehow still managed to get an emotional grip on even the least likely to indulge in dramatic/romantic flicks. Every teen in the 90's has had some kind of experience with ""10 Things I Hate About You"", ""Cruel Intentions"", and for boys was once in love with Sarah Michelle Gellar or probably Ryan Phillipe for teen girls. It's just that setting, those songs (""Kiss Me"" by 'Sixpense None the Richer'), those faces, that vibe from that era; all so familiar and made into something of a pop-culture heritage for the teens of that time.Anyways apart from that ""historical"" exploration for context, the film in and of itself is actually very funny. Obviously, it's made much funnier when the viewer actually has background on the specific films being referenced. The film manages to be a very thick, overly exaggerated sort of parody while still avoiding being gratuitous and comedy overkill (which the later such films were so guilty of doing). It's completely 'meta' and hovers right over the typical storylines of the typical teen film, but manages to not be too clever with itself or quite a straight-up explanation of just why these films are so stupid. It doesn't get annoying and redundant at that, the jokes manage to expose the idiocy and inconsistencies of the teen movie with freshness and just a little bit of subtlety (though not too much !...). Plenty of references and easter eggs even outside the universe of teen movies to be enjoyed, character mannerisms and repetitions that become contagious (""Goddammit !!"", the slow clapper, all of Malik the token black guy's scenes), flat-out outrageous concepts/scenes. Finally, the thing they managed to do well is actually make this into a teen movie of its own, just with the difference that the plot's very self-conscious: but Chris Evans, the gorgeous Chyler Leigh, Jaime Pressly, Olsen, the three guys who want to get laid... all help craft a familiar framework and form an emotional attachment of sorts for the viewer with those actors and the way they look in that film specifically.In short, it's stupid as hell, but good at doing it. 8/10.",Not Another Teen Movie

Most of the casting is good, though Jamie Pressley as the cheerleader is not a good copy of Kirsten Dunst's ""Bring It On"" role.

Although there was too much repetition of some gags, such as the ""pining guy"" (my term not theirs) getting into to many accidents, ala ""Scary Movie"", I sorely missed the following gags:  1) The (female) shower scene; 2) Bullies beating up the nerd; 3) Bikini top stealing dog; 4) Nude beach scene; 5) pulling pranks on the police/principal/(or any authoritarian figure); 6) Blowing up the mean guy; 7) White people stuck in a black bar; 8) Catching the adults having sex; 9) the ""wasted"" druggy; 10) the ""chicken race""; 11) a few outer space aliens; 12) embarrassing the prom queen/ snooty girl by stripping her naked in public; 13) the Nerd getting the sexiest girl in class; 14) panty raids; 15) video cameras in the girl's locker room/dorm/bedroom; 16) the shy kid that has sex with the hottest teacher in school; 17) up the skirt shots, skirt blow ups, etc--They need to make a movie that spoofs the ""real"" classics of teen movies.The adults in this film steal the show (Especially Molly Ringwald)!",Not Another Teen Movie

65,dallasryan,Don't Quite Understand...,8,14 January 2013,"What I don't quite understand is why this movie has such a low IMDb rating. This is one of the top 10 funniest spoofs ever made. In about the last 10 years no movie has been able to touch the brilliance of Not Another Teen Movie. In the last 10 years, most of these so called 'spoofs'(if you want to even call them that)go off of a popular movie, and then they make jokes about that movie, but not about the popular movie itself, the jokes are made to what is hot and hip and in the now in our modern day culture. For example, Epic Movie plays out The Chronicles of Narnia aspect, but yet they don't make any jokes ripping into the Chronicles of Narnia, instead it has the Centaur rapping to a popular song while he's showing his crib off to the girl. Basically what they're doing is mixing The Chronicles of Narnia with MTV Cribs and Rap videos. It's not funny though because it's not relevant to the movie itself, which is The Chronicles of Narnia. And the reason it's not relevant to the movie itself is because it is mass produced puke that's been spat out by 4th rate writers who can't write their way out of a paper bag. So most spoofs nowadays use this type of formula. Using pop culture within the moving they're suppose to be spoofing and it doesn't work, it's very stupid and unfunny. The only one that kind of worked with this style, and only because it made fun of the movies it was going after(at times) was Date Movie. And the only times that Date Movie was funny was when it made a joke relevant to the movie it was making fun of. And this is the exact reason Not Another Teen Movie is so freaking hilarious. It's first rate writing, actually some brilliant writing, mixed with some pretty good acting believe it or not. There are no cheap laughs or pop culture b.s. within Not Another Teen Movie. Every movie Not Another Teen Movie plays off of, it makes some great observations and relevant inside jokes towards that movie that it's making fun of and because the jokes make sense in their relevant nature, it's hilarious. Not Another Teen Movie doesn't go for the cheap joke, it's written so good that it doesn't have to go for a cheap joke that doesn't make any sense. It makes fun of everything from American Pie to Never Been Kissed. It also makes fun of She's All That a lot. Not Another Teen Movie points out how obviously beautiful Rachael Leigh Cook's character was in She's All That and the writers drive that point home with the hilarious spoof they do on the scene about the bet of picking a girl to be this years homecoming queen. Then Not Another Teen Movie makes fun of Varsity Blues, and they drive home the fact of how ridiculous it was to leave Reggie Ray(his name wasn't Reggie Ray in Varsity Blues, but it's the same actor) on the field and they also make fun of how many concussions he has left until he goes into pretty much a coma. Then they drive home that fact with Reggie Ray even more when the coach says 'Can He play?' 'He's Unconscious.' 'But Can he Play?' 'I don't even think he can breathe.'And Not Another Teen Movie doesn't just stop there. It makes fun of the movie process altogether. As one of the football players on the field in Not Another Teen Movie has a jersey on that says on the back of it 'Extra'. Hilarious stuff. This movie goes so deep and rings true on all levels that it goes after. Every joke is pretty much a hit, where as nowadays with the spoofs that are made, every joke is pretty much a miss. Not Another Teen Movie spoofs a lot of popular movies and it points out the ridiculous nature of all of those popular movies and because that ridiculous nature rings true and makes sense(And that's been the main problem for the last 10 years on spoofs, they don't ring true or make sense to the movie they're making fun of/spoofing on), it makes Not Another Teen Movie a classic!

Consequently, the opportunity to attend a sneak preview always felt like a treat.  However after having my life force drained by such bombs as ""Tomcats"", ""Freddie Got Fingered"" and ""The One"", I've become a tad apprehensive. Can you blame me?The plot for  ""Not Another Teen Movie"" is lifted directly out of  ""She's All That""  - the cool guy takes a bet that he can to turn the nerdy girl into a goddess.  This time however, it's intended as a comedy that throws together every cliched character from the genre in a series of unrelated rambling sequences with references to teen movies from the past two decades.  From the Brat Pack films of the 80's to the indistinguishable teen romance flicks of the 90's to the virgins-dire-to-get-laid farces common to both decades, everyone is represented - whether or not they should be is an entirely different question.There is no continuity to speak of in this movie, and unless you've seen most of the films in question (which unfortunately I have), many of the in-jokes will be lost.   This is important when you consider that most of the 80's references will be lost on the target audience who wasn't even born when the films came out.While there are several amusing gags - I smiled at the ""American Beauty"" and ""Grease"" references - the bulk of the humor scrapes the bottom of the gross-out comedy parody, relying on waterfalls of feces, homophobia, incest jokes, racial slurs, debasing misanthropy, and enough pointless swearing to make a sailor blush.

This blatantly extracts the Michael out of any and every `teen movie' dating back from `Grease' right up to `Bring it on'. It throws gags at you left, right and centre and although some parts are just plainly not funny, if you have seen at least 50% of the films it parodies then you should enjoy it. The story takes the basis of `She's all that' and throws in characters, situations, quotes and anything else it likes from other films. I loved the character known as Malik  - `The Token Black Guy' (Deon Richmond  Trippin), while Lacey Charbert (Lost in Space) is cute poking fun at Jennifer Love Hewitt's part in `Can't Hardly Wait'. The best scene by far has to be the `Breakfast club' rip off  - where Paul Gleason reprises his role as headmaster Richard Vernon, while Cody McMains becomes a deadringer for Judd Nelson  `mess with the bull young man, you'll get the horns!'  great stuff.",Not Another Teen Movie
72,oshram-3,Raunchy but funny,6,6 December 2004,"By and large I'm not a big fan of spoof movies  they tend to get silly and stupid and usually have one really good laugh that is spoiled by being in the trailer (which they sort of have to do or you wouldn't go, but that's the point). I missed this one when it came out, though I really should have seen it because I'm still a sucker for a well-done teen flick. But I caught it last week on TV, when it was heavily abridged; while I thought it was funny, I wanted to see it in the way it was intended it, so I rented it and took a look.Not Another Teen Movie is absurdly funny in spots. It pokes fun of movies from the John Hughes 'classics' of the eighties up through movies like Bring It On, She's all That, Cruel Intentions, and so on. The premise is mostly stolen from She's All That: witchy cheerleader Priscilla (Jamie Pressly) dumps jock Jake (Chris Evans) and his callous (and especially stupid) friends make him a bet that he can't turn an ugly duckling into a swan. Enter Janey (Chyler Leigh), who like every girl in these movies is actually very pretty but here hides it behind glasses and a ponytail. Jake has to transform Janey into prom queen material, which he attempts to do with the help of his extremely disturbed sister Catherine (a skilled parody of Sarah Michelle Gellar from Cruel Intentions, handled well by Mia Kirshner) Along the way they encounter every stereotype from every teen film, from the horny younger brother (Bring It On's Cody McMains) to the bitchy pretty girls, to parties, the prom, the big finale, the pining best friend, and so on. Just about every cliché is touched on, some with more wit than others.The movie is also exceedingly raunchy. There's gratuitous nudity (one foreign exchange student never actually wears anything at all), a lot of swearing, and an awful lot of bathroom humor (some of it literal). There are also a number of fun cameos from a few of the actors who starred in the eighties film (the teacher from The Breakfast Club, for example), including a surprise at the end that's incredibly funny. Not Another Teen Film isn't brilliant comedy, and sometimes it tries too hard (or like in the parody of the kissing scene between Sarah Michelle Gellar and Selma Blair from Cruel Intentions, it goes way too far), but there are some really good laughs sandwiched between the raunch. The movie manages to consistently elicit chuckles, and it's certainly worth a look for those of us who grew up on these films twenty years ago or still enjoy the new crop being churned out.",Not Another Teen Movie

Much like you would expect, ""Not another teen movie"" is packed with all the predictable slapstick, sexual and gross out jokes that a parody of teen movies is guaranteed to have, resulting in a satire that knows what it's making fun of and goes for the right kind of jokes, even if the results are rather hit or miss.",Not Another Teen Movie
79,Mr. Pulse,Not Smart Enough,5,22 December 2001,"This movie is trying to make fun of numerous teen movies; primarily ""She's All That,"" ""Varsity Blues,"" and ""American Pie.""  There are jabs at probably a couple dozen other movies.  I'm all for making fun of movies, and certainly there is a lot to make fun of in some of these films (""Down to You"" I'm looking at you).  But in order to make fun of a film, you yourself have to be smarter than the subject matter you are mocking.  And I'm not entirely convinced this film is there.The potential for truly intelligent satire might have been here, we'll never know.  The biggest problem is the creators truly underestimate their audience.  After almost every joke, there is an explanation for the joke. For example, in one of the few smart bits, a character tries to start a cliched slow, building applause.  But because he does it at such an inopportune moment, it doesn't work.  Very funny.  But then a character comes over (Oddly, Melissa Joan Hart in a cameo) and explains that that won't work now, and he's got to wait for the right moment.  Very unfunny. Give us a little credit; we get the joke, we don't need our hands held.This hurts the movie because parody works best when its characters aren't in on the joke.  In Blazing Saddles, the townspeople don't go ""Oh that man is tricking us by holding a gun to his own neck.""  They go ""Would someone help that poor man?!?""  In ""NATM"" every character is completely aware of themselves, and so instead of building off of stereotypes, they are mired in them.  For instance, the black character knows he's only supposed to say silly retorts that add nothing to the conversation.  Funny when he explains it; not funny when for the rest of the movie he actually only says those three things.  Instead, why not have the character only say three things, and then have other characters question him on his bizarre behavior.  Same goes for Bruce, a white kid who thinks he is Chinese, funny at first, not funny for the last seventy minutes of the film.  The foreign exchange student character probably sounded funny on paper, but it's so over the top it's downright exploitative.I liked a few of performances; the character of ""Ox"" is an incredible impression of Chris Klein in every movie he's in.  And the film makes excellent use of its soundtrack; all the moments they are making fun of have the original songs in the background (""Kiss Me"" when the ugly duckling walks down the stairs in slo-mo, for example).  It even has a cute song and dance number.In any case, there is potential here, and certainly a couple of big laughs. But the film thinks it is a whole lot smarter than it is.  I guess in that sense, it really IS just another teen movie.",Not Another Teen Movie

Occasionally, something semi-clever surfaces, like the white kid trying to be asian to lampoon how dumb some people look when they try to act asian or black.

Not Another Teen Movie fills the need to poke fun at the teen genre, and does so by lampooning the last twenty years of teen films, from The Breakfast Club all the way to Bring It On. Molly Ringwald is even dug up for a solid cameo that links two generations of ridiculous teenagers on film.The movie's greatest strength is that despite it being so ridiculously over the top, you realize that the teen movies parodied were quite ridiculous in their own way. To that extent, each spoof casts a farcical light on a ""serious"" movie that we realize, perhaps again, perhaps not, was difficult to take so seriously.What the movie lacks in originality, it more than compensates for in execution of a good formula. The cast does not particularly stand out (except for a humorous cameo by Mr. T poking some fun back at Eddie Murphy), but in a way that's also good because there are no stars obscuring the material, which shines. The jokes are threaded together by what passes for a decent plot in its own right, with the plot itself a parody of...not another teen movie.This movie is a must-see, since you'll always wonder what they did until you see it.

83,Sparrowmaniac,Greatest Teen Comedy of the Decade,8,23 September 2007,"Not Another Teen movie is a collage of all the top teen movies of the recent years. It projects all the funny aspects of the teen movies in an amusing, amorous manner. It is a spoof in its truest form, but then again not a spoof at all.We meet up with these characters, Jake Wyler, the humdinger high school kid, son of a rich guy, who believes that he can get any girl in high school he wants. His twisted sister Catherine, whose ultimate fantasy is to do it with her brother. (Cruel Intentions anyone ??) Then we have the innocent yet stupid Janey Briggs, a girl whom almost everyone considers to be un-date-able. Her sex maniac brother Mitch and his two friends Bruce and Ox. Jake's witty linguistic friends, Austin, the mighty Reggie Ray and the insanely funny Black guy Malik.(This is so much like Varsity Blues) Then there's Jake's ex girl friend Priscilla and her weird boy friend Les. (American Beauty). Plus there's a multitude of other small characters who make this movie more colorful and hysterically funny.The plot is pretty simple, considering that the central plot is almost a rip off from the movie Can't Hardly Wait. But it is forgivable because it is so funny. We got this spoilt kid, who just got dumped by his smoking hot girl friend for some weird photographer guy. So his best buddies get him a bet that he has to date some girl of their choice and make her the most popular girl in college, a.k.a Prom Queen. He takes up the challenge i.e to turn the most hopeless girl as his partner. There are many ups and downs along the way, but eventually they do get together in the last scene. Dang, the last scene with the flight attendant is so damn funny.There's a good soundtrack to this movie if anyone is interested. The screenplay was too funny to be true. It got me howling throughout the 90 minutes. The acting is just about okay. Kudos to the makers who got this ultra brilliant idea of NATM.I would disagree that NATM is too crude or more raunchy than its purpose. Yes, its a teen movie and it is directed to an audience whose age is between 17 to 25. But then again you got the R rating coming along with it. And to those who scream at American teen comedies being too raunchy, give me a break. Because it is absolutely impossible to meet up with someone in his mid thirties who hasn't seen American Pie, NATM, Ten things I hate About You, or any from National Lampoon's production house.Besides when you are reviewing something like NATM, there's not much you can say is there ??",Not Another Teen Movie

Meanwhile, her little brother is in pursuit of the most beautiful girl he's ever seen when he's not getting into trouble with his geeky friends. Of course, a teen movie wouldn't be complete without a mean-spirited cheerleading captain, a love struck best friend, and a foreign exchange student, all of whom have prominent roles in the film. Throw in a few guest appearances from familiar faces from some of the best-known teen movies of the 1980s, along with remakes of songs from the same films–and even some word-for-word dialogue–and you have an amusing walk down memory lane for anyone who has a soft spot for THE BREAKFAST CLUB, CRUEL INTENTIONS, and PRETTY IN PINK.From the age of parodies, Not Another Teen Movie was released when spoof movies were actually funny and this is one funny parody movie. The movie basically makes fun of teen movies including the story. The story was okay and it made you laugh and the characters were done very well to depict all the stereotypical characters you see in teen movies such as Cruel Intentions, Bring It On, The Breakfast Club and American Pie. The acting was great and the actors and actresses made the characters that little bit more funny. The laughs were definitely there but not in every scene. As you guessed, there would be some toilet humour but Not Another Teen Movie does a good job in handling it well. Overall, it doesn't belong in the pits of Hell with the Seltzer and Friedburg abominations.I personally like this movie. It has some very funny, laugh-out-loud scenes which people could recognise from their favourite teen movie, however there were a couple of scenes that weren't funny but you forget about that. I just watched it for what it was: A funny, silly comedy that shouldn't be taken seriously. You know by looking at the trailer it's not going to win any awards for anything and you know it's not going to get many positive reviews but from me, it does.

This is my first favorite movie with her in it. Sam Huntington is a great actor too. I am also somewhat of a Randy Quaid fan and characters that are crazy Vietnam veterans.

86,Gambitt,"Not great, but not awful either",6,15 December 2001,"I think a lot of the flak this movie is getting nailed with is coming from people who don't really understand what parodies are.  All in all, NATM is a decent comedy spoof.  Even the harshest critic will have to admit some scenes were hilarious and many jokes were clever.NATM has been criticized for its frequent descent into pure raunchiness, blatant sleeziness, outrageous violence, and low-brow slapstick.  To some extent, I believe this may have been an intentional slap in the face of the viewer.  This was the movie's way of saying, ""See how vulgar the media that entertains you has become?  This is awful, but you will watch and you will be amused.  See how low we've come?  ""Hardcore movie fans will be rewarded with a landslide of movie references and gags.  The downside is that mild movie goers will miss many of the jokes.  The overall plot primarily spoofs Pretty in Pink and She's All That. Viewers should definitely be at least vaguely familiar with those two. Other semi-important study material include: Varsity Blues, 10 Things..., Never Been Kissed, Bring It On, Breakfast Club, American Beauty, American Pie, She's all that, Can't Hardly Wait, Cruel Intentions.   If you haven't seen all those, don't sweat it;  you'll just miss a few gags here and there.There is a horde of other references.  The movie actually tries to touch base with a bit too many movies.  A few of the gags and references are almost so obscure as to be useless(Almost Famous??).  And some of the target movies were actually spoofs themselves.Another flaw is that occasionally, NATM became a bit too self-conscious, and the ending really began to drag.  Overall, it ran a bit longer than necessary.I give Not Another Teen Movie a 6 out of 10.  Go with a bunch of friends and just have a good time.",Not Another Teen Movie

Even the spoof of ""Breakfast Club"" is almost an identical recreation until the tail end of the scene.Sadly the filmmakers decided to go for the vulgar gross out which they achieved many more times then I care to count.

It contains a lot of real original characters. Maybe the jokes are tasteless, but all the people have some kind of live. For example, they feel embarrassed if something embarrassing happens. That is what makes the jokes themselves actually funny !Not so this movie: every scene is clearly arranged as a pure parody, so there are no characters at all, therefore there is really no room for any sympathy. Too, if you know the original movies, you know whole scenes in advance.

They really continue the tradition of grossout teen comedies in trying to outdo the last at making the audience cringe at every moment. Admittedly, I laughed occasionally, but for nearly all the film I was covering my face, not only so I would not have to look at the screen but also so no one could see me actually watching this drivel.When it comes down to it, it's really nothing more than a bunch of badly connected spoofs of various teen movies of the past five years, all poorly written and with the responsibility on the audience to laugh rather than giving them something to laugh at. Some of the spoofs are almost good (the ripoff of 10 Things I Hate About You on the sports field is perhaps the best in the film) but they're not funny. And unlike the surprisingly entertaining Scary Movie, this one doesn't manage to worm this satire into a plot, simply because it doesn't have one.While I was able to tolerate the first half hour of this rubbish, by the end it was absolutely nothing. Awfully written and with the most inane dialogue I have ever heard outside Scooby-Doo and with very much the same embarrassing effect.

If one were to like every single movie ever made, then there wouldn't be movie critics. By the way, that quote in the summary is one of the funniest lines in the movie. This movie has plenty of fun spoofing THE BREAKFAST CLUB, PRETTY IN PINK, American PIE and, the one that probably gets spoofed the most in this movie, SHE'S ALL THAT (which, by the way, wasn't all that). The party scene where the girl is walking through the house naked prompting another naked party going girl to say to her friend, ""Oh my god, I can't believe she's wearing the same outfit as me."" to which her friend replies, ""It looks much better on you."" I laugh all the time on that part. NOT ANOTHER TEEN MOVIE is pure, no thinking involved, stupid comedy. But, like with SCARY MOVIE 3, I like this brainless stuff.

The movie is a satire of Pretty in Pink, The Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles, etc.The humor is raunchy but also hilarious. The jokes are setup well and the characters from the 80s movies are nailed. Everything is played over the top and for laughs.There are a few gross scenes in the movie that are forgivable because of the amount of jokes that actually work. The jokes that work are laugh out loud funny. IMO, this may be the outrageously funny ever made.This is the movie that the Scary Movie franchise wanted to be. Scary Movie had a few laughs with it's parody of horror but this movie hits more than it misses which is the opposite of the Scary Movie franchise.I do believe this movie would still be funny to people who have not seen all the 80s movies but those of us who grew up with those movies will appreciate this move a great deal more.The last 30 minutes of the movie starting with the prom is perhaps the most hilarious parody ever filmed.I give the movie 8 out 10 which is as high as I have ever rated a comedy.",Not Another Teen Movie

104,eckhouse24,Not Another Box Office Smash.....,5,18 December 2001,"Not Another Teen Movie is a parody of the teen genre and though some people may think that this genre was in no need of a parody, anything can be made fun of. So thats what Not Another Teen Movie does, make fun of the genre, but it only makes you laugh some of the time. Trying to follow in the foot steps of Scary Movie, Not Another Teen Movie uses some of the old standard but funny gags while also throwing in a lot of the gross-out humor, however, Scary Movie made it funny, Teen Movie made you want to ask WHY? There are Some things that Teen Movie could have done. First, and by far, that asian wanna be kid. Could have been funny, but the gag got real annoying real fast. I like Randy Quaid, but truth be spoken, his scenes were not in any way, humorous. For continuity sake, I know it is a parody, but why were the students playing football, in the cold, wearing their Varsity Jackets, their breath showing in the air, and then the next day, the Senior Prom is taken place. Was there a need to throw in Risky Business, or Ferris Bueller, or Sixteen Candles. A lot of the targeted audience have not seen these movies and the jokes were just not that funny. What made movies like Airplane, Hot Shots, Naked Gun, or even Scary Movie (not Scary Movie 2) so great was that they used only a few sources for their jokes. Teen Movie should have stuck more to the recent teen movies, and forgot about the rest. Instead, they tried to think of any movie they can, and make fun of it, losing the audience on the way. On a positive note, when making fun of She's All That, the movie was a lot of fun. The 3 minute Prom song was entertaining, the site gags were on most part funny(the paintings, the pictures, etc...)and when even making fun of other recent teen films, the movie was good. Why, because most people got the joke.All in all, this movie will make you laugh, it will make you at sometimes wish that you didn't pay for it.

It's in fact so bad that I have to make up new words to describe the pure atrociousness of it: ultra-crappy-king-of-garbage, uckog in short. And yes, this really is uckog. The story is a parody of several movies I already hate, and I hate them even more now, because they gave inspiration to this uckog. Every joke is a sex-joke, every sex-joke is useless. This would be okay if the movie wasn't an attempt at comedy, unfortunatley it is, therefor it's full of jokes. Therefor i hate it.The fact that I only smiled once should speak for itself as this is labeled ""comedy"".Of course there are other things that will make you want to swear your face blue: almost everything else. And what are Molly Ringwald and Randy Quaid doing here? Destroying there careers?The only thing that made me give it a 2/10 was ""The beast from Yucca flats"" and Mr. T who appears in a short role.

But I finally gave it a go here 7-8 years later or whatnot, and I have to say that I missed out. There HAVE been a ton of really terrible spoof movies in recent years -- the whole Epic Movie/Date Movie crew, what's left of the Wayans brothers etc. -- but this one was really quite funny. It steals its plot from the ridiculous She's All That, but manages to take shots at the silly clichés from almost every teen movie of the last 20 years (or at least the 20 years before this one came out). Its often clever in its parodies, but its also raunchy as hell, which is either a plus or a minus depending on how delicate you are. As I am pretty much impossible to offend, it was a big plus, and let the movie just go for things that a little kiddie PG-13 film would never have dreamed of touching.No time for being snooty or prissy with this one -- just sit back, leave your pretentiousness at home, and have a good laugh at the mayhem.

People will definitely be entertained watching it, especially if they've seen the large number of movies it references or makes fun of (among them American Pie, American Beauty, Cruel Intentions, Never Been Kissed, 10 Things I Hate About You, and even Grease).In addition, there are lots of cameos that are a delight to see.However, there are lots of very painful scenes and it *is* very graphic and violent, even if those scenes are shown in such a way as to produce a mostly comic feel.As for plot, there's not much there besides borrowings from all the films it references. Visually, it is very similar to the teen movies of late, colorful and appealing, with gorgeous young adults in their 20's playing teenagers. Characters are again borrowed from other films.

Occasionally, something semi-clever surfaces, like using the white dude who acts Chinese to lampoon how dumb white kids look when they try to act black. That really amused me.Other than that, it's a steady diet of low-brow humor. ""NATN"" contains parodies of countless teen movies from the last 20 years. Sometimes, they're actually funny, but other times, all they've done is recreate an old movie scene and hope you laugh from the nostalgia.

112,Cube_TX,Pretty lame stuff,2,14 June 2004,"I really wanted to like this movie and convinced myself for awhile that it really was funny, but recently I realized that I was lying to myself. I saw this only one time -- when a college friend of mine and I used free passes to see it about 2 years ago. I never felt the urge to see it again because much of the humor simply wasn't funny. I can say that I only laughed at 2 or 3 parts:1) When Mr. T makes a cameo and the theme to The A Team is played. My friend and I got a good laugh out of that, though absolutely NO ONE ELSE in the theater laughed -- I assume they were all high school aged or just beginning college and didn't understand the dated joke.2) When one of the characters is running outside dodging cars and passes by ""Spicolli's Television Repair Shop"". I remembered Jeff Spicolli in Fast Times at Ridgemont High saying his father was a TV repairman so I found this to be a bit of a chuckle. Again, the joke is very dated and I think I'm the only one who noticed it.3) When the cast is singing and after the song they stand there like morons wondering what to do next. Great parody of Grease. I don't remember if I actually laughed at the theater, but I know I later found it funny after some thought. It mocked the reality (or lack thereof) in musicals. What exactly DO they do after the song is over? The deification (I just like using that word now) of Grease and its music was never ridiculed better.Anyway, skip this movie. It simply isn't funny enough to buy or rent. You're better off watching Crank Yankers or the Chappelle Show for better (and more) cheap laughs.",Not Another Teen Movie

114,TexMetal4JC,The worst movie of 2001? No.,7,29 December 2001,"The worst movie of 2001? I think not. Let's be realistic, after all.What's worse?A movie that takes itself way too seriously, has no plot, terrible acting, focuses on one overhyped star, is driven by special effects, is entirely unbelievable even for its own genre and is downright boring...Or a movie that refuses to take itself seriously, offending people left and right with jokes and gags, creating a self-parody that is disgusting at parts, offensive at others and hilarious at still others.Well, Tomb Raider was certainly the crappiest movie made in 2001. Not Another Teen Movie isn't even close. Not when Final Fantasy, The Musketeer and Pearl Harbor all followed Tomb Raider's mold.Teen Movie doesn't take itself seriously -- the toilet scene interrupting the professor's comments about how toilet-humor is gross, vulgar and not funny is proof enough of that -- so why should we? To treat Teen Movie as if it's supposed to have all the merits of Citizen Kane is ridiculous!So when I say that the movie is a 7/10, it's not because I think it is very original. Not because the jokes haven't been done before (they have). Not because it isn't terribly disgusting and rude (it is).But let's face it. It's SUPPOSED to be this offensive, and it's not that bad to boot. The acting is very good -- most likely because there's very little to act -- and the directing can't be faulted. The screenwriting can, of course. There's no plot, there's potty humor galore, and that does get old very quickly, the parodies aren't as funny as in say, Airplane! The Naked Gun, or even Scary Movie...But wait! Is there supposed to be a plot? Nope. Is there supposed to be an overuse of potty humor? I think so. It's quite obvious the director and screenwriters stopped taking this movie very seriously when they let loose with a toilet full of crap (literally) and had women walk around completely naked.The aim of the movie is to completely shock/offend and thereby make the audience laugh, even if it's out of sheer disbelief. They succeed, mostly, with the only problems being some of the spoofs were already used, and used better, in Scary Movie. Also some of the spoofs just aren't as funny as they could have been.So because the film mostly succeeds in doing what it intended to do, and because some of the parodies are truly funny (and not just shock-funny), I give it a 7/10.",Not Another Teen Movie

Even today I found myself laughing over the first scene where Janie experiments with a colorful dildo but but never mind. I like what happened when the police nabbed her, pinned her down, and 'put her out'. No, nothing sexual and still it worked.

The humor is based on sex, relationships, puberty, bodily liquids and such – anything and everything associated to the teen movies in general. There's a couple of films on which Natm's plot is based on and more jokes relate to those movies.The cast is OK, Chyler Leigh and Chris Evans leading the bunch, all deliver their lines nicely and are great as the stereotypes that they are supposed to be.There isn't much to say about the film. It does a lot better job than most of the parody films of the decade but still it drags far behind the ""great"" ones, like Hot Shots (1991) or Top Secret (1984).

118,Tolbert,Good for some laughs,8,26 June 2006,"This was a lot of fun. I think that one of the finer aspects of this movie is that it made fun of all the right stuff. By this I mean the irritating commercialized teen movies that we were subjected to in the 90s. Not that I think they were all bad, I liked American Beauty and The American Pie movies but most of the rest of them were unoriginal rubbish.That was the main target of this film and it was great to see that. It also was nice to see the subtle references to the 80s teen movies that really pioneered that genre. I grew up on Weird Science, 16 Candles, Ferris Buellers Day off, The Breakfast Club etc. These are awesome teen movies. There are again obvious exceptions to this but a majority of the 80's teen flicks are just fun! They don't need to teach you how you need to feel about issues, they don't just blindly overlap one another in the way that a lot of ones of the 90's did. They just entertained us and we loved it.(Minor Spoiler) I like the re-creation of (arguably one of the best 80's movies ever) The Breakfast Club. The scene were Mr. Vernon (Paul Gleason) goes into the library to investigate a ""Rukus"". That is hilarious. It was great to see Paul Gleason reprising that role. He nailed it! Twice to be exact. The cameo appearance by Molly Ringwald and her Dialogue/ reference to her own films was also funny.If you want a good sit down and laugh session, this is your movie. I'd recommend not showing it to the youngsters but it's good for those of us it's intended for.

There are plenty of movie quotes and references only the hip will get here but the story, while a quote itself, doesn't depend on it.

Just before you even see her, she says, ""Flight 193 is now boarding, so if your trying to stop a girl from going on the plane and staying with you instead now would be the time.!"" She also has a good line just before she leaves. Chiler Leigh is also in it who is on that 80s show. The thing that would have made it 50% good, is if Anthoney Michael Hall was in it.

Sure, most of the ones coming out recently aren't all that impressive, but till the early 2000s, most of them definitely had quality. Now, this movie parodies one of my most hated kind of movies i.e generic teen comedies and pulls it off very well.The jokes. Where to start? So many popular scenes from well know teen comedies have been parodied here. From the 'Eat my shorts' scene from The Breakfast Club to the opening masturbation scene of American Pie and many others in between. The film also parodies clichés seen in most teen movies like the stereotypical pointless black guy (who makes it clear he's pointless), the stereotypical slutty European girl and the stereotypical cool guy who learns his the movies lesson and realizes the error of his ways towards the end of the movie after falling in love with an unpopular chick etc. There is a lot of other humour related to typical teenage life, problems and such.

124,Polonius85,A true sign of how much parody movies have lost their roots,5,23 January 2008,"I will admit, the first time I saw this movie, I thought it was hilarious. The second time I watched it (usually this is when I start analyzing movies a bit more) I didn't find it very funny, and saw basically how poorly this movie was written.First off, this is not a parody or spoof. A parody would be a movie that had its own storyline, had subtle, though possibly slapstick, references to the movies or movie genres it is parodying. It does not mean simply taking an existing movie script and inserting fart, sex, drug, and pop culture references.If you have a ""token black guy"", the audience will generally get it. He does not need to announce in every scene he's in that his only purpose is to be the token black guy. Nor do they need the hot foreign exchange student to state that she's there to be the hot foreign exchange student. If they have that role in the movie, anyone who's seen American Pie, or is at least aware of the whole Nadia thing in that movie, will get the joke without having it shoved in their face. In the same way, the ""wise old janitor"" scene could have been funnier if Mr.T had not said, ""I'm the wise old janitor"". Other non-subtle jokes that could have been done away with or changed: The names should not have been so close to the characters they were making fun of (Janny Briggs=Laney Boggs, Amanda Becket=Amanda Becker), and less direct, scene for scene parody. In my humble opinion, if a scene for scene parody is in a spoof like this, it should be of a movie from a completely unrelated genre or, if it is from the same genre, it should be brief (example, the Lady and the Tramp scene in Hot Shots Part Deux and the ""I loved you in Wall Street"" part). To sum up my problems with this movie, it needed to be making fun of the genre of teen movies, not directly every movie in the genre.There were some funny moments in the movie, however. The ""Janny's Gotta Gun"" scene was actually funny. When the principal remarks, ""Who would have thought that everyone in this school is a professional dancer?"" was actually quite brilliant and is exactly the type of subtly that a parody needs.In summery, this was a good idea that was, unfortunately, poorly executed. If Zucker and Abrams Productions get their footing back and return to their roots (as they have recently fallen into the ""scene for scene"" non-subtle reference parodies as well) and make a second installment for this movie, it could actually be pretty good.",Not Another Teen Movie

I went in thinking it would have sucked, and I walked out thinking that it did not suck as much as I thought.They go overboard on the sight gags and rather than funny they come off as immature(even for my tastes!) and not funny. If you want to see FUNNY gross out humor go rent Porky's, or a Troma movie. If you want to see a parody movie that tries to share the spotlight with Scary Movie but fails dramatically, watch this movie.But it also had it's good parts as well. I mean I hate alot of these teen movies where everyone is rich and good looking and the actors playing the teens are like 28 and the plot is guy and girl meet, guy and girl fall in love, guy does something and girl hates him, then guy and girl kiss and make up at the end. And alot of the jokes in this movie poke fun at that overdone plot concept.If you have nothing better to do with that 7-8 bucks in your pocket and want to see a movie, well go to your theater and head for where Another Teen Movie is playing........then think and MAKE SURE there is nothing better worth watching before you go in.",Not Another Teen Movie

I didn't expect to like it, because the only teen movies i've seen are American pie and Road trip, but I really loved this film. It made me laugh so much. Some jokes, i think around about two, i thought pushed it a bit too far with the immature humour, but the rest of the movie definitely makes up for that. Surprisingly this movie has everything; humour, love, fights, someone getting hit by a bus, dancing, singing, it's all in there. They chose brilliant actors, and i like how they chose actors who hadn't done that much, or who i hadn't heard of anyway around the year it was out. I have only decided to watch it now because i like the actor Chris Evans and have seen a lot of his stuff, so i thought i'd add this to the list and i'm glad i did. It's one of the funniest things ever. If you enjoy teen movies this is definitely a must see.",Not Another Teen Movie
134,Don Stephens,American Pile,5,11 December 2001,"What's wrong with this picture?  If any genre--ANY genre deserved a swift kick in the pants it was the sappy teen picture.  The ones where instead of actually having a damn relationship he just converses with his brain-dead best friends about this girl he really wants to talk to.  Then talk to her, for Christ's sakes!  Moaning ain't gonna help matters!Which was why I was thrilled to see ""Not Another Teen Movie.""  I was hoping for something like ""Scary Movie"" which really and truly hated the slasher movie genre.  Here was my revenge on Ryan Phillipe and James Van Der Beek and that odious little simpleton Freddie Prinze Jr., who thieved hours from my life with their whining.  If I want to see someone whine about their relationships, I can rent a Woody Allen movie and actually be entertained!But sadly no.  ""Not Another Teen Movie"" wasn't my sweet revenge on the most lackluster group of films in cinematic history.  It actually pays tribute somewhat to the teen genre instead of ripping it to shreds. You just can't call your target audience on being idiots, I guess.  Instead of single-mindedly making all of it's gags at the expense of the genre it's mocking, ""Not Another Teen Movie"" just settles for grossing you out.  So *this* is how screenwriting students at the bottom of their classes make their livings.I'm not easily offended, nor did anything that happened in this film do so, but gross rarely equals funny.  Do you remember those videos you used to watch in your High School biology class?  You know, the ones about the inner workings of the vocal cords that actually show footage from inside the human body?  That stuff grosses people out, and that stuff is nature.  It takes someone with a brain to be funny.The three best teen films I've ever seen are as follows: Cameron Crowe's ""Say Anything...,"" Wes Anderson's ""Rushmore,"" and Terry Zwigoff's ""Ghost World.""  Why are they better than all the others?  Because they were funny, sensitive movies by funny, sensitive people.  Unlike the products of the other directors, who probably have difficulty remembering that their socks go on first in the morning.But my biggest problem with the movie is the title: ""Not Another Teen Movie.""

In addition to having the same actor(though aged) as one in ""The Breakfast Club"", it appears the same detention room was even used.

140,Ghost the Lost Soul,"75% stupid, 25% funny, but all in all, 100% bad.",3,12 August 2002,">>Pros: Nothing>>Cons: Everything
>>Plot summary: Not Another Teen Movie is a slapstick parody of famous teen movies from the '80s and '90s like The Breakfast Club, Never Been Kissed, She's All That, etc., that makes fun of the stereotypical Hollywood interpretation of high school, but does it with grossout humor.
>>Review: Not Another Teen Movie sounded good on paper and in TV commercials, but it's painfully bad.  I did like the idea of spoofing Hollywood's cherished stereotypes, but the producers just screwed it up by adding all that gratuitous potty humor.  I usually like slapstick comedies, but this one is just horrible.  Not even the cameo appearences by Molly Ringwald, Mr. T, and that one guy from The Breakfast could save this film.

143,jpt27,Not another teen movie comment.,3,9 April 2005,"MY RATING: **/***** Contains sexuality and extremely unfunny jokes, that some viewers may find depressing.What sucks more than anything else is that my whole review of this film can be summarised in just one line of what James Berardinelli said: ""This movie understands the concept of a spoof, but not a satire."" A lot of new shows seem to be doing this. They understand that it's funny these days to be slightly post-modern, being a comedy/actioner/whatever whilst simultaneously mocking the incredulity of its own events.But they don't understand that unless there's a good movie behind it all, then it just all turns into tedious, random, almost hurtful jokes that ultimately make you wish you'd rented something else. If the writers clearly don't care about the material, why should you? 'Not Another Teen Movie' is a spoof of twenty years worth of teen movies. The plot is chopped together from the various classic teen conundrums that have enchanted us over the last two movie-going decades: the bet that backfires, the ugly duckling story, the horny high schoolers and their attempts to get laid etc.The problems in this movie start from the minute the titles roll. I get the feeling the script was written by a bunch of guys remembering the most famous scenes of all the teen movies they had seen, and saying ""Hey guys! I always thought it would be funny if instead of going to the prom with Jenny instead of Katalin, he ... farted in her face and threw a used condom in the face of her strict religious mother! Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!"" Hence, Not Another Teen Movie is basically one scene repeating itself over and over again for ninety minutes. We'll be presented with an instantly recognisable scene, either by use of similar-looking actors (the American Pie sketches did this a lot) or memorable dialogue (for example the Bring It On spoof about being in a 'cheerocracy.') Then something crude will happen, more often than not involving oral sex and/or more oral sex. Or the disabled, or issues of discrimination. Ha ha ha.Such an approach might have worked if the screenplay could have been kept tight, with a small number of memorable characters. Instead, Not Another Teen Movie makes a mission of trying to visit every teen movie that was ever released. Think you're a film buff? Think again. To understand even half of what's being spoofed, you need to have seen more films than Roger Ebert. Too often, the audience is dumped into a scene that makes absolutely no sense at all to the uninitiated. And yet other movies that were primarily spoofs, such as the excellent Airplane! and Naked Gun series, avoided this problem altogether by coming up with witty, original material, and putting in a movie reference whenever the opportunity obviously presented itself.Nonetheless, the makers of Not Another Teen Movie have certainly put together something that will make idiots laugh, and in turn bring in more idiots see it. It's just a pity that beneath the fart jokes, it's so cynically, desperately unfunny.",Not Another Teen Movie

If you aren't, then you just won't get it and you'll think this is just a stupid movie (which it is, but it's funny/stupid if you know the other movies.) I'm sure it doesn't hurt that I graduated from high school in 1989, so I watched most of these movies as a teen to begin with. Molly Ringwald's cameo at the end was a nice touch as well.

145,JokerSwan,Better than I expected,8,12 May 2003,"I rented this movie, thinking it would be another sex-poop-dumb jokes- sketch show à la Scary Movie. I was wrong. This won't become one of the great comedy classics, but it's the best parody of teen movies I've seen so far. Unlike in Scary Movie, the parody is actually clever, and there is great attention to detail. The movie mocks the original teen films, not their audience. For example, the movie doesn't make fun of ugly girls, but rather the stereotype of an ugly girl in teen movies. The ""Cruel Intentions"" parody was my favourite, along with the ""American Beauty"" weird guy character. They were done really well. Some of the jokes, like the pie joke from ""American Pie"", could have been left out though - reusing jokes from the original movie is not very creative. The whole ""we have to have sex before the term is over""-thing, on the other hand, was done well, as the boys making the pact in this movie were 13. They were really cute. There are, of course, bad moments too. What bugged me the most were the constant dirty jokes - how many times can you laugh at an oral sex reference? It gets old really fast. The poop scene was appalling, not funny. But there aren't too many scenes like that. All in all, a decent, funny comedy. With some more work on the story, taking out a few sex jokes and other dumb gags, it would have been a really good movie.",Not Another Teen Movie

149,Cantab04,When will the teen movie genre finally be laid to rest?,5,6 May 2002,"Synopsis: What? A parody of teen movies, and you expect a plot? Maybe you're looking for the wrong film all along? Well, if you must know, the basic plot line seems to be based on She's All That.As stated above, this film tries to make fun of films that were not entirely serious to start with. However, it worked for Scary Movie (at least the first one). But the film's ambition becomes its very downfall: it's all been done before, only it was then still trying to be comedy in its own right rather than parody. To its credit, Not Another Teen Movie is remarkably short on (but not completely devoid of) gross-out gags and sometimes even manages to be funny during the pot-shots at for example She's All That, Cruel Intentions or Never Been Kissed (especially Cody McMains and his horny gang of friends). And it is several notches above the German American Pie-imitations, which most of the readers will be happily unfamiliar with. But it is about time that the teen movie mania comes to an end, although with Slackers and Van Wilder waiting in the wings, it seems that this time has not yet come. Go and see Not Another Teen Movie if you thought Hey Dude, Where's My Car? was the funniest film of this century so far (although to be fair, Not Another Teen Movie is better and funnier). 5 out of 10 (and out of those, half a point each is for Chyler Leigh and Jaime Pressly).",Not Another Teen Movie

Now they shove this disgusting trash down our throats and expect us to swallow it.  This movie was horrible.  Every second of it was sick and completely over the top with toilet humor that couldn't have made me laugh even if the writers of South Park wrote it.  And the director knew it wasn't funny.

It is one of the unfunny, uncreative, one dimensional, movies I can remember, and it's just generally.. well.. boring.Of course it's a parody of ""American Pie"", etc., and thus requires basic familiarity with those films in order to get most of the.. ahem.. ""jokes"".Right from the start, the shameless and unfunny toilet humor beings. We see a girl caught using a vibrator, a roomfull of kids get splattered with feces, a cheerleader with a case of.. er.. irregularity. Die hard fans of these teen movies will get the jokes but still not laugh... others may require medical attention. It's not really a movie, more like awful sketch comedy. Think of a poorly written, unfunny, boring parody of saturday night live.By the way, there is some quality nudity, though not enough to make this worth watching.This is another film, not unlike the horrid 'Freddy Got Fingered', that only dishes out one toilet humor or gross-out joke after another.I can't stress this enough. It's really, really not funny. (John Hughes High?) What do you know, there is a jock (who can't act, like the original) who makes a bet to transform the nerd into a prom queen. the nerd who's in love with the popular girl; the slut who tries to get her brother in the sack; the foursome of cliches wanting to lose their virginity; and the foreign exchange student who is only in attendance to walk around naked.Like many awful movies, the soundtrack is much better than the film itself.

152,qdude440,So so spoof,5,22 August 2005,"Not Another Teen Movie is the hit and miss spoof of the teen 'comedy' genre of the late 90's, spoofing films in the same fashion as Scary Movie did one year earlier. A lot of Not Another Teen Movie feels forced, and some of it is just too silly for words, but other moments are genuinely funny and some of the actors shine in their roles. But in the end, Not Another Teen Movie almost seems to become what it strives to make fun of, another teen movie, with jokes aimed strictly for 12 year olds.For the most part, Not Another Teen Movie seems to spoof She's All That, with the same central plot, a hot shot high school jock is dumped by his girlfriend and so decides to make a bet that he can take the most hopeless girl and turn her into prom queen. Along the way, the film spoofs just about every other late 90's teen flick, and film references all over the place. In the final act, the film seems to almost directly follow the plot of these teen films, offering only a few 'new' moments for the audience to reflect on. For the most part, these teen films that the movie spoofs are just about as funny as Not Another Teen Movie. At times, it really is hard to see the difference between a Varsity Blues and a Not Another Teen Movie. They're almost identical.Some of the cast shines though in their roles, Randy Quaid is solid as always as the no name soon to be prom queen Laney's drunken father, and there are funny references and quotes here and there and funny cameos by Molly Ringwald and Melissa Joan Hart, poking fun at themselves. The script is at times quite weak, but some of the duller moments in the film are made a bit brighter by some of the actors. The film's jokes also variate, going from strictly disgusting, gross out, and low grade, to a silly slapstick brand of comedy.In summary, Not Another Teen Movie is no Airplane, not even a Scary Movie, but some funny moments make up for the weak talent behind it all and prevent it from being another Spy Hard or Silence of the Hams. It suffers from some central flaws, and is inconsistent, but is not the worst way to waste 90 minutes, and there are enough moments in here to make adult film buffs chuckle.5/10",Not Another Teen Movie

The Almost Famous parody made me cringe, it wasn't needed, but the Grease take off?  That had me peeing in my pants!  I thought they would forget about that movie!The acting was wonderful!  No doubt about it!  Props to the casting agent! My personal favorite was Sam Huntington as Ox, who did a very impressable job as the most sensitive guy on Earth, a.k.a. Chris Klien's American Pie charactor, Oz.  I think he deserved more scenes.  Jaime Pressly did a spectacular job playing Precilla, the nasty cheerleader.  She may have been cast to play herself.  Chris Evans did an equally wonderful job as Jake Wylers, the lovable jock.  Chyler Leigh is gorgeous as Laney Briggs, the pretty ugly girl.  Rob Lester does the unspeakable, makes fun of his Varsity Blues charactor, but does a great job!Overall I think this movie was a good laugh!  It lacked plot but, I wasn't looking for a story!  Scary Movie didn't have a story!  And one thing I could do without were the nude women scenes!  But there is a little male nudity, one I would have rather NOT seen, and the other, oh it was great!

163,bdubstater4,"none of the modern spoofs are masterpieces, this one is the best",8,22 February 2006,"The days of Airplane and Naked Gun are over. Nowadays, we have the Scary Movies, Spy Hard, Date Movie, Not Another Teen Movie, etc....of all of these, Teen Movie is quite easily the best one. The point of spoofs and satires, to me, are not just to take familiar scenes and do something retarded and gross with them, but instead to actually make fun of all the things in the original movies that, while watching them, we all turned to our friends and said ""wait a minute, thats kind of stupid"". Teen Movie does this extremely well. How many of us lucky movie fans who saw She's All That had trouble seeing why everyone in the movie thought the lead actress was ugly just because she had glasses and a ponytail? She was still a babe! How many of these teen movies give the main lead actress a friend who is clearly into her, but she always seems to ignore any possibility of romance between them, instead pursuing another character and asking for her friend's help/advice? How many people thought the characters in Cruel Intentions were just sexually over the top to the point of being absurd? Teen Movie pokes great fun at all of these flaws. It is, unlike many other movies that attempt to be like it, a true satire, taking characters and not just doing stupid things with them, but exaggerating the traits of their serious counterparts and, when it comes down to it, just making fun of them. It has surprisingly good plot cohesion while still making fun of a variety of teen movies. I suppose the best way to distinguish this movie from all other modern spoofs is that this one is truly intelligent. Sure it has some stupid jokes, and toilet humor (that I admit I chuckled at in disgust like the diarrhea scene and the lesbian kiss with the old woman), but it also has some very clever jokes, like when is it appropriate to start a slow clap, why do these teen movies seem to only have one black character, and how silly is it that things slow down for emphasis when the beautiful female lead enters the room. Please, give this one a chance. If you've seen the other modern spoofs, I'm confident you will appreciate the noticeable and subtle differences between them and Teen Movie that make the latter much more enjoyable and palatable to watch.",Not Another Teen Movie

It thoroughly skewers everything from The Breakfast Club to Bring It On to Can't Hardly Wait. They even used the same classroom. For those of us who slogged through the Brat Pack movies in our twenties, and now must endure the latest crop of teen movies aimed at our kids, nephews and nieces, it was a hilarious breath of fresh air, as nothing was left sacred. Yes, it was crass, foolish and blatant... but executed with a panache that, if you missed it... well, then either you weren't really paying much attention to the movies it was poking fun at, or you've got some weird emotional attachment to those sentimental 80's flicks.I'm amused at the amount of whining from commenters complaining that it parodies many movies that, ""didn't take themselves seriously and therefore didn't deserve it.""

Unfortunately this film should not even be viewed as a spoof. Over 80% of the film was nothing more than word for word scenes from other movies, being done over by other actors. I found myself ending the sentences of the actors before they were finished. After about 45 mins of trying to endure this film the 3 other people I went with all decided that it would be more humane to leave the theater ,taking the $9 loss, than to have to endure any more of the film.

169,ildudeentertainment,Not Another Bad Parody,9,28 July 2019,"In recent years the slapstick comedy genre has slowly died out and for good reason, most of them are god awful. Now, I'm not going to say this movie should be up for an Oscars (or rather it shouldn't have been) but seeing as it's a comedy it definitely does it's job, ""Not Another Teen Movie"" (2001) is a hilariously good comedy.
As the name suggests the movie parodies a variety of coming of age and teen movies, as well as common high school tropes. Unlike a lot of modern parody movies, many of the gimmicks in this actually feel like parodies of what they're making fun of, allowing the audience to be in on the joke rather than just merely referencing the source material and thinking that's the joke. Sure it relies on a handful of overly gross or raunchy jokes for shock value but for the most part the movie is genuinely charming and has me laughing from beginning to end. As a big fan of John Hughes and other coming of age films, I loved watching all of the iconic moments and cliches have there flaws pointed out or turned on their heads. While I think this definitely adds to the enjoyment, I feel that even just a basic level of knowledge on being a teenager is enough to get you through it highly entertained (source: many of my friends not knowing half the references, and still deciding to watch it every time we hang out).
The core films getting parodied in the movie are ""She's All That"" (1999) and ""American Pie"" (1999) with a helpful dose of ""Cruel Intentions"" (1999) and ""Pretty in Pink"" (1986). It follows Jake Wyler a popular jock played by Chris Evans as he tries to turn the nerdy rebellious girl Jamie Briggs played by Chyler Leigh into the prom queen. Due to the fact that it's a parody, the movie isn't exactly original in its plot, but that's not the point of a parody movie so to judge it on that fact would be unfair. I will, however, say that the writers did a very good job of stitching many iconic scenes from countless teen movies into one cohesive story. I've seen this movie about twenty times (maybe more) and can't think of a scene that felt thrown in or like a cutaway gag. That's not to say that some jokes are a tad random or out of the blue, but you gotta give credit where credit is due.
Then there's the cast, which is mostly filled with now recognizable actors just starting out, but they're all incredibly funny the chemistry between the actors might not be the greatest in the world, but each individual performance is remarkably funny. It's interesting how they're able to embody the character from the source material, all while giving it their own charm and comedic twist. Chris Evans, for example, us hilariously funny as a spoof of Freddie Prince Jr, and I kind of wish he got the chance to be in more comedic roles.
I feel that a lot of times when you watch a movie, it's easy to pick up on actually film techniques that cause a movie to the impressive and forget that the point of art is to accomplish a specific goal, and a comedies job is to cause people to laugh. This is a comedy true and through, as long as you find slapstick parodies funny. Definitely give the movie a watch, it's honestly my favorite comedy of all time and even one of my favorite movies. I would give it a 9/10 as it accomplishes all that it sets out to do, and is definitely Not Another Bad Parody.",Not Another Teen Movie

(well for one it was over and for two molly ringwald's cameo was awesome) it was really nice seeing some of the faces i grew to know as a teenager in this movie (since there were some actors cast that were in 80's teen movies included in this film) but other than that it was truely a waste of time.",Not Another Teen Movie

174,The Spirit 68,Just Another Teen Movie,1,10 April 2002,"This movie is maybe the worst I've ever seen in a cinema. Mel Brooks once said that if you want to parody a movie, this movie must be able to reach a certain level of quality. Otherwise it's too easy to do the parody and a bad movie is of course always a parody on itself.This is the situation we have here. 'American Pie', 'She's All That' and so on are so bad that you don't need a parody to see why they are bad.The next problem with 'Not Another Teen Movie' is that this movie is not a real parody, because it uses the same stereotypes than other teen-movies and that's of course not the way to parody a genre.Also the movie steals just like 'Scary Movie' elements of productions by the Zucker Brothers and Jim Abrahams. OK, 20 years ago their movies were new, but today this kind of silly humor is just old-fashioned. For Example nobody needs the unbearable new movies of Leslie Nielson.But the worst thing about this movie is that it also grabs real movies and take them down into the filth. For example 'American Beauty' and 'The Breakfast Club' are made fun of on a quality-level that's ridiculous.Well I think that's all the main bad things about this movie.What really makes me angry is the guy, who sit next to me in the cinema. He laughed at every stupid joke and always said things like 'Oh, man that's not possible!'. Those guys are responsible for the disappearance of really good movies that are also successful.Ah, by the way count how many people are hit by bikes, cars or buses. I think the number is a new world record.",Not Another Teen Movie
175,cleric20,If you remember the 80's...,7,27 May 2002,"Not Another Teen Movie is, er, another teen movie.  just with added gross out humour. Trying  to do what  Scary Movie did for horror films -Not Another Teen Movie (NATM) bolts the plots of She's All That and Pretty In Pink together, throwing in scenes from just about every other film ever to feature teenagers. Spoofing characters from Breakfast Club, American Pie, American Beauty and Cruel Intentions and with one called 'token black guy', this is not high brow entertainment. It is however vaguely amusing - and if you were one of the sad people who spent the 80's watching all those John Hughes films starring Molly Ringwald you'll find yourself trainspotting all the references to them. Unfortunately, even having one of the best ever cameo's in film history (Molly Ringwald herself, looking a bit old now, who turns up and complains about teenagers today) isn't enough to make this a 'must see'. You'll laugh - but be prepared for some seriously bad taste jokes about vibrators, incest and diarrhoea. You'll see some hunky blokes and well fit females (including the foxy foreign exchange student who spends the whole film in the nude and even has her subtitles arranged around her obvious selling points). And as I said there are a million references to other films - its just that NATM walks the fine line between parody and rip off and too often it falls off the line on the side of cheap rip off. The working title for NATM was 'Ten Things I Hate About Clueless Road Trips When I Can't Hardly Wait to Be Kissed', very droll. Joel Gallen who directs should be ashamed of himself because he has made some excellent promotional material in the past including the superb 'Mission Improbable' where Tom Cruise sends himself up with the help of Ben Stiller as 'Tom Crooze' for the MTV video awards 2001.The NATM soundtrack is pretty cool though featuring re-workings of classic 80's tracks like Tainted Love, Blue Monday and 99 Red Balloons by Marilyn Manson, Smashing Pumkins etc. So in the end what could have been a really funny night out ends up being a bit of a lame er, teen movie.

Not Another Teen Movie is one of those movies where you sometimes cringe from the gross humor, but it also has some good written scenes. It's spoofs movies from the 80's and 90's, so it's not based only around the 90's teen movies. It spoofs such movies as The Breakfast Club, Pretty In Pink, Varsity Blues, Ten Things I Hate About You, and the movie they spoof the most, She's All That. Joel Gallen is the director for this movie, and I have to say, for his first movie, he did pretty good. Some parts are hard to watch though. Like the scene when the 3 teen boys climb through the vent, trying to spy on girls in the locker room and bathroom stalls. They end up spying on a girl going to the bathroom, and fall through the ceiling into the stall, where they fall into a classroom, where the ""poo"" shoots out from the toilet onto them. It is a pretty hard-to-watch scene, but most scenes are funny, although I wouldn't recommend this movie to older adults or younger kids. The actors perform pretty well, with some good cameos, especially from Molly Ringwald from The Breakfast Club.

There were very few redeeming qualities in this movie, and it was only with the cameos made by Mr. T, Molly Ringwald, Sean Patrick Thomas, and Melissa Joan Hart.

Although it does take a small amount of brain power to recognize that the disgusting bathroom scene is a variation of a scene from Detroit Rock City. Remember Anthony Michael Hall? Well, I do and I was in stitches when the name of the lunch room was The Anthony Michael Dining Hall. I am 19 years old and I am a huge fan of *some* John Hughes movies. I thought the jokes about his movies were the best part of the whole movie. Granted, there are a few scenes that were so lame I had to close my eyes to keep a headache from coming on. But all in all this movie was actually pretty smart. It pointed out a lot of things in movies that really ticked me off and most of them happen to be Freddie Prinze Jr. movies.

I'll be honest, I've seen a quarter of the films they parodied in this film, however you could easily see where other films came into it. From the cringe group song for the prom, the Bring It On aspects, the cliché plot that seems to be in every teen film. The Anthony Michael Dining Hall was a favourite of mine at the John Hughes high school. The characters were brilliantly done, I'm surprised they got through filming so seriously. We've got the jock that falls for the nerd girl who turns out to be a hidden beauty through a mini makeover with a slow, dramatic entrance. We've got the boys in puberty, trying to find a semi-naked girl and then the 'token black guy' who says 'whack' and 'damn'. The unruly car collision towards the end, the hold-your-breath football game with a near-death on the pitch. The poor, nerd girl has a dead mother, as usual. The blonde best friend of the jock bully type. One of my favourite scenes was when Jake sang 'Janey got a gun' in a spoof-scene of '10 things I hate about you'. Then the 'breakfast club' scene as I simply dislike that film, I found it rather funny. I can't put into words how remarkable this film is, it's perfectly cliché and cringe with all the best teen movie bits done incredibly well, it's disgustingly crude and blue with same 90s music in the background.

This film is even more offensive and crude (hard to believe, I know) but it's totally predictable and very stupid. It's obviously aimed at teens, who can't legally see it because of the very ""R"" rating (the theater was full of them anyway).  The 13 year old boys loved it, but I have a feeling their parents would be very troubled by that. There is no plot or point. There are some talented actors in the film (not that you can tell) but what a total waste of their careers.  ANYTHING else showing at the theater would be better.  If nothing else is showing in your town, stay home and watch ""Lost in Space"" re-runs on TV - it would be a better use of your time.",Not Another Teen Movie
193,mjt2000x,"Great Premise, But Felt Incomplete",8,2 June 2002,"What the filmmakers were going for was a complete parody on the teen film genre from the 80s, 90s, and 2000s.  While it was a hilarious concept and the outcome was very worthy of note, it felt incomplete.Mainly, the movie never touched on teen flick hot spots ""Clueless"" (the classroom poetry reading scene was perfect for a ""Clueless"" spoof of the debate class), ""Election"" (the Tourett's syndrome girl looked very Reese Witherspoon-ish, but I kept wanting to see an election between her and Austin, the pop jock, with the embittered teacher obstruction and all...), and ""American Beauty"" (yes, we had Wes Bentley's introspective filmmaker, but I wanted Randy Quaid's father to lust for a girl, a la Kevin Spacey's Lester Burnham).ANALYSIS: The movie, a pure farce, is funny, but I left the theater feeling cheated of seeing a true all-around high school joke.  Kudos, however, for ""The Breakfast Club"" scene. GRADE: B",Not Another Teen Movie
194,Vampirok,Stupid comedy----I LOVED IT!!!!!!,8,27 December 2001,"This movie is loaded with toilet humour, crude sexual content and humour, and foul language. But then again, THESE ARE THE REASONS I WATCH MOVIES LIKE THESE IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!!!!!This movie was a total laugh-fest. It may never reach the level that Scary Movie went to, but this is definitely something to watch for anyone who digs teen movies.However, the part where Catherine Wyler (The Cruelest Girl) tongued Sadie (The Undercover Reporter) was not funny. That was this movie's only flaw. I mean, who wants to see drool, especially if a hot young girl is kissing an old battleaxe? Not funny at all. I was blocking out that terrible image with my hands in front of my eyes when that came on.The funniest part of it all was the Horny Virgins. Definitely the Horny Virgins. Especially the guy who thought he was Chinese. That was some funny sh*t. I also found Janey (The Pretty Ugly Girl) and her drunken father to be funny as hell.Overall, this movie was like Scary Movie, but geared (as you can tell) toward teen movie parodies and not horror movie parodies. It is a million laughs if you dig parody flicks. I just wished that the ""Shoot The Sh*t"" song by Bad Ronald played the whole way through, cuz that song rules.Oh, and Areola (The Foreign Exchange Student) is HOT!!!My Rating: 8/10",Not Another Teen Movie
195,mattdowning,"So close, and yet so far",3,30 August 2003,"The inspiration behind this movie had real potential, since many (if not all) of the ""teen"" movies made in the last decade or so are begging to be spoofed.  It could have been intelligent in its jokes based on other movies, but most of the movie is reduced to simple, childish humor.  There WERE some funny parts of the movie, and I'll admit I laughed at some of it, but these instances were very few and far between.  So much potential for a spoof movie, and its squandered because the director, writer, or whoever was in charge decided the real money was in gross-out and infantile humor. Some of the jokes are funny, but mostly its just either gross, or boring. Skip it unless you MUST see how they spoof the other teen movies. 3/10",Not Another Teen Movie

It doesn't even have its own storyline, it just badly rips off other movies. And not in a funny way, it just quotes off other movies, word for word, line by line. I actually had to check to make sure it wasn't a Lionsgate Production.It ripped off American Pie in the most ridiculous of ways and is not worthy to try and make jokes about classic teen movies THAT ARE ACTUALLY FUNNY. I know that I may be biased as I am a big fan of American Pie, but I am a firm believer that a writer should write his own movie rather than stealing parts of other peoples (this might be okay if you took like 5 lines) because I see this as a greedy half hearted attempt to make more money.And Melissa Joan Hart, why they put her character or her in the movie beats me.

Besides from that this new brand of teen movie, provides laughs around every corner, and the more you watch it the more funny it is.This film completely pokes holes in classic teen movies, for example ""billy bob with bacon the pig from varsity blues"" is ""reggie ray and sausage the pig"" you get what i mean.very strong acting from Chris evans and Jaime Pressly.the reason why some people are over critical is because that these people would not of got the jokes because the lack of knowledge of teen movies.And like it says in the trailer ""if you have seen scary movie, who gives a...."" that is exactly right, this movie far outbeats the latest installments of teen movies by far.A definate must see for fans of teen flicks.i will give it a 8.5/10",Not Another Teen Movie

This movie has a lot of the little things that go a long way to make it great. The performances are spot-on. The dialogue is snappy and clever. The pace is fast and the references spot-on.The girls in this movie are also wicked hot. The sister is out of control hot.

With that being said, I have to say that the parts I like had me LOLin! The exploding toilet was much and a lot of the nudity was gratuitous, but c'mon, what young straight male doesn't like gratuitous nudity... unless he's gay, not that there's anything wrong with that, but I liked the foreign nude girl. But that's just me. There were parts that could have went wither way for me, but as I said, the parts I loved were just hysterical and I still get tears just thinking about them. First, I love the phony American Beauty weirdo. ""I'm not...... ordinary."" is hands down my favorite line. Then there's the part where the phony American Pie jock is singing all to himself like in the real movie. Or when Jake goes ""I don't want your life"" is exactly like Varsity Blues and Ron Lester as Reggie Ray/Billy Bob And Jaime Lee Pressly is hilarious. ""Cheertator and cheeronsequences"" and ""You put the brat in bratwerst"" had me rollin but my favorite is ""Oh it has already been broughten! And all these white girls going, ""We ain't white, we ain't white, we definitely ain't white"" is classic to me. And of course, Token Black Guy was all like ""D@mn! Sh!t! That's wack!""

Now I admit I liked the first Scary Movie as it was nice to see a good spoof movie since the last one I saw was Mafia back in the 90s. The problem with this movie is that it explains their jokes like we the viewer are not smart enough to understand the spoof. The worst is when the Jennifer Love Hewitt/can't hardly wait character walks in and some teen boys explain how everyone has to stop and stare and wait for her to start moving again. seriously I got it, but it wasn't any funnier when you explained it. Another part that got my goat was the lame Molly Ringwald cameo. It starts with a fast zoom in of her face so we MUST know who it is. OK like I can't recognize a flaming red head form every teen movie in the 80s when i see one. THen she proceeds to preach like she is the GOD of all teen movies ever and tells the characters what to do in the airport. NOT FUNNY NOT COOL AND NOT NOSTALGIC.

But as he keeps spending time with her, he starts to fall in love. I actually liked this movie. It's funny, if you don't take the movie too seriously and dwell on the fact that it has no plot. I always love to watch this movie whenever I'm especially PO'd at the world and I just need to sit back and laugh. Some of the parts are absolutely hilarious actually.

If you haven't seen those movies, you're missing out, and you will probably think that this is a dumb comedy and nothing else. Good farce, though, is hard to find, and while it won't change anyone's life, Not Another Teen Movie filled an empty slot in pop culture, and did a good job of it.

When ever I see that the critics hated the movie, I tend to enjoy the film. This was not the case. After an entertaining and humorous beginning (about 1st 5 mins. of the movie) the movie takes a nose dive. If this was a 90 min movie, 80 mins of it was a complete waste of time. On a scale of 1-10, I give this film a 2, and thats being nice. Do not waste 8 dollars to see this movie, or even 3 when it comes out for rent.

Your not going to this movie expecting a great work of art, or having the greatest story line. Face it, your going to this movie to laugh, and you will be doing plenty of it!This movie is great for older teens and young adults. Don't go see this movie if you hate seeing sexual jokes. If you've gone to see any of the ""teen movies"" in the past years you will love this movie. It's mainly based around a parody of She's All That, so I'd go rent it before hand to get the most of it this movie. It reminds me a lot of what Scary Movie was, but it pushes the limits, by far. The opening scene alone beats out Scary Movie all together. There are points in the movie that some jokes just weren't funny, but there aren't many. There's not much of a story line, but hey it's a parody, and Scary Movie was just the same way. The only thing I didn't like about this movie was that by the end of the movie, the whole thing of taking sences from other movies and trying to fit them it gets old, and you question how some of them even fit in to the story line. But what can I say, lots of laughs, hot girls, bad words, and naked girls, and if your a girl, there is some nudity for you. Go see this movie if you want to laugh.",Not Another Teen Movie
207,dmgoehring,Surprisingly funny movie,9,17 December 2001,"I must say I was impressed with a movie I'd originally considered boycotting. Before I'd seen it, I had three problems with the movie: 1) The advertising looked so much like Scary Movie's that it felt like a ripoff (a ripoff of a parody, that's interesting); 2) I'm a hardcore ""teen movie"" fan and was too sensitive to the criticism; and 3) The trailers didn't look all that funny. I relented, though, partially because I really wanted to see a movie or two this weekend and partially because I realized that if I loved both Scary Movie and Scream, why can't I love Not Another Teen Movie (of course I did go into Scary Movie with anticipation because I wanted the other ""scary movies"" to be parodied to death, but still). Also I heard about the gratuitous amount of nudity in the film, and that clinched it (I'm sounding more and more like a cliche'd teen movie fan by the minute).Anyway, it was a very funny movie throughout (I coulda gone without the toilet scene, but other than that) and really seemed to be made by people who were actually fans of the genre as weird as that sounds. And not just the recent teen movies, but dating all the way back to Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Risky Business, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Grease and the John Hughes Brat Pack movies. There was a scary level of attention to detail with little things like the names of buildings (the students go to John Hughes High and eat in the Anthony Michael Dinining Hall) to the constant use of music from the movies (off the top of my head, I'm thinking about the frequent use of Don't You (Forget About Me) from the Breakfast Club and the cover of Somebody's Baby from Fast Times at Ridgemont High (I started laughing my ass off as soon as I heard that one coming on)). There was also quite a few people from those teen movies on hand, whether in obscure roles (Ferris Bueller's dad shows up briefly as a dad and the teacher who ran the detention (and lead villain) in the Breakfast Club reprised his role for that scene, ""Bogey Lowenstein"" from 10 Things I hate about You played the ""Slow Clap"" guy) to more important roles like ""Billy Bob"" from Varsity Blues playing the same character only stupider as ""Reggie Ray"" or Molly Ringwald (teen queen of each and every John Huges film from Sixteen Candles to Breakfast Club to Pretty in Pink) showing up in a pivotal role at the end of the movie. Oh, and I should mention, the movie was funny as hell. Really funny parodies and some unique little twists (who would've expected Mr. T to show up in a movie parodying teen flicks (as an aside, though, I don't know if ""Rudy"", is really a teen flick).

Also, the cameo by Molly Ringwald, perhaps the queen of 80s teen movies, is great.Crossing over into the 90s, ""She's All That,"" ""American Pie,"" and ""Can't Hardly Wait"" also receive some good-natured jabs. Lacey Chabert is excellent, reprising the ""Hardly Wait"" role of her ""Party of Five"" co-star, Jennifer Love Hewitt. Where this movie strays, however, is when the humor takes a scatological turn. For some reason, we are expected to enjoy jokes about excrement; and, judging from the silence of the people sitting around me in the theater, we weren't amused. Furthermore, if the intent was to shock us, that intent failed, too. We were simply disgusted. Oddly enough, Neal Moritz, who produced ""Cruel Intentions,"" also produced this movie.

221,jnew-30864,Not Another Spoof Movie,7,7 March 2019,"Let me just start by saying don't expect it to be more than what it is. It is, after all, a spoof movie. It's based on other movies of the turn of age variety. With that being said, it is exceptional in comparison to other movies in it's collective genre. It's well-directed (with the exception of a couple scenes), well shot, it's script isn't too over the top (exception of bathroom scene, which was a little too much but not enough to ruin the movie) and the story moved well throughout. Production quality was pretty standard for that time but was good considering the 15 mil budget. The real gem in this movie though is the casting...the casting for this movie was absolutely fantastic. This movie actually helped launch a few careers. Most notably Chris Evans. I gotta hand to my boy Chris, he killed it. He had great screen presence, for being a rookie in the screen acting gig, nailed like, 99% of his lines and made all the scenes with his costars better than they were without him. It should be said, without Chris Evans, this movie would have been an absolute flop. He seriously stole the movie. Also, notable mention, Mia Kirshner did extremely well also, considering the f-ed up scene material she had to work with (lol). She stole her scenes as well. Eric Christian Olson and others did well but lacked depth and came off a little one-dimensional. It's no surprise that, with the exception for the two I mentioned above, they could only find steady work on television. Though she did well in her scenes and was so unbelievably hot, I don't really see why Jaime Pressley's character was even in the story. She was absolutely inconsequential to the overall story. To give you an example, she was supposed to be the main's girlfriend but you never actually see them dating as they break up as soon as you first see them on the screen together. There's a few scenes that exist solely to spoof other movies but for the most part they tie in well with the rest. It's as entertaining as the first Scary Movie, which was the best spoof movie I've seen since Mel Brooks' Robin Hood Men in Tights and Airplane, my top two all time. Worth a watch and has good rewatch quality but not an Oscar Winner by any means. Chris Evans, Mia Kirshner and Randy Quaid, who was hilarious, make it very watchable if you're looking for a spoofer that isn't too corny. Solid 6.8ish not quite a full seven so I just rounded up.

Plainly put, I don't think Not Another Teen Movie is as funny as it tries to be. To be fair, it does have a lot of potential, but none of the comedy is consistent, with jokes ranging from subtle to being whacked by a hammer. For example, we're introduced to an exchange student who parades around naked without a care in the world. That would've been funny on its own, but then she goes on to literally announce her role as an object of lust for horny teenagers. It's like the film doesn't trust its audience to understand the clichés it's trying to mock. But then, in another scene, a reporter, played by an obviously older woman, goes undercover as a student--and no one is ever the wiser. She doesn't mutter under her breath ""I hope these students never find out I'm a 73 year-old woman who's insecure about being bullied back in High School, thus jumping at the opportunity of starting over.""

In my opinion this movie was kind of tasteless, but was actually done very well.  When I went to this movie I thought it would be very-extremely stupid, but I found that it actually wasn't, it effectively brought together, as far as I could see, all the teen movies, even Pretty In Pink which was brought out in the 80's. The way all the teen films were put together into this one movie was spectacular and shows that the writer is very good at what he/she does, unlike many of the other ones.  Overall I don't think this movie was a 10, but I think in terms of teen comedy, it ranks very high.",Not Another Teen Movie

I opt for the latter.A short review: take all recent (and even not-so-recent) teen-friendly movies and pervert them with gross, cruel and just plain stupid humor, and you have Not Another Teen Movie.  The concept might have been funny but the crude humor was such a turn-off that my stomach was too busy churning to achieve any belly laughs, or even a faint chuckle.

230,Man in the Planet,Tepid,2,29 September 2002,"Of course, all this nonsense begs the question 'Does a genre as self-referential as the teen comedy really need another parody movie?' The woeful 'Scary Movie' (I and II) took the formula about as far as it could go - 'Not Another Teen Movie' really doesn't have anything either intelligent or shockingly excessive to add.The plot, essentially based on fairyfloss teenflic 'She's All That', walks a shaky line between parody and homage ('John Hughes High School'). Everything from 'American Beauty' to 'Varsity Blues' is mined for references. The result is ultimately an unfulfilling viewer experience. The downside of giving us a carbon copy plot of 'She's All That' is that we all know where its going anyway. And if we didn't then the jokes would be meaningless.
There's extremely little to recommend here. The token gross-out scene (an erupting toilet) seems badly out of place here amongst all the 'feel-good' references. There are moments of humour - the song is funny enough and the odd good line is send the audiences way. It stinks, don't watch it.",Not Another Teen Movie

Although box office critics can be quite inaccurate when criticizing comedies, they do get some elements correct. However, that was not the case with ""Not Another Teen Movie"" From the moment it started I was already aware I was in store for something I had not expected, sheer laughter. This movie breaks new ground (so to speak) in the teen comedy genre, as it uses the classic teen movies such as ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" as it's parody content as well as newer ones such as ""American Pie"" or ""Bring it On"". However, the parodies of the newer movies weren't the ones that made me laugh, it was the sheer brilliance of making parodies of older teen movies, the movies that started the whole teen genre that amazed me. If you are appreciative of movies and did not find this funny, admit that you found it creative, because in all aspects, it was. If you are appreciative of movies and haven't seen this yet, pick it up the next time you're at blockbuster.

This one pokes good fun at all the Brat pack movies, plus a whole lot of others in the process.

242,Czechmated,"Irreverent, sometimes stupid, but mostly hilarious",9,22 July 2007,"Not Another Teen Movie was pretty much made for people my age (30 somethings). From John Hughes High School to the Anthony Michael Dining Hall, from the dozens of movie references and clichés to the obviously hot ""nerd"" girl, NATM spoofs everything, mostly well. Unlike the Scary Movie franchise, NATM is consistently funny. The Breakfast Club set is a great recreation (in the detention hall scene) and they even have the same actor in the part.This is not to say that NATM hits on all cylinders. Some of the humor is stupid (the literal flying pooh scene comes to mind), but some of it is so unexpected that it's almost a breath of fresh air. The slow clap guy, the ""nerd girl"" and her ""paintings"", the one black guy running into another black guy at a party -- there are a lot of priceless scenes.The plot is appropriately predictable, but how they get from point A to point B is for the most part hilarious. The music references are perfect as well. I had no idea I was so well versed in 80s pop music. The straight-up weirdness of some things like the jock's family is funny because it's so unexpected. The poor ""nerd"" girl's dad, portrayed by Randy Quaid, could probably make a spin-off movie. (He calls his daughter pumpkin tits, and has some of the best lines in the movie. After saying he won't be able to pick up the kids after school and being asked if he has a job interview, it goes something like, ""No, I'll probably just be too s***-faced to remember."" ""Good thing you won't be driving then!"", to which he replies, ""Oh, I'll be drivin'!"") The younger set may not appreciate this because the younger types don't like being made fun of for the most part, and the older crowd may not understand it at all and will be turned off in particular by some of the potty humor. The third porridge, though, is us middle-30s types that lived through this era. This movie is a catalog of our youth, put hilariously to set pieces and scenes.

This was purposefully made to be over-the-top type humor because it is a parody of that genre.I've seen this movie 3 or 4 times, and I still can't help but laugh when I see the scene when no one wants to go with Janey Briggs because she's too ugly and weird with her ""tied up hair and glasses,"" yet an albino girl with red eyes that plays the guitar wouldn't be such a bad catch. This is an obvious parody of teenage movies where the one girl is too nerdy for anyone to ""go with,"" yet really they're a very pretty actress but just wearing glasses and a ponytail. It probably directly is making fun of movies like ""A Walk to Remember."" It's a great movie, but people think of it as actually being a ""Teen Movie,"" and that's why they don't like it.

Rent the films it spoofs instead (like She's All That, Pretty in Pink, etc.).It was painfully obvious that this film tried to cover all teen movies without actually bothering to take the meaning from them.

260,The Storm,Watch the movie from a different perspective,9,17 December 2001,"It seems as though all the complaints about this movie include the excess of dick and fart jokes and also the plotless nature of the film.  Furthermore, most of the so-called critics here on this board are all adults commenting on the lack of intellectual subject matter in the movie.Wake up!  There aren't any!  Parody movies are only negative if they hurt the integrity of the movies that they parody.  The parodied movies that still have integrity (The Breakfast Club, American Beauty, Almost Famous, and Grease) were not done insultingly, so there really is no reason to criticize.  The intellectually devoid movies which were parodied (i.e. any movie with Freddie Prinze, Jr., Jennifer Love Hewitt, and James Van Der Beek) had no substance anyways, and I feel that Not Another Teen Movie was put on more interestingly than all of these movies combined (except American Pie, but that's a guilty pleasure of mine).Another factor criticized were the cameos by Brat Pack actors, epitomized by Molly Ringwold.  So her career was made by teen movies, so what?  She's past that now, and she is just poking fun at that which made her famous.  I see nothing wrong with exorcising the demons of the past onscreen, because it helps deliver the message which the movie is trying to offer.  Melissa Joan Hart and Sean Patrick Thomas are there to deliver lines that show how ridiculous the spoofed movies really are.  The whole Breakfast Club scene was brilliant and very precise, and the whole wall reading ""Weird Science"" was an added joke many people might have missed.Next, let's not rip into the music please.  So a punk/emo band (Good Charlotte, more specifically) redid a bunch of 80s songs.  Is that a mistake?  At least they left all the old music and theme songs in the movie. Hearing a remake of ""Don't You Forget About Me"" was the brightest spot in the movie for me.  Also, I loved the American Pie and American Beauty music being in the movie (where appropriate) because they are two of my favorite tunes from movies.  It wasn't like teen movies where huge rock bands debut their new songs at the backdrop of a party.  They kept the originals, respectfully.Another frequent criticism I hear is that many of the teens who will see this movie may miss the 80s (and before) references.  This is highly untrue. I went with a group of my teenage friends (I'm 18 by the way), and we recognized the Pretty in Pink, Sixteen Candles, Breakfast Club, Grease, Fast Times, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, etc. references.  So to claim that all of today's teenagers are uncultured and uneducated would be misconstruing a whole culture.  So teenagers, I'm sure you will love this when you see it, and adults, free your mind, think back to when you were a pubescent teenager, and just sit back an enjoy a collage of both good and bad movies put together into one ball of scenes.It's not quite Mel Brooks' Spaceballs (another 80s reference), but it is better than Scary Movie. 7/10",Not Another Teen Movie

I never stopped laughing!!! There was never a dull moment. I would encourage people to go see this movie.,Not Another Teen Movie
264,liliah1,a very funny movie,10,21 December 2001,"well, I loved it. My friend and I were laughing the whole time.  It's REALLY not a movie for those over the age of 25 or if you have a problem with poop, being naked, or sexual gratification.  And it isn't funny unless you've seen all the movies they spoof in it.  It isn't the worst movie of 2001 *cough* SUMMER CATCH *cough*. Don't expect this one to be popular with the reviewers because they're a bunch of crusty old men who only enjoy historical drama's with distinguished actors.  It's stupid and disturbing at times...but so stupid and disturbing you can't help but laugh.",Not Another Teen Movie
265,jestek,Hilarious,10,27 December 2001,"There were some stupid parts in that, but over all the movie was great! It's about time they did a spoof on all the teen movies! I really wouldn't suggest that children view this movie do to the nudity, among other parts that were just plain inappropriate!",Not Another Teen Movie
266,Gargymel,"a hilarious spoof, while still being a movie in its own right",10,22 March 2002,"Not Another Teen Movie heralds back to the days of spoof movies such as 'The Naked Gun' or 'Fatal Instinct'.  It runs the gamut of teen movies, and takes the p*** out of all of them, but at the same time manages to maintain its own storyline.The performances are well above average - sometimes better than some of the real teen movie performances.  Even though the characters are simply teen movie formula templates, they still generate enough pathos for the audience to connect with them.The humour itself still remains fairly puerile, but not enough to be classified as a 'gross out comedy'.  Unlike 'Scary Movie', not all the humour in 'Not Another Teen Movie' is visual, or pertaining to bodily fluids (not that there isn't a fair share of that!)  And the movie references are extremely well done, without being totally insulting to the movie itself.On the whole, 'Not Another Teen Movie' is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time, not just as an over-the-top farce, but as a genuine, well-written film that just happens to be a mad spoof at the same time.",Not Another Teen Movie
267,Puboo88,It was a great movie,10,9 January 2002,"The reason I think this movie it great because it did what it was supposed to do. This movie was written to make fun of the stupid ""I'm a teen and need to find love"" movies. It touches all the points that a teen movie is all about, typical teens living in a dream world. Most of todays teens are not the way the big screen portraits them to be. I like the way they chose to use Ed Louter in the movie. Because in all the sports movie the coach is always getting mad at something and cursing up a storm. This movie deserves a better rating then It got ant that is why I loved this movie. You would understand it more if you looked at it at my point of view. Cheesy acting or not This movie deserves the respect it needs.",Not Another Teen Movie
268,lange draak,"It is another teen movie, or not?! Well, maybe!?",7,23 January 2003,"Not another teen movie takes you to the funniest parts of all the other teen movies produced over the last few years. Why is it funny then? I found it unique that in not antoher teen movie everything goes wrong, which is different with al the happy ending teen movies that we´ve all seen to much. There are scenes in the movie that will crack you up because they are so wrong!! I say, let´s see it again, again, again, and again. It will give you a laugh!!",Not Another Teen Movie
269,jake422ny,Worst parody ever!,1,31 January 2002,"This was definitely one of the worst movies ever, let alone one of the worst parodies.  The jokes weren't clever and it seemed as though it tried too hard to be funny.  They made gross comments that had nothing to do with teen movies, but that they thought would be funny.  However, they were just plain stupid.  Even nudity and Jamie Pressly couldn't make this movie even half decent.  Trust me, seeing this movie is a big waste of time.",Not Another Teen Movie
270,kitten_lover_2003,This movie is terrible.,2,5 May 2002,To me this movie is just a waist of time. I was going to go see it at the movies but my friends talked me out of it. I should praise them for what they did. The movie is too rude and nasty . I thought scary movie was bad. Yeah right. This is not a nother teen movie. This is a movie that gives teen movies a bad name.You may not agree with me but this is my comment.,Not Another Teen Movie
271,shumi620022003,Creative.,7,18 November 2007,"Well, this is one killer movie, all what I thought about the teen movies over all brought into this industry without any serious intentions, the director's scripted it off for me. Jake Wyler's bet and the crap he did at the end of the movie was just like "" It can only happen in a teen movie"" the Football matches and the guy who had serious problems with his ""when-to-clap"" incidents was tragic, finally when he learns the art, Janie's best friend steals the show by clapping in before him, that was the funniest part of the movie. A must watch for all stupid teen movie fans, and humor crazy people would surely love the movie.",Not Another Teen Movie

276,mocktortuise,Spectacular,10,19 August 2003,"Hilarious movie.  I've seen it twice an laughed a lot both times. Actors and Actresses are very quick and have good comedic timing. The football player ""Reggie Ray"" that keeps running into walls and getting concussions is rediculoously funny. I am ashamed to admit that I consistently laughed at the idiot who wanted to be asian. The spoofs on other garbage, bottom-feeder teen movies were hilarious as well. It's the same type of humor as ""scary movie""",Not Another Teen Movie
277,handeb,rock bottom,1,7 October 2003,"I watched this movie after a friend recommended, as he said it was the funniest movie he'd ever seen. Well, I had my share of bad comedies, but unfortunately this one hits rock bottom. The truth is every single movie this one makes fun of is 10 times better than the movie itself.",Not Another Teen Movie
278,toblerone183,Extremely funny.,10,8 January 2011,"So awesome! The irony of this movie is the funniest thing I've ever seen. Nothing better to describe high school life. Its in my top-ten favorite movies, no doubt about that. The characters fit perfectly with the purpose of the story. I would say that all of them are brilliantly set up. On the other hand, the plot is carried on nicely: even though it relates about how the life in high school is, it takes out the best and the funniest thing of it. Not only makes a funny description of high school life, it also refers to scenes and situations that occurred in other teen movies like American pie, a letter to Amanda and some others. The clever way in which the movie links with those other movies, is ironic and very funny. In my opinion, this movie reaches the level of the ones which it relates them to, and maybe in certain situations goes higher than them.Some of the quotes that appear on it i would describe them are historical, i have watched it 4 or 5 times already, it gets even better. The view is far than recommended, its obligatory, for everybody.10/10",Not Another Teen Movie

It's absolutely wonderful, and I still find it funny even though I haven't seen all of the movies it makes fun of.

281,MR_INSOMNIAC,"Funny, Funny Movie",9,20 May 2004,"Not Another Teen Movie is a great example of how to make a great spoof. Now granted to experience the movie to the fullest you have to have had seen or at least heard of the movies that it's making fun of. Now I'm an 80's baby so i caught everything down to the smallest reference. I like the way everything gelled together and made sense, where as the original ""Scary Movie"", while very funny just seemed to throw too much into the mix. I personally was waiting for a movie like this for a long time after the barrage of crappy 90's teen movies. I mean these guys seemed to have been in the same meeting with some of these plots. But back to NATM. I can see where some of the so-called ""gross out"" jokes may turn a few people off, but you can't deny moments like the ""Varsity Blues"" inspired banana split scene, or the ""Prom Tonight"" musical number. I don't think any other spoof has hit the nail on the head so perfectly. There are not a lot of films you can just put on and laugh at because they are down right funny like this one. I highly recommend this movie, even if it means going back and watching every teen flick from the 80's just to get the jokes, it will be time well spent",Not Another Teen Movie
282,jonesa64,Sad,1,12 February 2006,sad simply sad....who ever liked this movie i feel so so sorry for them.I only laughed 3 times in the movie. When you count how many times you laugh in a movie that is meant to be 'funny' then there is something seriously wrong with the movie.Yes certain parts were weird and nearly made me laugh but this movie is so geared up for the American market which has to be told in an obvious manner when to laugh during the movie.thank goodness i never saw this at the movies when it came out. It would of been a waste of my money and a waste of one and a half hours of my life.,Not Another Teen Movie
283,olarudan,Gorgeousness and Gorgeosity made flesh!,9,27 February 2005,"I have seen this movie quite a few times, and it was great to watch every time.Surely there are some scenes which can be termed corny, but they are few and invariably counterbalanced by the absolutely great ones, which are the majority.After seeing it so many times, I have come to realize that the script is the product of many years of work, and 'ripe' for making a movie of. Also, the makers of this movie have had the courage to dive into the Absurd, which is one of the most productive, though harder to understand(for some people) types of humor. This is why there are folks who didn't like it; and it's also why the title is wholly appropriate, because it has taken all the Absurd it could find in teen movies, and put it into one great work, that laughs at traditional teen movies.

But I was sitting at home watching HBO one day and it came on. Out of sheer laziness, I just laid there and watched it, and I swear I did not stop laughing once. My roommate actually came into the room to see what I was laughing at, and I said, ""Ted, you have to watch this movie the next time it's on!"" Needless to say, we watched it every time it came on TV after that first time, and it quickly became my favorite comedy of recent memory.
