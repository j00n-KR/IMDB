0,SnoopyStyle,adulthood problem,5,9 July 2021,Tim is now a father to two girls. He doesn't talk to his baby brother Ted who is very rich and successful. He's worried that he's losing his 7 year old Tabitha. He discovers that baby Tina is working for Babycorp. There is a problem and they need help from Ted. Babycorp has created a new formula to de-age people for 48 hours. They want Ted to return to his baby self despite not remembering being a baby agent. Tim insists on joining the mission and also drinks the formula.It's a mistake to make Tim and Ted adults in this movie. It also pushes this world forward in time. There is no need to age up the characters. The original surprised me with its charm. Most of that charm has to do with the baby world being completely outside of the adults' understanding. It's a fun concept and there is no reason to change that. It's certainly unnecessary to attach this father-daughter emotional drama. Maybe the franchise runners are having some mid-life crisis. The franchise was fine with its original concept. This movie leaves the story rather a muddle. It should be simpler than this.,The Boss Baby - Family Business
1,nogodnomasters,Do the Time Warp Again,8,6 July 2021,"The beginning is slow for the first 20 minutes for character introductions and plot set up. The Boss Baby is now an adult and the brothers have drifted apart. Tim has his own Boss Baby, but does not know it. There is something up at the local school for gifted children. Tina (our new boss baby) revert Ted and Tim to their younger selves in infiltrate the school.The film has very strong pro-family message. I loved the sound track which included some classic rock tunes . There were remarks that boss baby had a ""big head"" which I took as a friendly dig at Alec Baldwin. There were also some old pop culture items in the film kids won't get such as a reference to Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots. Also product placements. I like it when something obscure happens in the beginning that then comes into play. Nice to see Jeff Goldman is alive. I had him listed as dead.They tell each other to ""suck it"" a lot. Something that wasn't acceptable when I was growing up.",The Boss Baby - Family Business
2,view_and_review,Two Boss Babies not as Good as One,6,19 July 2021,"""The Boss Baby: Family Business"" or ""Boss Baby 2"" takes place years after ""The Boss Baby"" where Ted (Alec Baldwin) and Tim (James Marsden) are now adults and Tim has a boss baby daughter, Tina (Amy Sedaris). Tina has a mission much like her uncle Ted did years before her. Her mission is to uncover the plot of the principal of her older sister Tabitha's school. To do that she's going to need the original boss baby, Ted. Ted and Tim would drink a secret formula that reverted them back to toddler and child respectively for 48 hours. In that 48 hours they would have to infiltrate Tabitha's school and uncover the plot of Dr. Armstrong (Jeff Goldblum).If I've said it once, I've said it a thousand times: very very few sequels even match their predecessors while the majority don't even come close. ""Family Business"" was decent, but nothing worth going out of your way to see. There were a couple of funny parts, but the new boss baby, Tina, didn't have the pizzazz or personality that Ted had. For that matter, Ted didn't have quite the same pizzazz as he had in the first movie.It was a sequel and we only watch sequels based upon our enjoyment of the first installment. And we hope against hope that the sequel will live up to the name established by part one though it rarely ever happens. We are some strange creatures.",The Boss Baby - Family Business
3,jack_o_hasanov_imdb,Weak But Fun,6,13 September 2021,"It was weak compared to the first movie. But the voice-overs / dubbing were very good. It was poor as a story. I'm not counting the logic errors, it's an animation, come on. It was a bit of a disappointment, but I still liked it. I had fun watching. This is my new favorite series.",The Boss Baby - Family Business
4,briancham1994,Very messy story,5,7 November 2021,"I didn't like the first Boss Baby movie but I think it had potential. My view is the same of the sequel. It starts off after a thirty year time skip, so Tim and Ted are now fully grown men. This was a strange premise to go with, but I gave it a chance. The film sets up some interesting issues between Tim and his daughter Tabitha who is growing up quickly and doesn't share his imagination anymore. Somehow, this devolves into a complete mess involving Tina (who is another boss baby, but why?), a new mission (involving what?), Ted (who is the boss of something else, but what?). Then the film suddenly negates its own premise by de-aging Tim and Ted. I think it was neat to see Tim interact with his own daughter in secret, but this was short-lived. Then the film switches tone again and the focus is on a generic evil villain (I did like his awkward voice acting though). Any one of these subplots could have been the premise of the entire film, but it seemed to skip between them haphazardly with zany action sequences throughout.",The Boss Baby - Family Business
5,Thanos_Alfie,Funny and entertaining...,5,4 October 2021,"""The Boss Baby: Family Business"" is an Animation - Comedy movie and the sequel of ""The Boss Baby"", in which we are some years later when the Templeton brothers are adults and a new boss baby needs their help for a very important mission.Since I had already watched the first movie I was familiar with the context so, I knew what to expect. The direction which was made again by Tom McGrath as in the first movie, it was very good and he continued the great job along with the use of the voices of many brilliant actors and actresses. For one more time Alec Baldwin's voice as Boss Baby (Ted) was very good and James Marsden's voice as Tim was fitted on the role. To sum up, I have to say that ""The Boss Baby: Family Business"" is an entertaining movie and I am sure you will have great time watching it therefore I recommend you to first watch ""The Boss Baby"", and after this movie.",The Boss Baby - Family Business
6,stevendbeard,Descent,7,11 July 2021,"I saw ""The Boss Baby:Family Business"", starring the voices of Alec Baldwin-A Star is Born_2018, the Mission:Impossible movies; James Marsden-Sonic the Hedgehog, the X_Men movies; Amy Sedaris-The Mandalorian_tv, Old Dogs and Jeff Goldblum-Hotel Artemis, Thor:Ragnarok.This is a sequel to the 2017 Boss Baby and the babies are all grown up now. Alec is the rich, successful one that is jealous of his brother, James, who has a family of his own. Amy plays one of James' daughters that is having problems in school and Jeff plays the villain that runs a school and guess what? He wants to take over the world-it's number one in the villain's playbook. To stop Jeff's plan, Alec & James take a secret formula that reverts them to younger versions of themselves so that they can infiltrate Jeff's school. Jimmy Kimmel & Lisa Kudrow pop up as the grandparents. It's not a bad movie. It's descent enough movie to take the little ones to. I liked the baby ninjas that Jeff used as security.It's rated ""PG"" for rude humor, language and action and has a running time of 1 hour & 47 minutes.I don't know if I would buy it on DVD but it would be alright as a rental.",The Boss Baby - Family Business
7,kwenchow,"Not as good as the first chapter, full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Another big letdown!",1,18 July 2021,"This film start with the narrator talking about he is grown up, and the introduction of the Templeton families scene! As turnout, this film is about two brothers(Ted, and Tim) need to turn themselves back to baby to stop a baby villain ""Dr. Armstrong"" using the so called ""QT Snap"" apps to manipulate parents! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the narration scene, overuse of the driving scene, overuse of the eating scene, overuse of the playing dumb scene, overuse of the tripping scene, overuse of the arguing scene, overuse of the calling names scene, overuse of the singing scene, overuse of the song playing at the background scene, overuse of the taking photo scene, and overuse of the imagination scene! Make the film unwatchable! Barely laughable scene is, Tim, Ted, and the pony ""Precious"" crash into a 3D cinema! At the end, Tina defeat Dr. Armstrong, and Dr. Armstrong back to his parents house! That's it! Another disappointed sequel!",The Boss Baby - Family Business
8,lukem-52760,Hilarious & heartfelt family fun. Jeff Goldblum is fantastic!!!,8,3 November 2021,"This sequel is way more fun than the first film. Yes i liked the first but the sequel is way better & that's thanks to the absolutely hilarious, show stealing voice performance by Jeff Goldblum as the baby villain of the piece. Goldblum is so funny & witty i had a huge smile the whole way through the movie.The movie is more heartfelt this time with emphasis on growing up & family like most sequels lately (Frozen 2) but it is sweet & often emotional, especially to parents like myself. I was choked up a few times & yes some tears dropped.All voice casting was fine but the absolute standout voice here was Goldblum.Boss Baby 2: Family Business is alot of silly fun for the whole family & was way, way better than the very disappointing ""Addams Family 2"" which was a terrible unfunny mess.",The Boss Baby - Family Business
9,Kdosda_Hegen,Lacking originality and creativity.,4,19 July 2021,"I have waited 4 years for this to get such a letdown? I mean, I had a bad feeling this could've been a disaster, so at least I'm happy that it wasn't terrible.Starting with the good, I think that the animation is awesome for the most part, motion blur and depth of field really does look awesome and I don't think I have ever seen those things used before in animated films, though I don't watch many animated films, so I couldn't tell really. Though I really dislike Tina's design, her face is truly not looking well.I love some of the music/song choices and a few of the action scenes are pretty good.There is some nice depth about seeing people from another perspective, and it was truly interesting to see Tim getting to know his daughter better without her talking to ""him"".Now for the bad:
Carol is a really underdeveloped character, there just isn't much of her, I wish she had a much bigger role in this. Also, why couldn't any of the characters from the series make a return, Danny was even in the promotion of the film yet I did not see him in the film itself, what a disappointment.I really hate that the brothers somehow are now distant from each other again even after all they have gone through in the first film and all 4 seasons of the series. I like that Theodore doesn't remember anything as it creates the right continuity after the series, but then again not a single character from the series make an appearance here.All the family values are being relearned here once again and it just seems very cheap as if they couldn't have taught us any other values besides family and love. We clearly knew that already from the first film and series and it was done way better in those.Most of the film follows the generic plot, and the villain isn't very interesting, easily the least interesting villain of all Boss Baby universe villains.Also, it seems that Tim has never grown up. His dad was the easy-going type, minimally cringe and charming and Tim looked like his younger version. But I'm supposed to believe that Tim has grown up not into his father, but really, he's grown into a really goofy and plain awkward obsessive dad.Also, this film doesn't have any subtlety or hidden smart references the first film had. The first film and series were both full of depth, but here everything is just so plain and simple.The ending is just so basic. They tried to make this a character reunion and a pass for the new generations, but they have done it in the most uninspiring way. Especially that I have seen Dragon Ball GT: A Hero's Legacy, which is just a pure heartwarming love letter to both characters and fans.The Boss Baby 2: Family Business is not terrible, but very underwhelming of what it could've been. I'd go as far and call this a cash-grab.",The Boss Baby - Family Business
10,rgkarim,Cute Endearing Sequel That Is Just Fun and Simplistic,7,3 July 2021,"LIKES:Animation:
No surprise, the animation studios know what to do with the animation software when they invest in their work. Boss baby's dive into the realm of BabyCorp still has the flair that made it so much fun in, with interesting, big eyed design and a colorful setting that grabs attentions. Seeing the kids do surprisingly adult like moves, and capturing the anatomical function of the body is still done super well. No glitchy frame shifts, no dropped frame rates or obvious cuts to skip, and they don't take the lazy pathway and avoid doing things because it might take too much to do it.Cute:
Babies are cute, babies are adorable and babies can be trouble. Boss Baby proved just that in the presentation for the first installment, but to the level that did not annoy or make us want to walk out. Well, the sequel manages to do that once again, and perhaps to a better level than the first. The adorable baby calls of the new junior exec Tina make will melt the hearts of parents at that familiar call that brings joy. Not your cup of tea? Well don't worry, the family business extends to so many other cute factors to make this a family friendly adventure that will have many saying awwww. The new babies are cute, the family aspects are touching, and even the real life practical lessons have these elements of adorable nature to them and though a bit annoying at times, is mostly used to elevate the movie. Even the main villain is adorable in his own right, and though a bit odd for his intro, I loved how they embedded cuteness into him.The Morals:
It would not be an animated feature without some life lessons being doled out to the young audience members and their parents. Family values are the core theme of the movie and it takes multiple facets during the course of the adventure. Reconnecting with family members as the trailers have shown gives adults a good lesson in the importance of work to not drift apart. The ideas of growing up too fast and yet refusing to grow up are well represented in this film, helping show how a balance is really the key to not losing the joy in life. Even more, the relative concept of family love and the stress of school are big elements in this theme and though they do trudge into preachy, in your face moments, it's still not the worst thing like the 90's sitcoms used to be.The Story:
Simplistic? Yeah, it's the boss baby and so the complexity is not the most surprising or eye opening that we've seen in other studio works. However, the story is indeed fun, and works on so many levels to ingrain the morals into the movie without swallowing it whole. It's a sweet tale that hits on many levels, making sure to balance the adult and kid elements in a manner that never leans one way or the other. The simple layout also allows for the gimmicks they want to neatly arrange themselves into an adventure that makes sense, and not throwing too many convenience factors in that we sometimes get. Throw in just how much fun it is in regards to the pacing and entertainment components, and for once I felt I was watching a movie with little to no political agenda at all. It was a well-rounded tale that certainly was not groundbreaking, but also not too limited either so that's a victory to me.The Voice Acting:
A choice of voice cast is essential for bringing these characters fully to life, and Boss baby's ensemble is certainly an ace in my book. James Marsden does well in the role, being the lame dad, nerd voice, but lacing it with the care and compassion of a loving father layered the character well and maximized the emotional moments. Amy Sedaris as the new baby, was funny, if a bit annoying/over the top, which worked given Tina's character. That nasally voice pitch and energy worked as sort of a parody to the normal chief of operations, and managed to remain limited enough to not over shadow the other aspects of the movie. Jeff Goldblum as the head of the school/professor, was perfect, an almost smarter, less bohemian version of the grandmaster that we saw in Thor. He was fun, witty, and that voice of his delivering his character's thoughts and insights was again arranged quite well to truly enjoy. As for Alec Baldwin, man was he on fire again. That snide, snooty, arrogant persona he radiates comes through in spades for the Boss Baby once more, adding that level of intelligence and confidence that made the character so much fun in the first film. He elevates the performance more in this movie, the direction of the character allowing him to do more with the character than the previous installment and I really liked it.Clever/Comedy Fun:
the best element of the movie though, comes in the clever writing of the film and the comedy styles that followed. Boss Baby 2 thrives in the fact of poking fun at things, and even more so challenging the modern trends with the classics for what styles work in a movie. Without revealing too much, the movie manages to utilize the morals as not only learning points, but also laugh sources as the error of certain ways of thinking is poked at by our group. The famous toy Wizzie hits comedic goals with pointing out the character flaws, all the while falling into his own limitations is just one example of what I'm talking about. Yet other sources of comedy are thrown in that left me in stitches due to how well timed they were. You want babies showing obsessions that only adults should have? Done. You want well timed one-liners utilizing future merchandise? Done. Need to see babies crafting works that are way above their caliber? That's there too. Along with so many pokes at things like how ridiculous school competitions have become, or how Enya's music can potentially cause insanity. It's well balanced, it's got a variety, and even more it's not the pure focus of the film and forced into our faces.DISLIKES:Some More Twists:
As I said, I enjoyed the movie for just the simplistic fun, but that does not mean I would have liked a little more challenge to be integrated into the film. Disney shows us how they push the envelope, sometimes too much, in their movies, but they at least get some surprises and depth that leave you bewildered. Not so much in this movie, and maybe a little more diving into those realms could have opened up a little more for the qualities I enjoyed in this movie.Better Utilization of Characters:
Perhaps the second to worst thing about the movie, is that the characters are in need of a little more balance and integration into the film. The mom is one character that I felt kind of got the shaft given the involvement of just about every other member of the family. Used primarily for comedic purposes, there could have been more plot elements to integrate her into, or perhaps a side story involving primarily Tina trying to do her job while the mom tried to figure out more. Something needed to help take her involvement to the same level that the others were integrated in. However, there were other characters that really needed more elevation namely, the other classmates of Tabitha. The promo shows a baby who is into bad boys, who actually has a Dr. In front of her name, I would have liked to see more involvement with given the points. Was it just a clever name, or was there more? Don't know, but she could have been fun. And Tabitha's rivals were sort of one and done bullies that did little to muck up the gears and offer a way for some slight political agenda work depending on how you look at it. These characters may come back in the third sequel that can arise, but it would have been nice to see things from a new light.Trailers ruin a lot:
I have a friend who states how much he avoids trailers due to how much they give away. While I think there are some trailers needed, Boss Baby's advertising got carried away with showing too much of the fun themes of the movie. Of the at least six combinations I have seen, many big parts and fun elements the movie holds and that further diluted the surprise away from me. In this case, my friend's style is right of not going too excessive with the trailers, or at least doing what he does and avoiding them to help maintain the surprise.The songs:
A sweet component no doubt, but the Boss Baby was never known for being a soundtrack heavy component. So the fact they went out of their way for two original songs was kind of lost on me from an inclusion/logic point. They were fine, they are going to bring in cash, and they certainly accomplish the goals of moral driving and cute family themes. However, it could have been accomplished in other means and I think I would have liked focus on other characters over the attempt to induce tears with the melodies. A minor flaw for me, but hey we roll with it.The VERDICT:Boss Baby: Family Business, turned out to be a surprise by how much fun I had with the simplistic tale laid before me. It's linear plot works well to bring in the elements of fun, layering the tale with lots of moral lessons.",The Boss Baby - Family Business
11,rannynm,"Completely Entertaining, Exciting, Humorous and Fun to Watch",10,1 July 2021,"The boss is back baby! The Boss Baby: The Family Business brings back the Templetons from the original movie, The Boss Baby, also created and directed by Tom McGrath. This movie brings the same energy, hilarious animation, fight scenes and secret missions we've come to love with The Boss Baby Franchise.In this sequel, the Templeton brothers, Tim (James Marsden) and Theodore ""Ted"" (Alec Baldwin) are back as adults and have drifted away from each other over the years. We meet Tim's family, including his new toddler daughter, Tina (Amy Sedaris), who is now the new Boss Baby and is on a mission from Baby Corp. To bring them together. This launches a new family business.The main characters are Tim's wife, Carol (Eva Longoria), daughters, Tabitha (Ariana Greenblatt) and Tina, and, of course, his brother, Mr. Boss Baby himself, Ted. While the film has a lot of references to the first film, you can easily follow along in this sequel. Most of all the original main characters are back, and we even get a visit from Tim and Ted's parents. I really enjoyed that Tom McGrath stays true to the original concept, but adds a new storyline. One of my favorite scenes is when another baby group, ""The Ninja Babies"" are chasing Ted. He initially thinks they are cute until they start attacking him. It is pretty funny watching Ted run around screaming. Alec Baldwin nails Ted's sound effects. Even Amy Sedaris's squealing as Tina is hilarious and she actually uses this squeal in real life to get people's attention.The message of this film is that it is important to focus on what matters most - love and family. Over the years, Ted always put his job and money ahead of his family, but realizes that he will always be lonely if he doesn't prioritize things. Parents should look out for bad habits some of the babies show and words that sound similar to profanity.The Boss Baby: The Family Business is the perfect movie for families to bond over this summer. I rate this film 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 11 to 18, plus adults. The Boss Baby: The Family Business launches July 2, 2021 in theaters and on Peacock.Reviewed by Tiana S., KIDS FIRST!",The Boss Baby - Family Business
12,Anurag-Shetty,Lives up to its predecessor.,8,13 October 2021,"The Boss Baby: Family Business continues with the adventures of the Templeton siblings, Ted(Alec Baldwin) & Tim(James Marsden). Ted & Tim have drifted away from each other, over the years. A new boss baby is going to reunite them again, on a brand new mission.The Boss Baby: Family Business is a superb film. Director Tom McGrath has given us a movie that's entertaining & heartfelt, at the same time. The new family dynamics are a welcome addition to this franchise. The animation is phenomenal. The 3D is eye-popping & is utilized to perfection in every scene. The slapstick humor gets a tad bit silly after a while but, kids will love every minute of it. The voice acting is the highlight of the film. Alec Baldwin is outstanding as Boss Baby(Ted). James Marsden is spectacular as Tim. Amy Sedaris is amazing as Tina. Ariana Greenblatt is awe-inspiring as Tabitha. Greenblatt nails all her performances & has a bright future ahead of her. Jeff Goldblum is unforgettable as Dr. Armstrong. Eva Longoria, Jimmy Kimmel & Lisa Kudrow are brilliant as Carol, Grandpa(Ted Sr.) & Grandma(Janice), respectively. The supporting cast is memorable.

13,legobuilderpro,Boss family,6,2 July 2021,"I think this is weirder than the first movie, a crazy plot and villain with funny ideas and characters that are weird.I enjoyed the boss baby and Tim working together again and enjoyed the voice actors playing the characters.I laughed a lot of times in the movie mostly because of how strange it is, the 3rd act final battle was amazingly entertaining and I think its 3rd act is better than the 3rd act in the first movie.",The Boss Baby - Family Business

16,trinaboice,Sugar rush followed by a headache,5,5 July 2021,"IN A NUTSHELL:
In this DreamWorks Animation's sequel to The Boss Baby, the Templeton brothers have become adults and drifted away from each other, but a new boss baby with a cutting-edge approach is about to bring them together again - and inspire a new family business. The sequel is directed by Tom McGrath.The first The Boss Baby was fresh and fun. It actually became a 4-season series on Netflix. This second edition in the franchise feels like a sugar rush - a burst of energy that leaves you with a headache. That being said, kids love it.THINGS I LIKED:
The pompous, overly confident character of The Boss Baby is basically the same as Alec Baldwin's role on the popular TV show 30 Rock. They're both hilarious and super entertaining.James Marsden replaces Tobey Maguire for the voice of Adult Tim in this sequel. He does a great job and I loved being able to hear him sing again. He's so talented. Parents will definitely be able to relate to his character, Timothy, the dad in the story, who asks, ""Where has time gone?""
Ariana Greenblatt is one of the hardest-working child actors these days. She has been pumping out a ton of movies lately! She's adorable in all of them. Check out my reviews in her recent films AWAKE on Netflix and LOVE AND MONSTERS. She's even seen briefly in the new movie musical IN THE HEIGHTS.Who doesn't adore Jeff Goldblum? He and his character are awesome. All of the sugar consumed by Dr. Armstrong made me laugh out loud, especially when he started pouring an actual bag of sugar into his mouth.There are some sweet musical numbers.A lot of funny visual humor.There's a creepy-girl character that is super...creepy and funny.The lessons for children come through loud and clear.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
It's been 4 years since the original The Boss Baby hit theaters, so the beginning of the film gives you a quick update on where the characters are now. The problem is that you're not completely clued in because if you haven't seen the Netflix series, you're going to be left out on many of the story details.In this age of female empowerment, the characters with the brains in the movie are all female. I'm all for empowering women, but it really bothers me when men are portrayed as bumbling idiots. One of the girls says, ""Men, am I right?"" As a mom of 4 sons, I don't appreciate belittling men in order to make girls feel better about themselves.Sooo much exposition.Almost every scene is extremely chaotic.The sibling rivalry got really old.I understand that the pandemic has messed up the timing of a lot of movie releases, but this movie should have come out during November or December, which is the season represented in the movie.Tina had blonde hair at the end of the first movie but now has brown hair. Why the change?A lot of the humor doesn't land.The soundtrack often conflicts with the dialogue.I like Amy Sedaris, but I didn't like her voice for the young Boss Baby. She's supposed to be a baby but seems much older. Christine Baranski or even Julia Louis-Dreyfus could have been a much better choice for this role.The entire movie feels frenzied and feels like they just tried to squeeze too much into it.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
You see the naked rear end of a baby boy.Lots of destruction
Bullying
TONS of cultural, musical, and movie references that young kids simply won't understand.You can see my full review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel!",The Boss Baby - Family Business

21,zac-04879,The First Boss Baby Would've Been a Great Stand-Alone,4,10 July 2021,"Expect nothing from The Boss Baby: Family Business except a flat storyline, wacky characters and tedious animated action. This potty slapstick sequel is no where near as good as the original family comedy, although there's some big-hearted family themes within this animated tale.The first film introduces a fun story of a child meeting his new baby brother and experiencing babylike but humorous adventures. Well they're all grown up in the sequel, but transform to their child-selves. Kids will get plenty of laughs from the slapstick action and other potty humour. But the plot is simple and flat, meaning adults won't have too much liking for it.This is basically another unnecessary and unwanted sequel. The Boss Baby would've worked out perfectly as a stand-alone film. Although Family Business's animation techniques and voice performances are just as admirable as any other family animation, the flat story and frequently weird depictions ruin it. This was likely to turn out really badly, unwatchable or average; it turned out as a really unwatchable adventure. It's dull, uninteresting, overlong, and unfortunate.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",The Boss Baby - Family Business

24,jace_the_film_guy,Strong Message of Reunion and Family,6,14 September 2021,"I had low expectations for this sequel and found myself mildly entertained. I enjoyed the first film, though it is not on my top 10 list. While this second installment was not as funny nor as charming as the first film, at the core of The Boss Baby: Family Business is a strong message of reunion and family. My main hiccup with this film is Tina (the girl Boss Baby). The reason that the original Boss Baby character works so well is the voice casting; Alec Baldwin's voice is instantly iconic and elevates the character beyond the script. Unfortunately, Amy Sedaris' voice is not as recognizable, entertaining or memorable, it's actually a bit grating.Voice casting aside, the plot was a bit jumbled and the villain was a little overly wacky. Though there were some flaws, I left the theater smiling due to the beautiful song ""Together We Stand"". The climactic scene with Tabitha's performance was beautiful and the song's lyrics are perfectly fitting for the film's message. A strong finale with emotional depth elevated this film to the ""good"" tier rather than falling below other disappointing sequels.",The Boss Baby - Family Business
25,jjburkekid,Pretty skipable,4,4 July 2021,"I never really liked the first film. I thought it was mean spirited and just dumb. Judging by the trailers, I thought this film could be an improvement on the first film. It was not. The whole movie just feels like the original boss baby, but with some different details. They basically used the same formula for this film. The main emotional focus of the film was Tim and Ted reconnecting after they've grown apart. It's a nice message, but drowned out by all the nonsense going on at the same time. The animation is fine, not great but not horrible. The new Boss Baby, Tina, doesn't add anything new to this film whatsoever. In all it was a pretty bad film with a heartwarming message lost in all the nonsense that is happening in this movie.",The Boss Baby - Family Business
26,nayeemiqbal_,Dont waste your time. Disappointment.,4,18 September 2021,Just to churn out money they make sequels and even ruin the original. Maybe hollywood need to hire voice actors again instead of hiring boring stars to do voice overs. Trailer was more interesting than the whole movie. Stretched it too far. Absolute disappointment.,The Boss Baby - Family Business
27,rohanumpleby,Just Why?,3,28 July 2021,Ok my baby cousin liked this movie. But my other little cousin still hated it. It's like looking forward to having a nice wine then to find out you've ran out that's what this movie reminds me of. I watched It on Tuner Radio. The Soundtrack and the animation is ok. The Acting is better in this movie. I also think kids would prefer this movie. As my baby cousin didn't admire the first but did admire the second. It's still god awful. Avoid at all cost unless you do have a baby or a young kid that liked the first!!!,The Boss Baby - Family Business
28,BijeshNagesh,Not as expected...,6,4 July 2021,"A fun-funny sequel, but not at all as good as the first one. Had some 'predictable' plot-points, but that's only to be expected in this campy-cute animation feature. Some valuable factual ideas covered in the movie, like the tremendous learning-abilities of children. The movie feels like it's going on fast-forward, with a lot happening in each scene that makes you anxious to blink in case you miss something lol. The glossed-over colouring and contrast schemes throughout this movie were a treat to soak up. Loved the in-school 'divisions' portrayed in the film, they're a very real thing and not altogether wholesome for kids - each child is unique. (Cooperation>Competition). <--It should be so anyways. Movie contains a tad too many stereotypes, non-gracefully used at that. Boss Baby remains a scene-stealer, which is great, but it was disappointing to see the other 'good' characters being used as hurdles just to progress BB's arc. Dr. Armstrong, as a villain was, though a bit heavily baby-stereotyped, well-crafted and Goldblum made for the perfect voice-casting. Many a 'convenient' scene addition, awkward dialogue choices, a few inappropriate baby humour moments (subtle exploitation hints not appreciated; programmer babies scene)... All in all, little to no originality in this movie, which was technically a highly anticipated sequel to its hit predecessor. The movie often did not feel like it was for kids, more like it was a kids-based movie for teens and young adults. 'The age of parents is over', not really a good message in such a movie, some kids actually already believe that lol, what an unwittingly dire way to enforce that thought. The whole anti-parent theme was vexing. Some parents are good (even though mine weren't J), and it feels like a let-down to those particular parents/grandparents who sacrifice and plan so much and so hard so their kids can have a life. That portion was covered only minimally in this film between Ted and Tabitha, with mum nowhere in the equation, she's 'app-washed', again not a good choice where just one parent is chosen to be the 'hero'. All the folks are good again AFTER the app-wash is no longer in effect? Hmm, curious scene choice. Nice musical score and emotional moments, though. The He-Man 'Grayskull' toys hit a nostalgia-spot lol. The symbolism behind apps brainwashing adults held psychological credit. Precious the Pony, lol, nuf said! The whole acorn and mecha fight choreo between Tina and Armstrong were also fun. The winter musical play had eye-opening content, Tabitha's solo was exemplary, and the sibling bonding scenes between BB and Tim sent all the right feel-good messages.",The Boss Baby - Family Business
29,gabethedinosaur,The boss baby rocked the summer,10,11 July 2021,The boss baby 2 was a remarkable hit. Seeing Jeff as dr armstrong was absolutely hilarious. He almost sounded like ian malcom in Jurassic Park but still funnier. The rest of the characters were so funny and so touching to those who love your siblings and parents . I hope a boss baby 3 happens and tabitha and Tina become parents too and there babies run the same thing too baby Corp .,The Boss Baby - Family Business
30,margineanvladdaniel,A nice sequel,8,3 July 2021,"I expected a worse and sexualised continuation according to the trailer, but it was decent and cute. I hoped for an improvement from the first, but they kept the deepness and the hidden messages of the real world like in the first one. I liked how the bonded in the end. I think it let space for part 3 too so, I'm waiting! Well done!",The Boss Baby - Family Business
31,dontakeitpersonal,what to say? They.... tried?,6,12 July 2021,"It was bad, but not that bad. I had to watch the first one 3-4 times to 'appreciate' it more. Perhaps I have to do the same with this one. I think i get what the writers wanted to achieve. Loosing touch with family, your daughter getting big too quick, school/pression, daughter who wants to make dad proud, being smart..... However this time, I missed a bit more humour, I missed Baby Ted's awesomeness and cuteness. I missed new team sidekicks? The old team grew up as well. I thought maybe they would do something with them or a new team of babies to help with this mission, even if it was about bringing the brothers back together and taking down dr. Armstrong. It was nearly borderline boring.",The Boss Baby - Family Business
32,Clank_Zoka,What Else Can I Say Other Then... It's Passable?,6,3 July 2021,"Usually my reviews are quite long in detail, but this it'll be short since there isn't much to say about it, so..., this is a sequel that didn't need to exist, even though I like the first Boss Baby fine, Tobey McGuire got replaced by James Marsden and erm.., yeah, the trailers didn't grab me at all and my expectations were low, so I watched it yesterday and erm.., it was actually not terrible, not good but pretty split in the middle.I like the animation overall, it's nice and simple and colourful with nice use of Cartoon slapstick, it's pretty good, it has a few funny lines and moments sprinkled across, I like Tina she was a pretty fun and expressive character, Tabitha was cute and relatable I suppose, the voice acting was... fine, but the cast did do the most of what they can with Alec Baldwin and Amy Sadaris being the big standouts!, I liked the ending and the film's nice heart and tone, it's quite nice and gives you a nice warm feel and finally the chases and fights are quite amusing and fun to watch, along with a really lovely song ""Together We Stand"" and a decent score by Hans Zimmer & Steve Mazzaro.However, there are things that hold this back, like a very recycled and predictable plot, the villain here isn't as good as the first movie's villain, Tim and Ted are kinda annoying and not that interesting, same can be said with everyone else who are very one dimensional with one trope/goal, not to mention about 80% of the humour isn't funny and just drags on, so kinda basic DreamWorks humour and even the animation gets rather too much with how bland their characters look (despite how well designed they are).So yeah, it's not good, or bad, it's kinda passable, Boss Baby 2: Family Business is just a step down from the first movie, not awful, but.., nothing wowing or leaps off the screen to amaze you, y'know?, it does have a good message and heart to it, along with nice animation and few funny gags, however it's insanely predictable and all over the way and expect for Tina and maybe Tabitha, every other character is just forgettable with mostly tiresome humour and sometimes phones in acting, (especially Jeff Goldblum), so it's a totally fine kids film, I know people will trash the heck of this film for sure, but it's really not bad, there are FAR worse animated films out there believe me I know, so if you like the first film, you'll like this probably or if you are vice verse then you'll LOATHE this movie, kids will enjoy and parents will get something out of it, but other then that, it's just a mediocrely average film for DreamWorks, but hey, looks better then the next film I'll be seeing from THEM!.I'm going to give Boss Baby 2: Family Business a 6.3/10.",The Boss Baby - Family Business
33,CrazyCockatoo2003,A slight improvement over a bad predecessor in my opinion.,5,3 July 2021,"If you thought the original was bad, prepare yourselves, because this movie is, well, surprisingly a slight improvement over the original in my opinion.What I still dislike about this movie is that unlike the first film this one focuses more on trying to be hip with the target audience with internet references, it retains the poor execution of such ideas from the first film including everything to do with Baby Corp, the toilet humor, the baby related scenes are still insufferable, it overuses tropes from a lot of movies despite being different ones, it relies a lot on pop culture references, an incredibly weak plot twist, some parts drag on for too long, this movie is as nonsensical as the previous movie in a bad way, a mediocre climax, weak villain, product placement for Mentos which feels very out of place for a DreamWorks movie, and everything feels very inconsistent.I do still see some good qualities, including the fact that it does stay true enough to the 2017 movie by retaining all the elements that made it the movie it turned out to be, the characters are much more likable this time around, Tim is much more relatable considering the situation of adulthood, some jokes work, the animation and voice acting is still good, it has better morals than the first, okay musical numbers, decent soundtrack, and the ending is written a lot better than last time.Overall, I thought this was only one step ahead of the original, despite it still not being that good of a film at all. I would not recommend you see this movie.",The Boss Baby - Family Business
34,ray115,Hard to recommend,4,12 September 2021,"Seems like the movie makers have had the best intentions. Base idea is about family and the movie contains some OK jokes. But everything is strangely whipped together with lot's of fighting and introduces another bad boss, who has plans to conquer the world. This seemed boring even to my child.",The Boss Baby - Family Business
35,masterekblasterek,The Boss baby is back...:(,1,20 September 2021,"Ok...this movie is not good at all, but 2 things are pretty decent to be honest. The quote: Yeah I make money, but you made a family...being on top doesn't matter when you are alone there...or something like that and Tabitha's song is good. Anything else is bad, nasty and irritating. The boss baby and this ginger hair guy are madnessly irritating and the main villain is pretty bad. He is like the guy from the first one. Also the story is a little bit annoying and some moments are unclear. Anyway still a bad movie, but a little bit better than the first one.",The Boss Baby - Family Business
36,fandomfatale,Entertaining,9,13 July 2021,"There are a lot of bad reviews here, and some rather unfair ones, I think. I just thought I would throw in that I was entertained from start to finish and it garnered quite a few chuckles out of me. I would watch it again some time in the future, which is not something I've been able to say about very many movies that have come out in the past year or so. It's lighthearted and there's not very much here to bother anyone. If you didn't like the first one, you probably won't like this one, but if you did like the first one, it's more of the same, which was fine by me.",The Boss Baby - Family Business
37,Bubba32618,How was it sort of good?,6,8 July 2021,"The continuity in this a mess. They say that Baby Corp. Just invented a new baby serum that turns adults into babies but at the end of the first movie the villain turned from an adult and into a baby once they fell into the normal baby serum so the continuity is a mess. Jeff Goldblum as the villain was phenomenal. I loved the villain, the villain was so messed up when it comes to the animatronic human body because the villain is a baby. The movie was really funny because of how random but good it was. Jeff Goldblum's character was really good. I don't like Alec Baldwin but he was ok in this movie. I enjoyed Lisa Kudrow's performance and character. This movie was a lot more entertaining and enjoyable and just a better quality movie. The Boss Baby: Family Business is not great but it wasn't bad. This sequel was better than the original and I think I kind of liked it more than Raya and the Last Dragon. We will see if The Boss Baby: Family Business will get an Oscar nomination just like the first movie but the real question is why did I see this in the theater?",The Boss Baby - Family Business

39,minerwolfminer,Boss Baby 2 was entertaining and heartwarming but...,7,22 September 2021,"Was it a good movie? YES! Was the whole movie good? NO ( I'll get to that in a sec. ) I definitely think this should have 6.9 as its average rating. It's not that bad. I know the reason why a good bunch disliked it and I totally understand them.Pros:
I like Tim because he reminds me of myselfending is very good. Tim and Teddy are closer than ever! Moral Lesson: Be close with your family members and make sure to give them your time, love and understanding.animation is very smoothThe animation and how the characters look is cute in a good way. I love it. I love the character's designs.ending half of the movie was a redemptionGRANPA AND GRANDMA are here! Grandpa also looks like Iron Man's dad.I know I've seen this kind of situation before... A father becomes a child again and gets to bond with his son/daughter/wife, I can't remember the movie though. But I like that it's a part of this movie.Cons:
First half was funny and entertaining but also annoying and weird.Though I like Tim's imagination, it's a bit too much sometimes.Tina's voice isn't perfect for her. It's bothering at times, but somehow... It does fit sometimes? Like what my mom says... "" She sounds like a kid and an adult at the same time ""That one scary baby... I even told my siblings that it's probably the baby or ""It"" the scary clown.That's all! I know it's a lot but it's really not that bad.

41,krisnadexter,Adequate At Best,6,10 September 2021,"Some movies be left alone, and Boss Baby is one of them. The first movie is good and fun, you could finish it there, they shouldn't make a sequel from it. But they did, and it's worse.Some positive, the animation is good, some good voice acting, and the soundtrack ""Together We Stand"" is reaaaally good, kids will love it.But the story is so so. This is cartoon so don't expect logical thing. The jokes kinda flat, some characters are annoying, the villain isn't as good as the first movie, and the plot is too predictable.Overall this is okay movie.

43,kristoffe-brodeur,mayhem everywhere as the animators make you laugh out loud,10,3 July 2021,"Just sitting down to get into this, each and every hit was on, but I felt like the voice actors were more famous than correctly cast for this. Sure, that was a bit of the old nails on a chalkboard to hear Amy Suderis, but wasn't bad, maybe that's the mood beyond use famous actors to sell it.The use of timing is everything in this visually. There's a chase scene that is very looney tunes and I love it, everything is cute and funny to the point kids will obsess over this one. That means you too, yes the kid inside will hem and haw about the first 10 minutes of the overly preachy parts, but they're even fun.It's not bad to feel good when you watch a movie, have a couple of good life lessons thrown in there too to bat. The ideas are a bit all over the place, but many films do that, only in say Toy Story does the, wait, same thing there and that's a classic, right?So if you like zany animation that breaks the rules of physics and silly voices with some tutorials on growing up, slowly, for kids, then check this one out.",The Boss Baby - Family Business

45,Dunkaccino,Alec Bladwin is an angry baby...again...,3,24 September 2021,"The first Boss Baby was some dumb fun family entertainment. The second one tries to follow the footsteps
of it, but fails miserably.As you may know, brothers Tim (James Marsden) and Ted (Alec Baldwin) are grownups now. Tim has a daughter
Tina (Amy Sedaris), who is apparently an intelligent baby working in BabyCorps.Tim has issues with his older daughter Tabitha (Ariana Greenblatt) coming from her school, created by the villain Armstrong (Jeff Goldblum). Tim and Ted sneaks in the school disguised as their younger selves.The villain Armstrong is trying to overthrow the world's parents by controlling them with an app. He and his army of babies try to take over the world.A mobile app. Yes. A mind-controlling mobile app. Didn't we see the same idea in Incredibles 2 and Kingsman: The Secret Service? Yes we did. The Boss Baby: Family Business is a cliched and boring movie like that.This awful sequel offers nothing except a nice score by Hans Zimmer, some colourful visuals and Jeff Goldblum making an OK villain. It's really unlikely that the messages of this film will make some children learn a lesson.The idea of an entire intelligent baby company seems fresh for the first time, but not fresh enough for a second time apparently. Boss Baby is undeserving of a TV series and a sequel.A lot of slapstick and childish humour falls flat and turns into embarrassment, which the movie is.

The heartwarming story about fatherhood and brotherhood.The Protagonists' positive arcs of Tim, Boss Baby (Ted), and Tabitha tied with the flat arc of Tina ended happily and even the Antagonist got a meaningful change ending. There's some symbolism in there about the characters.The reason I call this ""The New Age of Dreamworks"" is because of how Dreamworks is evolving into a more colorful and brighter studio aiming at a new audience.

The animations aren't simple but top notch and portray the moments well. It's hilarious most times and touching with a message that a lot of people did not pick up because they were too busy hating or comparing it to the previous movie. The girl's singing is realistic, it's actually unrealistic to expect them to sing like super pop stars at that age especially when she couldn't get the right tune due to stage fright previously.Villain could use more depth and conviction but it's a family friendly movie, what do you expect?All in all, it was a very delightful watch, the whole film was bursting with energy and all the voice actors were great.

I kind of disliked the first Boss Baby just cause the humor fell flat for me in a lot of places and it was mostly aimed at a very young audience, (Which is fine, nothing wrong with that). But Family Business is genuinely funny, like I admit it's not a comedic masterpiece or anything, but I feel like this movie fully commits to what it is and it chooses to have fun with it anyway. The first movie kind of attempted this but it didn't go all the way in it's execution. This movie is pretty much just non stop chaos amongst the screen, does any of it make sense? No of course not, but it acknowledges this and uses it to it's advantage. I will always appreciate the cartoon that knows that it's a cartoon and doesn't attempt to pull at your heart strings but rather provide a few laughs for ya, and Family Business did just that.Why did I take the time to write this?

Even my son who LOVED the first one was ready to stop watching about 20 or 25 minutes into it. We hung on though and eventually it started moving a bit.The problem is that it all seems so forced. Every situation is just really trying to push the narrative even if it doesn't help move the story forward.The first one was ridiculous, but still had some endearing moments, and really seemed to have some spots for parents to enjoy with some references that would go over the heads of the kids. This one seems to go to the opposite end of the spectrum, and seems written towards the 8 year old mentality. While I don't mind watching most animated movies several times with the kid, including the first Boss Baby movie, this one just doesn't seem to be something we'll be doing that with.But for younger kids the mindless plot and mediocre voice acting this time around won't be as much of an issue since there's still enough shiny eye candy to keep the children engaged.",The Boss Baby - Family Business

71,alammuntasir,The long awaited sequel is uh... okay,7,5 July 2021,"The Boss Baby 2: Family Business Movie ReviewThe sequel to one of the best animated movies was worth it. The movie was directed by Tom McGrath. It stars Alec Baldwin as Ted, James Marsden as Tim, Amy Sedaris as Tina, Ariana Greenblatt as Tabitha, Jeff Goldblum as Armstrong, additional cast is Jimmy Kemmel and Lisa Kudrow as Grandpa and Grandma Templeton respectively. The music is done by Oscar winner Hans Zimmer.The movie is back after the first hit film and 4 seasons of Netflix series, the sequel is released and boy it astonished me. The only problem of the movie is that it continued from the series instead of the first movie. In the movie, Tim and Ted are de-aged to infiltrate a super school whose main goal is to make the parents the slaves of the babies. A lot of plot details were followed from the series instead of the movie. (I NEVER WATCHED THE SERIES THOUGH). Like what happened between Ted and Tim. Then when he got married and how the children came. They were apparently part of the 4 season series in Netflix. Other than that the whole movie is very good. The cast was awesome. Tina as next Boss Baby is though lacking the coolness of the Ted in that position. Like all kids movies, a lot of things haven't made sense, but after all, this movie was made for kids, so I have no grudge. What they absolutely nailed was the music. Hans Zimmer is the best. And Ariana Greenblatt as Tabitha was so beautiful. If you watched the first movie, you should definitely watch this movie.The movie delivers its cheesiness and it is full of clever jokes and action. The movie is cutely creepy which is what I expected. This movie also explores a very important family relation which is disappearing now is brotherhood in adult. It nailed in case of explaining what we have to cope up to maintain brotherhood during adult period. This movie is must watch for everybody who wants to experience a good time with their family.Personal Review: 7.5/10

72,marq_bryant,Really great sequel. Better than I expected.,10,13 July 2021,Watched it with the kids and loved it. Didn't have high expectations but my mind was changed quickly. Animation is great and several of the jokes were reminiscent of the first Boss Baby. A lot of complaints in the reviews but this movie was just fine with indeed a great lesson. Alec a Baldwin btw is great as always. Check it out!,The Boss Baby - Family Business
73,uglymushroom,The greatest film ever made.,10,14 July 2021,This film is a masterpiece. The characters are awesome and the story is highly believable. This could definitely happen in real life! My only complaint is that the movie should have been longer. Also there needs to be more sequels.,The Boss Baby - Family Business
74,aussieblob,Am I watching Boss Baby???,4,9 July 2021,"I'm sorry, it didn't get me hooked from the start. And I couldn't figure out what was going on. Just felt weirdly flat. You know a movie is not good when your son looks at you 20 mins in with questionable eyes, screws up his face and says ""this is rubbish... can't I do something else.""",The Boss Baby - Family Business
75,adrianmcmahon-52299,"A decent movie, though at times confusing and rushed.",6,3 July 2021,"Overall, I enjoyed this movie, and though I think the first was better, I'm sure kids will love it just as much.Intro: 3/10The intro was by far the weakest part of this movie and felt incredibly rushed and made little sense. The problem and characters are barely developed at first which makes it difficult to follow, and before you know it major changes have already happened. As the movie went on, I had so many questions on what was happening because the introduction didn't explain the plot of the movie well.Plot: 7/10Although it starts off bumpy, the plot of the movie does make sense, yet as I said before, I still feel that the main problem that the protagonists are facing is barely developed. The ""villain"" in this movie isn't shown in an evil light until what seems to be the end of the film.Humor: 10/10When I was in the theater a group of little kids sat behind us and they managed to laugh at almost every scene.Ending: 9/10Unlike the rest of the movie, Boss Baby 2 actually had a surprisingly good ending. The main problem, along with smaller problems within the show, are all satisfyingly resolved.",The Boss Baby - Family Business
76,afelgueres-77036,Not even close to being as good as the first one,1,21 October 2021,"Didn't like this one. Felt more like it should've been a spinoff or part of BB Back in Business type show. I feel that Theodore Templeton was pushed back to being a side character in this one. I also thought it was stupid that Timothy Templeton. Still had his adult voice when he was changed by into being a kid again. Plus the awkward relationship he had with his daughter when he changed into a kid was kind of weird itself.The only part I liked was when BB played the part of the Baby Jesus. Other than that, i really think this movie was a dumpster fire.",The Boss Baby - Family Business
77,afelgueres-77036,Doesn't capture the imagination of the first film,1,24 October 2021,"The first Boss Baby was great! I liked how the movie left it up to you to determine if BB was real or if he was a figment of Tim's imagination.In This one I feel that BB was pushed to be a secondary character and I didn't like how the rest of the gang was grown up. Plus
I found it weird that Tim would still have his adult voice when he becomes a kid again. The new characters and villains were forgettable as well.The only part I liked was when BB was dressed up as the baby Jesus but other than that horrible film.Boss Baby Back in Business was a better sequel to the original than this one was.",The Boss Baby - Family Business
78,vaughanstarr,Soundtrack overlays every dialogue scene!,2,2 July 2021,"What lunatic thought it a good idea to overlay every single dialogue scene with distracting soundtrack? Were they getting paid for each second it was included? It made it impossible to focus upon what was being said a number of times, especially when the ""new"" Boss baby is speaking at a mile a minute. The rest of the time it diminished the scene. When used judiciously the right soundtrack passes right by conscious awareness and just seizes your emotions. When you are aware of it constantly though, so that the brief periods of its absence (and they are oh so brief) are greeted as merciful respite, then it has not only failed its purpose but is actively working against the movie!",The Boss Baby - Family Business
79,dangrmk,Lost me in the first 10 minutes.,1,21 August 2021,"I'm pretty good about giving films a fair shake. Sat through, and mostly enjoyed, my share of B (and C) movies that others would've left. This, however, was like watching a bunch of toddlers after consuming way too much chocolate. Screaming, shrieking, flailing, all backed by a blaring music score. It was actually painful. Too bad.",The Boss Baby - Family Business
80,eriksolis-49373,Awful movie for kids.,1,6 October 2021,Hollywood is producing some sick and awful movies aimed at kids. They make a big deal out of sucking on a pacifier. Just little jokes here and there are just too Hollywood perverted. The movie teaches kids to be rude and act like jerks. Most kids don't need that help.,The Boss Baby - Family Business

82,chrisd-58613,One of the funniest movies of the year,9,21 July 2021,Okay so I'll say that I had my doubts about this one due to the fact that I didn't exactly like the first one however I laughed constantly threw out this movie they amped up the plot and the laughs a few notches and I highly recommend it to almost anyone.,The Boss Baby - Family Business
83,El_Gamas,Just another happy movie to watch in your empty moments,6,10 October 2021,"Just like we expect for those childish movies, this is a soft animation to see with your kids or when you don't want to see a movie just to chill out. It's doubtless that your kids will enjoy, there's good comedy and the storyline is hypnotic (for a child) and there are a few moments a children can feel related to, such as being different than the parents, wanting to impress them and how bullying affects their lives outside school. And they also may get with the beautiful song of Tim's daughter stuck in the head.Now to an adult, the movie brings problems we face when growing up, but only the two brothers separating that innovated, the rest were only cliches. The movie brings also one critic about the society, but it's just the same old ""cellphones are gonna brain wash you"" and in a superficial way.The end was not just a happily ever after, it led the viewer to expect to have a sequel (through series or movie), because there is one moment in the end something happens that the main characters don't know about, ending the movie with a question.Therefore, there is no doubt the first movie was so much better. Although this one couldn't surprise me, it still is a great movie to watch during dinner or in family time.",The Boss Baby - Family Business
84,pejashco,Not very good,4,3 July 2021,"This first 45 minutes of this movie are incredibly boring. It is hard to sit through. The rest of the movie is watchable, not great, but watchable. It has some funny parts, but not many. My kids gave it 5 stars, but liked the original way better. Seriously, no one in the world would find this movie hilarious. Don't believe any of the reviews giving it a 10.",The Boss Baby - Family Business
85,longoni-52354,What are people talking about,10,10 July 2021,I hate reviews from people trying to be the next roger ebert so I'm not sure exactly why people are bashing this movie. I took my family not expecting much but to our surprise it was funny from start to finish. I guess people think they deserve some masterpiece or maybe they don't have a sense of humor but people icing this anything below a 7 should really ask themselves if they feel they can write a movie. People are so entitled it's horrible. So take your family. It is funny and overall a great movie. Haters will always hate most likely because they are virgins.,The Boss Baby - Family Business
86,craigmilller,Perfect,8,11 August 2021,"While the first half might be slow, it was fun. It is the second part which was noteworthy to me.

I liked James Marsden and Alec Baldwin. They were funny and I liked their characters. But, here's the thing wrong with this movie. SPOILERS :
When Dr. Armstrong baby takes over the parents through the app at the play, Tabitha does her singing solo with the other kids. It's not that good. Her actresses' singing voice is good, but the singing is annoying and unnecessary. This movie isn't awful but not good. Better than the first one.",The Boss Baby - Family Business

There were a few laughs but overall I didn't think the movie was very funny. It was loud and busy but unfortunately not busy enough to distract from how bad this movie was.Unlike most people, I liked the not so subtle message to parents: GET OFF OF YOUR PHONE and pay attention to your kids.Tim's parents almost saved the movie! The chemistry from the first movie appeared for a bit at the end so maybe after sleeping on it, I'll change my review to a 5!

I lobe how the story is adult but executed through a child's mind. I would watch a third installment, without any question.",The Boss Baby - Family Business
99,rmpartyplanners,Amazing movie choice for families!,10,10 August 2021,"You can't watch an un-logical movie logically. Most of these reviews are trying to watch the movie with the mind of an adult and try to think their way through the film rather than feel their way.Towards the 1/2 hour of the movie, it was emotional for me and focused a lot on the bond of the two brothers (Tim and Boss Baby) which I especially loved. I cried a little bit even- and the ending of the movie just left me in a happy and satisfied mood :)Would definitely recommend to families with kids 11 and under, they will love the movie! Overall, I think both 'Boss Baby' movies were amazing, and the sequel was definitely a great addition to an amazing series!",The Boss Baby - Family Business
100,erilaurence,I was laughing out loud at the gags even as an adult,8,4 July 2021,"Maybe i have just low standards, but the comedy was really hilarious. And i love the sequel's premise where the brothers have drifted apart and it's up to the new blood to fix things. The touching moments were also very nice. I cried my heart out on each of them. Lastly, I really enjoyed jeff goldblum's performance. He kind of played himself on this one which I really like. Oh and the sidekick babies are so cool.",The Boss Baby - Family Business
101,jbflower96,"A Good Sequel, with a Lot of Heart",8,3 July 2021,"The first Boss Baby movie was more of a whim viewing and was quite entertaining. Wasn't too impressed with the trailers for BB 2, but neither did I like the first movie's or any of DreamWorks' films in honestly. So off to the movies I went!Like the first one, Tim provides the opening narration and animation that is still as creative and bright. He's grown up and started a family, while Ted (BB) is a major CEO who barely visits. Once again, Baby Corp has an issue that needs to be cleared and the Templetons are chosen to fix it. To do so, Tim and Ted are changed back to their ages in the first movie and have to infiltrate Tim's daughters's school. Cue shenanigans, jokes, sibling squabbles, and an outrageous plan.A big theme of the movie is family staying together and learning how to balance life, work, and each other. Tim and Ted have a brother relationship to mend, and Tim is learning how to be there for his daughter, Tabitha, as she's growing up. Tina, the youngest member and current Baby Corp employee, works to bring them all together without taking over the whole show.It leads to some wacky comments and hurt feelings, but it's something anyone with siblings and children can relate to.In short, I find this movie much more entertaining and engaging than the first movie. Tim and Ted work well off each other, the villain was over the top in a good way, the animation is fast paced and colorful (especially Tim's day dreaming), and it's a wholesome message about learning to grow up without growing apart from each other.If you're a fan of the first movie, then I highly recommend it!",The Boss Baby - Family Business
102,tahaneebean,What did I just watch!?!?,2,16 August 2021,"This is really unsettling. Not every movie needs a sequel and this is one of them. Why just why. This should not be a kids movie.

105,renzgarciano,My expectations were exceeded!!!,8,5 August 2021,"When i watch the first movie of boss baby i thought it was just fineThen i somehow watch the second movie because i have nothing to do(i watched it with the lowest possible expectations that's probably why i loved it more than i thought)Okay first about the plot
Well It's just okay honestly but let's not talk about thatLet's talk about the reasons why i loved this movie and the reason is because of it's character i really loved it especially in the pageant part i did get a little emotional
And the dynamics between the brothers they have such an amazing dynamics it's like a love hate relationship which im a fan of that kind of relationship (im not gonna go deeper than this because i might spoil your experience whoever's reading this)And some of you well probably thought that we've seen that kind of plot in some shows before well in my opinion boss baby 2 did the same thing but just betterAlso i forgot to mention my second reason why i love this movie the second reason is it's visuals i love how they Animate a lot of scenes so naturally that it doesn't fell stiff also there were a lot of colorful visuals like when the girl sings(i forgot he's name) and stuff which made it more compellingThis is just really good im kind of upset why the ratings are really low it should have at least 7+ ratingsBut there is probably another reason why i loved this so much it might be because i have such a low expectations in this movie but one thing is for sure this movie deserves a 7-8 ratings.",The Boss Baby - Family Business

108,oldgrumpfromthe80s,Cash Run,3,2 July 2021,"The first movie was so good. My kids and I even liked the Netflix Series (even though Alec Baldwin isn't in them). I thought the whole Tim and Daughter relationship/becoming schoolmates, then friends, then teased for being 'romantically' interested in each other is just kind of unsettling, a strange plot direction. The rest of the movie is pretty good, totally lame that Tobey Maguire didn't participate, wanted too much cash probably, and probably fair enough. However, being that this movie was released after the world ended, heck, pretty good to keep production costs low because I wonder if this will this make it's money back???On another note, and it is hard for me to say anything good about the movie after all the Tim/Daughter weirdness, Jeff Goldblum and the character are just flawless.

141,ggxdkfj,Love this movie!!!,10,8 August 2021,Usually the 2nd movies aren't as great as the first but this was awesome! Not sure what is wrong with those people that gave a bad review. My kids love it!,The Boss Baby - Family Business
142,veggiecat-20162,Fast-Paced Fun for Whole Family,10,11 July 2021,"This movie really is family business. This sequel has some the fastest pacing I've seen in an animated film. Watching it was like the thrill of riding a roller coaster while in a theater seat. The action is made more impactful with strong character dynamics and a good message. Overall, the film is full of heart. 10/10 must watch family movie.",The Boss Baby - Family Business
143,psballer,Meaningful movie about life,10,22 July 2021,Some comments here disappointed the movie but the truth is this has a good message about siblings and love ones. Family is more important than anyone else. Just done watching the movie. I enjoyed it!,The Boss Baby - Family Business
144,ainexwalsh,Surprised by the other reviews,10,28 July 2021,"I had low expectations going in, knowing I was seeing a children's animated film. The beginning is a bit slow, cute but could have been better. Once Ted shows up the movies gets infinitely better. I laughed pretty loud a few times, there is a little bit of humor for adults that my daughter half heartedly laughed at, not really understanding what was so funny. There are a few new characters that I loved (Tabitha, Tina, Tabitha's pony, glue kid) and old ones, Wizzie is of course hilarious! I could do without the Tim imagination scenes, but overall I would highly recommend seeing the movie! I've seen a lot of reviews saying it is misogynistic etc. No it's not, stop trying to find the negative in things, it's a fun lighthearted movie!",The Boss Baby - Family Business
145,fp-52558,I'm 20 years old and thought it was pretty great,9,2 August 2021,"I know the movie was a little chaotic but honestly aren't all children films? Anyways, it's nice to just rewind and watch funny and heartfelt cartoons every once in awhile. I almost teared up at some points throughout the movie also. I think this movie overall has a cute and meaningful message about the importance about spending time with family and time running out with loved ones. I only watched half of the movie to continue it later but once I read some of these reviews, it almost made me not watch it. However, I'm glad I ended up watching it anyways! I loved how cute the ending was. There's always a bad guy in movies but I felt content that even he had a happy and well deserved ending as well.",The Boss Baby - Family Business
146,tonyindustries,Lots of moral values,8,2 August 2021,"Indeed, the storyline is predictable, but the concept and value of the film is very useful.",The Boss Baby - Family Business
147,riamukesh,"Emotional, Amazing, Great family movie",10,10 August 2021,"I think it really captured the importance of a family bond! At least for me, it was emotional at times, more so towards the end. May be a little boring for adults kids 11 and under may love it!",The Boss Baby - Family Business
148,doriangolub,"Evertything feels overwhelming, with a forced feminist spice",3,10 September 2021,"Every dialogue has a soundtrack, the movie is filled with toxic positivity and kids under 10 will probably like it. It feels like every scene is loud, colorful and energetic like a bunch of toddlers wrote the script.Also, the movie has a bit of letfist feminist spice in it with Tim being a stay-at-home softy dad, mom being the cool breadwinner, the baby girl behaving like a typical boy, and saying lines like: ""Ah, men. Am I right?"" What's up with that?Only watched the first 20 minutes and that was enough. 3 stars for the production quality.",The Boss Baby - Family Business
149,yangshanny,Splendid but could use a little more work,9,4 October 2021,"It was amazing but the one problem is that the story plotting seems a bit dry, ngl the seasons in Netflix had a much better story plot but the animation and the effort put into the models and the scene itself was amazing
, I was totally amaze through the green laser scene it gave like a reality laser senses and some scene were funny, the kids couldn't help but laugh in the movie theatre but the story could have been much more better.",The Boss Baby - Family Business
150,stealthpilot101,HILARIOUS!!!!,10,2 July 2021,"I REALLY enjoyed the 1st one. But, the sequel is WAY better!!",The Boss Baby - Family Business
151,eekamouse909,Absolutely loved it!,10,9 July 2021,"We watched this with the kids and we were all in stitches. Superb writing, great casting - loved Goldblumms part - just a great couple of hours fun. Highly recommended.",The Boss Baby - Family Business
152,wubbs23,Insulting,1,31 July 2021,"Created an account just to write this review. One of the only movies I've considered walking out of (and should have). Our kids liked the first movie but we didn't vet this one ahead of time. It's clear all new movies need to be vetted now as it was over stimulating, chaotic, and didn't even really try to have much of a plot. It felt shoving an iPad in front of a toddler with as much stimulation and movement you can pack into one screen. It's really insulting movie studios have gotten so overt in their attempt to throw noise, colors, and stimulation at us and our kids and thinking it's what consumers want. I felt ashamed I took my kid to this, and am sad that our overconsumption of media has lead to movies like this just to meet the demand. Felt like the definition of a money grab. Also while most movies are generally liberal anyway, there were particularly overt aspects of cross dressing and others things which I didn't appreciate in a kids movie.",The Boss Baby - Family Business
153,nettlesm-24514,Not bad,6,3 July 2021,Fun for all ages. Not a bad plot. If you seen the first and liked it then you should see this one as well.,The Boss Baby - Family Business
154,stephieanderson-15570,Not as kid friendly as I want,3,26 July 2021,"Nipple twisting, crotch hits, bullying, not a fan.",The Boss Baby - Family Business
155,danielespinozax,Amazing,10,2 July 2021,This movie was by far the most amazing and funny movie and it tells us to grow up but not to grow apart from our loved ones and this made me laugh and after watching the 1st and this one this was the best story both the 1st and 2nd I hope to see a third in the future.,The Boss Baby - Family Business
156,prdrummer,Loved it!!!,10,3 July 2021,The movie was great! It continued with the fast paced humor that the original had. The reality is this is not supposed to knock your socks off but it is a hilarious and well done KIDS movie. If you find yourself turning your nose up at this...you are just boring! Enjoy!,The Boss Baby - Family Business
