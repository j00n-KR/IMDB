0,Leofwine_draca,Nothing to dislike,7,17 October 2021,"Very much in the spirit of a LETHAL WEAPON sequel, BAD BOYS FOR LIFE is a surprisingly enjoyable throwback to the 1990s. I thought the first two movies were pretty good, but I actually enjoyed this one the best of all. The ageing jokes are quite funny, there's less dumb/crude humour than I was expecting, and the character interplay still works; there's a reason buddy buddy comedies are perennial favourites so this is a no-brainer really. In addition, it's very well shot with a great colour palette and the action sequences are handled adroitly. Nothing to dislike, really.",Bad Boys for Life
1,SnoopyStyle,Lethaler Weapon,8,12 April 2020,"Miami PD Marcus (Martin Lawrence) and Mike (Will Smith) continue to take down criminals with a new squad. Meanwhile, Isabel Aretas (Kate del Castillo) escapes from a Mexican prison with witchcraft and her son. The two set out to take revenge with the finale being Mike.The boys are back and they are better in one respect. Essentially, they have become Riggs and Murtaugh. Marcus is now doing too-old-for-this... Mike is edging into mental melodrama with the reveal. The reveal is an interesting one. I would have liked a de-aging sequence with Driving Miss Daisy. There is still plenty of ridiculous action after getting away from Michael Bay. The best of the franchise continues to be the duo's chemistry. The airplane sequence is hilarious. The main flaw is that the couple gets separate for a large chunk of the movie. They need to be together every second so that they can maximize that magic. This is obviously aiming for more sequels and the one that I would keep is the muscle man pacifist.",Bad Boys for Life
2,Prismark10,Bad Boys for Life,6,3 February 2020,"Michael Bay has stepped aside from the Director's chair but he makes a cameo appearance and his signature high octane style is all over this film.Twenty five years after the original Bad Boys. You would expect Miami detectives Mike Lowery (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) to be retired or dead by now.Here they are still going strong but Marcus is now a grandfather and he thinks about calling it a day.Mike though is almost fatally shot. His past as a rookie cop comes back to haunt him. Isabel Aretas is a widow of a Mexican drug cartel head. She has been jailed for a number of years and has now escaped with the help of her son Armando.Now they are hell bent on revenge on the people who put her and her late husband to jail as well as take back their power in the Mexican cartel. Armando has been trained to be a fledgeling gang leader and assassin.Isabel is a witch using her powers to incite hate. She also has a past association with Mike.Bad Boys for Life is a noisy cartoonish action film. It has over the top stunts, some humour and a laughable plot which really cannot be taken seriously.Will Smith who is now 51 is in good shape. Martin Lawrence who is only three years older looks rather portly and out of shape. However the two leads still have a good chemistry.",Bad Boys for Life
3,claudio_carvalho,"Funny, Full of Action and Entertaining",7,26 April 2020,"In Miami, Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) is a grandfather and intends to retire. Meanwhile, the dangerous Isabel Aretas (Kate del Castillo) escapes from a Mexican prison and plots with her son Armando Aretas (Jacob Scipio) to kill the people responsible for arresting he husband that died in prison. Armando tries to kill Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) but he survives. When he recovers, he decides to hunt down Armando with the support of Marcus and the AMMO led by Rita (Paola Nuñez).""Bad Boys for Life"" is a funny, full of action and entertaining film. This third film of the franchise has a good combination of action and comedy. The plot is predictable but the chemistry of Will Smith and Martin Lawrence is worthwhile watching. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil):""Bad Boys Para Sempre"" (""Bad Boys for Life"")",Bad Boys for Life
4,nogodnomasters,We ride together. We die together.,8,25 January 2020,"Don't need to discuss much of the plot. Our bad boys go after the bad guys. Multiple shoot-outs and chase scenes. Will Smith is the target in this one. He can't do as he would like and has to work with a new group called AMMO who uses drones and high-tech stuff. They join the ""Bad Boy"" group as the film does set up for a sequel. For a moment I thought I was watching ""Gemini."" I guess it is tough coming up with new scripts. Maybe we could turn Will into a pigeon.Fun popcorn film. No heavy thinking.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Bad Boys for Life
5,kosmasp,Not too old for that ...,7,21 June 2020,"I'm not sure I can finish the quote on imdb. Swearing and all that. But that aside and not even close to comparing this to the Lethal Weapon franchise, the next entry into the Bad Boys series is here. Many have been waiting for this for a long time. Not sure why that was (many speculations about that), but let's just enjoy that it is here.It also feels like both Martin and Will never left ... the roles. It feels like they are those guys. Maybe some parts of them do match to their personality, who knows? Having said that, the movie is quite predictable, but also quite fun overall. I cannot be mad at some of the flaws and the convinient timing of certain events. Nor the added relationships and backstories that might feel detached to a degree. If you can just watch it, without thinking too much, it'll be ok. But I reckon it is time to rewatch the first two movies again ... (4 Life though? Shouldn't they have waited to use that for a sure to come part 4? I mean come on!)",Bad Boys for Life
6,jboothmillard,Bad Boys for Life,5,26 January 2020,"The first movie released exactly 25 years ago is great fun, the sequel that followed 9 years later is a bit disappointing, this third film, released 17 years later, was the completion of the trilogy. Basically, Miami detective Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence), having witnessed the birth of his grandson, tells his partner Mike Lowrey (Will Smith, also producing) his intentions to retire, much to Mike's disappointment. Meanwhile, assassin Armando Aretas (Jacob Scipio) helped stage the prison escape of his mother Isabel (Kate del Castillo). The vengeful Isabel wants all responsible for the demise of the Aretas cartel run by her and her husband Benito, who was sent to prison and subsequently died, this includes Mike. Following a celebration party, Mike is shot by Armando. Despite being told to kill Mike last, Armando targeted him first as he deemed him the biggest threat to their plans. Armando proceeds over the next six months to assassinate everyone else responsible, while Mike recovers. Mike demands Marcus's help to catch the assassin, but Marcus decides to go into retirement. Marcus prayed to God for Mike's survival after his death experience, promising he will never turn to violence again. This causes the two friends to fall out. Despite orders from Captain Conrad Howard (Joe Pantoliano), Mike learns that the arms dealer who sold the ammunition used in his assassination attempt is Booker Grassie (Rory Markham). Howard reluctantly brings Mike as a consultant into the tech-driven Advanced Miami Metro Operations (AMMO), led by Mike's ex-girlfriend Rita (Paola Nuñez). The team try to obtain evidence to bring Grassie in at a business deal, but Mike sees the buyers are attempting to kill Grassie, Mike tries and fails to save him. While an old informant of Marcus, Carver Remy (Ivo Nandi), calls asking for his help, warning him that everyone who had protected him has been assassinated. Marcus picks up Mike to go to Carver's home, but they are too late, Carver is killed. Mike fights Armando and seems to recognize his eyes before Armando escapes. Sometime later, Captain Howard tells Mike he should also consider retirement before he gets himself killed. Howard is subsequently killed by Armando with a sniper rifle. After the captain's funeral, Marcus decides to help Mike out one last time. With the help of AMMO, they track down Grassie's accountant and identify key suspect Lorenzo ""Zway-Lo"" Rodriguez (Nicky Jam), someone Marcus used to coach basketball. They crash a birthday party for Zway-Lo, who manages to get away, and Armando in a helicopter over the bridge stops them from chasing. Armando kills Zway-Lo to get to Mike. Before trying to kill him, Armando says ""Hasta el fuego."" Marcus, however, stops Armando with gunfire and Mike jumps into the river to escape. AMMO is threatened to be shut down due to their recent failure. Mike tells Marcus in private that Armando may be his son: Before he and Marcus were partners, he was recruited by Captain Howard out of the academy to infiltrate the Aretas cartel. Wilst undercover, he had an affair with Isabel, which led to the birth of Armando, and they used to say ""Hasta el fuego"" (a meaningless phrase, translated ""until the fire"") to each other. Mike chose the side of the law and had Isabel as well as Benito arrested knowing she was dangerous. All the previous victims killed by Armando were working on the same case. Mike decides to go to Mexico City alone to confront Isabel, but Marcus and AMMO insist on going with him. At the Hidalgo Palace, Mike is angry Isabel for not telling Armando the truth about his father and for raising him to be an assassin. There is a shootout between AMMO and Isabel's henchmen, during the Isabel's helicopter pilot is shot, causing it crash into building and start a fire. While Marcus briefly incapacitates Isabel, Mike confronts Armando and tries to convince him he is his father. Armando refuses to believe him until Isabel confirms it. Isabel shoots at Mike but strikes Armando instead, after which Rita shoots and kills Isabel. They all escape the burning building; Mike tells Armando he will have to pay for his crimes but says he will be there for him. Sometime later, Rita is named the new police captain while Mike and Marcus, having decided to come out of retirement, are placed in charge of AMMO. At the end, Mike visits Armando and asks for his help in a case to reduce his prison sentence. Also starring Vanessa Hudgens as Kelly, Alexander Ludwig as Dorn, Charles Melton as Rafe, Theresa Randle as Theresa Burnett, Khaled 'DJ Khaled' Khaled as Manny and Michael Bay (director of the first two films) as Wedding MC, Adil El Arbi (director) as Rideshare Driver and Bilall Fallah (director) as Fael. The chemistry between Smith and Lawrence as the mismatched bickering cops just about remains good, like the previous film there are maybe not as many good laughs, and the crminal wanting revenge subplot is a little up-and-down, but at least the high-speed chases and guns blazing sequences are reasonable, not a bad action comedy. Worth watching!",Bad Boys for Life
7,paul_haakonsen,Lots of action provide good enough entertainment...,6,1 April 2020,"Right, well first of all I must say that I have watched the previous movies, of course, and found them to be adequately entertaining, but I wouldn't consider myself a fan of the franchise in any way. But the movies do deliver adequate entertainment, but keep in mind that this is your typical Smith and Lawrence movie, for better or worse.The 2020 movie ""Bad Boys for Life"" does carry on in the spirit of the previous movies, combining elements of action and comedy in a good enough blend. So if you enjoyed the previous movies, then you will also enjoy this one, no doubt about it.And while there is an abundance of sarcastic and humorous banter between Smith and Lawrence, then it is something that sort of wears thin quite quickly, just as it has done in the previous movies.""Bad Boys for Life"" has a lot of action, which is what made the movie bearable for me, as I am not a particular fan of neither Will Smith or Martin Lawrence. They tend to be very monotonous in their performances, and if you've seen one of their movies, you've essentially seen all.Visually then ""Bad Boys for Life"" was quite good. The action sequences were very well executed and it felt like you were right there in the action alongside the actors and actresses.I am rating this movie six out of ten stars, as it was good entertainment. But this is hardly a movie that warrants a second viewing for my part, as I am not overly fan of the franchise or the two main actors.",Bad Boys for Life

9,CinemaSerf,"Quite funny, well-paced action adventure",7,20 January 2020,"Martin Lawrence steals this pretty run-of-the-mill action caper with some witty one-liners and for daring to act his age. Will Smith turns in a more standard, but still enjoyable, performance as his detective sidekick as they both investigate a hitman who seems to be randomly targeting Miami citizens for assassination. They discover that ""Isabel Aretas"" (Kate del Castillo) - an evil modern day ""witch"" who is the widow of a Mexican drug lord and who had recently managed a ""Silence of the Lambs"" style escape from prison, is bent on vengeance and behind all this chaos. Good performances from Joe Pantoliano as their captain and Jacob Scipio as the killer help this flow, and Alexander (""Vikings"") Ludwig provides the eye-candy as the beefcake with a conscience. There's nothing original here; but it is not drowned out by a soundtrack; is pacily directed and passes 2 hours without too much strain on the brain.",Bad Boys for Life
10,Calicodreamin,Bad boys for life!,10,19 January 2020,"This is one of the best third installments in a series I've ever seen. It was perfect. The right blend of nostalgia and old faces with fresh blood and modern technology. It was jam packed with action, touching moments, and laugh out loud humor. It was indescribably good. Lawrence and Smith have undeniable chemistry and make this movie flow seamlessly. This series was brought beautifully into the year 2020. I can't wait for more.",Bad Boys for Life
11,view_and_review,"Sorry Bad Boys for Life, Kobe Will Be Missed",6,26 January 2020,"BBFL certainly doesn't have the same appeal it had 25 years ago, or even 17 years ago. Martin Lawrence is so much... fleshier. Will Smith, albeit in better shape, is also thicker and both are noticeably older. With that being the case, how could it be as good?It wasn't, though it wasn't bad. The movie didn't have the Michael Bayisms from part two, which is a plus. This time it was directed by a Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah who still tried to deluge us with action whenever possible.The plot eschewed drugs this time around in lieu of a more personalized crime. Someone wants Mike Lowery (Will Smith) dead and the assailant is a super-criminal. This is not a Marvel movie, but you wouldn't be blamed if you believed it was, based upon the killer pursuing Mike
Lowery. This guy could rival Wolverine with his speed, agility, and kill strikes.The plot was a bit thick. Whether it was as a means to make it international or as a means to be clever or maybe even just to have a greater emotional impact--in any case, I would've preferred it to be simpler.
I have to admit, I was distracted part way through the film by the myriad updates and calls I got about the death of Kobe Bryant. It was hard to stay focused after that. I was never a Kobe fan because he played for the Lakers, which is a rival team, but I respected the hell out of his game. I only hate good opposing players and I certainly hated Kobe, but it was purely sports related.Sorry for that mid-review tribute. BBFL, no spring chickens, still funny, not mad I watched.",Bad Boys for Life
12,ferguson-6,philosophical bad boys,5,16 January 2020,"Greetings again from the darkness. ""Whatcha gonna do when they come for you?"" In this third entry of the franchise, those song lyrics are what we are asking cocky and aging Miami detective Mike Lowery (Will Smith). An old case comes back to haunt him and a scorned lover comes back to hunt him, and he may or may not have his old reliable partner Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) by his side.It's been 25 years since director Michael Bay introduced us to 'Bayhem' with his first feature film, BAD BOYS. It took another 8 years for the sequel BAD BOYS II, and now 17 years later, we get this long-anticipated third film. Only instead of Michael Bay (who is listed as a producer and makes a cameo), Belgian directors (and former film school buddies) Adil El Arbi and Billal Fallah are directing. Fans of the franchise need not be worried, as the two expected and necessary elements are present: partner banter and Bayhem action.
Detective Mike Lowery (Smith) is an old school bull with a badge, and Detective Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) is simply ready to ride off into the sunset of retirement as Pop-Pop with family, including his new grandbaby. Also back for his third run with the bad boys is stressed out Captain Howard played by Joe Pantoliano and the ever-present Pepto Bismol.Isabel Aretas (Kate del Castillo) is sprung from jail in Mexico by her son Armando (Jacob Scipio). Mother and son have two missions: take back their drug cartel, and take revenge on those responsible for her arrest and the death of Isabel's husband. Oh yeah, Isabel is part-witch and a former lover of rookie cop Mike Lowery. What a tangled web ... and that's without including another surprise twist. Their revenge checklist includes many Miami dignitaries ... and a vow to make Lowery the last to die.There is another surprise near the beginning of the film, and that motivates Lowery to get involved to help solve the string of murders - not yet aware that he's on the list. Of course Detective Burnett is drawn out of retirement and they are forced to work with a new Special Forces team called AMMO. Surprisingly, neither of the 'Ms"" stand for Millennial, and instead it's Advanced Miami Metro Operations. The team is led by Rita (Paolo Nunez), another former Lowery lover, and includes badass Kelly (Vanessa Hudgens), hulky computer whiz Dom (Alexander Ludwig), and wise-cracking Rafe (Charles Melton) as a verbal sparring partner for Lowery.What follows is car chases, shootouts, fancy weapons, drones, and helicopters. And lots of one-liners at stressful moments. Lawrence is especially effective with the banter, and fans will be happiest when he and Smith are jabbing back and forth. This time, much of their grief towards each other focuses on mortality and growing old. The partners are close, but their life philosophies vary greatly. Of course we do get the fiery finale, and this one involves a helicopter and a stunning hotel that's been left in ruins.Chris Bremner, Peter Craig, and Joe Carnahan (originally slated to direct) wrote the script, and for the most part stays true to what the fans want - banter and action - while making note of the 17 years that have passed for these bad boys, ""Ride together. Die together"" always seemed like an absurd phrase for two cops, but the partner dynamics are in full force here, even though this movie (as well as the other two) are closer to live action cartoons than an actual police thriller. The end credits scene sets us up for BB4, and if they wait another 17 years, I calculate Will Smith will be 68 years old. Instead of a Porsche, he'll be driving a Buick.",Bad Boys for Life
13,morrison-dylan-fan,Bad Boys 4 Life.,8,19 January 2020,"Chatting to a pal on the phone about us hanging out for the first time this year, he mentioned since we caught the second one 17 years ago, we could go and see the new Bad Boys. Having gone to see 1917 (2019-also reviewed) in Manchester on IMAX (second biggest screen in Europe) it was the perfect time to meet these bad boys again.View on the film:Reuniting for the first time in 17 years, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence prove they have not missed a beat, thanks to a infectious camaraderie of quick-fire comedic banter between the duo,with Smith bringing a new maturity to Lowrey over facing the end of his bad boy days,along with Lawrence hitting dead-pan laughs on Burnett's tiredness over being dragged back into battle.Literally being blessed by Michael Bay to continue the series, co-directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah nod towards Bay's unique style, (a plane going over a Miami billboard, the camera spinning in a slow-motion circle round the characters) but thankfully place the focus on presenting their own moves.Cracking the sun-kissed backdrops with blood shots, Fallah and Arbi fire up ultra-stylised blue and red flames keeping the cops under pressure, whilst smartly standing back for the explosive chases and hand to hand combat set-pieces, which wipes off Bay's trigger happy editing of Bad Boys 2, to instead brilliantly allow each superbly performed fighting move to breath, with the directors coiling narrow long panning up close to the twisted metal chase.Originally planning to also direct it before dropping out, the screenplay by Joe Carnahan/ Chris Bremner and Peter ""The Town"" Craig trim down the racial and homophobic gags of Bay's films, instead leaning to the tough edge of Carnahan's credits, via humor coming from the at-odds state between gung-ho Lowrey & tied Burnet, plus a joyfully odd twist being balanced between giving the baddies a motive, and riding into the past of the bad boys.",Bad Boys for Life
14,bombersflyup,"What I should of done, is turn it off.",1,29 March 2020,"Bad Boys for Life is a fake, soulless cash grab. Utterly blown away by this rating.Lawrence has a few funny moments, even though his character's completely useless. More than Smith contributes though. The trailer's better than the film, didn't care about anything that was happening, the action sequences reminded me a bit of the game Time Crisis. Too many sayings and silly speeches, if you don't have any material, why's the run-time two hours. Joe Pantoliano as the captain, woeful... and the team that works with them, lame and done to death.",Bad Boys for Life

A sinister cartel boss exacts revenge on the Miami law enforcement team.Good use of the different cast members. Will looks great still and Martin delivers his comic parts flawlessly. Liked the choice of thhe younger cast: Vanessa Hudgens (she can do action!), Riverdale's Charles Melton and Alexander Ludwig. The hisapnic cast are good too with newcomer Jacob Scipio quite effective as a ruthless killer and Kate de Castillo as a bad ass cartel queen.There are lots of laugh our loud funny moments and funny conversations between the pair.

16,trashgang,no chemistry,6,10 April 2020,"I do know the two directors due living in the same country and have seen their earlier flicks I thought, well great that they had opportunities to go to Hollywood. On part of directing no probs but this hyoed flick was for me a big failure on many parts.The action was okay in the beginning with the car chase but once that over the jokes were the thing were this flick failed. And a Bad Boys flick do needs the jokes. On the other hand it felt like they were just reading their lines, no chemistry at all.Some conversations were to long, the whole Bruja stuff didn't work for me except in jail.

Bad Boys For Life is without a doubt the worst movie of this franchise. I did enjoy the early Bad Boys so I thought this one would be in the same lineage but all I got was irritation. I don't know who wrote this script but it's cringing to watch at times. We're used to overly exaggerated action scenes in this kind of movies but here it just gets ridiculous. The chemistry between Will Smith and the normally always funny Martin Lawrence is completely lost. I could count the funny moments on one hand, and even with those I had to force a smile. I can't say I did enjoy this movie, I was glad when I saw the end credits appearing, and I sincerely hope that they will close this chapter forever.

18,thesar-2,Lethal Weapon 4b: Another Judgment Day,8,16 November 2020,"If not for Michael Bay, I'd be a fan for life.I am, for this movie anyways. Yes, it probably has a lot to do with him not directing and only cameoing in this. And I would've rated this even higher if it weren't so damn long. Seriously. This and the aforementioned & referenced Lethal Weapon 4 have that plus some more in common: WAY TOO LONG, WAY TOO MANY HOMAGES, WAY TOO MUCH BAD CGI IN CLIMAX and WAY TOO MUCH USE OF THE TITLE SONG.Okay, got that out of the way. I really liked this movie!Hilarious, great action, beautifully shot with so many wonderful color schemes, great chemistry with several tear-jerking scenes and to top it all off: two SOOO incredibly gorgeous actors, I instantly fell in love with the villain: Jacob Scipio and Will Smith's other comic relief: Charles Melton. Two names that will mean something to me in the future, I bet.Um. I digress. This is the stereotypical 90s Action Buddy Cop movie that could never happen in real life, but always enjoyable on screen. With one of my least favorite buddy cop tropes, the ""I'm getting too old for this sh#t""/5-days to retirement, Marcus almost loses his best friend/partner Mike during a drive-by shooting and the two are out to find the killer and resolve that case.I actually never really wanted to see this. I saw part one ONLY because of its popularity. In fact, I have it recorded I saw it on February 26, 2012, almost 16½ years after its release and I thought it was just okay. Nothing against Will Smith or Martin Lawrence. I like them, for sure. I just hate Michael Bay. I ONLY watched his Transformers movies (all but #5 when I seriously could NOT TAKE THEM ANY LONGER) for the fact they were SOOO BAD, they were unintentionally hilarious. Much like the Twilight movies, The Room or Birdemic: Shock and Terror.And when it comes to part II, never saw it. I had my fill with the first Bay music video/movie. So, technically, I can't say this is the best Bad Boys, but it's certainly my favorite one.Now, granted, like I said above, there was a lot of overkill in this movie - for the love of GOD, I never want to hear that theme song again. But I thoroughly enjoyed the action, sights, chemistry, humor and devotion of the two leads.Not to mention, my two future husbands: Jacob and Charles.***Final thoughts: Wow. Talk about timing.

19,FeastMode,"feels natural, captures the essence of the originals",7,7 February 2020,"On second viewing, i reinforced everything i liked and easily forgave the flaws. Was fully entertained and never felt bored. And the musical score is amazing. Bumped it from a 6 to a 7. Kept my original review below for reference (2 viewings, 2/6/2020, 7/31/2021)There's a lot of good here. The music is my favorite part of this movie. It significantly elevated many scenes. The action ranged from decent to awesome. The comedy was on par with the rest of the series. The acting by the leads was impressive. Some of the scenes were directed in a very creative manner. And the biggest surprise was the emotionally powerful moments that are littered throughout this movie. On more than one occasion i thought to myself, ""wow, this is a really good moment."" and many times it was brought out by the performancesat the same time, there were lots of dumb moments, one in particular where i was wondering if the movie was going to be a cartoon. The pacing was off; i wasn't bored, but it slowed down in weird moments, and i didn't have a full grasp on how far i was through the movie even though i knew the run time. At one point i thought the movie was over and there was about 30 minutes left. And at times i did feel like it was more of a netflix movie than a theatrical release. Not always, but at certain pointsSPOILERSthe cartoon scene i was referring to was the opening car chase. Not only did they straight up steal that from fast 6 (i think, one of the fast and furiouses). But the way they did it was so absurd. I was even thinking to myself during the chase, i really hope this doesn't end up being a joke. The i kept seeing the insanity of the chase and the extreme danger they were putting ppl in, not just with themselves but with the other cops coordinating. I thought, nah, no way it's a joke, that would be too crazy, but it was. So i prepared myself to watch a cartoon. Luckily the rest of the movie, with the exception of some moments, was a lot more grounded. Not saying realistic, but at least not a cartoon.",Bad Boys for Life
20,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"More of the same, if you can cast your mind that far back",7,20 January 2020,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningDetectives Lowrey (Will Smith) and Burnett (Martin Lawrence) have entered middle age, but are still on the force, chasing the mean streets of Miami and keeping the people safe (or as safe as you can, recklessly driving high performance sports cars at top speeds down busy roads in the opening credits!) But their relative calm is shattered when Lowrey is brutally gunned down and left for dead. Surviving the ordeal with his friend by his side, Lowrey heads out on a quest for vengeance, but the truth behind the attack may be more than he could have imagined.For such an apparently successful franchise, the Bad Boys film series has been just about the most sporadic I can ever remember. The first sequel was a massive surprise, arriving eight years after the original graced our screens, and now the third film in the series has arrived, a massive twenty five years after the first one. The phrase 'make hay while the sun shines' doesn't seem to have registered in the makers minds, seemingly confident of the apparent enduring appeal the series will have, although it's apparently had an impressive opening weekend and a fourth film is now in the works (that I'm guessing we'll see in about 2050!)It's careful to deliver all the goods the audience is expecting, and so is wisely crammed full of fast paced, explosive action, slow, moody views of the Miami sideline, cool, slo-mo shots of the stars sliding their jackets on and the wise-cracking banter between the pair. It's testament to the lead stars that they can seemingly switch their on-screen chemistry back on like a tap, last on screen together seventeen years ago but laying it on like it's just been a day. Despite a darker, grittier edge to the plot, there's still loads of effective, funny humour on screen to take the edge off, as well as an admittedly clever, unexpected plot twist at the end.It's surprisingly better than the first sequel, despite sharing it's suffocating over-indulgence and at times uncomfortable blur between the heroes and the villains. Still, one hopes this really is the end, and we don't really have 'Bad Boys for Life.' The thought of a senior citizen Marcus and Lowrey, with zimmer frames and hearing aids (but still with their foul mouths!) coming at us in quarter of a century's time is too much. ***",Bad Boys for Life
21,Pjtaylor-96-138044,The boys are back in town.,6,24 May 2021,"Surprisingly, I actually think 'Bad Boys For Life (2020)' is the best entry in the 'Bad Boys' franchise. That's primarily because the movie actually brings some emotion and character development into the fray, making for a much more personal and easy-to-engage-with experience overall. You actually care about the protagonists this time around and they both undergo their own individual arcs (though Lawrence's is frustratingly undercut in favour of Smith's). The first hour of the flick is actually rather unconventional, taking its time to set up exactly why we should care about its central 'investigation' (in stark contrast to its predecessors). The plot, in general, is less complicated this time; there's no confusion about what's going on, which makes for a much more compelling picture overall. There are also plenty of relatively subtle call-backs and cameos (including a rather bizarre appearance by former series helmsman Michael Bay) that even I - someone who thinks the first film is alright and the second film is terrible - found amusing, so fans of the franchise should be in their element. After about an hour, things slip back into slightly more generic territory as the narrative starts to hit the beats you'd expect it to. However, this segment is enjoyable despite being fairly generic. It features more than one exciting action sequence and, generally speaking, moves at a fairly fast pace. The wider experience just feels as though its heart is in the right place. There isn't really any uncomfortable sexualisation, misogyny or homophobia. Plus, the picture has a much more, shall we say, modern approach to its 'macho' undertones. It's not a fantastic film, don't get me wrong. It still falls into the trappings of its genre and it isn't the most gripping affair, either. However, it's a solid action-comedy (it's actually rather funny in places) that should keep you entertained throughout. 6/10.",Bad Boys for Life
22,ThomasDrufke,Welcomed Surprise,7,28 January 2020,"Genuinely funny, surprisingly heartfelt, and entertaining from beginning-end, Bad Boys For Life has to be one of the biggest surprises of the last few years. There's nothing quite like a throwback buddy-cop film, and Smith & Lawrence have once again proved to us that the franchise should be here to stay. Aside from a Fast & Furious style ridiculous twist and some hit or miss jokes, Bad Boys For Life is a thrilling action film that will surely lead to more sequels, for better or worse.7.7/10",Bad Boys for Life

I liked it only because of two main characters (very good actors) and also because ,at least,for me, it was movie with the most action in 2020. I would recommend to watch it because it wasn't boring just not as good as I wanted it to be.",Bad Boys for Life
24,Cineanalyst,Retire Already,3,6 August 2020,"""Bad Boys for Life""--thus far followed, mind you, by a movie based on a video-game hedgehog and another ""Dolittle"" disaster--might end up being the highest-grossing theatrically-released picture at the box office this year. Maybe it is the end of the world, after all. The timing of this release really was fortunate, too, when one also considers the national and, indeed, worldwide protests and unrest that has erupted against police violence since then. Beyond an interesting footnote, however, ""Bad Boys for Life"" is a bad addition to an already tired series. Moreover, the first two installments directed by Michael Bay bore, at least, an authorial stamp, as distasteful as I might find it; they were movies demonstrably made by someone--dare I say, an artist--with a unique vision. 17 years after ""Bad Boys II,"" this reboot follows a trend nowadays of reviving long-dormant series, including once again trotting out the aged cast to mingle with new characters, to attempt to brand them as franchises in the fashion of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. There are even mid-credits sequences here, for crying out loud--one of which is there explicitly to set up future projects. ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" (2015), Ghostbusters"" (2016), ""Halloween,"" ""Ocean's 8"" (both 2018), along with Arnold Schwarzenegger in yet another Terminator movie every few years, or Harrison Ford in another Indian Jones adventure are some other examples of this trend. Seems many don't mind that the movies tend to be rubbish.Sure, some of the jokes here are funny, but most of them aren't, and the action sequences aren't terrible, but in that respect it pales in comparison to the non-stop car chases of ""Bad Boys II."" Way too much exposition is required here for more than a couple chases and shootouts to be allowed. Inexplicably, some think it more interesting to learn an intricate and entirely new backstory for one of these cardboard-cutout characters than to see them driving cars around explosions for a couple hours. Not me. I don't like telenovelas and soap operas; I like them even less than Bay's senseless hyper machismo, although I'm glad to be rid of the homophobia, hints of racism and general misogyny of Bay's gaze from the first two movies. I'm not sure that jokes about wearing a condom when fornicating with a witch is necessarily progress, but I guess I'll take it over Bay's camera lingering on views of the posteriors of young women and girls while Will Smith and Martin Lawrence make a point of how heterosexual they are as though it were funny.Yet, in this and every other way, ""Bad Boys for Life,"" directed by others, is a derivative, watered-down imitation of Bay's style coupled with the same formulaic franchise building polluting most of cinema recently. Despite the praying of Lawrence's character, these two are still terrible detectives--assaulting witnesses, neglecting warrants and killing suspects rather than arresting them (not that they could convict them after all the laws they break to catch them anyways). They're only older and slightly gentler than before. Meanwhile, Miami remains blighted by an ugly orange-and-teal color scheme. Editing remains choppy, and the zooms, whip pans, low-angle slow motion and pauses for character posing is carried over from the Bay handbook. I had my hopes up when the duo seemed to finally being seriously discussing retirement in this one. They should already.",Bad Boys for Life
25,CuriosityKilledShawn,How to make Good Bad Boys - Subtract Michael Bay,8,19 January 2020,"I don't think that the original Bad Boys is a great movie (or a particularly good one) but it WAS lightening in a bottle and the correct mix of talents at the right time. It kickstarted the career Michael Bay and turned Will Smith from a TV star into a movie star. It took an unusual amount of time for the sequel to arrive and by the time summer 2003 came around we were treated/subjected to Michael Bay at his absolute worst with full creative autonomy. Bad Boys II is one of the most utterly repugnant films I have ever seen and I once thought that it killed the series forever. In the nearly seventeen years since its release there has been lots of talk about a Bad Boys III but with the once high-flying, then stalling career of Will Smith and the non-star power of Martin Lawrence there was never a right moment.Thankfully, the long wait meant that Michael Bay was off the project. Instead Belgian filmmakers Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah are calling the shots and new writers are involved, and it's far, far superior to either of the previous movies with some truly shocking moments that will have you holding your breath. What a happy surprise.Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowry are now in their 50s and feeling the toll that their lifestyle has taken on their bodies, though Mike is in denial about it. They know that they are nearing the end of their careers and partnership but are finding transitioning into the next phase of their lives difficult. Meanwhile, a maniacal villainess down in Mexico is planning a series of revenge executions with Mike Lowry as the final target into backstory before the events of first movie and ties them all together.The bad guys in the first two movies were just cardboard cut-outs with little-to-zero motivation while Marcus and Mike themselves had rather poor character development, relying too much on the ad-libbed chemistry between the stars and the perceived idea of childish ""cool"" that they were supposed to exhibit. Bad Boys for Life delivers so much, much more than that. Not only is the directing more mature and restrained but the writing is far superior, giving everyone depth, meaningful dialogue, and some really involving conflict and character development.This movie is ""Bad Grown-Ups"". Michael Bay makes movies for angry teenage boys, but Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah have superseded him and delivered the absolute best in the series so far. You could call it a million times better than Bad Boys II but a million times nothing is still nothing, though it's better than that. I went in with expectations lower than minus infinity and was quite surprised and taken aback. Lorne Balfe even brings back Mark Mancina's original themes, which Trevor Rabin unwisely ditched for the second movie.I'd like to see Bad Boys for Life be the success that it deserves. Will Smith's career has been a trainwreck for a long time now, and with the recent bomb of Gemini Man still haunting him it would restore his credibility if Bad Boys for Life did bigger business than Bad Boys II. The theatre I went to was packed for an afternoon showing, so it's looking promising. They've made a silk purse out of a pig's ear and in the process they have, by accident, bigged-up the first two movies. Michael Bay does make a cameo as a wedding announcer, but that's the limit of his involvement, and everyone is better off for it.",Bad Boys for Life

They were just OK in my opinion at the best - i saw them both once and never even remembered. This movie on the other hand is not a masterpiece either, but i had more fun times watching it. It had a good twist i did not see coming, some good humor and action. It all clicked pretty well, and while this movie won't be remembered for long, i had a good time watching it.Overall, ""Bad Boys for Life"" is many things packed into one package, and they all clicked more of less. Not the greatest movie around, but descent enough to recommend.",Bad Boys for Life
28,The-Sarkologist,A Pretty Wild Wide,7,18 January 2020,"Well, this is the third installment of what seems to be a rather popular series, though I do get the feeling that there are certain people out there that really don't like the films. However, in a way, this film is your typical buddy cop film, at least from back in the early days of the century. I also get the impression that this has been sitting on the back burner for quite a while, and now we have our interpid heroes being quite a lot older, with one actually becoming a grandfather (and if you are familier with the characters, you know that it isn't going to be Mike Lowry).Honestly, I really don't want to give anything away at all with this film because there are quite a few interesting twists, and the trailers do a pretty good job at not really giving anything away either (as opposed to simply showing a lot of machine gun fights, explosions, and Will Smith and Martin Lawrence doing their stuff). As such I won't say anything beyond that.Except of course that they do a good job of playing up the fact that these guys aren't that young anymore, or at least Martin Lawrence isn't, because it really seems as if Will Smith hasn't aged a day since the first movie, so I guess the 'hey, we're young guys trapped in old guys bodies' sort of doesn't seem to work out as well here. Though, they do play on the fact that they have been partners for something like twenty-five years, so there is the suspicion that they basically know everything they need to know about each other, which turns out not to be the case.Yeah, I liked the film, and while it wasn't directed by Micheal Bay (which is one of the reasons I found the first film worked so well), this film still seems to capture the essence of the first. However, where I found that the film succeeded is the way the trailers were constructed so that, well, you get a taste of what is going to happen, but you don't quite know, and there are a few nice twists here as well.However, the one thing that grabbed me was that cut scene at the end, which dropped a hint that maybe, there might be another one down the track.",Bad Boys for Life

Personally, I think it helps the movie that it was NOT directed by Michael Bay!! You can actually see what happening during the action. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are so good together, I love their chemistry. Lawrence does not kook as heavy as he does in the trailer either. Sadly the line I hated from the trailer ""We're not just black... We are cops too!!"" made it in to the movie.There Are one cool action sequences but nothing really stands out. There was some dodgy CGI at times (maybe 3 or 4) during the action scenes, but it's a minor gripe.I liked the villains, a lot more than the two drug dealers from the first two movies. Joe Pantoliano steals all his scenes as per usual. Vanessa Hudgens was fine as was Paola Nunez and Alexander Ludwig.There was something I hated and there is something at the end, that I thought was cheesy as hell and I just didn't buy this change from a certain character!!

32,cruise01,"If you love the first two, you will love the third movie that delivers on action and humor.",8,18 January 2020,"Bad Boys for Life (4 out of 5 stars).Bad Boys for Life is a long awaited sequel to the Bad Boys series bringing an action comedy film with Martin Lawrence and Will Smith back as Mike and Marcus back in action. A long time gap since Bad Boys 2 which I still say was the best in the series out of the three. Cause of Michael Bay's over the top action and explosions. For good or worse, if your into Michael Bay's movies. The third movie is done by a direction Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah which the budget is a little smaller than the second movie. The action sequences are still exciting but a little under control with its still cinematography and less fast editing like the previous movie.The plot follows Detective Mike (Will Smith) and Marcus (Martin Lawrence) are still battling it out with retiring. Since Marcus is ready to call it quits after his daughter just had a baby. While Mike still wants to be in action in chasing bad guys. Meanwhile, Isabel (Kate del Castillo) breaks out of prison and has her son Armando (Jacob Scipio) assassinate several people and one of them being Mike. Since Isabel and Mike had some kind of history. She wants to tie all the loose ends. Which puts Mike and Marcus back into action and now working with a new team in their unit called AMMO led by Rita (Paola Nunez).The film is a lot of fun and has some fun humor with Mike and Marcus arguing with each other. Mike is still stuck in his old ways of doing things. Marcus is trying to find peace within himself. Mike is dragged back into action when his past catches up to him. With the villain this time wanting to get revenge. Mike and Marcus are teamed up with a new unit called AMMO which they approach things using technology like drones, using non lethal weapons, and strategizing. It was a fun team up with old school detectives being hands on, shoot first and ask questions later. Versus a team that tries to contain the damage than cause it.The film does have some exciting action sequences. A few car chases and motorcycle chases. And a climatic shoot out in an old building. May not be as crazy and over the top with its action like the second movie. It is still entertaining and exciting. And a lot of action if that is all your expecting in a Bad Boys movie.Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are great in delivering their characters. It is fun to see them back. And I would love to see more sequels if they can keep it exciting. Joe Pantoliano returns as their overreacting Captain. The new AMMO team that works with Mike and Marcus is lead by Rita (Paola Nunez), and her people Dorn (Alexander Ludwig), Rafe (Charles Melton), Kelly (Vanessa Hudgens). The AMMO team is a fun addition to the movie. The villains Kate del Castillo and Jacob Scipio being a mother/son duo was an interesting mix to the plot.Overall, Bad Boys for Life is a good action comedy. It has a lot of fun humor and action to make this movie worth seeing on the big screen. It may not be the best in the series. It definitely is a good comeback after a long time apart from the last movie.",Bad Boys for Life
33,eddie_baggins,Our favourite Bad Boys are back in a surprisingly fun adventure,7,16 January 2020,"It's been 17 years since we last saw smart talking best buddies and Miami detectives Mike Lowery and Marcus Burnett and we now find them without their head honcho, as original director Michael Bay has departed the universe he helped create, but if anyone had doubts about both Will Smith and Martin Lawrence being too old for this caper, think again!Instilling their film with a toned down sense of Bayism's but not dialling back the craziness in any way shape or form, directing duo Adil and Bilall prove to be perfect headmasters of the Bad Boy universe as they throw detectives Lowery and Burnett into a surprisingly sentimental comedy thrill ride that never threatens to stop for any significant amount of time as it's highly over the top plot and action beats remain front and centre.From the moment the film kicks off with Lowery and Burnett racing through the streets of Miami in the latest model Porsche, you get a very strong sense of what the latest addition in the franchise is going for and not surprisingly if you're either not a fan of the series or not accustomed to previous entries, you may find yourself struggling to have a good time, but for fans, Bad Boys for Life will be giving you a dosage of action packed adrenaline that will be a sight for sore eyes.Importantly for the film and key to the reason it's such a fun, if forgettable romp, is the same chemistry and easy going charm that's found in the pairing of Will Smith and Martin Lawrence.Joined once more by the scene stealing Joe Pantoliano as police Captain Howard and solid new additions to the world such as Vanessa Hudgens, Alexander Ludwig and Charles Melton as fellow Miami law enforcement officers, Smith and Lawrence well and truely prove that their return to this franchise wasn't the wrong move as they put many other imitators to shame as they bicker, butt-kick and bromance their way through an investigation into a dangerous Mexican crime family.It's been a long time since we've seen Smith in such fun and energetic form, while after what feels like a long time on the sidelines, the return of Lawrence proves he can still cut it as a leading man.There's nothing here that messes with the rule book but there's no need for the film to do so with Lowery and Burnett already well established, while nicely for the film, there's enough surprises in the plot to keep things unpredictable, while Adil and Bilall showcase a strong sense of action craftsmanship as they stage some impressively intense set pieces across the sun drenched surrounds of the film.Without a slight doubt, Bad Boys for Life provides nothing close to high class cinema but as a refreshingly old school offering that is looking to provide thrills, laughs and eye candy without any sloppily tacked on political messages or statements, this return to the bullet strewn world of our loveable detectives is a winner.Final Say -Against the odds and despite missing Michael Bay, Bad Boys for Life is a seriously fun big screen return for Detectives Burnett and Lowery that is sure to be a big hit with long time fans.3 1/2 forehead lumps out of 5",Bad Boys for Life
34,leonblackwood,"Watchable, but not as good as the previous movies in this franchise! 6/10",6,28 August 2020,"Review:
When I heard that the dynamic duo, Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) were returning to the big screen, I did think that it was going to be two geriatric cops, shooting guns on there zimmer frames, but it was surprisingly full of intense action. Martin Lawrence did get on my nerves after a while because he couldn't keep up with Superman, Will Smith, who looked as young and fit as he did in the first movies. I also wasn't impressed with the comedy throughout the film, which didn't have the punch that the first movies did, but with that aside, it was good to see them together again. When I also heard that Michael Bay wasn't returning to direct the third instalment, I thought that there was no way that this movie would work, but I must admit, it fits in well into the franchise. Although the action was pretty far-fetched, it was put together well, and the tension, kept you glued to the screen. On the downside, it's nothing that we haven't seen before, and once the plot is revealed, it's not the type of film that you would watch time and time again, like the previous films. That's not to say that it's a bad film, it's just that it lacked that special Michael Bay, over-exaggerated but original action, and I missed the funny humour. The new AMMO team was a great addition to the cast, and it was good to see Agent Howard taking control of the misfits again, but once the situation takes a turn for the worse, the film gets serious and it turns into your regular cops and robbers type of movie. It's still worth a watch and I'm sure that audiences will enjoy it but it won't go down as the best in the franchise. Watchable!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Adil El Arbi & Bilall Fallah, who brought you Image in 2014, Black, which is highly recommended from movie-goers, and Patser in 2018. As I haven't seen any of there previous work, it's hard to compare this movie to anything that they have done, but after watching the bonus material on the Blu-ray, I can see that they took this project seriously, and they worked closely with Jerry Bruckheimer and Will Smith, who also produced this film. Personally, I thought this was going to be another one of those movies that a franchise could do without, but I was surprisingly entertained. I wouldn't be rushing to watch it again, and there weren't any moments that struck a chord, but I have seen worse.Budget: $90million

Not in a ""return to the Nineties"", high concept, action thriller type of way. It's a throwback in the sense it's what sequels used to be. A cheaper to produce, pedestrian, follow up - designed to take money from people who liked the last one. And fair play to them, it has been timed perfectly to make as much money as possible.Everything about it is run of the mill. Bit of action, but nothing you haven't seen before. Bit of comedy, but nothing that last beyond the end credits. The story does have a little twist that I didn't see coming, but it comes pretty late after a well-worn story about taking out everyone involved in this old case. It's overblown with its emotional points too, including the death of a major character, which is then hilariously glossed over once the film reaches its conclusion. There's nothing specifically bad about it, it's just lacking compared to its contemporaries.It's irrational I know, but the title bothers me too.

41,paul-allaer,Breathing new life in long dormant franchise,7,28 January 2020,"""Bad Boys For Life"" (2020 release; 124 min.) brings the ongoing adventures of Miami detectives Mike and Marcus. As the movie opens, Mike and Marcus are driving their Porsche at top speed while Miami cruisers are following. Turns out that Marcus' daughter is about to give birth to his first grandchild. We then go to ""San Maria Ixtel Prison, Mexico"". A female prisoner, with outside help, manages to escape. The woman is Isabel Aretas,
and she is keen on taking revenge against everyone, including Mike, responsible for sending her to jail and killing her husband. Isabel sends her son to Miami to handle it... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: after a 17 year hiatus, the Bad Boys return, sans director Michael Bay. Instead the helm is given to newcomers El Arbi and Fallah, two up-and-coming directors from Belgium in their early 30s and making their US directing debut. They do amazingly well in fact (and I don't say this because I hail originally from Belgium myself!). But the key to success is of course the return of Will Smith and Martín Lawrence as the buddy-cops. In particular Lawrence is effective as the retiree wanna-be. Indeed the movie features a ton of (R-rated) comedy and doesn't take itself too serious (which couldn't be possible with Michael Bay directing). Of course there is also the over the top action scenes with correlating (and R-rated) violence. ""Violence is what we do!"", reminds Mike. The photography is eye-candy from start to finish (it feels like a two hour commercial for Miami).""Bad Boys For Life"" opened wide last weekend and exceeded all expectations, both critically and commercially. (Sony has already announced that 4th Bad Boys will be coming.) I finally saw it this weekend. The Sunday matinee screening where I saw this at in a large theater was attended very well, with the audience hollering and hooting at all the right moments. As for El Arbi and Fallah, up next for them is ""Beverly Hills Cop 4"". If you like buddy cop movies or are simply a fan of Will Smith or Martin Lawrence, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Bad Boys for Life

I will admit, I'm sad that Micheal Bay did not direct this movie. I do feel like the guys they got to direct where mimicking Bay more than doing their own thing so some visual suffered.
However, I can't dwell on such a little thing when Bad Boys for life gives us everything that all the others give us. Action adventure, hilarious ness with Lawrence jut bringing that humor. Plus, nothing beats the part when they pull it all together to ride or die.

43,jtindahouse,These two prove they still have it in a very good film,8,19 January 2020,"When a sequel comes this long after the last film in the series (17 years from the first sequel and 25 years since the original) it is always a little bit of a concern as to whether or not they will be able to stick the landing. More times than not they don't. The actors have usually aged so much that they struggle to pull off the same characters and they've often lost a lot of their chemistry as they've changed as actors/people over the years. 'Bad Boys for Life' doesn't seem to have suffered from any of those problems. Being cops allows the actors to age and still be believable as their characters, and Will Smith and Martin Lawrence have such strong chemistry that even if they did lose some of it over the years there would still be more than enough left over.The thing I loved most about this movie was that the villains were genuinely menacing. There's a great prison break scene at the beginning that sets the tone perfectly, and let's the audience know that these are extremely dangerous people not to be messed with. Once you have an interesting antagonist the rest of the film just takes care of itself.The only faults I'd suggest with the film are that the amount of time Lawrence's character spends not wanting to be a part of the police side of things is too long. It drags the film down while it's happening, and while I get that that's what his character is about, I still think the film would have been stronger without it.

I liked the the other Bad Boys movies, but didn't love'em. I mean Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are fun to watch together, and have this budding chemistry that makes the films work, and action scenes are awesome, but the villains and the plot in the last two films pretty much went nowhere.But that all changes with Bad Boys for Life, here the plot is pretty well told has the two main characters realize that there age is catching, and that there not has young has they once where. And this time the villains have a bigger part, and has a somewhat connection to one of the main characters. But not just depends on Lawrence and Smith, the supporting cast also really shine.

IDK.I thought the first one was brilliant, and the second was an OK action/comedy but didn't have as many subtle spoofs, but still was a decent action movie.This one, on the other hand I'd only give one star because I do an all or nothing thing... but it was better than Lethal Weapon 4 wasn't it? It was better than Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. It was better than Coming Two America. It was better than most of the made it far too late where the original cast was far too old sequels that plague Hollywood like remakes.It lacks the action fun that II had, it lacks the layers of humor that I had, Martin looks like he couldn't be bothered to get in shape... but it was a lot better, a LOT better, than like films.So I guess I'll give it 10 stars because if Hollywood is going to make a sequel way too late for a sequel, this is sort of how you would want them to do it.There's nothing I can say I really love about it, but there is also nothing I can say I hate about it, and for a sequel that should either have never been made or should have been made a decade earlier, it's not a bad film.

46,stevendbeard,Great Action Movie,8,18 January 2020,"I saw ""Bad Boys for Life"", starring Will Smith-Gemini Man, Suicide Squad; Martin Lawrence-The Beach Bum, Wild Hogs; Joe Pantoliano-The Perfect Match, Daredevil; Vanessa Hudgens-Second Act, Machete Kills and Kate del Castillo-The 33, No Good Deed.
This is the 3rd in the Bad Boys series-with a 4th in production-that has Will & Martin returning as the Bad Boys, a couple of Miami cops that get into lots of trouble, both with the bad guys and Joe, their police Captain. The first Bad Boys movie was in 1995 & the second was in 2003, so it's been a while and I'm glad they are back. There is some new blood with a squad of police officers called AMMO, Vanessa being one of their members, that get to work with the Bad Boys. Kate plays the wife of a Mexican drug lord who breaks out of prison at the beginning of the movie. She has plans to open up a new drug cartel in Miami and she also has some personal issues to settle with one of the Bad Boys. Lots of action, gun battles, car chases....Well, you get the idea; A great action movie. One sad note: There is a death, so the next installment in the series might be a little different. Michael Bay does not direct this one-Adil El Arbi does-but there are a few cameos and Michael is one of them. Look for the wedding MC. If you liked the first two Bad Boys, then you should enjoy this one, too.

47,kevin_robbins,There's a Fast and Furious feel to it,7,5 July 2021,"Bad Boys for Life (2020) is a movie we saw in theatres during the pandemic. The storyline follows our favorite detective duo for one last case. Marcus is ready to retire and Mike think's he's crazy. As a new set of killers arrive in town, Mike and Marcus may have one last good deed left in them as a dynamic duo. This movie was codirected by Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah; who also co directed Black, and stars Will Smith (Independence Day), Martin Lawrence (Martin), Vanessa Hudgens (Spring Breakers), Alexander Ludwig (Vikings) and Charles Melton (Riverdale). The storyline in this was just okay but the action scenes do their best to make-up for it. The film relies on the witty banter and chemistry between Lawrence and Smith. That aspect of the move is very entertaining. The movie is well paced and had a fast and furious feel to it in many ways. Overall this was a fun family film that is worth your time.

50,alindsay-al,A good Fun Action Film,7,23 January 2020,"It's been 17 years since Bad Boys 2 came out and now we have the third film Bad Boys For Life and this is my opinion on the film. The premise of the film sees a hitman go after the cop duo which forces them to reunite and hit the streets again.
Main Character
Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are back together again and they haven't lost a touch, in fact this may be their best performances yet in this franchise. The film focuses more on Smith this time but it really works he is still the cocky but loveable police detective that you want to root for but in this film he really has to deal with some dramatic things and he does it really well and makes him a better all round main character. Lawrence is in a different place as a character but it also works for this film, there is a clear difference between the two characters in this film and it allows them to explore their friendship in greater detail. Also their chemistry together is once again really strong and it will keep you highly entertained throughout this exciting film.
Supporting Characters
Joe Pantoliano is back as the captain and he is actually given more screen time in this film and he is just really funny in this film, he is a great addition to this franchise and fits in excellently with the two leads of the film. But this film tries to add a group of new characters including Vanessa Hudgens and they just aren't interesting at all, they just feel like a roadblock to our main characters and it feels like they were just added to get some younger actors to be in some of the action scenes. Also, even though the motivations for the villains were fine the characters weren't particularly interesting and they weren't that compelling.
Story
In previous Bad Boys films the villains motivations have been very basic, but credit to this film that it tires to give the villains a reason for going against our main characters and I thought it was handled pretty well. Smith's journey throughout the film is also well handled and his character evolves as the film progresses which I would argue hasn't happened in the previous films. However, the last act is pretty cliche and by the numbers, it is a shame as the film tries but falls into a pretty basic conclusion that isn't that interesting.
Script
The script is actually really good in this film, the humour is there like the previous films, it had me laughing throughout. But what suprised me in particular was how well the drama was handled in this film, in previous Bad Boys reviews I always criticised the lack of drama but that is not a complaint in this film and I feel like this film has a great blend of humour and drama.
Style
This film has really exciting and hard hitting action scenes, the films hand to hand combat is the best in the franchise and Will Smith delivers even when he is around the 50 years old range. You will be entertained as things explode and go a bit crazy for our characters, but for some reason this film felt much longer then it actually is. The action scenes sometimes go on for a bit long and the film's pacing does make the film drag a bit.
Overall
Overall this is a really fun film, I would argue it is the best Bad Boys film yet but it is just a good action film and nothing special, though if you are looking for a fun action film to watch then Bad Boys For Life is a good film to watch.",Bad Boys for Life

Despite being advised against it by his captain Mike goes rogue and decides to investigate his own assassination attempt and sadly can't rely on his old partner who has decided that he is going to retire...First thing that is fairly noticeably absent here is Michael Bay's direction; this third instament is very much less wham bam thank your mam which acts as both a blessing and a curse....Bad Boys For Life takes on a much more serious tone than its predecessors (which I suppose is oddly inevitable), but sadly it simply doesn't work in its entirety...So once the story gets established and everything is in play the film becomes rather monotnous and mundane lacking in both firepower and any kind of pzazz. I like both Lawrence and Smith both individally and in their respective roles here, but they are both underwhelming acting as if they are both contractually obliged as opposed acting as though they genuinely care.The story is quite weak as are the villains and the ludicrous plot twists which all culminate in a semi-involving film, but certainly nothing more than that. I quite liked the change of pace (moreso with Lawrence's character having to accept his age and Mike Lowery still being the more child like of the two) but it sadly never amounted into being a wholely involving picture.",Bad Boys for Life

I'm a life long Will Smith fan & have been since the very early 90's & Will Smith is my all time favourite actor & i was so excited when it was announced by Smith & Lawrence that they're back for a 3rd film.This excellent movie was like an invitation to see old friends again & i loved every minute of it!!!I grew up watching Smith & Lawrence on video with the likes of Independence Day, Men in black 1&2, Bad Boys 1&2, Wild Wild West, Enemy of the State, i, Robot, Blue Streak, Big Mommas House & more so it's great to see them both older as I've grown with them & it's nice to see Martin back in movies!!!!Bad Boys for life is much more grounded in ways compared to the other two films & is more on the grittier & darker side of action but still with plenty of humorous bits & funny banter between our favourite Miami cops but there's a hell of alot more Heart & emotion throughout this action thriller.Will Smith's Mike Lowry is much more a troubled & lost guy in this film & Will shows his outstanding talent as the incredible serious actor he has become, here Smith gives one of his best performances as this older & more emotional version of Mike Lowry who is usually known as the super sexy & super cool super cop but here he's every bit the damaged cop & lost soul of an older guy without meaning or a family of his own, he just has the job. Also Martin Lawrence gives the best performance of his mostly comedic career as an older, wiser & less violent or crazy, settled down family man & granddad version of Marcus Burnett, he acts serious often as well as be funny but it's another heartfelt performance.The danger is more brutal & frantic than ever here & it's all shot beautifully by new director's so there's a real fresh & exciting approach to it all & the cinematography & look is stunning & extremely colourful & pure eye-catching visuals on screen, the best looking film in the Trilogy. We also get their excellent Captain back again played by the excellent Joe Pontaliano & a new younger high-tech team of Cops called ""Ammo"" that are there to help out our cops. The villains this time are an extremely deadly cartel from Mexico that really wants to kill Mike Lowry for reasons that uncover later, this movie is action packed, shocking at times & full of mystery & excitement all wrapped up in a fun Action packed Cop thriller, a great movie & one of the best action films of the genre in years.Nostalga & heart make this bad boys film great meaningful entertainment & one that can be watched countless times.

59,aidanratesmovies,An Unexpected Surprise,9,9 February 2020,"With some much needed change in direction, an improvement in action and humor, and as always the beloved chemistry of Lawrence and Smith, Bad Boys For Life truly harnesses the potential of the franchise by doing something different and graciously succeeding. The film is largely entertaining, with action pieces that are no longer so much in your face, but feel more personal and thrilling than before. Martin Lawrence and Will Smith truly continue to harness the films energy to a point, providing some great comedic and far more serious performances than before, making their characters not only more round, but likeable. Directors Bilall Fallah and Adil El Arbi truly take the film to the next level, with some clever set pieces, use of story, and by far some amazing visuals. The film is oddly beautiful, which is not only refreshing from the sun drenched look of Bay's style before it, but also fits well. The style does seem a bit odd, considering the previous ones are oh so different, but it works in a way that doesn't seem too forced or too out of place. The use of the new team, Ammo, in the film is a well appreciated addition, and makes for some quite humorous moments. The villain also seems far more rounded than in previous films, and provides for a quiet interesting arc. The biggest problem I had with the film, is the progression of the story, and pacing throughout. The film bounces around a lot forward with things moving rather fast over large periods of time, making it seem kinda choppy. It never felt too long, but it felt like a lot to process given the circumstances, and felt like it could have been better handled, and/or more condensed, which does dwindle from making it a bit better than it could have. In the end, however, Bad Boys For Life is a perfectly enjoyable and surprisingly refreshing sequel, that finally harnesses the talents of the stars involved and makes for a worthwhile plot that is not forced and cliche, but actually interesting.

No. This is just stupid.It's been 17 years. Seventeen. Since the last ride with the boys and time has not been kind. Martin Lawrence was funny once. He's not now and, frankly he doesn't seem physically up to the task anymore. Will Smith, he's exploded since then and now, looking at him in this role again is just wrong. He's trying to have fun with it and take it seriously at the same time and it misses entirely.As for the rest of the cast, it's filled with a lot of beautiful people, and that's all there really is to say here. They make for a great visual but it all feels forced and awkward.Fortunately, Michael Bay is the master of ridiculous action stuff. The man has been doing it for years... So why are there so many spots were the effects look worse than anything in Bad Boys 1? There were maybe 3-5 instances of just awful effects work in this, explosions and fire that look like somebody whipped it up 20 years ago. Bay! Come on! This is the one thing that you're supposed to be good at! What are you doing? That's not to mention the parts that look like old, bad 3D gimmicks, which is sad because I don't think there's a 3D version of this movie.So it looks bad. The people are pretty but not given anything to work with. The story! The story will save us. Bay is obviously known for his stor- Oh. Whoops. This is as ridiculous as you'd expect from a man that thought ball jokes on Transformers was gold. Whats really crazy is how eerily similar a part of this was to Gemini Man... but oh well.Seriously, there is nothing here.

Bad Boys For Life is a lot of fun, and full of the rush we fell in love with a long time ago. It brings the past and present together in a manner that should help rope fans in, while never losing sight of the goals and story it set forth. Good use of characters, balancing the comedy with a special effects ridden action set, and tying everything together with that champion acting leads to one of the best reboots I've seen in a while. Yes, it still has some balance issues that have not been perfected, primarily in getting the right time for some action moments, some comedy elements more fine tuning, and most importantly working out their bad guys a little more.

The humour, banter & funny scenes also added to the film.The story follows the duo who chase down a gunman who almost killed one of them in a drive by shooting. A couple more men get killed off & it's up to the duo for the 3rd & final time to stop him.This film was pretty good. Having not seen the first 2, (which I must watch) it seems like a great franchise. Wouldn't say it has the wit of Hobbs & Shaw or the crazy action seen in Lethal Weapons 1-4. But it is overall a great film. Like I said, I must see the first 2 Bad Boy films, which I'll have no doubt are as good.I also noticed that this film thankfully (through the 17 year gap) isn't PC or filled with snipping Left Wing Propaganda remarks or scenes. So that's a big plus for me when I watched as I now fear this with popular film franchise like this one.Overall, it's not amazing, but it is pretty decent. 8/10",Bad Boys for Life

67,arungeorge13,The boys are back for some middle-aged fun! [+62%],6,28 March 2020,"Smith and Lawrence return as Mike and Marcus for unquestionably the best outing for the boys thus far. Lawrence may have put on a few extra pounds, but his comedic timing is still GOLD. Smith amps up his masculine charm even in his 50s. The dudes share brilliant bromistry, and while it took 17 years for a sequel to take shape after the less-than-mediocre part two, third time's indeed the charm.Belgian directors Adil and Bilall capitalize on the duo's charismatic screen presence. Lawrence lands almost all his one-liners in the laugh-out-loud territory, while Smith certainly delivers on the action front. This time around, they're even backed by some decent writing (by Chris Bremner, Peter Craig, and Joe Carnahan). Mike's (undercover) past is back to haunt him and he desperately needs Marcus, who's considering retirement, to get back in the game with him for one last action-filled ride.Several officers (including Captain Conrad) are targeted and taken down by an unknown bike-riding, gun-wielding assailant. This forces the duo to reunite once again and hunt the guy down, with a team of tech-backed investigators - one that includes Mike's ex, Rita. There's a lot of fun and havoc created along the way, with Lawrence ensuring plenty of laughs, sometimes ripping a line even in the conventionally serious scenes (like the somewhat emotional climax, for example!). The set-pieces strike a fine balance between chaos and dazzling imagery: a feat that Michael Bay has been struggling to achieve in recent times.Major baddie Armando Aretas (Jacob Scipio) is surprisingly good. While it's an action movie all the way, the director-duo let their leads'
jocose play-offs do all the heavy lifting. And what intrigues, is the fact that the female characters come with slightly more depth than usual, for something classified as a testosterone fest. That being said, the mid-credits sequence felt unnecessary. I know their intention is to set up another sequel but it blatantly disregards the 'one last time' bro-to-bro talk between Mike and Marcus, midway through the movie.If the main objective of this movie's existence is to make us forget our uneventful lives for two hours by treating us to a proportionate dosage of action and comedy, I'd say Adil and Bilall have done a more-than-serviceable job.",Bad Boys for Life

69,rivertam26,Surprisingly good,8,17 January 2020,"After just having revisited the overly entertaining and ridiculous bad boys franchise I really had little hope for this reboot. In all honesty it began to run out if steam in the second entry. That being said I'm happy to say that this was actually quite good. It took me a little while to get into it because it's such a different film than the others. It's not as flashy and it's more story and character driven. Theres a fair amount of schmaltz as we encounter Mike and Marcus getting older and focusing on more ""life"" oriented stuff. But before you know it they find themselves the targets of an assassination revenge plot. The movie is self aware and smart and so much humor comes from that it. The action is a bit more subdued and realistic to connect with modern Audiences and it all just finds a right balance. But don't get me wrong it's still gory, edge of your seat and really, really hilarious. The movie also benefits from a strong supporting cast which includes a smoking hot villain and the handsome Alexander Ludwig, hell even Vanessa Hudgens wasn't too bad. This entry really pulls off the rare feat of taking an aged property and making it feel modern while keeping it retro enough to appreciate the nostalgia. Of course the film isn't perfect it can be a bit too hammy in spots and the direction feels a little too amateur in moments.

73,vithiet,This is how you revive a franchise!,8,23 April 2020,"A lot of people seem to hate this movie because they love the first 2 but I think it's mostly due to nostalgia. I too grew up with the old Bad Boys movies and liked them, but I just watched all 3 of them in a row and the reality is that 1 and 2 are just... not that good. For this one they took everything from the first 2 movies and made it better in my opinion: it has more heart, jokes are funnier, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence have better chemistry, and action scenes are a lot better choreographed. They even do Bayherm better than Michael Bay! It's still your basic action flick and not some award winning piece of art but it's the most entertaining of its genre I've seen in a while.",Bad Boys for Life

Then second thing after his recovery he goes to find out killer even the situation is dangerous and his seniors asking him not to risk more. Why he taking such stupid steps ? From these two points movie looses its grip from strong story content. Later when killer had to chance to shot Mike but he didn't, why? Because they are father-son ? Then come some action and chasing sequences, yes, this part is interesting to watch as same as Bad boys previous versions. Another remarkable sequence of in plane conversion of Mike and Malcom . it is hilarious scene and really enjoyed me and reminding that we are watching Bad boys. Again climax we slighthly disppointed to nothing remarkable. Only here we find son of Mike and as me it is an arrangement for next sequels.",Bad Boys for Life
76,rockman182,Bad Boys For Life (2020),7,18 January 2020,"Its been 25 years since the first Bad Boys came out. A quarter of a century. That is absolutely insane. The first film also happens to be the film that brought Michael Bay into the film making world, for better or for worse. I as excited, albeit a little cautiously optimistic about this latest installment. Its the first to not be directed by Bay but the trailer for this looked funny. Bad Boys For Life turns out to be a fun time, really strengthened by the two leads and their chemistry.
The film follows detectives Mike and Marcus. They are older now and are thinking about family and retirement. Mike does not want to admit that age and retirement is something they should consider but decisions in that matter become prevalent when a new threat emerges. Mike is attacked by a mysterious assassin who immediately becomes a threat to the pair. With the help of a younger police force team named AMMO, the Bad Boys make one last stand.
Side note, I kept thinking ""damn who is that hot chick in AMMO?"" Only after the film was over did I realize it was Vanessa Hudgens, boy she looked different here. Anyways, the film's action set pieces are set up very well. Its not as relentless or nauseating like a Bay film. The plot and writing is not all there and I feel like it could have used a stronger sense off plot third act and onwards. Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are typically great in this. The humor and chemistry between the two has not lost a bit and it brings an air of nostalgia .
The truth is, the two characters are growing up and its nice to see the two deal with these changes that comes with aging. They aren't who they used to be but boy do they come damn close with all the action involved. This is a surprisingly entertaining time at the movies, which is the best you can hope for. There's been some bad stuff out in January 2020 but finally I see something that lives it up. Bad Boys for Life.

But...as life would have it...I ended up attending this film - with a giant attitude of ""this is gonna stink"" to accompany me.And...I was wrong. I was really, really entertained by this film.BAD BOYS FOR LIFE presents Martin Lawrence's Det. Marcus Burnett and Will Smith's Det. Mike Lowry still ""in the game"". One wants to keep working and the other is looking to retire (if you take a look at the picture, you can figure out which one is which). The two battle like an old married couple while taking on some crooks in ""shoot 'em up"" action scenes.And...what's not to like about that? Smith and Lawrence still have strong chemistry on the screen and the action scenes - staged by new (to me) Directors Adil and Bilall - keep things moving at a quick enough pace, not too fast that you get a headache, but not too slow that you start punching a hole in the plot.And...as is typical of these types of films...the plot is paper thin and just is a reason to have these 2 banter and to have shoot-em-up scenes.But that doesn't matter.Ably helping the boys out is their put-upon Captain (the always watchable Joe Pantaliano reprising his role from the previous 2 films) and the members of the ""AMMO SQUAD"". These are young cops who are set up to replace our 2 heroes. Normally, this band of youngsters would be arrogant a-holes who end up being too cocky and are outwitted by our heroes, but this film puts that convention on it's ear and the ""Ammo Squad"" are actually a pretty good addition to this film series.The filmmakers left the door wide open for BAD BOYS 4 and...I can't believe I'm saying this...I'm actually looking forward to it! Certainly not an Oscar contender, but an entertaining ""blow-em-up"" with 2 charismatic leads that play off each other well. Everyone involved knew exactly what type of film they were making - so they made that movie, with no apologies.Letter Grade: a solid B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Bad Boys for Life

Mike & Marcus reunite for one last ride, to take down the bad guys.Bad Boys for Life is an awesome movie. Directors Adil & Bilall, have recaptured the magic that made Bad Boys(1995) & Bad Boys II(2003), huge box office successes. The action set pieces are the highlight of the film. Another strong point, is the effortless camaraderie & banter between Will Smith & Martin Lawrence. All the one-liners are hilarious. I just feel that there are some scenes that are unnecessarily dramatic. The original Bad Boys(1995) is my favorite movie of the franchise. Bad Boys II(2003) just gets a slight edge over this movie. Will Smith is spectacular as Mike. Martin Lawrence is outstanding as Marcus. Vanessa Hudgens is amazing as Kelly. Alexander Ludwig is great as Dorn. Charles Melton is superb as Rafe. Paola Nunez is brilliant as Rita. Kate del Castillo is perfect as Isabel Aretas. Joe Pantoliano is excellent as Captain Howard. Theresa Randle is good as Theresa.

79,fernandoschiavi,"Bad Boys Forever is a grateful attempt to update the franchise created by Bay for modern times, questioning some old traditions and respecting others",7,22 August 2020,"Almost twenty years after the release of the second part, Bad Boys presents a change in its creative team for this third part. Michael Bay leaves and Belgian directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah enter. Although the direction is not of Michael Bay, known for his exaggerations, the tone remains similar, as the production is of no less exaggerated Jerry Bruckheimer (Top Gun, Top Gun, Bad Boys), alongside Will Smith and Doug Belgrad. After a relatively successful streak in 2003, stars Will Smith and Martin Lawrence return to what would be the ""final mission"". Smith and Lawrence, who in their mid-90s were in their 30s, are now fifty in the midst of the new scenario in which we live.Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) has a grandson and is about to retire when Mike Lowrey (Smith), a bachelor and his partner for decades, suffers an attack and is on the verge of death. Upon returning, Lowrey seeks revenge and Burnett tries to leave his hectic life behind, while the police department receives a new, younger team, made up of Lieutenant Rita (Paola Núñez), invasion police officer Kelly (Vanessa Hudgens), the muscular nerd Dorn (Alexander Ludwig) and hacker / sniper Rafe (Charles Melton).The duo Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah abuse the panoramic views with paradisiacal scenery, sports cars and luxurious life. To enhance the look of our time, there are even photo filters that you can easily find on an influencer's Instagram. This, of course, serves as a reference to the first features and to connect with new viewers. The script by the trio Chris Bremner, Peter Craig and Joe Carnahan bet on the successful chemistry between Smith and Lawrence - although the moments of laughter are far less inspired and frequent than in the previous features. Furthermore, without the same physical form as before, the action sequences lack more intense pursuits or more realistic fight scenes, without so much editing, as in John Wick, for example. This third part deals with the virtue of talking about the past, guilt, redemption and legacy becomes inevitable, and these issues are not always addressed with good will. Fortunately, in the case of ""Bad Boys Para Semper"", good humor is the thread used to sew the weight of time together with the action scenes that conquered the audience 25 years ago, but without losing the charisma while showing that things have changed, and that is part of it.
The arrival of the team led by Rita brings an interesting counterpoint to the ""old guard"" police. The group has a potential friction between Lowrey and Rafe, in addition to a probable romance with Rita, while there is a clear intention of the directors to create a ""legacy"", passing the baton to the new generation. Vanessa Hudgens' lineup is not for nothing - and there is even an Easter egg with a comic strip about it - and here follows the predictable clash between veterans and newbies, while we see different approaches. For example, just like in aerial shots, where we see larger scenes clearly made by drones, we also see flying robots and cell phones themselves in action. This dynamic between the older police duo and the younger officers is one of the things with the greatest potential in the film. However, this is somewhat wasted, as there is not enough screen time for the characters. They lacked sentimental connections, which they could eventually share, to make their relationships more interesting.The directors also explore the neon ambience that has become almost mandatory in the most recent music videos (especially in reggaeton music videos) and the addition of two big names in contemporary music, like Nicky Jam in the role of one of the main cartel dealers and the producer DJ Khaled playing (albeit almost as a cameo) an butcher and illegal arms and ammunition seller, is also part of the attempt to modernize the franchise and contextualize the current image of a culturally diverse Miami. And look: already as a reflection of our modern times, there is a certain discussion about violence. We know that many of the successful films in the ""Rambo Era 2"" had a very debatable motto, with the American ""hero"" murdering 300 Vietnamese to save four Americans. In the story, Lawrence's character and the conclusion itself (and the villain) approach this theme with more consistency and verisimilitude than in other times.
At the same time, ""Bad Boys Para Semper"" still skids on already tiring stereotypes of films about cartels and Latin American culture, such as the Mexican villain who is called a witch by the American duo because she prays for Santa Muerte, a figure popularly known for Catholic culture in Mexico and strongly associated with drug dealers and cartels; female police officers who still play the role of femme fatale during the mission that requires a certain level of disguise; and even some decisions made by the protagonist duo in the course of the film. Ironically, the sequel also tries to correct other narrative vices of the genre, showing one of the young policemen as a rough man as a guy who just wants to work in the more technological part of the police and live away from the violence that marked his past; while another takes the liberty of biting Mike and Marcus with sarcasm and the certainty that he knows the things in life that only youth brings.This is also the most dramatic film of the three. Tragedy strikes at once and continues to emerge, punctuating history throughout the duration. Real losses are felt here, giving greater weight to the work. But this does not mean that humor is left out - with the very fine chemistry between the protagonists. And how great it is to see Martin Lawrence back on the big screen after a long hiatus, demonstrating that he is still a master at making artThe atmosphere of reckoning and completeness built in Bad Boys Forever almost justifies the uncompromising tone of its predecessors, which for a younger generation can be read as outdated, while for those who cling to the nostalgia of the 1995 film the conclusion can be that the first film has ""aged badly"" if they decide to revisit the plot from the beginning. However, the third part comes to show that it is never too late to recognize and settle your pending issues with the past full of mistakes and guilt to create a present without resentment and a legacy worth remembering.Bad Boys Para Semper lives up to the phrase repeated over and over in the three films in the franchise: ""we walk together, we die together"", but this time it is said in unison by more people. Since Marcus' son-in-law, that same 15-year-old boy who was bullied by the two main characters in Bad Boys II; even the captain lived by Joe Pantoliano, star of one of the most courageous decisions of the script in this feature. The atmosphere of returning to a franchise so beloved by fans and its good ambience these days are the perfect components of this meeting. Here, the villains are the best in the franchise, and are closely linked to the story of the heroes. Entertaining, genuinely funny and, to the general surprise, emotional, the film rescues old-fashioned entertainment - when Hollywood still cared about more than effects and action. Something called humanity. The film, moreover, is clearly an attempt to not only continue the story, but to start a new wave of sequels. New characters are introduced and some of them are due to return in the next feature - which has already been confirmed. The whole supporting team presents a new dynamic with the protagonists and is very fun.It is important to emphasize that to enjoy the film, it is necessary to buy the idea of the simple plot, which prioritizes action and fun without compromise over verisimilitude. Not only for action scenes that go against the laws of physics, but also for some events that are poorly explained in the plot, in addition to an unreasonable script twist. Betting on the clash of generations between the secondary cast and the main duo, it is clear that the very direction of Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah move between their own identity and several reverences to the cinema of Bay. Therefore, we have both the presence of the absurd (villains with bazookas in helicopters) as well as an action dynamic much more focused on an aesthetics of the choreography of movements and points of view that often transport us to visions of cameras embedded in vests or drones. Finally, Bad Boys Forever is a grateful attempt to update the franchise created by Bay for modern times, questioning some old traditions and respecting others, especially the companionship of Mike and Marcus.",Bad Boys for Life
80,markthomassintek,Martin Lawrence was just annoying,6,20 January 2020,"REVIEW - BAD BOYS FOR LIFEHonest review here, the 2 previous films spawned so many other buddy cop copies but the 2 previous Bad Boys had something which made them stand out from the crowd, was it the action? The story? The comedy?For me this latest installment of the franchise is weak on all of the above, so much so Martin Lawrence just became irritating and actually had no other function in the film other than retiring then coming back then retiring again.A 2 hour film which in places dragged and one of the weakest silliest plots I've ever seen in a film which disappointed me.Nowhere near as good as the 2 previous and especially bad because of Martin Lawrence so my score for this complete waste of time and money is,Rating 6 out of 10",Bad Boys for Life
81,abisio,Far better than any expectation,9,20 January 2020,"It does not look that good. Too many years since BD II and different director. I basically looked like a fast cash however to my surprise it was not.
Time has passed also for the characters. This time everything is about age. They can still kick ass but there are other things important than an adrenaline driven life.
The directors; well let me tell you the change of pace certainly benefit the movie.
This time action is secondary to comedy and even some dramatic moments never present in the previous movies.
This time Will Smith left his ego behind and allow Martin Lawrence and Joe Pantoliano to shine; this one has very emotive moment and some brilliant comedy ones.
But Lawrence is basically the movie. Without him the movie could not even exist. He is the big motor behind and you miss him when is not in the screen.
The younger police members are basically the YOUNG PEOPLE REPLACEMENTS. Are there but did not change anything or even have some character development.
The bad guys are quite OK this time. But sadly the ending was too lazy to squeeze more juice out of the characters.
In brief. Pure entertainment and laughs nothing else but sometimes more than enough",Bad Boys for Life
82,bob-the-movie-man,Welcome to Miami... again.,7,9 March 2020,"Will Smith seems to have been having a lacklustre period in his career. His genie from ""Aladdin"" got a rather lukewarm reception. And his last movie - ""Gemini Man"" - billed as a big summer blockbuster - failed to impress. True it wasn't a commercial disaster (raking in at the time of writing about 150% of budget), but it's still a film on a plane for me that, even if I'm bored, I'll say ""nah"" to.Perhaps it's for this reason that Smith reached for an old and reliable property to dust off for another outing.And, do you know, it's not half bad.I only recently saw this one, right at the end of its UK cinema run, because frankly it appealed to me like being hit round the head with a cold fish. Martin Lawrence is an actor who just grates on me enormously. I'm sure he's a lovely chap; kind to animals; donates to charity; etc - but I generally just don't find him funny. (Here though he has a killer line about condom use that made me chuckle.) It feels to me like he is on implausible ground here re-treading the role of aging detective Marcus Burnett. One look at Burnett lumbering along and you would think ""well, he'd never pass the medical"" for the on-street role he's portrayed doing. His buddy is detective Mike Lowrey (Will Smith), who has a sordid past that is set to catch up on him.Since we start the story in Colombia, where Isabel Aretas (Kate Del Castillo), the witchy wife of a notorious deceased drug baron, is sprung from prison by her son Armando (Jacob Scipio) in what I admit is a clever and novel way. The Aretas family is bent on revenge - - and a key target in their sites is Lowrey.Burnett is newly a grandparent and hell-bent on retirement. But with Lowrey and his associates with a target on their backs, will there be one last chance to ""Ride Together, Die Together""?Not seen the first two movies? Not to worry! There are movies, like LOTR, where if you've missed the first two movies in the series you will be left in serious ""WTF"" territory in trying to watch the third. This is not one of those movies. The story is entirely self-contained, and refers to events never seen prior to the first film in the series.But whether the movie is for you will depend on your tolerance for loud and brash visuals and music with the knob turned up to 12. Directors Adil and Bilall (Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah - Belgian film school buddies best known for the critically acclaimed 2015 feature ""Black"") - don't do anything by halves.There is a scene in ""Lost Series 3"" in which Sawyer, Kate, and Alex have to bust young Karl out of the mysterious room 23 where he is being tortured by having his eyes kept open while watching a collage of images continually smashed into his eyeballs. This movie feels a little like that after a while.This is not by any means a criticism that it's poorly done. There is some truly stunning cinematography of the Miami skyline by Belgian cinematographer Robrecht Heyvaert, including a 'pull-back' drone shot from a conversation on the top of a building that is quite AWESOME! And there are more than enough ""fast action - then slo-mo - then fast again"" shots to keep music-video junkies happy!The music score by Lorne Balfe is also pumping, adding a dynamism to the frantic action scenes that keeps you entertained.The screenplay by Chris Bremner, Peter Craig and Joe Carnahan is assuredly familiar: it's not going to win any prizes for originality. We've seen the cartel/revenge plotline played out in multiple movies over the years. And we've also seen the ""buddy cops with aging partner taking retirement"" angle from the ""Lethal Weapon"" series. This just sticks them together.Will Smith and Martin Lawrence wise-crack their way through the comedy well-enough, though for me it never reaches the heights of the pairing of Smith and Tommy Lee Jones from MiB (or indeed Mel Gibson and Danny Glover from Lethal Weapon). Elsewhere we have Vanessa Hudgens as a cute cop, still trying to break through from ""Disneyfication"" into mainstream flicks. For one horrible moment, when I saw her name on the cast, I thought she might be the love interest to Smith. But no. That honour goes to Mexican beauty Paola Nuñez who, with only a 10 year age gap, becomes a less gag-worthy pairing. She plays a female leadership role (every 20's film now needs one) as the head of a new crime division.Also good value is Joe Pantoliano reprising his role as Captain Howard - Lowrie's exasperated boss. Playing it by the numbers, every film like this has to have one!Where the plot does add some interest is in a surprising scene mid-film and a twist that I didn't see coming. But this twist felt - in the context of the release date or the film - like a mistake (a ""Spoiler Section"" in my review on the One Mann's Movies web site discusses this).All of this happens of course against a backdrop of a body count of bad guys being killed in ever more graphic and gory ways, while the good guys generally dodge every bullet, grenade and crashing helicopter heading their way.It's that time of year when films are released to die. Where studios drop their movies that are never going to trouble the Academy and are not deemed worthy of summer or even late spring release. But they should have had more faith in this one, for it's not half bad. True, you may need a couple of paracetamols afterwards, but if your corneas and ear-drums can stand the pace, its not short on entertainment value.",Bad Boys for Life
83,kjproulx,Easily the Best of the Three Films,8,23 January 2020,"What a strange ride the Bad Boys franchise has been. While it didn't make a huge dent in the box office back in 1995, the first Bad Boys film is now revered by some as one of director Michael Bay's better films. That's not exactly what I believe, but there are some massive fans of these movies out there. I enjoyed one and two for what they were, but I never felt the need to rewatch them over and over. Upon the initial release of Bad Boys for Life, nearly 17 years since the release of Bad Boys II, I decided to revisit the previous two films. I still find them to be very entertaining, but lacking in many other areas. Maybe that's why this review may seem almost too positive for a film like this, but it's been a long time since a franchise has turned itself around this well.Bad Boys for Life picks up in real-time, 17 years after the events of the previous film and nearly the entire cast has returned, which was nice to see. Marcus wishes to actually retire this time and the violence is what is keeping Mike going. Due to some unexpected circumstances, a vengeance plot is set in motion, which finds them on the hunt for the Aretas family. With a lot more drama than the last two to really make you care about these characters, this film, in terms of characters and story, is eons better than anything presented in the last two.In many ways, Bad Boys for Life is the Fast Five of this franchise. It took the existing characters that you know from previous films, introduced a new team, made the family and friend aspect very strong, and those aspects in turn just made for a more enjoyable experience. It's still filled with cliches and moments that make you roll your eyes, but if the rest of the movie is well done, sometimes those moments can be likeable. It sounds weird to say this about a Bad Boys film, but I found myself shocked or feeling emotional on a few occasions, due to the plot twists. I didn't expect this movie to connect with me as much as it did, but I had a blast with it.In terms of new direction, it was nice to see Michael Bay stand back and support a new vision. Directed by the duo of Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, they presented a film that was not short on action but also felt very laid back in comparison to the previous films, which also worked with the story, as Mike and Marcus are now ageing. Most of their work is on foreign projects that I have not seen, but I may actually seek some of it out. These two guys seem to be very talented behind the camera. I will gladly see another Bad Boys movie, directed by them or anyone else, as long as they stick to this new direction.I didn't bother mentioning Will Smith or Martin Lawrence off the top, because if you're a fan of either of them and like the last two films, then there's no change here. They both share the same charisma and chemistry that they did over 20 years ago and I don't see that going away any time soon. Bad Boys for Life injects drama into an overblown action franchise and grounds it in reality. I can actually see newcomers liking this one more than the previous films and due to some new backstory revealed throughout this movie, the previous two aren't exactly necessary, even though there are some great callbacks sprinkled throughout. I would definitely recommend checking this one out, especially if you liked the last two. This is a much better movie than I was expecting.",Bad Boys for Life

I went to see it when I saw the trailers as part of ""Front and Center."" But, it should come as no surprise...the trailers lied.First off, the opening scene was like a rip-off of LETHAL WEAPON 4. Only, this time, it was Martin Lawrence's character becoming a first-time grandfather instead of Danny Glover as Roger Murtaugh. Then, there's the needless death of Joe Pantoliano's character. The only difference between that and the death scene of Axel Foley's commanding officer in BEVERLY HILLS COP 3 is that the latter occurred during the first half-hour of that movie!Worst of all, however, is that the chemistry Lawrence and Smith had, in the first two flicks, is just plain gone. Oh, Will Smith was still great at being the straight man of the duo! But, with regard to Martin Lawrence as the comic relief? Quite frankly, I was relieved when he stopped _trying_ to be comedic! The man was that unfunny.In short; Columbia Pictures should have left well enough alone and kept it at just two successful blockbusters.

87,msbreviews,"If you go to the film theater with basic expectations of having fun, Bad Boys For Life gives you that, so I recommend it.",5,16 January 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I was never a big fan of the Bad Boys films. Firstly, I'm not too fond of Michael Bay as a director (as a producer, he's fine). The way he directs his action sequences is incredibly choppy, filled with questionable CGI, very hard to follow, and we all know his passion for exploding everything. Oh, and I can't forget about the constant product placement (amazing how in a brutal explosion, everything is destroyed except a gorgeous-looking Audi car that remains intact). Secondly, the storytelling always felt extremely generic and unsurprising. So, obviously, my expectations weren't very high...Maybe that's why I enjoyed Bad Boys For Life way more than I anticipated. This movie should be a lesson to the Fast and Furious franchise. To make a mindless entertaining action flick, the lighthearted tone has to be well-established from the get-go. Despite the fact that the third act deals with absurd emotional twists worthy of a Mexican soap opera, the screenwriters are able to find just the right amount of harmless fun. I didn't watch a single clip before the film, and ten minutes in, I acknowledged that its goal was to simply be entertaining without taking itself too seriously.Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah balance the more dramatic family issues with the ludicrous action very well. The latter sequences are much better than Bay's. The car chases, even when containing a few too many cuts, are relatively easy to follow, and they pack that necessary adrenaline rush. There are a few surprising shootouts that are filmed to make them look like one take, which definitely brings something pretty uncommon to this kind of formulaic action movies. Technically, I think both directors did an excellent job, especially considering that this was their debut feature film.However, the story brings everything down. I believe Mexican soap operas might have better scripts. The dialogue reaches such a cringe-worthy level. Every essential plot information is given either through lazy character interactions or by that magical computer that every generic action movie possesses with which the main characters can basically know everything about everyone at the click of a few buttons. The comedy is quite hit-and-miss to me, a lot of the jokes didn't land, but some did make me chuckle. Overall, the screenplay is as cliche as it could be, and that last shot... I hate it. In the end, it's the cast who saves the boring narrative.Will Smith and Martin Lawrence share fantastic chemistry, and their banter is always entertaining to watch, even if it isn't as hilarious as it could be. I liked Lawrence more than Smith, maybe due to the non-action, family comedy bits that worked seamlessly. Nevertheless, it's dumb fun, and it's plainly visible that the actors had a blast shooting this movie. The whole cast transfer the joy that they had on set to the screen, and it's pretty noticeable. Watching Alexander Ludwig (Dorn) outside Vikings is always a pleasure (I so wish that he gets more important roles in the future), and the whole AMMO team (Vannesa Hudgens, Charles Melton, Paola Nunez) is all compelling enough, even if the characters are two-dimensional.It's simple: whether you enjoy the Bad Boys saga or not, this is undoubtedly the best installment of the franchise. If you go to the film theater with basic expectations of having fun, Bad Boys For Life gives you that, so I recommend it. It's a pure popcorn-entertainment action flick with recognizable actors who all share great chemistry. With Michael Bay out of the director helm, Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah deliver surprisingly good action sequences, considering this is their debut feature film. The formulaic, cliche, soap opera story is straight-up ridiculous at some points, and it carries such an aura of predictability that when it tries to introduce an emotional twist, it merely becomes absurd. The last shot feels like a call to Hollywood to make more sequels, which sort of ruins the whole ""Bad Boys one last time"" tagline... I'm extremely undecided on which side this review should fall, so I'll base my decision on the answer to the following question: ""Am I going to (want to) see this movie again or another sequel?"" Honestly... no.Rating: C+",Bad Boys for Life

89,jp_91,Great film!,8,31 January 2020,"I have never watched Bad Boys 1 and 2, but this third part is amazing, now I wanna watch the previous films. Will Smith is awesome, a great funny character with a hard drama scene. Kate Del Castillo played an evil woman, she's great too. Paola Núñez is lovely and strong, the same thing with Vanessa Hudgens, two great actresses. The film is funny and full of action, I laughed and I was thrilled with the chases and action scenes. The film is about working together, two good police fellows, also a team of different races: black, white, latino, asian. There is some race stereotypes but not a big deal, Bad Boys for Life is a comedy after all with a good heart for racial inclusion. The film meaning about friendship and team working is amazing. A charming film with great characters, cool cinematography and gore!",Bad Boys for Life
90,mfellipecampos,Very good,8,5 February 2020,Last year I watched Bad Boys for the first time! In the first film I found it regular and I gave my score for the film 5 out of 10 (I wanted to give it a maximum score) and in the second film Bad Boys 2 I gave it a score of 7 out of 10. In the second script movie of the Bad Boys sequence it is more full-bodied and and so I gave this note and the film was released on January 30 in Brazil I saw in the premiere I found a script very similar to the previous one and it has more comedy and I gave a note above the second film!,Bad Boys for Life
91,cardsrock,A pleasant surprise,7,27 January 2020,"Bad Boys for Life is definitely better than you would expect. Returning to screens 17 years after Bad Boys II, Smith and Lawrence are still a terrific pairing with great comedic chemistry. However, this threequel manages to pack in more heart and maturity than its predecessors. Bad Boys for Life brings all of the explosive fun the series is known for, but takes the franchise in new and exciting directions by choosing to be more reflective in nature.",Bad Boys for Life
92,CANpatbuck3664,A Rare Long-Delayed Sequel That Knows How to Pay Homage While Still Being Entertaining,8,18 January 2020,"The previous movies were so bombastic and fantastical that someone making it more serious would have been a disservice. Bad Boys for Life plays with the action where they don't re-write the book but it has the same flavour and they were pretty inventive. Are the action scenes silly? Absolutely, during an action scene, someone bumps the separated passenger car from a motorcycle to avoid an RPG missile being fired from a helicopter while the passenger cs firing a minigun that's mounted to the car. You're either going to think that's hilarious or the dumbest thing you've ever heard. But that's one of the reasons I love Bad Boys 2 so much, you just surrender to the ridiculous nature of it and it becomes a ""how can they top that?!"" situation from scene to scene. But the action is well choreographed and decently shot in Bad Boys for Life. Its surprisingly brutal at points too, character are ended and blood sprays everywhere! I don't remember that in the previous entries so much but it was a good decision to swerve into the R rating instead of having one foot in the Pg-13 area too.When you're making a sequel, a well placed callback is an art. Make it too obvious and people roll their eyes, too subtle and they miss it (and people later complain if the team even watched the old movies... I blame the Star Wars fandom for this). Even the biggest of the big budget movies fall flat on their face trying to do this sometimes but the creative team on this movie played their cards just right. I would be about to complain about something not being carried over from the original movies, they would make note of it. Something would be too crazy or unbelievable, Martin Lawrence would crack a joke. I'd lean in to whisper a line from one of the other movies, Will Smith would reference it. Not all the jokes work but overall this is a pretty polished script for an action movie. The dialogue is funny, the story is easy to comprehend and we get some more growth for Marcus and Mike without it being groan inducing. I tip my hat to the writers and the director for making a pretty tight movie.I can't tell you how refreshing it was to see the our comic duo back to their old tricks. I was really impressed with Will Smith specifically, he slipped back into this role seamlessly. He managed to pull off Mike Lowrey but he regained his charm and his ability to be funny. I like him as a more dramatic performer but it brought a huge smile to my face to see him in this kind of movie again. Martin Lawrence has never been a thespian and while he retains his comedic chemistry with Smith, this might have been the movie where I truly noticed how uncomfortable he is as an actor. I didn't hate his performance and he was very funny but where Will can hit the more serious notes on the scale, its just not his forte. The performance that really captured my attention was Paola Nunez as Rita. She knew how to play this type of role without being corny but she still sprinkled in some humour. She had solid rapport with the rest of the cast, she performed her action beats (I can't speak to how many or what stunts she did) capably and was able to keep up the femme fatale nature of her character. I'm going to remember her going forward. Alexander Ludwig, Vanessa Hudgens and Charles Melton were all good, Ludwig has a couple of funny scenes and while Hudgens isn't give much room to stretch, she accomplishes what she needs to with the material that she was given. Joe Pantoliano is a cartoon character but he got a couple of chuckles out of me and his character has always been broad so it at least was consistent with the rest of the franchiseThe villains are still the backseat characters in this but I liked what they chose to do with them. I can't get too far into it without venturing into spoiler territory, the arc isn't new but I thought the execution elevated the material. Its actually a pretty tired trope with them being out for revenge but much like the rest of the movie, there was an inspired effort to sell it. They're easily the most well defined and human antagonists in the franchise. Their motivations are clear (even if we run into the same old crap about them having the ability to win but putting it off so the heroes must ""suffer"") and Bad Boys for Life script was smart enough to underscore the drama but to make fun of itself in small doses later. A couple of Marcus' one-liners about them really got me laughing. So in a movie that had all the warning signs about just functioning as a cash grab, this was another area where I was thankful that they didn't just phone it in.This movie could have been a true disaster. Long gestating sequels are busts 9/10 times, there were several different writers and directors cycling in and out of this project and neither Will or Martin are at the top of their games anymore. But if someone is looking for a blueprint or a reference guide on how to make a sequel years later to a popular project, this could be used. They callback to the previous movies when its appropriate and its never frustrating or lazy. On top of that, there's some exciting action, Will and Martin are right back in the swing of things and the script is pretty sharp (for the genre). It could have been even better yet but I went in with low expectations (the trailer was a mixed bag at best) and I walked out happy that I took the time to go to the theatre to see this. Bad Boys 2 is one of my favourite guilty pleasure movies so its hard to top but Bad Boys for Life is a fun trip back to that period in action movies (late 1990s- early 2000s) and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. It would actually grade out between an 8 and a 9/10 but its still not a fantastic movie so I'll round down. If you're looking for something undemanding and still fun or if you fondly remember the previous movies, this is worth checking out in the theatre.",Bad Boys for Life
93,cliftonofun,Martin Lawrence was right: retirement is a good option,4,12 July 2020,"I have a special spot in my heart for the first Bad Boys. It was *the* 90s action movie - that perfect blend of characters, comedy, and Michael Bay-ishness. I heard such good things about installment 3 that I got kinda excited...maybe this could make me forget part 2? Unfortunately, this movie felt like it was about 25 years late. The characters were just caricatures of themselves (also, Martin Lawerence is somehow a worse actor now?). The villains were as cheesy as the twists. The action was laughable. Plus, the portrayal of policing here felt comically out of step with this moment. I wanted to see the Bad Boys ride one more time, but maybe I just should have watched the first one again. There were some genuine laughs throughout, but not everything needs another sequel.",Bad Boys for Life

Bad Black magic, old vengeance are the raw materials of this film. WOW. What kinda innovative brains these guys have. My feet.
The only good thing, I could derive out of this movie were the stunt sequences which were designed to some watchable extent.",Bad Boys for Life
96,rdoubleoc,Doesn't meet the expectations of its franchise.,2,12 April 2020,"This is a Michael Bay movie? I had trouble sitting through it, but maybe that was just my mood at the time, or because I expected a lot from a Michael Bay movie in the Bad Boys franchise -- the first two (3?) were great, especially the one with Tea Leoni.The only thing I actually liked in this movie was one joke and one 3 second clip of Will Smith shooting a machine gun from the back of a bike.The first 51 minutes of it were almost unbearable.I will give it two stars since it was nicely filmed. The plot, story, and acting just weren't that great. The idea of a lost son has just been done too much, and I'm getting tired of all these ""family reveal"" plots that feel like soap operas or TV shows.",Bad Boys for Life
97,statuskuo,3rd Time Is The Charm,8,19 January 2020,"When you go into this movie, remember a few things...leave your woke card at the door and bring a friend who you can fist bump with.
The duo are back...and they're still bickering as to how hothead Mike Lowery and bro-partner Marcus Burnett can fade quietly into the night. However, Lowrey isn't done yet. But Marcus is. And that is at the core of this laugh out loud, sometimes pitch dark humor'd flick that will have you smiling ear to ear.
I dig this movie a lot. It's unapologetic to the politics of society. And made me TRULY miss the 90's. It is an exercise in wild excess with no common sense logic but fun. FUN. Remember that folks? It's what we had before we let PC culture take over. Because the directors and writers here are skating a fine line. Women are nagging harpies, whilst the boys do their thing. And I love them for it.
I actually consider this the best of the three, since it actually has a point to make. Can we age gracefully into living a mundane life after all the excitement goes away. Many who have bland lives won't understand, but in the case of Miami cops...it's that they will eventually have to. Whether it be death or otherwise AGE catches up with you.
The new kids on the block are state of the art cops who are to replace to old ways. They're cologne commercial hot. And sleek. Not anything new, but the kids know the stories of the two most reckless cops in history. Does it make any sense at all? No. The amount of mayhem their history elicits puts them DEEP into criminal behavior. Again, I left my woke card in the car. Instead, the ride is fun. So enjoy it with some good bros because women will most likely hate it. It's too...bro. And that's what makes it a nice breath of fresh air from all the oppressive Leftists that have put duct tape over our mouths.",Bad Boys for Life
98,dilipbts,Bad boys for life,8,7 June 2020,"Going back to the roots of the first film and cutting down the lengthy action scenes this film relies on probably the best story line of the franchise and as usual Martin Lawrence sterling the scenes and laughs.

The story isn't anything special and it takes a while to get going, but there's plenty of funny humour and the action scenes are exciting and well put together. The film accepts that times have changed and the leads have grown older and uses this to great effect, although Miami (and its women) are shown to be as glamorous as ever. The supporting cast are ok, although most aren't used much, and although Will Smith doesn't quite pull off the emotional gravitas the finale requires, it's a fun and enjoyable film.",Bad Boys for Life

This movie works with the fact that mike and marcus are getting old, and theres a new team called AMMO. Basically this movie starts with a porsche 911 and mike and marcus banter about the way mike drives, so you know this movie is in some ways a tribute to the first movie, and at the same time is a sequel because we finally know why mike lowrey acts and dress like we all know.Is a good action movie, with serious moments and over the top moments that never fails to deliver.Recommended for fans of the previous bad boys, and any Bruckheimer fan , because the movie have the same jokes and style of the 90s movies he produced.",Bad Boys for Life

Bay himself makes a hilarious and welcome cameo as a reminder that we're all glad he's not directing but he's sort of still involved.Martin Lawrence's Marcus who often played second fiddle to Smith and ended up just yelling incessantly has a logical conclusion his arc in this movie and Smith gets a fun arc in this movie. The extra characters looked bad in the trailer but work here tremendously. The action is satisfying and coherent and the references, callbacks and other nods were solid and exciting. And Loren Balfe's music is exhilarating.Everything is treated with sensitivity, there's real love here, modern sensibility, and empathy. I enjoyed this forward looking action movie, it's the film we need right now and more should follow its lead. It's maybe the first emotionally sensitive buddy action movie of recent times.",Bad Boys for Life

I mean, what was anyone hoping would come from that last 'meeting'? What were the goals? For either side? That was the most glaring weakness in a plot of nonsense. Really, besides lots of explosions, one or two laughs, and the advice not to have sex with a bruja, there's not much else in here.

107,nikola17,i have been waiting for this 3rd film since 2007,8,20 January 2020,"I have been waiting for this third film to be made since 2007 when i was in grade 6 i was around 12 years old that i have been a die hard fan of bad boys movies in my childhood much more then to Men In Black franchise. this film was been holding back in production since 2008 that's when i heard it Michael Bay said he would love to do a Bad Boys III then he hired writer Peter Craig. then it was production in Feb 2011 Martin Lawrence retired as actor? when hestill did last bad films like collage road trip, Death at Funeral, and most forgettable 3rd film Big Mama's House 3 that was most forgettable film of time he says yes to that movie but he doesn't say yes to Bad Boys III that time when film was in development in Sony pictures 2015, director Joe Carnahan was in early talks to write and possibly direct the film. i am oh god please don't let that prick direct or touch Bad Boys III just like with Death Wish remake with Bruce Willis, Joe Caranhan is director known for the Smokin Aces, A-TEAM, The Grey. for people who works in film industry never let Joe Carnahan direct films ever. because one time Joe Caranhan is idiot he wanted to make Mission Impossible 3 (2006) then Tom Cruise told him to Piss off and he got fired from project witch i don't blame that then in interview he is been idiot how company or Tom Cruise didn't let Joe Caranhan direct Mission Impossible 3, he said he wasn't fan of A-TEAM and he directed film that he wasn't fan of. Joe Caranhan is a Hack he doesn't give a crap about it he gives a crap about money and his career he wants to do is ruin movies and franchise that's why he is a screenplay in he doesn't give a crap about anything he just wants Money and ruin franchise, so thank god he left the movie due to scheduling conflicts thank god it makes me to like movie and so as Death Wish (2018) On March 5, 2016 film was going to be released and if it did then we would have a Bad Boys IV but in another hand the film was pushed to June 2, 2017 Producers planned to begin production in early 2017. On August 11, 2016, the film was pushed back once again to January 12, 2018, to avoid box office competition with the upcoming DC Comics film Batman VS Superman Dawn of Justice, Suicide Squad, Wonder Woman, Justice Ledge all that, that is a good way to delay film even i don't want to see this film bomb as well and lose money then no Bad Boys IV then a TV Series i don't want to see Bad Boys TV Series at all. in some interview Martin Lawrence said that Bad Boys III would not happen, but then somehow the film got made project started in 2018 November to March 2019. and Michael Bay didn't direct this movie he had 1 minute cameo but i think when this movie was production i think he was directing Netflix 6 Underground. thank goodness this film happened, i thought this film was good i would say it's better Bad Boys II i don't hate Bad Boys II but at least this felt better with action scenes, i liked direction i had one issue with this film is twist is bit silly. and plus this is my first film i seen in 2020 in theater more films to come ahead. the new cast you have pretty girl that you all know (Vanessa Hudges) Kelly, Vanessa she has done some films i liked she was in this i would say he role in film is best maybe? but i love girls who are cops as in a tough strong female role that's my taste in girls normally but hey that's just me. Dorn (Alexander Ludwig) known for Seeker, Vikings, Lone Survivor. (Charles Melton) Rafe, Rita (Paola Núñez) known for Purge TV series. i thought they worked fine in film.story follows Set 25 years after the first Bad Boys and 17 years after the second Bad Boys, it is now 2020, at women prison Miami Isabel Aretas (Kate del Castillo) who escaped from prison has son Armando Armas (Jacob Scipio) she wants revenge and she wants him to kill people that she want those people to be dead. detective Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence), who just witnessed the birth of his grandson, tells his partner Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) his intentions to retire, and Captain Conrad Howard (Joe Pantoliano) is back in 3rd film for paycheck i don't remember last time when he comeback in a bigger budgeted film after they celebrated the party Mike and Marcus and Conrad a just screwing around at street all sudden Armando shoots Marcus then Marcus ends up at Hospital and he is all okay and Marcus wants to go find this guy that is Armando who is keep on killing people that is requesting from his mother.so entire film Marcus is retiring of because of what happened to Mike, so Mike leaves him behind. then Marcus ends up with this new team (Vanessa Hudges) Kelly, Dorn (Alexander Ludwig), (Charles Melton) Rafe, Rita (Paola Núñez) who will help to catch Armando, the action scenes i enjoyed action scenes they were a lot of fun, gore, great action, cinematography is beautiful, and bigger budget film that didn't looks so cheap and drill, it had funny lines that will make you laugh so hard through out the all film to start to end. i think those 2 directors did a good job of working with this film, but the problem and issue i had is one thing is twist that's why i put the spoiler contain on it so people don't get spoiled. the twist when Mike does his investigating about Isabel and Armando this is most Shocking twist ever apparently Mike has married to Isabel 20 years ago before he partnered up with Marcus he broke up with her, and he didn't know he had a son witch is Armando i am like?? he try to kill Mike his father that he didn't know, he uploaded it online, he killed Captain Conrad so now on Mike goes to Mexico to kill his son. i thought the twist was stupid, dumb pointless writing is this now like Batman vs Superman where Batman didn'tknow Superman mother name? all sudden how in earth does Mike will forgive his son? the writing of film is issue the twist wasn't anything exciting at all the twist just didn't make sense, see sequels or reboots nowadays in this 2020 generation and before writers always can't write for crap, why can't this story would be simple just simple Mike and Marcus are looking for Armando and Isabel that's it no twist plots what so ever it's dumb, i enjoyed film i love it but i thought i had a issue with twist. but in another hand It's more action packed than the second, and it's hilariously funny. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are back together, and nailed their main characters again. Vanessa Hudgens did pretty good working with the main cast members, and she's hot i totally agree that what saved movie for me, It may not be the most realistic movie, but it's a hilarious ride. Great characters, perfect casting, and good laughs you name it and you throw it on table. Good ole' shoot em-up, car chasing i loved scenewhen Mike and Marcus are on motorbike then Mike was in passenger seat shooting a 50 cal machine that was great scene of movie. Bad boys for life 17 years and they still got it until on this 3rd film this had no sloppy jokes or dumb writing expect for twist was very silly, but didn't make me to hate movie. i really wished this title would have been called Bad Boys III then you call 4th film Bad Boys 4 Life i don't know why didn't save that title and call 4th sequel Bad Boys 4 Life would have been a better name for 4th film i still don't understand why this is not titled Bad Boys III i don't get it but if i was directing this movie i would called it BAD BOYS 4 LIFE, i rate this 8.10 hopefully we see a Bad Boys IV very soon.",Bad Boys for Life

113,Magow-Intermean,Bad Boys for Life Review,8,7 February 2020,"After 25 years of being together, 'bad boys' Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) are at the crossroads of their exciting lives. But even as one of them wants out, the dramatic turn of events lead them to more deaths, destruction and startling revelations.
It's the year 2020 and Marcus now wants to lead a peaceful family life away from all the violence. But his partner in crime Mike cannot let go so easily because this time, the horrors of his past have come to haunt him and it's destroying the world around him. He must do what it takes to protect himself and exact revenge, but first, he needs to convince Marcus to get back into the game.
It's a simple plot with many new additions in the cast. But the one who leaves a lasting impact is the film's main villain Armando Aretas (Jacob Scipio) - a strapping young leader of a Mexican drug cartel, whose lethal blows totally belie his baby-face good looks. Mexican-American actress Kate del Castillo is also impressive as the ruthless widow Isabel Aretas, who literally calls the shots in this high-octane action comedy. The new crack team called AMMO led by Kelly (Vanessa Hudgens) has more young blood (Alexander Ludwig, Charles Melton) and they inject the much needed freshness into the proceedings. However, it's the film's leading duo who take their perfect camaraderie a notch higher. They're the strongest when together. Whether it is Will Smith's towering persona and swashbuckling punches or Martin's poker-faced humour, it works.Directors Adil and Bilall pull out all stops to make it more exciting. The film's narrative and execution remains loyal to the usual trappings of a testosterone-led action entertainer with shocking developments that will often keep you on the edge. While the action and comedy elements like high-speed chases and witty one-liners work, the pace drops in parts. The film's climax, however, is packed with more startling (almost too dramatic) revelations and some finely executed action in the picturesque locations of Miami and Mexico.
In conclusion, this one carries forward the legacy of the bad boys franchise and the magic of its leading men ensure that third time's a charm.",Bad Boys for Life

In this action film, Mike and Marcus join a new elite team in order to take down a ruthless drug cartel.
.
Even though we were introduced to these characters 25 years ago (I feel very old), the same energy and electricity is there. If anything Mike and Marcus age like fine wine. The one thing that turned me off was all the CGI in the action sequences; I miss the days of stunt men/women and real explosions. Aside from that ""Bad Boys For Life"" has tons of action, laughs and huge revelations. The most important part of this film is the chemistry between Smith and Lawrence and that is definitely not lost.",Bad Boys for Life

116,backup-50362,Respectable action but laughable cliches and too much filler,1,20 January 2020,"It's 2020 yet this movie rehashes an insane number of tired old cliches, like ""comically evil female character can only be hit by another female"" and cheesy conflicts and generic ""white people, haha, right?"" banter and pointlessly glorified Mexican cartel stuff and 1990s computer hackery that happens trough way too animated operating systems that resemble nothing realistic. A large chunk of the movie was really boring filler. The action scenes however were really epic and cool. Some of the way too rare comedic moments were fun too. Since this is your strength - do just that next time. And there clearly will be a next time as they opened a new door to a new character at the end.",Bad Boys for Life
117,daisukereds,Forgettable.. like everything Smith has done recently,2,16 May 2020,"This is the sort of garbage that most people like, I'm sure.
It's a mix of a latest Fast and Furious on a budget, and an Adam Sandler comedy.
The jokes don't land and the action isn't that good. Predictable youngster team coming in (even singing ""Bad Boys"" song to be stopped by the boys). Or young people making fun of them for not being ""hip"". Big disco party scene and cute girls dancing. Old man embarrassing himself by being old.. etc etc.It's like these movie writes themselves. Even most dramatic moments are laughable.. What are a super cop and a super useless guy doing together? Why was the second useful and why should we care? He doesn't add anything.Meh.. At least the villain had a personality, was not that dumb and was the only thing driving this movie, but there's a reason for it.",Bad Boys for Life

119,fciocca,"A decent piece of entertainment. Not at the same level of the previous two movies, but still watchable",6,20 April 2020,"Bad Boys for Life is a comeback of one of the most appreciated action movie franchise. Between the end of the 90's and the beginning of the 2000's Badboys 1 and 2 made laugh a lot of people. Movies had amazing action sequences and good comedic moments. After more than 10 years since then,they released a new chapter, that was completely unexpected. Jokes are not particularly funny or original, but some of them made me laugh. Will Smith clearly dominate most of scenes. Martin Lawrence cannot reach his level, and this makes him more like a side character. In previous movies was definitely better. As for the rest of the cast, I cannot say that I am impressed, most of them are actors that I have never seen on my life, except for Vanessa Hudgens, and a few cameos such as The Weeknd and DJ Khaled.Action scenes are overall good, but I cannot say the same about the special effects. From a production of this size, I was expecting more. Especially towards the end, you can actually see how poor animations are made. I have watched indie movies, that have a smaller budget than this one; and have better visual effects. However action scenes are very well conceived and extremely dynamic. Extra points for camera shots.The story is uninspired. Writers could came up with something different, but they decided to play safe and go for an overused narrative scheme, already seen on cinema many, many times. Overall is a decent movie that manages to entertain for a couple of hours. Soundtrack is nice and it fits perfectly on every situation. For sure the worst movie of the trilogy, but not so bad as many people thinks. I personally enjoyed it a lot.",Bad Boys for Life

Bad boys for life reunites detective Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett 17 years after their last mission. This time with a mother and son looking for revenge on Mike for killing their father, but after Marcus retires, they both must work together for one last time, but the bad guys aren't who they seem. Wow what a fantastic movie. One of the best action movies I have seen and easily the strongest film in the franchise even after 17 years, this was an example of a long-awaited sequel done well let's talk about this more in detail.First of all, the films performances were fantastic, and Will Smith Martin Lawrence still had their same fantastic chemistry from the previous two movies. Wow the performances from will and martin was fantastic, proving that they are still as good as they used to be. But they also showed a surprising amount of depth to their performances which was a big surprise for me. And both Will and martin had exactly the same amount of infectious chemistry as the previous two movies. It was a worry that after 17 years the bond would be gone but it felt like it dropped us off straight after the second film which was a pleasant surprise.Next the film had excellent visuals, and it hit all the right nostalgia notes. Wow this was the first film in the franchise where they payed close attention to the cinematography. The set pieces were incredible, leading to creative and exciting action sequences and also making Florida look amazing. And the film had a perfect blend of both nostalgia from the previous two films and also feeling modern and fresh as well. Considering that it was different directors this time they managed to really capture the essence of the previous two movies. With the bad boys theme, slow motion action scenes and club scenes it really made you feel nostalgic whilst watching, But it also felt very modern with its action sequences character developments and great characters.Next the film had a surprising amount of heart and emotion to it that I wasn't expecting. The film went into detail about the impact of the lifestyle of the police force can have on people. The film also had Mike nearly die, which was emotional to see as It really made you realise how much he meant to a lot of people. And the friendship and the love between Mike and Marcus was so believable it led to many heart-warming scenes between them both.Next the films new characters were surprisingly very good and there was a very good amount of character development and arcs for most of the characters. At first when I knew about a new squad helping the main characters, I was worried they would be bland and underused but boy I was wrong. They all had their distinct personalities and humour throughout the film, whilst also holding there own with the action scenes, making you actually care about what happens to them within the film. And the film had fantastic character development both with Mike and Marcus, having Marcus retiring to be with his family was a great touch to the movie, but also his loyalty and love towards Mike when he nearly dies also showed that he was willing to help his friend out. And for Mike to be considered bulletproof only then to nearly die was a interesting concept as he realised that he wasn't indestructible but also giving him the motivation to find the villains was a great concept and theme of the film. And even the new squad had some decent character development, into the reasoning behind there actions and why they are doing what they are doing.However, my only slight negative for the film would that it just needed a bit more development and depth to the new characters played by Vanessa Hudgens and Charles Melton. Their only purpose within the film was to either be a distraction and have good action sequences or to annoy Mike and Marcus. This was fine as they did a good job with these but it just would have been nice to have a bit more depth to them so the audience can connect with them more.My next two positives would the films surprisingly strong villain and unexpected plot twists. The villains Armando Armas (Jacob Scipio) and Rita (Paolo Nunez) were the strongest villains out of the whole franchise. They had a convincing motivation to go against Mike, and their action scenes and character development was fantastic making them compelling and interesting villains to be invested in throughout. And the surprising plot twist of Rita being the only women Mike ever loved was really interesting, and for Armando to be Mike's son that he never knew about, set up an extremely compelling conflict between the bond between father and son and what's right and wrong when someone you love does something bad.My final two main positives for me was the film's fantastic action and how hilarious it was. The film's action sequences were also the strongest of the franchise, with fast paced and hard-hitting sequences that kept you on the edge of your seat for a large majority of the time. The film also had a surprising amount of graphic violence which just added to the impact of the scenes. And finally, the film was absolutely hilarious. Martin Lawrence has to be one of the funniest comedians in film. His wit, his timing, his relatable over the top style really made me belly laugh multiple times throughout and every joke landed which is extremely rare with a comedy.Overall bad boys for life is the strongest film in the franchise, with a perfect blend of action, humour and heart.",Bad Boys for Life
121,gavinp9,Decent enough cop-action film with Smith almost returning to form,6,17 January 2020,"'Bad Boys For Life' is the third film in the franchise - and while perhaps unnecessary, three films in 25 years is not really saturation, so it can get away with it. It's set up as a finale, but isn't really - Mike (Smith) and Marcus (Lawrence) are back as the smart-ass Miami detectives who drive around dangerously in their Porsche - or minivan. Some things have changed since the first two films, but not much - Howard (Pantoliano) is still the Captain, they still don't play by the rules, and they still call themselves ""bad boys"" often. This time, a Mexican gangster's wife, Isabel (del Castillo) and her son Armando (Scipio) are after revenge on Mike for killing Isabel's husband.There's a couple of 'twists' - none of which are as big or impactful as they're supposed to be. Smith and Lawrence are still good together, always wisecracking and joking with each other, but there's not really many overtly funny moments or laughs. They team up with the AMMO team, a new police squad led by Lieutenant Rita (Nunez) and her three Millennials (Hudgens, Ludwig and Melton), who are presumably there for the sequel(s), if/when Mike & Marcus retire. AMMO are OK, but don't provide too much.There's still a few car chases, lots of explosions and unlikely stunts, and plenty of gun battles. If you've seen the first two, you know what to expect. It's not a bad action/buddy-cop film, but - can't believe I'm saying this - it might actually miss Michael Bay directing. At times, it takes itself far too seriously and is more earnest than it probably should be. Could've done with a bit more humour and fun.",Bad Boys for Life
122,thebricks,"Minus two stars for AMMO and plot holes, minus five stars for the plot twist",3,19 January 2020,"Much better than Bad Boys 2, if you turn your brain off all the way, it's an enjoyable movie. If you don't, you're going to regret paying for the film. This movie definitely had some studio interference going on on the level of what happened with the new Star Wars film.My first gripe, the special investigations unit, AMMO. Please, if a sequel is made, do not bring them back. The only reason they were included was because some suit in a studio demanded young, hip, hipster types to appeal to the teen and twenty-something demographic. They were just awful. The original movie was far more grounded than this one. While they got the tone right, AMMO just stuck out like a sore thumb. It felt like something out of a dumb TV show on a network. There's a saying, ""Jack of all trades, master of none""? I know the studio feels they are clever trying to hit all the demographics, but sometimes, you just have to commit to one so you don't make a joke of your project. You can have young cops and detectives without making them utterly annoying. I won't even get into that bizarre, cringe-worthy club scene. Holy cow.My second gripe, the plot holes and inaccuracies. It's 2019, if you've seen Mythbusters, watched National Geographic shows and First 48, are familiar with Miami, a lot about this movie is going to rub you the wrong way. If you've ever seen a First 48 set in Miami, prepare to be massively disappointed. It's just about the most boring place you'll ever see. For some reason, while LAPD always gets faithfully depicted on screen for the most part, Hollywood thinks Miami PD is like some big vacation where everyone is hip and shows up to work like they're hanging out on the beach. Also, Mike does things that are all but guaranteed to get him fired and force the department to pay out millions. Especially that first car chase scene, what was up with that?Last gripe, oh man, this is a big one, that plot twist. Man, that was so bad. Whoever wrote the script and directed had no idea when the movie was made. I believe Mike Lowery was working at least a few years before the first movie, so there's no way what happened could have happened. The timelines do not match up by a country mile. He and Marcus were good friends and established, so they had to have been working for a while. Where did all this hot mess come from? After the last scene of the movie, I should have given this zero out of ten stars but I enjoyed myself, so I'm being generous.This was almost a great movie. It's a shame some suit ruined it trying to make it a franchise. Sorry guys, it's not. It's never going to be Avengers. They did this to the last Bourne too and completely sold it out. I almost hate to say it, but it's starting to seem like I'd rather stay home and stream than go to the movies anymore. The streaming sites are doing some amazing stuff for only $6-12 a month. Why go to movies anymore for this? Seriously.",Bad Boys for Life
123,flicklover,I was very pleasantly surprised!!!,8,19 January 2020,"I am a fan of the first Bad Boys. It was hilarious and the two leads had terrific chemistry. It was dIrected by pre Transformers Michael Bay. Very sleek and cool looking but not so over the top that it was tiresome. The action was cool, but the film was very funny. Then came Bad Boys. I hated it!!! It was an unrestrained Michael Bay over the top film that he just can't help himself make when he's got free rayne. It was watchable only because of Will Smith and Martin Lawrence but it wasn't nearly as funny as the first one. Then came the trailer for Bad Boys For Life and I was sceptical. 3rd parts are usually very weak messes and it had been 17 years since the second film. Also, to release it in January which is usually a sign that a studio does not have confidence in the film. I was not expecting much.Well I am glad that I was wrong. Bad Boys For Life is definitely better than the second and as good as the first one!!! It is the funniest film of it's kind I've seen in a long time. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence return as Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett and are as good as they have ever been. Their chemistry is still there after almost 20 years. Of course it is a buddy cop action film, but it us primarily a laugh out loud comedy. It is the type of film that gets so many laughs that you can't hear some of the dialogue after. It is hilarious!!! The film is directed by Bilall Fallah and Adil El Arbi. They do take a bit from the Michael Bay school of action but even though it's sleek and frenetic it isn't as over the top and exhausting as what Michael Bay does. That is a good thing. The story is standard for the franchise. Marcus and Mike team up to get a drug lord that is out for revenge. The heavy is played by Kate Del Castillo as a wife of a Mexican drug lord who wants to avenge her husband death. She is very good. She sends her son to Miami to kill those involved in his father's death. The thing that the film does best apart from the comedy is that it flashes out the characters of Mike and Marcus well. We care about these guys and you could see they care about each other. Will Smith is a much bigger star but the film's biggest laughs belong to Martin Lawrence. He is so funny as Marcus that he steals every scene. Will Smith is the straight man in this duo. Also, it was great to see Joe Pantoliano as Conrad. He also brings laughs and needed weight to the story. Is it great? No. But in a time where sequels are so common that they are instantly forgettable it is pleasantly surprising to see a sequel.that really tries to entertain. And this one does!
Grade: B",Bad Boys for Life
124,renegadeviking-271-528568,Bad Boys for Life review,7,22 February 2020,"When you look at Will Smith and Martin Lawrence's filmographies, you'll undoubtedly find far better and more memorable films than any of the Bad Boys movies. Ok, maybe not so for Lawrence. In spite of that, the first two films in the trilogy managed to carve out their own places in my memory. The first was an enjoyable but formulaic romp which saw both stars establish and cement their dynamic chemistry. The second, while an abhorrent assault of excess and grandeur, is still incredibly fun in a sleazy way that only Michael Bay could pull off (something which is amplified tenfold if you take the recommended approach and get absolutely blitzed before watching it). Plus it has one of my favorite car chases of all-time in it, so that's a plus.Then there's the curious case of the trilogy's finale, Bad Boys for Life.It's been almost 17 years since Bad Boys 2 and life has passed by our characters. Marcus (Lawrence) is ready to retire as a grandfather and Mike (Smith) still wants to kick ass and take names even though life is clearly trying to tell him otherwise. It feels like an apt comparison to the real lives faced by Smith and Lawrence. Smith, just like his character, has the love and respect of those around him and still packs power and charm, but he's not the Fresh Prince anymore. Still, he tries to take the reigns and ride as hard as he can.This was obviously never going to be the case for the film if it had been made back around 2008 like it was supposed to, but I appreciate that it's a central focus throughout a large portion of the film. Unfortunately, that thread is axed around an hour in for a different path, one that ultimately leads to an early contender for Goofiest Plot Twist/Reveal of the Year, an amazing accomplishment considering how relatively straightforward everything already was. Not that any of the films in the trilogy have had anything remotely close to Christopher Nolan levels of plot structure. I should've known what it was leading to as I kept trying to recall certain people and things that weren't being explored. We don't need backstory on par with The Silmarillion, but it'd go a good way toward making things feel a bit more complete and competent.
Via Sony Pictures ReleasingOf course, Lawrence and Smith shine once again as the dynamic duo. They continue to have bulletproof chemistry thanks to Smith's charm and Lawrence's humor which manages to land most of the time and feels less problematic and in danger of aging poorly. However, the breakout stars of Bad Boys for Life are the members of the AMMO squad, a high-tech tactical group that Smith and Lawrence must begrudgingly partner with on their latest exploit. The groups interactions bring a lot of chemistry and laughs and I found myself wanting more of them. Hell, I'd be ok with a spin-off entirely focused on AMMO if it meant seeing more of Vanessa Hudgens as a smiling badass, Charles Melton as an abrasive prick, and Alexander Ludwig as a buff tech wizard with emotional issues.Ultimately, I think that's a signal of what failed to make Bad Boys for Life really work as well as the other two. It presents several things but never takes them to the limit. You never want to run the risk of pushing something too far, but there's an equal danger in not going far enough. We start getting a deeper look into the mindest of our characters and their histories, but that only comes in snippets. We get humorous moments, but not as many as in the prior films. We get action that, while not as bombastic as what Michael Bay brought, feels a bit hollow (but more brutal).That's the problem with trying to make something like Bad Boys for Life after such a long wait. The world of our characters as well as the audience has changed drastically in that time. We're more jaded and cynical and thus expect our characters to be so as well or to be so opposite that it feels like an escape to a new world. Bad Boys for Life tries to have its cake and eat it too by giving us these mature snippets cut between comedy and a younger man's action. It's difficult to try and toe that line after so long. Go too hard and you can't buy into these guys getting into those kinds of hijinks anymore. Conversely, you can't make it as mature as it should be with its central theme because it clashes with everything else and would be tonally inconsistent.I'm making it sound like it's a bad movie. It's not. It's certainly not perfect and has flaws, but it's the best of the trilogy. The story, unnecessary reveal and all, is fine. The action is good, the cast has strong chemistry together, the humor works, and there are a couple scenes that actually manage to pack an emotional punch. However, it's not my favorite. It takes the steps necessary to be enjoyable with an edge without stepping on too many toes. Yet after two prior films that didn't shy away from pushing things to the limit and beyond, the more subdued (or subdued by Bad Boys standards) attempt just feels incomplete and a bit incompatible with what we've had.I guess the best way to describe would be to call it Fast & Furious Lite. It's smarter, funnier, and more engaging that any offering from the mammoth franchise, but there's a reason why we'll continue to remember all of the over-the-top stunts instead of anything from Bad Boys for Life.",Bad Boys for Life
125,ginocox-206-336968,Two movies for the price of one,6,1 April 2020,"Bad Boys for Life (2020) features the reunion of several pairs of former lovers, a birth, several bumbling new father scenes, a wedding, the death of a central character, a resurrection, lengthy prayers and heartfelt discussions of the importance of friendship, duty, family and marriage. The pace alternates between hyperkinetic action scenes and ponderous scenes that seem better suited to Lifetime.The action scenes are excellent, vibrant, thrilling, expertly choreographed, executed and photographed.The central plot is a simple tale of revenge with a few complications involving treachery, deceit, and betrayal. However, with considerable screen time devoted to six or eight subplots (including the B-story bromance), efforts to reboot the franchise and set up a sequel, and a few ""obligatory"" socially-conscious elements, the main plot and subplots seem underdeveloped. The plot also bears striking similarities to the plot of another recent movie with one of the main characters in a similar role confronting a similar villain, which tends to put a few cracks in the fourth wall.The film credits two directors and three writers. At times it feels as if somebody had spliced together scenes from two entirely different films.",Bad Boys for Life

However that does't mean that this is bad movie by any means.Highly enjoyed things like the action and comedy. My complaints about the film would be about pacing for starters felt couple times in it like scenes dragged bit and didn't even really need to be in there. I also felt the chemistry between the two main characters wasn't as fluent as it was in previous films.My only other complaint had to do with the excessive use of side characters. This is more suppose to be buddy cop film but it didn't feel that way because it was bogged down by them and they personally detracted from the story bit.Overall this was still very good flick and def think whether you're fan of the series or not they'll still be fun to had.,Bad Boys for Life
128,movieman6-413-929510,The new director duo portrays the film in a calmer but appropriate way.,6,24 January 2020,"Bad Boys for Life is the latest film from the Bad Boys film series. This film is directed by the duo Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, who have also directed the films Black and Patsers.In the film, the detective duo Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) are again investigating murder cases, where the victims seem to have something in common. Among the victims are also some people who knew Mike and Marcus personally. During their investigation, the two realize that they are no longer the young detective duo as they used to be. For this reason, she is advised to collaborate with the new younger ANMO elite team consisting of Miami police officers. Together with this team, the two have to unravel the connection between the murder cases and stop the perpetrator. The two must now also take into account their older age and try to keep their ego under control.The two previous Bad Boys films were directed by Michael Bay, who gave his own sometimes somewhat exaggerated action to the films. For example, he made sure that the action scenes seemed a little more energetic. Michael Bay does have a cameo in this film, but is otherwise separate from it. Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah have portrayed this film in a somewhat quieter way, but still manage to fill the film well with entertaining action scenes. The quieter way in which they present the action in the film also fits with the older characters. For example, they have made this film entertaining for fans of the film series.That this film is only their first international action film for the directing duo is unfortunately reflected in the technical field, because the transition between the actors and their stunt doubles can sometimes be seen. You can also see when a green screen was used in some explosive action scenes.The film is also supported by the returned duo of Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. The two together still have good chemistry as friendly partners who sometimes ridicule each other with their personal problems. Will Smith also comes across as he did in the older films. This was before Will Smith was a big Hollywood star and he really went to great lengths for his film roles Martin Lawrence had already retired as an actor for this film and only played small roles or acted more in TV series. It is nice to see him again in a real role. The rest of the cast also provides good and appropriate acting. The actors of the new police team put down their roles well without overshadowing the two main characters, which happened in the third Expendables film, for example.",Bad Boys for Life

Except for Will Smith and Joe Pantoliano, the movie is one big miscast with people like Vanessa Hudgens and Charles Melton who are obviously only in this movie for their looks and have nothing else to offer. The action is underwhelming and their is zero chemistry, not even between Smith and Lawrence.The final nail is not even the terrible story and conclusion which forces a lame origin story down your throat, but the whole presence of Martin Lawrence who does nothing more than scream, yell and make the unfunniest jokes you've heard in a while.

130,WalkdenEntertainment,One Last Time... Oh Hell Yeah!,7,16 January 2020,"Welcome to the third instalment of Bad Boys! Police Detectives Marcus (Martin Lawrence) and Mike (Will Smith) are two of the Baddest cops, now going through new challenges in life. Marcus has decided to finally retire and someone is out to kill Mike for personal revenge. Marcus and Mike soon join a new elite team within the Miami Police Department known as AMMO. This team, along with Marcus and Mike, are focusing on a new dangerous villain known as Armando Armes from Mexico.If you've seen the previous two Bad Boys films, you'll generally know what to expect- cheeky banter between our leading heroes with bonus action. The difference with this third instalment; however, is we now have a new pair of directors to helm this third instalment. Even with new directors I'm thankful to report that this film feels consistent with what director Michael Bay perhaps would have done with this instalment. It's also respectful to the original two films, even bringing back returning side characters.A main praise point for this film is the fact that there is a greater focus on characters and the furthering of their relationship more than ever before. This film could very easily have been a simple cash grab loaded with brainless action, but it's not just that, it's more. As plot, it's darker than the other two and even manages to surprise the audience with a few twists.Unfortunately, it does feel like there is less action here, but what does happen is mostly enjoyable with the added element that is random comedy. In regards to the action, I was slightly disappointed with a certain chase scene which seem to have been filmed in an odd frame rate, plus it's obvious that there is a higher use of CGI throughout the film.Overall, Bad Boys fans will generally find joy in seeing a further character development along with a few surprises along the way. It's a plot that is next level in their friendship as well as taking on a new threat one last time. Slightly less action than previous film but more plot development than ever before. If you need to switch off from the world for a while? Watcha gonna do? Bad Boys for Life Y'all.7.0/10

But Bad boys for life somehow didn't make the cut at all. Though Bad boys for life has all the ingredients which made the first two movies of the franchise click big time like Guns, narcotics, cars, profanity, humour, women, stuff blowing up and mean bad guys it somehow didn't gel together. Maybe both Mike & Marcus are too old, maybe it misses Micheal Bay touch, maybe bad boys for life missed a good script?. Here's what I feel, the chemistry between Mike & Marcus was missing entirely and they were like a very tired old men who looked every bit that they didn't want to be in the movie but needed money and had to do this. The rest says for itself it's a very predictable movie with no humour at all, predictable bad guys and lame new cops.

It had a lot of swearing, blood, explosions and freaking tons of humor that was all my adolescent mind needed at the time. As I grew older and (hopefully) wiser I've excluded any possibility of a triquel to ever arrive in theaters but this day has finally come and I went to see it and boy I felt like a child once again. Although the movie has changed and it doesn't have the fast pace and as many explosions as it once used to (under the careful supervision of maestro Michael Bay) it covers it all up with freaking gazillion tons of humor, drama and great action. Will Smith is back in the saddle again after the failure of Gemini Man and roars fire into Bad Boys For Life. It's also nice to see good old Martin Lawrence at his side who seems to have vanished from the big screen since late 2000s - their duo is unstoppable and I felt like no time has passed since the sequel; it tied up the stories told in the first two movies almost perfectly and had time to tell new ones, did some nice character development and played a little with nostalgia, in a word, a triquel worth waiting for.",Bad Boys for Life

We know it is Isabel (Kate Del Castillo) and her son Armando (Jacob Scipio). Isabel wants Mike dead because he arrested her back in the day when he was undercover and he sent Isabel to prison.The first half hour could have been shot within 10-minutes and still all the info could have been told. That first half hour put me to Zzzzzzzz. See? Yes, this was somewhat long too. Moving on...............Marcus retires and Mike doesn't like that; Mike gets shot; Mike finds out that Booker Grassie (Rory Markham) made the special bullet that he was shot with; Grassie dies Mike cannot find out who the buyer was. Back to square one. Bummer.Notables: Joe Pantoliano as Police Captain Conrad Howard, who is sometimes a good supervisor and sometimes a comic relief (you judge); Paola Nunez as Rita and Mike's former love interest and she heads up AMMO an elite police unit; Ivo Nandi as Carver who is Marcus' Confidential informant, and he dies and lands on Marcus' Prius and this prompts a funny scene when Mike and Marcus take the car to the police station. It was just a funny scene just seeing the car with the car dented broadly in the middle and Mike and Marcus on each side lowering their heads to see out where the windshield used to be.I suppose one could say that Martin Lawrence is also a comic relief character as the banter between Mike and Marcus is sometimes funny or astute and sometimes not. You decide.There are several attempts by Armando to shoot Mike and at one point both fight, but Armando gets away. Once when they were in close combat Armando yells a Spanish phrase that Mike and Isabel used back in the day and NOW Mike knows who has been after him.There is a lot of action in here, and that is becoming typical of a Will Smith movie. The Stunts and CGI are spectacular and, yes, some do go on for some time, but the choreography and photography are so good you really don't mind and appreciate the choreography which is stunning. Really. And the banter continues between Mike and Marcus during these chase scenes. (9/10)Oh, stay until most of the credits run to see outtakes of the movie. Some are

145,bastos,Dead Boys,3,1 May 2020,"Wow, this was bad. The first Bad Boys was born out of producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer will to create a blockbuster out of promising new talent. We had Martin Lawrence, Will Smith and Michael Bay all trying to prove themselves in what would be a career launching movie for almost all of them. It had a catchy title that made no sense, charismatic leads, a director with a great eye for action and all of them hungry for success. The second one was born out of arrogance. They all had established themselves as huge stars and just thought they could do whatever they wanted. It resulted in an insane movie with over the top action and no sense of direction, just the whim of stars who had no one to tell them no. This one is born out of desperation. Martin Lawrence's career didn't go anywhere, Will Smith has been struggling for the last few years and Michael Bay didn't even return to direct. So they took the lazy way out and made another Bad Boys movie. I never thought I would miss Michael Bay's directing, but I do, this one could've used his talent. I kinda feel bad for the duo directing this movie as they are probably talented as their Belgium work can attest, but the writing is just terrible with the new AMMO millennial team being the best example of all that is wrong with this movie. Please no more.",Bad Boys for Life
146,gareth-75442,Poor 3rd instalment of a franchise 2 movies too long,3,31 March 2020,"So the real mystery is how do these people get a $90,000,000 budget to spend on a story that's a pile of garbage.
When a movie begins at break neck speed with an OTT car chase with gravity & physics defying stunts to a hospital because someone's having a baby, you know the producers /directors aren't taking their own movie seriously & that's exactly how this movie should be viewed, as a children's cartoon, a very expensive children's cartoon.
The story / plot is something you expect a teenager to write after binge watching bad boys 1 & 2 & quite literally every scene is from ""how to direct the Michael Bay way"", the stunts are excellent but they are just ""stunts"" nothing looks real every scene looks as tho its a ""set"", every car chase, bike chase looks impossible & unrealistic.
Why oh why do writers think it's clever & imaginative to ""create"" characters that are unbelievable, if this were a fantasy set in middle earth or a sci-fi epic set in the far flung future the characters that make up A. M. M. O. would be no less laughable, the notion that a police force anywhere on this planet would create a multi-million dollar task force with access to every database in existence & then allow a bunch of screw ups with mental health, authority & gender issues to do with it as they wish is laughably childish, perhaps the writers watched far too much Power Rangers in their formative years.
The story itself which by anyone's standards is garbage is literally killed off half way through the movie with a jump then of 6 months in which nothing has happened, nothing, a whole 6 months where no investigation or incident has taken place to then only resume with the re-emergence of the main character, to say this movie is dumb is an insult to dumb, even dumb isn't this stupid.
If this were just one of the many garbage TV shows that netflix, amazon or Disney were vomiting out I would at least understand but this is a theatrical release to cinemas, movies like this are not going to attract movie goers to shell out their hard earned cash.
The list is endless when it comes to disappointing cinema releases, whether it's one off story's or part of a franchise but there are few gems out there, unfortunately you'll need to dig through the garbage to find one.
We may live in an age of PC gone insane but it seems it will always be ok to have a dig at the ""white man"".
Given how small & meaningless the story/plot of this movie is its runtime is about 40 minutes too long, alas it would seem a 4th instalment is hinted at the end of this, hopefully it's cumulative worldwide box office takings will extinguish that threat, if not then hopefully they'll hire better writer & give the audience something worth watching.
Neither a comedy or action movie, yet it is laughable how the ""evil"" villain that murders indiscrimently is lauded at the end as much as the so called ""hero"", then you realise the majority of ""murders"" are of white people, about time you came out with it Mr Smith after all it's glaringly obvious.
I've given this 3 stars for the brilliant Joe Pantoliano, had he been in the entire movie I would have given 5 stars, the movie itself gets 0 stars, everything in this movie has been done to death before, within the previous 2 Bad Boys movies & the Fast & Furious & Transformers franchises.

This might even be the best of the three instalments, and I left the movie feeling satisfied. If you want leave your brain on standby and watch some fun action look no further, this is great from that perspective.But this is not a very good movie and I cannot allow myself to give it a better score than 6/10. I would like to, but this is has too many problems and lack too much in script, directing and story telling that 6/10 is actually generous.I would put this movie in the same category as Demolition Man and Commando (continuing the 80's and 90's references) - pretty bad movies but still guilty pleasure and fun to watch.Do not expect too much, leave your brain at the door, buy some popcorn and sit down and enjoy.

The whole Ammo team seems unnecessary, Badboys is about Smith and Lawrence.. My interest in the ammo team was the same as my interest in the ""new recruits"" used in expendables.. Zero! I watched the film to see bad boys not a fictional team that takes time away from them.. Anyway other than that the only other thing that bugs me is how they've rewritten Mike and Marcus story to fit in the new plot.. Like how would Marcus not notice that Mike went undercover during their academy days.. Fall in love, bust an international drug cartel boss and never bring it up with Marcus.. Seems like the writers just lost interest with that but as its a comedy aswell I guess it can be overlooked. Action scenes are brilliant, comedy is great and the plot moves along nicely. I hear there are plans for a 4th, if that is true then I hope they make it about Mike and Marcus and drop all that new team for a new generation crap..",Bad Boys for Life
150,Avwillfan89,That's how you do it!,8,31 March 2020,"When I found out that Micheal Bay would not be returning to direct this sequel, I was totally relieved. Although the first two movies were hit success, it was only because of the chemistry between Will Smith and Martin Laurence. Bay's humour is non existent, the bad guys are one dimensional cartoon villains and and some gags, especially in the second one, were obscenely sexist and homophobic.Now directed by Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah , this one has far more going for it than any thing in the first two movies. The villains are far more nuanced with the motivation of revenge, the stakes are higher and the heroes - unlike many other older men in action sequels - deal with old age. Marcus is ready to retire while Mike still wants to chase the game. There is a hilarious montage in which Mike puts on flashy suits to go interrogate some snitches, while Marcus rests compfortably in his recliner chair in his dressing gown. In both instances, things don't exactly go down as they intended.I really enjoyed this movie.

155,kingofdanerds,The best Bad Boys movie so far,8,26 October 2021,"Fans of 90's action fondly remember the 1995 film Bad Boys and the same goes for the sequel, Bad Boys II. 17 years after Bad Boys II, we get the third installment titled Bad Boys for Life, released in 2020. While the first two films were directed by Michael Bay, this film is directed by Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah and stars Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. The film was a critical and financial hit. With critics, this is the best reviewed film in the series. The film was a surprise hit considering it was released in January. The film came out a couple months before the COVID 19 pandemic, so while it was a box office hit then, I can only imagine what more money it would have gotten without COVID.Mike Lowry and Marcus Burnett are getting older, having been together for 25 years on the force. Marcus (Martin Lawrence) plans on retiring but when a Mexican cartel tries to take out Mike (Will Smith), Mike and Marcus get together for one last time.I do like the Bad Boys movies. They aren't perfect by any means, but they do have entertainment value of which I can easily return to a lot. It is nice to see Lawrence and Smith back on screen together after so long and they do not disappoint. Lawrence's character, Marcus, is a cop that has matured and knows that it is time to retire and live life whereas Smith's character, Mike, has not grown up or matured. This is all executed fairly well and adds more to the characters of Mike and Marcus. As always, Lawrence and Smith play off of each other fairly well and gets some pretty good laughs throughout the entirety of the film. With the first two films, both Lawrence and Smith shared the screen equally, but here, it is made clear that Smith is the star. Which, doesn't sit too well with me. I would rather prefer that both Lawrence and Smith were the big stars and less focus on Smith, even though Smith is a badass as always. There are these new characters that are apart of this police program called AMMO. A few of the characters are interesting but some of them are hardly developed. The action in the first film was over the top but fun but while not as over the top this time around, we still get some pretty good action scenes here. I also find the film a bit more violent this time around with more blood being seen throughout the film. There are at least two moments where the film does surprise me and I do not want to give anything away but they really come out of nowhere and just surprise the hell out of me. The first two films never did anything like that. The villains are better this time around. The first two films had generic foreign bad guys that kidnap a girl and it is up to Mike and Marcus to save her and take out the bad guy. This time around it is different because the villain is a bit more personal to the characters, which ups the intensity and stakes for the characters.I think this film benefited from the fact that it was 17 years since the previous film. This time gap allows the writers to expand upon the characters a bit more and that is what I find to be this film's strongest part. For those that are fans of the previous two films, this film gives you what you like most out of those films.",Bad Boys for Life

161,RhapsodyReviews,So Happy!,10,3 February 2020,"Review:
'Bad Boys for Life' is an action-comedy film directed by Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah. It is the third installment in the 'Bad Boys' franchise. The film follows detectives Mike Lowrey (Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) reuniting once again when someone starts murdering people involved in an old case.
I enjoy a lot with the 'Bad Boys' movies. They're not well loved by critics, but audience viewers seem to enjoy them, and I was excited to see this one. It's not like the first two films at all and seems to settle down and take itself more seriously and I loved it even more for it.
Will Smith and Martin Lawrence don't skip a beat coming back to these characters after over 15 years on hiatus. The embodied the characters perfectly, yet still mange to show character growth from when we last seen them in 'Bad Boys II'. I was unsure going into it with the younger police officers played by Vanessa Hudgens, Alexander Ludwig and Charles Melton, but it brought something that I think was needed to the story, and all three did a great job as well.
This is my favorite film in the franchise and it's mainly because it had the most focused story. From beginning to end it knows what it wants to be, and it doesn't get jumbled in between genres as I find the other films to do. It's comedy lands when it needs to, and the action sequences are fantastic.
Overall, I know we are still in the beginning of 2020, but this film has a real chance of making my to ten favorite films of year. It's a giant adrenaline rush with lots of laughs, and some unexpected twists along the way.

Going for a full 2 hours, there needed to be more explored and have more depth. Bad Boys and Bad Boys 2 were both highly entertaining and fun, this was more of a paint-by-numbers action film with nothing new or special, sprinkled with a sort of old and tired version of Will Smith and Martin Lawerence, and a few cool elements that were never really explored.Directing - mediocre, script - mediocre, acting - decent (with the exception of DJ Khalid, he's terrible, why is he 'acting?'), action - okay, music - great. I think if I had to sit through this and it wasn't Will Smith and Martin Lawerence, I would probably like this a lot less. They do have good chemistry, I just felt like they were doing this for the paycheck and weren't that committed. I'm not saying Will needs to hang up his action booties yet, but he needs to start doing yoga and limber up and hire an Asian guy as his stunt double. He looks cool and is cool, he just moves like an old, stiff man. He's an old man in a young man's game and it shows. Basically, Keanu Reeves is the only middle-weight action guy over 40 who can still pull off action. Dwayne Johnson, John Cena and heavy weight action dudes can more easily pull off getting older 'cause they just need to punch and give guys the clothes hanger and people cheer. Smaller guys like Will, Keanu, Tom Cruise, we expect Jackie Chan and The Matrix. Basically, gymnast meets kung fu, but looks cool holding a weapon. I'm guessing with all the training Keanu had to do for The Matrix, it paid off, and he still holds up to the younger guys. Simply, Will and Martin need to step it up, or they need to sneer and use their brains more, and be the rugged detectives.The most exciting parts was AMMO, which they trimmed their role in the film so they wouldn't upstage Will and Martin, which they do. AMMO is basically the tactical sexy squad of GQ models and hot women. And the bad guy, also very GQ. So, they had some actor / actress eye candy, the film had that going for it, it just needed more. Also, they never really explain or make sense of the bad guy being a drug cartel guy who just happens to know Krav Maga, be a sniper, and a motorcycle expert? That made no sense. Like, did he serve in Afghanistan since birth? He was a little too good at too many things to seem realistic, which kills tension.And why is DJ Khalid in a movie? This is the second time I've seen him in a film and it makes zero sense. The man can not act. He's straight up terrible. All I can think when I see him is, ""Why is this guy in a movie? He can't act."" When he opened his mouth in Pitch Perfect 3, people in the audience started laughing at him. Not to mention, he's music sucks, and he's not cool. Mixing beats is easy and his mixes are generic and lame. It escapes me how he is even a thing. Like, I feel it's some kind of joke 'cause he has no talent and seems like someone's uncool dad.Wait for this as a rental. I wish I would have done that and saved myself almost $25 between the ticket and snacks. You don't really gain much from seeing this in the theater as the action was not all that great, and I would have rather had the ability to pause and take breaks. Nice to see Will and Martin back together, it's too bad it wasn't better.",Bad Boys for Life
172,royhectorkabanlit,Entertaining enough,8,23 July 2020,"Typical of Michael Bay, there are predictable, derivative and thus boring scenes in this movie, but the Cinematography is beautiful, it is Stylish, Glamorous, with some great humor especially on the side of Martin Lawrence, and some of the action scenes (not all, just some) are pretty good.

174,eelen-seth,An action comedy that delivers on every level!,8,15 January 2020,"After 17 years, Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are back for one last ride. Michael Bay is still a producer on this third instalment, that initially launched his career as a director of highly explosive action blockbusters, but it's Belgian directing duo Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah who get a shot at directing their first big budget Hollywood film.One last ride, but the stakes are higher than ever. They gained a bit of weight, their hair lost its colour and they're ready to retire. When we meet our bickering partners in crime, Miami P.D. detective duo Mike Lowrey (Smith) and Marcus Bennett (Lawrence) are on their way to the hospital to meet Marcus' first grandchild. At the same time, Isabel ""La Bruja"" Aretas (Kate del Castillo), violently escapes from prison and takes control over a Miami-based cartel, pulling the strings via her son Armando (Jacob Scipio). What happens later that night back in Miami, all links back to the Miami police force and will change our buddies' lives forever.Bad Boys For Life has been in the works for over a decade. The script was never good enough for our stars to sign up for, but in hands of Joe Carnahan (Narc), Peter Craig (The Town) and first time screenplay writer Chris Bremner, we get a fast paced, action packed and to the brim filled with jokes story that keeps your attention for the full two hours. Even when not every joke lands, the chemistry Smith and Lawrence bring back to the screen, that feels particularly nostalgic to fans of the previous two films, is endearing and smile inducing.Lawrence hasn't been in a lot of films for the big screen in the last 10 years, after his own Big Momma-franchise bit the dust in 2011. Seeing him come back to form in a graceful way that reminds us of his comedy heydays, is a warm reminder of his talent, that will make you want to rewatch his older hits. It's great to see Smith back in an action comedy, when it also looks like he's having a lot of fun on set. His Mike is the main star of this story, who also gets an eye-opening third act that hints at a possible fourth film. And if this chapter does well, why wouldn't the studio try and make this into the franchise it so desperately always could have been.A bunch of new side characters get introduced, most of them in the form of younger team members on the squad. Each one of them has a well rounded personality, yet lacks a bit of background in why they act the way they do. Besides Vikings' Alexander Ludwig as bouncer-turned-IT-pro, which comes across a bit awkward - but that's part of the gag - and team leader Rita (Paola Nuñez) who's had a romantic past with Mike. Joe Pantoliano is back as the foulmouthed loud Captain Howard, stealing every scene he's in, while the fresh new British actor Jacob Scipio, who plays bad guy Armando, knows how to command your attention with his piercing eyes and stand tall next to well known actors such as Smith.What especially stands out is how different yet classy the action sequences are compared to Bay's typical style of explosive car wrecking highway car chase kind of ""Bayhem"". Particularly the whimsical yet stylish cinematography by Robrecht Heyvaert (Adil and Bilall's 'Black') combined with Lorne Balfe's (Mission: Impossible - Fallout) rousing score in one scene that starts of in a club, to then evolve smoothly into a car chase to then turn into a gunfight and motorbike-explosive-neon-lit-extravaganza, is extremely well choreographed and reminiscent of last year's John Wick 3's horse riding motorbike chase through New York. The thrilling action pieces blend well with the enormous amount of one liners and throwbacks to earlier chapters. A few shocking unexpected moments will have you gasp for air, while surprising cameos are there to amp up laughter.Bad Boys For Life is a successful international feature debut for Adil and Bilall, who - after witnessing this - could possibly revive a franchise like Beverly Hills Cop any day now. All thrills and gags, without ever toning down the gore and profanity, this chapter is without a doubt the strongest and most engaging one out of the trilogy. An action comedy that delivers on every level.",Bad Boys for Life

(I'ma penetrate this man's soul with my heart) 😁😆😂° The Villain was Super cool, I mean he had Flavour pouring out of him. Everything he did was smooth. There is a scene with him and a group, it was Super Cool.° The Whole feel of the movie radiated Vibrancy and Colour 🌉, it was very easy on the eye🎉° Some of the Action scenes were Amazingly Impressive, a slow motion scene with Will on a bike which was astounding, a scene near the end of the movie where the camera is innovatively used with Paola Nunez and also a scene near the end where the camera is used greatly again with the Villain and his Mother° The soundtrack had a great set piece theme, specifically the bike chasing the helicopter theme° Paola Nunez is Super Hot in this movie 💖As a movie on it's own it is a 7 but I had an incredible crowd and the theatre was on fire once it got going and for that reason plus the Realization of the Good points, it's an 8 for me.",Bad Boys for Life

180,Hussain-AL-Naseer,Bad Boys (3) For Life - Review by Hussain-AL-Naseer,7,1 April 2020,"The third installment from Bad Boys franchise is surely the strongest of them all but here the Bad Boys are not Boys anymore returning almost after 16 years of gap, doing things in an old style.
The film has got everything The Humor, Action, Emotions etc. starting from Miami and ending at Mexico the plot twist landed perfectly as audience might not anticipate it. Camerawork, editing and background music everything contributes to make this film very much watchable and enjoyable just like any Masala Bollywood Movie. Martin Lawrence and Will Smith's chemistry is as usual a LIT their onscreen love and hate relationship yet brothers for life just brings old memories back.
The only thing which felt incomplete was the AMMO team lead by Rita Secada played by the gorgeous Paola Núñez as this team gave the flavor of modernize tools and techniques and provided their support to the Old Dogs of the game but really it would have been a delight to see some street fights from AMMO team especially from Venessa Hudgens & Paola Núñez herself but sadly it didn't happen but nevertheless the film is entertaining and for Bad Boys lovers it is a must watch as this might be the last installment from this franchise.",Bad Boys for Life
181,Rino_Bortone,GOOD MOVIE THAT ENTERTAINS WITHOUT TOO MANY PRETENSIONS,6,29 March 2020,"Bad Boys for Life, represents the right piece of the saga. With the right humor to which we are accustomed, the film makes space between old-fashioned and well-made scenes, thanks above all to the couple who breaks out Smith-Lawrence. Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah certainly know how to direct a film and they do it simply, honoring entertainment. Unfortunately, although well-made, the film is flawed in what can be defined as ""overabundance"" and ""concise"", a flaw that is present in one or the other way in contexts where one or the other was needed / no needed, a bit of an imbalance. At the end, Bad Boys for Life is entertaining, good and it makes time pass in a snap of fingers; a good movie that entertains without too many pretensions.",Bad Boys for Life

183,joshbarton15,Best of the Bad Boys.,8,20 January 2020,"Back in 1995, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence burst on to the scene with Bad Boys, an action film from Michael Bay with plenty of attitude and one of the most entertaining double acts in the genre. Twenty-five years later, seventeen after the second film, Smith and Lawrence are back with Bad Boys For Life, this time though with no Bayhem in tow.When Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) is targeted by a demon from his past, he and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence), who he's dragged out of retirement, must team up for one last ride together. The trouble is, are their old school ""Bad Boys"" tactics much use in today's world?Leaving it so long to do a third film is something that could have backfired however, thanks to the chemistry shared by Smith and Lawrence, Bad Boys For Life is very much worth the wait, the two of them throwing themselves into proceedings with the same passion and ferocity as before. The pair of them just bounce off each other so well, Smith's more serious approach combining to hilarious results with Lawrence's comedic performance, as it always been.What the franchise had been missing before was a sense of consequence to the pair's often reckless approach to cleaning up the streets. Thankfully this is something Bad Boys For Life brings to the franchise and it makes for much more emotional and satisfying ride, with something at stake rather than just mindless action.The notable absence of Michael Bay behind the camera is a blessing in disguise for the film as well, with Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah delivering pulsating and coherent action sequences that hark back to the 90s era of action movies, which was a prime decade for the genre. Lorne Balfe's work on the film's score accompanies the action quite brilliantly also, which goes a long way in giving the film more energy.Bad Boys For Life may be the third film in a franchise some may have forgotten about being dropped in January, which is sometimes seen as a studio dumping ground however, it turns out to be the first surprise of the year and the best of the trilogy at the same time.",Bad Boys for Life

188,DennisBergkamp10,Pathetic for life.,4,4 June 2020,I read a review on hollywoodreporter that this is the best Bad Boys movies so far. So that's another review site that I will not be accessing anymore. Bad Boys for life henceforth referred to as BBFL is without an iota of doubt the worst movie in the franchise and it's not even a contest.There are Telenovelas out there with better storyline than BBFL. It's not that the strength of the first two movies was the strong storyline but this one just takes not having a coherent plot to another level. It's without doubt one of the worst movies I have watched this year. Everything about the movie is wrong. After watching Joe Pesci in The Irishman I was convinced that actors are like fine wine. The longer they stay out the better they become. Martin Lawrence has proven me wrong. He is all out of sorts in the movie. If the name of the movie was Bad Boy they would have killed off the Marcus character in a heartbeat. They could have easily replaced Martin Lawrence with fat Ronaldo and nobody would have been able to tell the difference.What is with these series and movies nowadays being directed by two individuals. After watching BBFL I can only say that both the directors put together don't seem to have one complete brain. The movie is just so bad that there are Indian soaps out there better than this nonsense. The plot is so bad that Bollywood was making similar plots in the 80's with washed out actors.The action scenes are extremely ordinary bordering on laughable. In one scenes half a dozen gunmen are firing at Will Smith & Fat Ronaldo on a scooter with side carriage from less then 50m away and never hit them once. If you had trained a monkey on using a camera he would have made a better movie. The climax scene is almost the same level as 70's movies. One of the strength of the first two movies was the extended action climax that would have made Michael Bay proud. The climax in this one seems to have been concieved by the mind of a 7 year old. It's hard to describe how bad the movie is. If I was the financier and someone came to me with this movie I would beat them with slippers and drive them away.Such a monstrous waste of time. The only slightly redeeming factor about the movie is Will Smith's screen presence.Can someone please find the two moron directors and slap them around a bit for me.,Bad Boys for Life
189,larosaj-26666,Even worse than I feared,1,19 January 2020,"Reluctantly I went to see this movie. Didn't like the first two but this supposedly had some good reviews. Apparently from people who are doing heavy drugs. This is total unmitigated trash. I didn't crack one smile. The drama, comedy and action were on an unheralded scale of ineptitude. Anybody enjoying this simply has no taste. This should be used in film school to demonstrate how not to make a movie. An abomination. Avoid.",Bad Boys for Life
190,larosaj-26666,Terrible terrible movie,1,21 January 2020,"I can't remember the last time I saw a movie this bad in the theatre. I didn't smile once. Bad humor. Lawrence has never been funny and now he's so old and fat, he can barely move. Watch as they cut away every time he takes more than four steps; probably because he was out of breath. Smith is as usual Smith but he can't do anything with the 4th grade script. The action scenes are boring and stupid. Any rational adult claiming to line this should be ashamed and embarrassed. For the knuckle dragging Fast and Furious fans only. What an abomination.",Bad Boys for Life

Showed weaknesses in the duo's characters. Bursts bubble of young Mike & Marcus.Felt the film dragged a bit towards the end and was a bit cringe/cliche/trying too hard in moments.Great visuals and camera shots though and the new technology was impressive.Captain dying was a SHOCK!Few unanswered questions about Armando and how him living and trying to make up for his wrongs and how realistic that actually would be.Overall, A good bad boys film, which was always going to be the case.",Bad Boys for Life
193,cwade22,Read the bad reviews and just know they're all dumb!,10,3 May 2020,"Watched this. It's great! Not perfect! I'd like subtitles when they speak Spanish, but other than that, it was great. Some parts were predictable but not many. This was great. Opened for another movie, which seems to be happening.Reading some bad reviews, I see idiots typing ""ANYWAYS"" and realize they're dumb! ""Anyways"" isn't a word! I rated this film a 10 because of all the idiots rating it a 1! The things they hate about the film Weren't much of a problem. The directors weren't Michael Bay, BUT Michael Bay was ACTING IN THIS! I can't remember the last time I saw him act. Maybe bad boys 2? I can't remember. But that was his blessing. Idiots saying he should've directed. Maybe, BUT directing is a BURDEN! And He could've been directing other projects. Seriously, the bad reviews are written by idiots!Nothing is perfect! Not even the previous 2 films. They were funnier, but I don't know if this film was devoid of great comedy. They didn't show nudity in this film, sadly. I'm tired of current times where feminists are hating nudity but whatever.Another dumb point a reviewer made was how second rate this film was because of the directors? But if you compare this film to FAST AND FURIOUS FILMS, this was WAY BETTER! You can say it was rushed, but it was 18 years after the last film! How was that rushed?! Honestly, I wanted the film to be a little longer, but whatever! It seemed to work. Well, English subtitles were needed at times but whatever.And another really dumb point made by an idiot was that a lot of reviewers were rating this film their first review. That doesn't mean anything. If the review is short and saying generic praise stuff then maybe it's fake but if it's detailed and specifying what they like and dislike, then it's legit. But I'm tired of idiots rating something above average 1/10 because it wasn't perfect! NOTHING'S PERFECT! I read reviews for Penny Dreadful new series and after only 1 episode, WHICH WAS VERY GOOD, I see some idiots saying it's bad because it's unrealistic! DUDE! The first penny dreadful series had VAMPIRES! And witches and you say the new series is unrealistic?! WHATS REAL ABOUT VAMPIRES?! That's an example of why reviews should be limited or restricted until after a few months or something. Too many idiots rating low because they think something isn't perfect! If it's not perfect, it's 1/10?! If it's perfect, it's still not good enough?! Stupid!Just read all the negative reviews and you'll see why I never trust critics or other reviews before I watch or do anything. I'm not expecting everybody to agree with me, but I know what I like. It's absurd that these negative reviewers think we all should think like them. They're never satisfied and they need to work on their own lives because I doubt they're perfect. If all the bad reviewers hate this movie, they better hate the fast and furious franchise Worse! Lol! Fast and furious has like 10 movies and they're not even trying to stop! This movie had way more depth to it than fast and furious. But yeah, it was kinda similar in ways. But those movies aren't Rated R.Anyway, if you see a review that's below 5/10, they're probably on drugs and/or dumb and/or weren't paying attention during the movie! OR they didn't even watch! I don't think there were spoilers but whatever.",Bad Boys for Life

Unfortunately I couldn't go but the fascination with the movie stayed especially when Diana King's song Shy Guy was playing on television all the time and I love that song. Still one of my favorite songs of all time and it was great marketing for the movie. I eventually saw the movie and luckily it didn't disappoint. The hype around the movie remained. Bad Boys was a classic and every year Will and Martin would get asked to make a new movie together.I don't remember much about part 2. I believe I generally liked it but it wasn't as good as part 1. In part 1 the dynamics were the best. Everybody was memorable. In this part I also feel like with part 2 it's mainly Mike & Marcus stealing the show.
I thought the villains were terrible in this movie. The storyline regarding the bad guys was absurd and easily the worst aspect of the movie. It made the movie feel generic in some ways.The thing that I loved was the dynamic between Mike & Marcus. The jokes were hilarious and gives big nostalgia vibes. It was enough for me to like the movie. Not only the jokes between them but with the supporting characters worked very well.Overall I think it's worth the watch if you're a fan of the franchise and don't expect too much.",Bad Boys for Life

Not everything needs to dissolve into more noise than the human eardrum can accept. Not everything said needs to be teenage blabbage. This isn't where the trilogy will end, but it should.

205,CriticalOfEverything,A pleasant surprise,6,17 January 2020,"This movie mainly plays on the core strengths of its predecessors and as someone who really doesn't like the first two, this movie is honestly rather decent if you want to watch a fun movie to just escape from reality for a second. It's far from perfect but if you're looking for a good time then this is a hearty recommendation. There was also a pretty damn good plot twist which caught me off guard. Overall, this is probably the best film to star Will Smith in ages and definitely the best Bad Boys movie.",Bad Boys for Life

207,nafodude,Finished the trilogy off nicely,6,1 June 2020,"It's what you'd expect from these 2.Gun fights, car chases and a little bit of comedy. The comedy was very slight however, but at least they tried.
As far as the storyline, it's really weak writing, it could've been more realistic and less unlike the character we've come to know in Mike Laury, but I suppose they had to think of something to keep the whole Bad Boys franchise going, don't be surprised if there's a spin off film.

It's really hard to explain this movie, since it's a Martin Lawrence and Will Smith movie and the second sequel in the ""Bad Boys"" theme. The movie's plot is really surprising and when you find out that the enemy in this movie is not an enemy, but....HA! I never liked the second film, but the third film is actually really good!

213,GavWaskett,I'm getting too old for this .... Sorry wrong film!,8,13 September 2020,"Seventeen years after Bad Boys II, Detectives Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett are back and are being Bad Boys/Men/Grandads! And they bring with them the usual mixture of explosions, chases, one-liners/immaculately choreographed deaths and friendship issues. And though both Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are both starting to/blatantly showing their age, they don't hide it, they celebrate it!One of the earlier scenes involves a footrace between Mike and Marcus and it very much like a Parent/Teacher race on a child's sports day, with Martin Lawrence being the slightly out of shape teacher who refuses to be beaten by the parent(honestly cannot think who that would be!) and Will Smith, the still physically active parent who is starting to loss their natural fitness but could still have a good run around on a Sunday League Football Game but is not willing to admit they can't beat a twenty -something to the ball, so is breathing out of their butt!Anyway, I digress(as usual), I'm not going to go into the whys and wherefores of the story, suffice to say just as with Bad Boys(Mike's Friend) and Bad Boys II(Marcus' sister), the problem revolves around the boys/men/near retirees personal life and involves people being out to get them.Will Smith is definitely back to best playing these action roles and this is one of his most beloved characters, he still has the swagger and the fun and adds his trademark emotional connection to the role. Martin Lawrence, though slightly looking like the eyeball guy from Britain's Got Talent and a bit like a chipmunk, retains some of the best lines and adds the anchor to Mike's exuberance.He also has one of the best comedy moments I've seen in a long long time, involving the aftermath of a rubber bullet. I was crying in the cinema with laughter. Joe Pantoliano is back as Captain Howard and has a lot more to do in this film than previously and provides some of the most funnily exasperated lines as well as one the films stand out emotional moments.They are joined by a new team, Paolo Nunez as Mike's ex-love interest/Police Lieutenant/ boss Rita, Vanessa Hudgens as girl with a gun Kelly(starting to develop her action skills and branch out from her usual roles), Alexander Ludwig as Dorn, the hard as nails, soft at heart tech guy and Charles Melton, with muscles and an ego to give Mike a run for his money. These four works very well together as a team and are a great addition to the Bad Boys.The Bad Boys song makes several appearances and each one is its own moment of little Gold, including Good Men (definitely catchy!).Bad Boys for Life is as good the first two films and does exactly what you want from a Will Smith action movie. It is a perfect Saturday night watch. And both me and Shell agree that is was the best film we've seen at the cinema for a long while and are happy that it has done well enough for Bad Boys 4 to be in the works already.Bad boys bad boys

214,lenusme,For the memories,7,9 August 2020,I like Mike (Will Smith) and Marcus (Martin Lawrence) as a cop couple but mainly Marcus who brings the fun. I was expecting something worst which is why it wasn't that bad for me but there were a lot of bad things with this movie starting with such a trash plot. I guess it's only worth it for nostalgic reasons but not much.,Bad Boys for Life
215,tstudstrup,Best Bad Boys movie so far.,10,23 January 2020,"Warning: Michael Bay is in the movie himself in a brief but annoying cameo. But that can be forgiven. Because he didnt direct this movie and all the stuff you hate, even if you like the first two Bad Boys movies is gone this time around.No shameless product placement, no objectifying women, no panning around the main characters, no offensive jokes about gay men and no over the top ridiculous action.That's not to say that this isnt everything you would expect from a Bad Boys movie. It is but its just so much better.This movie has a better story, good acting (not something you saw in the first two) Mike Lowry's (Will Smith) background explained. Mike Lowry and Marcus Burnett seem more human and act their age. 50 and 53 when the movie was made. Darker more serious tone, with lots of humor, mostly from Martin Lawrence. And some dark plot twists you will not have seen coming. It has a babe, Paola Nuñez that is a lot older than you'd think (41) but still gorgeous and she can kick ass just as well as Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, still can kick ass too.And of course its' R-rated, as it should be, so it has graphic bloody violence. And lots of cool action and lots of f-bombs. Only downside. You have to wait an hour for the first big actionscene.After the countless Transformers movies and the god-awful Netflix movie, 6 Underground, Michael Bay, has finally given up the reigns to Bad Boys after making us wait 17 years for a third Bad Boys movie. He might have invented the characters and the universe, but after the boring 1st Bad Boys and the psychotic sequel, its nice to see Bad Boys the way those movies should have been made from the get-go.The ending builds up to a sequel that is more than welcome as long as Bay stays away from it.I can definitely recommend this.",Bad Boys for Life
216,darkwizard404,Best one in the franchise,8,29 January 2020,Just as good as I had expected. Even after 17 years it didn't feel any different from the previous films except this one happens to be the best in the franchise. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence were able to re-enact the fantastic chemistry even after all these years. Their comic timing was on point and this movie has an interesting plot with some great action sequences. Overall this is a very enjoyable and entertaining film and a surprise package. One of the reasons is because it wasn't directed by Michael Bay.,Bad Boys for Life

218,theemuhammede,"An emotional, edge of your seat movie with a dark twist",7,17 January 2020,"My title is the best way I can describe this movie. From start to finish, it really was an emotionally connected movie, I was on the edge of my seat, and it had a dark twist to it. With the first two Bad Boys movies, the emotional connection was there for both Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Will Smith); however, it was not all throughout the entire movie. There was a significant turning point in both that did it for me, but in this one, it was right from the beginning of the movie. I was edge of my seat because of it. Usually I will kick back and recline my seat in the theater. But I did not for this one because of how invested I was in it.I give this one a 7/10 because of the story and a specific scene. The story was good and kept me guessing, but it did not have that complete ""Miami PD"" feel to it all throughout. It felt more like Special Forces because of the action scenes that happened. The scene that was such a let down to me was one that was highly anticipated. In the first two, there was a 180 degree shot of both Marcus and Mike that took place after the climax and pivotal point of the movie. In part one, it happened after Julie was kidnapped. In part two, it happened after Syd was kidnapped. Marcus was the first to stand up followed by Mike as they found out the news. For this movie, I really was looking forward to seeing that happen again because it was a powerful scene of brotherhood in the hardest of times. Here it felt very rushed and it did not have the same feel to it. I also did not like how certain sayings felt overused and misused. The sayings I am referring to are ""we ride together, we die together, bad boys for life"" and the Bad Boys song.I was really happy that Captain Howard was back at it again. There was a lot more of him on screen than I had expected, and I was completely okay with it. He still had his comedic sense.Overall, I definitely would recommend watching this movie. Part II is still my favorite one of the three.",Bad Boys for Life

220,ObsessiveCinemaDisorder,"A Part-Meditative Part-90's Nostalgic Action Comedy, Best Bad Boys Film To Date.",8,7 September 2020,"Bad Boys For Life ReviewOld school cops Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett, assisted by a new elite police team AMMO, team up to take down the ruthless leader of a Miami drug cartel, Armando Armas.The buddy cop movie was my favorite genre growing up and fortunately for me, there was an overabundance of them through the nineties. Whether they were good or bad, I loved them all regardless because I enjoyed the core dynamic of what they're about: male friendships.Directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, who have taken over the directing reins from Michael Bay, understand this completely and competently deliver a great third Bad Boys movie, a movie sequel nobody was asking for. They deliver all the things one would expect and deliver some nice surprises along the way.Will Smith and Martin Lawrence's onscreen chemistry is still vibrant and is the price of admission. They are like real inseparable best friends who are ribbing each other all the time. It seemed like they're ad-libbing a lot of the zingers between takes. The lines seem so natural at times that a screenwriter would have to pull their hair out in the middle of the night on caffeine to chisel dialogue to that level.The jokes are hilarious and they are many laughs. Essentially, Will Smith does the action and Martin Lawrence supplies the reaction. It's a simple gag that doesn't seem to get old. Initially, it seemed like Martin Lawrence's deliveries were a bit slow, like he was getting over some illness, but it was more on point as the movie progressed. There's even a great follow-up to the Reggie scene from Bad Boys 2, one of its funniest scenes.The action sequences are over-the-top but tame in comparison to the sequences directed by Michael Bay (who has a little cameo as a wedding party guest). What can get more high-octane than that highway scene from Bad Boys 2 anyways? For an action comedy, the comedy portion is the bigger sell than the action portion. Whenever there are action scenes without the two leads, the film begins to feel like a by-the-numbers action movie really quickly.The script, by Joe Carnahan, Peter Craig, and Chris Bremner, dives deeper into Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett, who are the archetypal 90's buddy cop duo. The script explores further into the spiritual aspect of Martin Lawrence's Marcus character, which was previously done as a character gag in Bad Boys 2 (""Woosah!"") and have stitched it into a meaningful story about a gun-toting action hero wanting to renounce violence and bloodshed. Yes, this movie gets deep at times in unexpected ways.Will Smith's Mike Lowrey character can only exist onscreen in a movie. He's a movie cop whose rich parents have died and left him with great wealth, but he chooses to be a cop anyways and uses that money to buy flashy clothes and sports cars to chase bad guys with. He always shoots first and asks questions later, knowingly endangers the lives of citizens in car chases, and openly claims that he loves shooting bad guys to death. If this person existed in real life, he'd be diagnosed as a psychopath.This film pries that open and deconstructs that in a fascinating way. There's a scene where Mike Lowrey actually is disappointed that he is required to use rubber rounds on criminals and Marcus repetitively tells Mike there is something mentally wrong with his love of police violence through the whole movie.The script forces the audience to consider all those faceless henchmen and villain kill counts in the previous Bad Boys as something that really happened and watch as the characters contemplate their own atonement. Dramatically speaking, Martin Lawrence steals the movie as he gets to show new depths with his character.If the movie gods ever allow it, I'd like to see what this writing team would do with Lethal Weapon 5, as Riggs and Murtaugh have similarly been reduced to being action hero archetypes after Lethal Weapon 2 and could use this type of deconstruction. Directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah are working on the fourth Beverly Hills Cop, so I'll settle for that.Bad Boys For Life will probably be most satisfying for fans of the series who were there since the beginning. For first-timers watching this as their very first Bad Boys film, it will probably be a great one-time watch, but it won't have them looking up the back catalog. There may be no point doing that anyways as this is probably the best of the three.",Bad Boys for Life
221,arod_85,Surprisingly the best movie I've seen in a long time...,9,18 January 2020,"We hadn't planned to watch this movie and ended up going because there was nothing else particularly interesting in the theater. It was not a movie I was anticipating and have been pretty disappointed in all the blockbuster movies in the last year (Star Wars, Avengers, Lion King, etc) so I wasn't expecting much after being let down so many times. I was a huge Will Smith back in his prime, but was never particularly excited about the other two Bad Boys. This movie was probably one of, if not the best movie I've seen this year. I ended up being pleasantly surprised! This movie was action packed, had a pretty good plot and was hilarious. It's by no means a masterpiece, but for what it is, it was great. Will Smith is making a come back after Aladdin and now Bad Boys.",Bad Boys for Life
222,MovieGuyFunTime,Twenty Five Years Later and They are Still a Fun Romp,6,18 March 2021,"The fun is still there along with the by-now obligatory racist cracks at whitey (I guess it's only ""racism"" if it's directed at certain people). The novelty of ""black cops"" with attitudes strutting their stuff to the chagrin of ""rich white people"" never gets old... I guess.Despite that, the film is actually pretty good. I've always liked Will Smith even though he's been in some crap films. He is always fun to watch. Though BBFL is pretty over-cooked at times, the buddy-buddy relationship still holds up well and lots of bad guys die in graphic ways.The ""Gemini Man"" twist where his son is actually trying to kill him seems a little plagiarized or too obvious or too lazy or too convenient or too forced or... I dunno. It didn't really work for me but it does set up the future for a young and repentant Will Jr. To keep the franchise alive.Overall, not a bad film. Just sad they still feel like they have to inject that obligatory anti-whitey racist crap. It doesn't add anything to this film and by now it feels pretty over-done and worn out. It was funny in 48 Hours with Eddie Murphy. Now it's just a box you have to check to get your film made.",Bad Boys for Life

224,MovieWarfare,It's surprisingly okay,6,10 April 2020,"Bad Boys was the film that pretty much launched Will Smith into action fame. The first two films which were directed by Michael Bay were the most Michael Bayest film ever. Both films had cringe dialogue with fart jokes, sex jokes, and treating women like objects with the dumbest and pervert camera shots for women with lots of explosions. Also an incredible amount of F-bombs. Honestly, the Bad Boys movies suck a lot and it baffles me that it managed to even get a third movie. However, this time it isn't directed by Michael Bay and that was enough to get me interested in this movie.25 years after the first movie I got to say that Will and Martin still have great chemistry and their banter is still one of the biggest highlights for this movie. I was worried about this as Martin Lawrence hasn't been in a lot of films but this movie shows that they still got it. Additionally, the movie makes their characters have more depth instead of being loud over the top cops and that was very interesting. The action scenes also have a lot less shaky cam which makes it so much easier to know what is going on compared to the previous films. The movie also does comedy much better than the first two movies with moments that actually gave me a chuckle. There are still some sex jokes but  and fart jokes are gladly gone. Also, the story is actually a lot more compelling compared the first two movies by making it feel more personal instead of ""hot girl gets kidnap by a bad person"". On that note, the villain is more memorable as it feels like they have a personality and has a believable motive instead of being a generic 80s cannon fodder. The stakes in these movies feel high and more important to the characters.However, this movie feels very generic and conventional and doesn't really add anything to the action genre. It's just a typical action movie that is not as terrible as the first two. The action scenes while much more visible, lack a lot of the high octane energy from Michael Bay movies. I hate the first two movies but there is some pretty crazy action in them such as the freeway scene in Bad Boys 2 but in this movie, they are just really tame. Furthermore, the movie also has a surprising amount of blatant CGI and green screen which are very noticeable in action scenes. It's very obvious when they green-screened a stunt double with Will Smith's face or Martin's face and it can take you out the movie sometimes. Finally, without spoiling the story, there is just one moment near the end of the movie that really irritates me when a character makes a choice that makes no sense as there was no proper build-up to it. It just happens and it doesn't feel deserved or believable.In conclusion, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. It wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. However, the franchise is still quite bad in my opinion and this movie doesn't make me change my mind. Maybe the 4th movie which should be called Bad Boys 4ever steps up the plate and takes more risk.",Bad Boys for Life
225,RobTortureWright,"One last time, let it stay that way.",5,21 May 2020,"Maybe I was young and impressed by the over the top explosions and flashy gunfights but now I'm a bit older (28) Im just not as entertained by it all. I found myself staring at my phone too many times throughout this film and would have to say 2 hours wasn't a great idea by the team. Shorten the film and focus on the story and it could have been much better. Now I'm not saying it's a bad film but if you haven't seen the first two films and don't get the nostalgic scenes then your probably going to hate it. Other than the nostalgia there isn't alot left, poor and predictable story, action scenes are badly over exadurated and the acting isn't great (I'm looking at you DJ Khalid) Will Smith carries the film almost entirely and Martin Lawrence tries his best but it feels like he's forcing the jokes and they don't land, only one or two that made me chuckle. The AMMO team are just extras and make scenes cheesy which isn't great. Overall if you like the first two films you'll tolerate this one but I think everybody would agree its time for the franchise to come to an end.",Bad Boys for Life

Isabel has a secret weapon with son Armando, played by Jacob Scipio, ready to party in Miami like there's no tomorrow. For those on the hit list! But two old cops are limbering up for the fight. Right to the hospital, as Martin Lawrence's Marcus becomes a granddad, and fancies life in the slow lane of retirement. While his partner, Will Smith's Mike, wants to see more miles on the Porsche before he's ready to settle down and call it a day.Directors Adil El Arbi & Bilall Fallah have created a really funny cop film with Bad Boys For Life. I didn't see the two previous but I'm guessing they follow the same pattern.Isabel now suited and booted in Victoria Beckham designer gear gives Armano, let's call him Junior for now, the hit list. And Mike just happens to be on it. But instructed to kill him last. Of course Junior has a will of his own, he quite happily finishes off the local drugs lord, his family is in charge again now that Isabel is back. And Mike is taken out too. Not exactly in the right order, so Isabel is pissed.While he's is in the Twilight Zone Marcus prays that if Mike makes it he will hang up his holster for good. A vow he makes good on, and spends his days getting in his wife's way and blowing things up! He's up to date on the soaps, but people are still getting killed out there. And Mike back in the Porsche is trying to figure out who the sharp shooter in black is, and who will be next. When he discovers a lead, Joe Pantoliano's Miami PD Captain Howard lets him sit in on a gig run by Paola Nuñez's Rita. Mike's previous girlfriend on the force, and there's no love lost. She has a crack team of newbies including Charles Melton, Vanessa Hudgens and Alexander Ludwig. The first not impressed by Mike and the last totally intimidated by him. He's built like a tank but has anger issues so does the nerdy computer stuff. Their team codename is AMMO, although occasionally they use plastic bullets. Not very rock and roll. And although he's an 'adviser' to the team. Mike sometimes has to make executive decisions. That guy will really get himself killed. With Howard suggesting he like Marcus might think about retiring soon too. Marcus needs glasses and Mike dyes his goatee for heaven's sake! But there's still life in the old dogs yet and when the shooter gets too close to home, they are ready to saddle up one last time. Motorbike and sidecar style. With a big dog!It's a terrifically funny script by Chris Bremner, Joe Carnahan and Peter Craig, with plenty of firepower and heat. Miami is a riot of colour with cinematography by Robrecht Heyvaert and the non stop action directed by Adil & Bilall never lets up. It was totally not what I was expecting and I had a blast. Will and Martin still got it.",Bad Boys for Life
227,sujanfaster,And they have come for us again,7,1 February 2020,"It's the era where movie franchisees are ready to go formula for many studios and Bad Boys coming back after almost 15 years didn't really surprise the fans. This was actually in the making for quite a while and has finally seen the light of the day.As usual, the script of a movie coming back after this long has to be something to do with lead character's past and Bad Boys is no different. Anyway, this time around the bad boys are chilling back in Miami having done little in the previous decade. While Mike still has got his adrenaline going, Marcus is all set for a retirement life as granddad. That's when the past comes to haunt them and Mike along with his unconventional Bad Boy methods has a hard time trying to find answers.This Bad Boys is slightly different than its predecessors. It obviously touches on how age has caught up to the lead characters and draws humour from the same. The movie also focuses on the team surrounding bad boys and not just Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. This movie kind of sets up for a young brigade takeover with actors like Vanessa Hudgens, Alexander Ludwig and Jacob Scipio. The movie also has some music celebrity presence with DJ Khaled and Nikki Jam. While Will Smith does look younger than his Youtube videos, Martin Lawrence surely looks much older and suitable for the retirement talk which is carried throughout the movie. Although the movie starts with some cliched humour it does pick up itself as it goes along. The actions sequences are pretty decent, not too heavy or overly done.Overall Bad Boys for Life does offer a good bit of nostalgia, that Miami vibe and some classic action entertainment.

Hopefully there will be another sequel before they both get too much older for an action flick, LOL.Script not too bad and incorporating new characters was good.Only disappointing thing was reviews expecting more from a comedy/action movie. Jeez, it's fiction for crying out loud. Appears some reviews hold this movie too higher standard or just plain hating. I was shocked to see the theater packed when I went hoping for a smaller audience and everyone was laughing; so it must be funny to many people.Highly recommend checking this out.

This one is different than the previous Bad Boys 2. It felt more mature, dealt with more profound concepts. Is the use of violence justifiable to stop violence?
It may not be the right type of movie to answer that question, but it didn't hesitate to ask it.

This was not directed by Michael Bay and apart from a brief cameo and some slight nods of recognition to his style you can tell. The dialogue is much sharper and funnier and not repeated over and over by 15 year olds at school after watching it funny but actually funny, funny. It has plot twists where the other two barely even had a plot. The two originals Will Smith and Martin Lawrence team up with a special team called AMMO who are made up of a group of typically politically correct characters you find in mainstream films nowadays. Martin Lawrence is considering retirement and Will Smith acts exactly how he did in the 1995 original which works in the films favour.

249,DJ_Shilo,Hasta El Fuego,9,18 January 2020,"""Bad Boys For Life: sees the return of Will Smith and Martian Lawrence as the two wise-cracking cops we have come to know, 17 years since, ""Bad Boys II."" Sony has long delayed the third film, and now it is getting released in the middle of January, commonly known as the dump month, where movies go to die, and these were all early warning signs. But despite being released in January, it's the best entry of the series. So much so that I saw it twice.It's about Miami Cops, Mike Lowery (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) who are called back to action when a shooter is murdering targets all around the world, and these targets are tied to an old case of Mike's from many years before. After a violent prison escape, someone returns from Mike's past for revenge. Mike needing Marcus's help, gets sidelined when he says he wants to retire. After a tragedy strikes close to home for the two cops, Marcus decides to help Mike one last time.This installment is the first film not to be directed by Michael Bay, and for that, it is better directed. It's helmed by Belgium filmmakers, Adil El Arbi, Bilall Fallah. Will Smith and Martin Larence are a dream team with great chemistry on screen, but I'm not too fond of the way Bay directs them; it feels very loud, and I'm not too fond of the way Bay directs action sequences. They are very messy, and he constantly zooms in on things. The bridge sequence in ""Bad Boys II"" is fun to watch, but it's very messy and loud with what has become knows as ""Bayhem."" However, it feels like they tried to emulate Bay's style of action with this one, perhaps for the fans, but it doesn't quite reach that extreme the way Bay does, which is a good thing, and for that, this film is more coherent.Surprisingly, ""Bad Boys For Life"" is nowhere near as bad as one would have thought given the January release date and despite it taking so long to get made. What I was not expecting was the twist in the last thirty minutes of the movie where it gets explained why everything is happening and how it is all linked to Mike's past. This sequence had he stunned as it got written with honest conviction, and Will Smith's performance to it is stellar when he looks back on the past from 24 years and has to relive painful memories.The film opens with the same sequence from the trailer with Mike's Porsche speeding through traffic with, what looks like, Miami Police chasing them. They employ their usual funny banter, and we see that the two actors have not lost their characters since the last movie. In this installment, they are much amusing, and the jokes are funnier. It turns out; it's to get Marcus to the hospital as he is about to become a grandfather or a ""Pop-Pop"" as Mike calls it. Being a grandfather is what causes Marcus to think about retiring, saying, ""We got more years in front of us than behind."" He wants to spend time with his family more much to the chagrin of hotheaded Mike, who wants to keep chasing down criminals saying, ""I"" m going to be running down criminals till I'm one hundred."" Mike tries to change his mind.Meanwhile, something violent is about to happen in Mexico. Isabel Aretas (Kate de Castillo), a self-proclaimed ""Bruja,"" executes a gruesome, ""Silence of the Lambs"" style prison escape, reuniting with her son, Armando Ames (Jacob Scipio). It's all part of Isabel's plan to murder the people responsible for putting her in prison and her husband in the grave, one of those people being Mike Lowery. Isabel commands her son to kill everyone and to save Mike for last, ""so he can suffer."" Castillio gives a top-notch performance as someone Mike describes as a ""Stone Cold Killer."" She is the best villain in the entire series. She is very compelling, is very dangerous, and does not scream a lot as the previous two villains did.Armando sets out to execute his mother's wishes using a motorcycle. However, she scolds him when he violates her orders, going after Mike first because he poses the biggest threat. It gives the film an emotional stake, and there is a very emotional sequence in the twist I mentioned earlier. Rest assured, there is still enough violence here. There are two sequences of violence that I found gruesome even for a ""Bad Boys"" movie. Captain Howard (Joe Pantoliano) returns as the long-suffering Police Chief who can't stop screaming because of Mike and Marcus's reckless behaviour, and he is always funny, albeit much older in this one, still steals the screen. There is a sequence where Howard scolds Mike for shooting people in a warehouse, and humorously describes the scene as ""carnage.""One thing I did like is that they found ways to explore both Mike and Marcus and their personalities, which was not present in the previous films. It hits the same notes as you would expect for a ""Bad Boys"" movie. Marcus is always terrified that is wife is going to catching him doing something stupid and yell at him. Mike is the badass that likes to kick in people's doors, but it gives us their backstories, which added depth to the characters. Mike's backstory is the key to the film and not in a superficial way as you would expect, but you feel for him a lot more than before with a choice he became forced to make.Still, this is better than expected; the only issue is the use of CGI for some of the stunt doubles. The actors are in their 50's now, and you can see that it's a CGI Will Smith's face, and they could have shot this a better way. Also, the use of green screens is very evident. There is a chase sequence where it's very noticeable, but it's a small price to pay for an otherwise well-written story that took me by surprise. For a January release, which, as I said before, were early warning signs, the film is a victory for the long-dominant series with Mike and Marcus setting off on one final ride. That is, of course, unless they make ""Bad Boys 4,"" which they are talking about, but who knows if we will get it. I assume we will, and we won't have to wait seventeen years for it.",Bad Boys for Life

I don't know the character flow in the first half felt forced and not good, no comedy, no action, pure drama, and many unnecessary scenes.

Then there is halfway into the movie or more like 75% in, it's like they got the old script writer back in or a new script to work with (the airplane scene), they went back to being into their old characters from the previous movie, funny dialog, action, quick wit...etc, and from here on until the end it got pretty good, so I have a feeling this was the real script , and the first half of the movie was make it up as you go to fill in the extra timeline...really if you watch the first 12 minutes (to find out who the villains are, then fast forward to about 50-75% in) it will be a good movie.",Bad Boys for Life

Whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do when they come for you...The opening sequence really delivers. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence have still managed to deliver their brotherhood and friendship since a 25 and 17 year absence from their predecessors. Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) are the Bad Boys back in the game!! Older, and wiser!!This film, unlike it's predecessors, has a more deep meaning in this director's version, compared to Bad Boys (1995) and Bad Boys II (2003) this is more meaningful, and Lowrey is mostly at the front and centre of the whole synopsis... however, Burnett still brings the lols and freedom of pure joy, but it's mostly Lowrey you're focused on. After Lowrey is injured badly and faces near-death, it brilliantly brings you tears and pain if you're a Bad Boys fan, and if you are swelling with tears, give it a while, until the Captain has his moment, it's quick, and it gives you as an audience, pure heartbreak.However, when the fights go down the fights go down. The story truly is a personal vendetta, and Lowrey has to thank the audience for a gruelling, interestingly new take on what fans have seen before. This film's drama is heavier than 1&2. Bad Boys 4 in the works has got to keep bringing the excitement in and then you can have a successful franchise.The antagonist is a true, dark, and disturbing figure. One hit to the next, it's gripping and gives you adrenaline, it's more gripping than ever before, and it's here to stay. Another antagonist, is personal and cold-blooded. She really is wanting Lowrey dead... that motivates fans and the audience alike entertained and hooked through the whole moving picture, from one shock to another, fans will be gasping.Smith and Lawrence have made the Bad Boys ""potential"" franchise a new, fresh-take and has guided the two bros for life on a successful tunnel of what fans and critics really want. It's an absolute joy and a really entertaining film. A couple of new ""faces"", a director might give you a coincidental moment, in fact. Lowrey and Burnett, finally, deserve to stay, and are awaited for a new instalment as it speeds its way to success.You gotta learn the words... but you gotta learn patience!

The chemistry remains the same after so many years and the humour is great in most parts (there is a surprise cameo). The younger team accomplishes its purpose (Paola Nunez is gorgeous).
CONS:Although Smith and Lawrence are a fantastic duo, the second one offers nothing essential in the film (the joke ''I'm to old for this'' is not funny anymore). The ending action sequence is kind of bland and the use of green screen is obvious. The acting from the female villain is horrible.",Bad Boys for Life
272,DjfunkmasterG,Entertaining Popcorn film,8,31 August 2020,"I see a lot of the Negative reviews for this film seem to miss the point of a Popcorn film. Popcorn flicks are 9 times out of 10 cookie cutter scripts that serve one purpose, to let your forget your troubles for 2 hours and enjoy things being blown up or shootouts occurring that you would never see in normal day to day live.Did people forget that the average day for a cop is pretty much boring? They are not chasing down international drug dealers everyday where they have one assassin who is the best trained and can take out an entire squad on their own?Did people forget that most police officers, even narcos do not have the swagger and personality of Mike Lowery but are more like a Marcus Barnett (Married Kids, trying to have a peaceful existence)If you walked into Bad Boys 4 Life expecting anymore than what was promised via the previous 2 films you set yourself up for failure.Bad Boys 4 Life, even under new directors, still entertains and has some great laughs because it never set out to be an Oscar Contender, it was made for the exact same audience as a Fast & Furious movie and the expectations to be that were met from start to finish.One thing BB4L did accomplish significantly is that it shows neither Will nor Martin have lost their comedic touch and make us remember why we enjoyed the 1st two films as much as we did.Also, BB4L is a natural progression of getting older, living off the Lethal Weapon Mantra that we're not too old for this stuff, and it is true, while Will and Martin are in their 50's and one is definitely ready for greener pastures they still delivered.So stop trying to act like every film needs to be Oscar Worthy, they don't.

273,KaZenPhi,Bad and stupid in all the wrong ways,3,14 February 2021,"Turns out entertaining dumbness is a very delicate balance.While the first Bad Boys was sort of generically stupid and a real chore to sit through, Bad Boys 2 was so over the top crazy and dumb that it was bordering on art. It went to such extremes in visually tiring but very creative ways that you have to admire it in a way. Ever since it came out, I've been using the term ""bad boys 2 effect"" to describe franchises that became better by becoming much dumber like the fast and furious movies and independence day.I was hoping for the same trademark Michael Bay chaos, fittingly christened ""Bayhem"" by media critics, to find out to my dismay that Bay wasn't in the driver's seat this time, instead he was replaced by a duo of Indie film makers that chose to stage this movie with more restraint, which was a bad choice from the start. This series doesn't work in third gear.In the beginning the flabbergasting attempt to tell a more mature cop drama inbetween Will Smith action posing for instagram stories almost works, but the makers wanted to have their cake and eat it too. The movie thus alternates between dramatic moments of death, vulnerability and a very shy non-committed look at toxic masculinity, and the inappropriate non-sequitur humour Michael Bay properties are known for. In the end, neither works and the drama falls as flat as the jokes. The confused tone isn't even consistent between characters in scenes themselves. It feels like all the actors separately were supposed to get cue cards on whether to act funny, cool or dramatic in a scene but an assistant accidentally scrambled them all beforehand and was too scared to tell anyone.There isn't really much here to draw your interest, neither in fluff or substance. The story is thin, acceptable for an episode of a tv series maybe, the action is mediocre and unimaginative, the visuals are repetitious and uncreative (I appreciate the effort to make yellow the new ""in"" colour but nobody's going to take inspiration from this film) and the acting is really off. Didn't these characters used to have chemistry? Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are back together after 17 years and they look like they'd rather be anywhere else doing their taxes.Look, I kinda hate Michael Bay, most of his films are bordering on unwatchable but his frat-boy-with-the-heart-of-a-teenager hand was desperately needed here. His films, more often to their own detriment than not, are made with maximum visual impact in mind. They are loud, expensive, dumb and extreme. They're almost a hundred percent icing with sparse crumbs of cake, but if you like icing at least you get a lot of bang for your buck. Bad Boys 3 in contrast is a bit more crumb with sparse icing. Either go full on action schlock or do a serious crime drama, you can't do both at the same time in such a borderline passive way and expect to swoon an audience.I mean what's even up with that title anyway? Bad Boys 4 life is the title you use for the fourth part not the third one. Try harder, think dumber!",Bad Boys for Life

1. The screenplay is good. There are many great action and comedy scenes that the franchise fans will love.
2. The performance of Martin Lawrence is really good. He makes you laugh everytime he comes on screen but it is more because of the writing.
3. The twist that comes in the middle of the movie is really good. It won't be predicted by everyone.
4. There are many scenes and jokes on the age of the lead characters. The makers accepting the reality was a good decision.
What's bad:
1. The story is predictable and filled with cliches. Apart from the twist that I mentioned above, the whole story is predictable. We have seen films like this before.
2. The performance of Will Smith doesn't impress much but it is more because of the writing. He is playing the serious no nonsense action hero that we have seen hundreds of times.
3. Logic is killed multiple times in the movie.

279,huntersmithx,"One last time? Probably not, but an entertaining one.",7,23 January 2020,"The Bad Boys franchise, with two prior installments in 1995 and 2003, has surprisingly aged well given its' mainstream fanbase despite middling reviews from critics. ""Bad Boys for Life"" brings back our favorite detectives, Marcus and Mike, in a surprising third installment with admirable production values.It's the darkest film of the series yet which helps to make the stakes feel as real as they can be for a Bad Boys installment, though it makes for an uneven tone. There are early scenes with the main antagonists that can be redundant, and the movie will obviously require some suspension of disbelief. This is all balanced out with gritty and entertaining action sequences. The chemistry between Will Smith and Martin Lawrence doesn't miss a beat, and the new cast members (especially the AMMO team, new allies for Marcus and Mike) are also fun to watch.Major movie releases in the winter have been known a lot to be average or bad at best, but for me and others ""Bad Boys for Life"" was a surprisingly fun time to start out 2020.

282,darklydreamingrahu,A Polarizing Entry Into One of Michael Bay's Most Cherished Series,7,18 May 2020,"First, Bad Boys for Life is not a bad movie. It has some genuine character moments and laughs with Marcus and Mike throughout its runtime, and any fan of the series should watch for the classic chemistry of these actors alone.However, this is a much different Bad Boys, and many fans are going to hate it.Michael Bay was perfect for this series. Bad Boys 2 is and always will be an action classic. The sequel's set pieces mixed with its innovative, frenetic action was enough make it stand out, but legends Will Smith and Martin Lawrence gave the script the comedic and charismatic gravitas needed to thoroughly entertain.One of those two things is still true for the series' third and presumably final entry.Bad Boys for Life needed to be a 2.5 hour behemoth of an action movie, and it was never going to be. This is very muted take on the outlandish series with only glimpses and stabs at its former glory.The new directors tried to take this movie in a more genuine, heartfelt direction with more focus on interesting characters and plot developments instead of funny scenes in between grandiose action.And it works for much of the runtime. It isn't near the spectacle or guilty pleasure that BB2 was. At all.But, does it have to be? Many fans would argue that it does, though I suspect this movie will age decently, because some of the dialogue and comedy between its stars is gem-worthy.As a third and assumed final entry for Marcus and Mike, this movie ultimately fails to live up to its predecessors, and it knows it from the jump.Yet, as a entertaining romp with a couple of characters that I genuinely enjoy, Bad Boys for Life is a good way to waste a couple of hours.6.7/10 for me, rounded up to 7 because it was fun.",Bad Boys for Life
283,cheekyfilm,Bad Bad Boys,3,1 August 2021,"It's embarrassing watching grandpa Will Smith act like he's some sort of tough guy, beating up people 35 years his junior. He is terrible in this movie, very cringeworthy stuff. Martin Lawrence is great as always, and it's good to see him back. Joey Pants is good, and there are beautiful locales, tight action sequences, and a few genuinely funny scenes. But the other 90 minutes is either boring or flat-out bad.The new villians are so bland you'll forget they exist, even as you're watching the movie. The look of the movie has taken an odd 'digital' downgrade. It just looks cheap. I was watching this in 4k and it only exposed the flaws. The story bits are cliché after cliché with no attempt to put a spin or twist on very tired concepts. The scene where the detectives watch the kids play sports is especially egregious, I've seen in at least 25 other movies. Super Troopers did a good parody of it many moons ago.This captures the classic feeling of Bad Boys a few times, but left me unsatisfied.",Bad Boys for Life

286,michaeldoud,"First Hit: Funny at the right times, but confusing gun battles took away from the story.",6,18 January 2020,"First Hit: Funny at the right times, but confusing gun battles took away from the story.Will Smith as Detective Mike Lowery and Martin Lawrence as Detective Marcus Burnett can be engagingly funny together. And in many scenes, they hit that sweet spot by bringing outright out-loud laughter from the audience.The background of this story is that these two have worked together for twenty plus years and, during this time, created havoc in the Miami Police Department by being both hasty in their actions and unconventional in their investigative methods. The directors, Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah put this right up front in the opening scenes when they have the detectives drive through Miami at recklessly high speeds in Lowery's 911 Porsche.Burnett wants to retire but gets yanked away from fulfilling this dream when Lowery gets riddled with five bullets from Armando (Jacob Scipio), an assassin riding a motorcycle down one of Miami's boulevards. In another early scene, we see Armando breaking his mother Isabel Aretas (Kate del Castillo) out of prison.Isabel is intent on revenging an old score which resulted in the death of her husband. She asks Armando to kill all that had to do with her former husband's death. One of the aspects of Isabel that the audience is made aware of early is that she sees herself as a witch of some sort.Directing the detective's work over the years was Captain Conrad Howard (Joe Pantoliano). After Lowery's shooting, he brings on his newly formed AMMO (Advanced Miami Metro Operations) squad to solve the case of all the current assassinations by using data and more conventional crime resolution techniques. This team is led by Lowery's ex-girlfriend Rita (Paola Nunez).Lowery won't be held back and goes out to find his assassin and finally convincing Burnett to come out of retirement to help him one last time.The rest of the film is about the slight conflicts between the AMMO squad and Lowery and Burnett's tactics on finding and dealing with the assassins.The AMMO team has some hilarious interactions with Lowery and Burnett, which helped set the stage. However, it was Marcu's comments to Mike that got the most laughs. One funny scene was when Mike names the color dye Mike uses to cover the gray in his goatee.However, what didn't work was the convoluted shootouts, two specifically, one in a warehouse garage and the other in an old hotel that was confusing. Just too much noise and shooting that didn't make a whole lot of sense.Smith was his typical smart-alecky competent self. As such, he was perfect for this role. Lawrence was terrific as the sidekick attempting to bring some sanity to his partner's life. Pantoliano was solid as a police captain. Nunez was good as Lowery's former girlfriend and leader of AMMO. Castillo was okay as the woman looking for revenge. Vanessa Hudgens, as Burnett's all-knowing supportive wife, was terrific. Chris Bremner, Peter Craig, and Joe Carnahan wrote the screenplay. Directors Arbi and Fallah did a good job of bringing both action and comedy to bear.Overall: There was nothing memorable about his film or story, but it was a fun experience.",Bad Boys for Life

But the wait was worth it, and the script was written with the time gap addressed. I was a bit worried this movie would not successfully attain the magic of the relationships, stunts, narrative and filming style that set the first two movies from all the other action genre movies from its era.

It starts out with a car chase, even though this film takes place 17 years later. Just throws in a random past relationship story to provide a tiny bit of action.Characters/Acting- Will and Martin are good enough, side characters are one dimensional. No one here will surprise you.Writing- Wack. Will and Martin needed more to work with. It was so dull. Bad Boys 2 may be easy to hate in some aspects, but that movie is hilarious at all the right moments.Quality- I hated the direction and cinematography. Everything was so shaky. A quarter of this film felt like an Indian dance music video.Overall, wouldn't recommend it unless it's free. As a major fan of Bad Boys 2, I am only here to tell others to not waste their time.

289,shawthingproductions,A disappointment.,5,20 January 2020,"I'm a big fan of the last two films. I remember seeing the news for Bad Boys 2 and being concerned because it had been a while since the first and the first was a GREAT action film. Needless to say, the upped the comedy and the action and delivered a good, solid action film again. When the third was announced, I was happy. Sure, I didn't need a third but - they got the second one right so they could get this one right too?No.The comedy wears thin, the editing (last fight scene) is so sloppy it's hard to tell what is going on. They followed Blade 3's idea of allowing a younger ""team"" into the picture too (and we know how well that worked out for the Blade franchise) and the writing is downright lazy and laughable (not in a good way). When you get to ""the"" reveal, you WILL roll your eyes.The directing captured the madness of the first two films but - other than that - this was just a cheap, ugly mess of a cash in and for why?! Pointless.",Bad Boys for Life

Annoyingly boring. Nothing to do with the good old BB....Very poor acting by all the young actors. Very poor. Especially the females - total failure, including the ""witch"". If this is the next generation of actors then Hollywood is doomed.The ""Bad Boys"" looked so silly at moments with that old crap ""for life"" and the fist bumping. Unfunny or clichéd jokes, absolutely nothing new as a story line. Who wrote that crap and why?!?Martin and Will looked very bad, seems like aging got them hard.
They were great in the old BB films but it seems they've lost the magic of Mike & Marcus.Sorry to say it but this film was not needed. 30 minutes after it's end I already don't remember most of it. One of those films you won't remember the day after.Another killed franchise in the bag, WTG Hollywood...Disappointing.

The storyline where the hero's son grew up to kill his own father unknowingly, is so cliche. Will Smiths and Martin Lawrence seems to lack chemistry as well in acting together.

So when I did watch it, I was pleasantly surprised, as it's done very much the same way as the first two.
It has the same feel, filmed the same way, which you see straight from the beginning, music is the same, plenty of wise cracks and violence and even Smith and Lawrence' chemistry still works.
The plot isn't too bad, it's not The Godfather, but you don't watch these films for an engrossing storyline, it's an action film, and that's what you get, as you did in the first two.

I was therefore very reluctant to see this and only did after hearing the many positive comments. After seeing it I will say I was wrong for ever doubting this.

Thing to be praised in the movie is how they adapted the buddy cops to the modern era. Followed by the intense action sequences and twists which were a surprise delight as they happened late in the movie. Although it is set in a colorful tone, the movie never forgets its darker elements that are provided by the mysterious mom and her son. As usual Will Smith and Martin Lawrence deliver the bad boys as expected. Last but not the least the cinematography of the climax fight adds to the biggest delight of the movie.Coming to con, the movie takes its own time to become engaging while the action sequences went a little over the park as the movie progressed which was kind of weird but adaptable.Bad Boys succeeds in entertaining yet again as its bigger, better and enjoyable.Rating:69%",Bad Boys for Life

Bad Boys for Life is much darker than Bad Boys II, figuratively and literally, as at least two of the big action scenes take place at night, which in big action movies like this always seems like an excuse to cut corners on set design and stunt coordination. There are some surprising/shocking dramatic turns, so I give it credit for taking risks, but overall Bad Boys for Life is not nearly as enjoyable as its predecessor.The jokes are few and far between, and none of the 3 big action sequences is as exciting as the car carrier chase, drug house shootout, or Cuban mansion raid/Hummer chase from Bad Boys II.If you're a fan of Will Smith and/or Martin Lawrence, you might as well go see this; it's not horrible, but it's a one-viewing-and-done sort of thing. Also, the resolution of the big dramatic twist is necessarily unsatisfying and unrealistic.On the plus side, there is a nice resolution to one of the more disturbing (albeit hilarious) scenes from Bad Boys II (hint: it involves the soft-spoken young man who arrived to pick up Marcus' daughter in BB II).

318,gy-att,Nah this aint the 90's anymore. Sadly,6,31 March 2020,"I dont quite get whats the reason behind the high ratings. The script is horrible the directing is terrible, you can feel no one really had the mood to do this, there is no chemistry anymore, no fun, no pumped up real action. Maybe with a better director it could have been worked. But no one can make action movies anymore, the 90's were the golden era. Only gave 6-stars because the nostalgia but otherwise this is just a 4-star movie. Somewhere between a Fast&Furious and an Expendables.",Bad Boys for Life

It lacked the feeling that the original Bad Boys movie had. The story didn't feel original, and it felt like they just forced that storyline to get another sequel. I didn't care about the bad guys, and the sudden changes in their personality didn't help anything. The only highlight of this was that we get to see Marcus and Mike together again. The humor was still there. However, the other addition to the cast kind of annoyed me. I don't think they were necessary.SHOULD YOU WATCH IT: Just for the laughs.

323,nicktusk,Reminds me of the Fast N Furious deterioration,5,23 August 2020,I knew this film would NOT be better than the first 2 . This is a classic franchise but reminds me of the Fast N furious genre when every movie they make after the first one gets worse and worse even though it has the same super star actors . Definitely not having Michael Bay direct the film was a huge mistake . I think if he directed it would have been a much better movie . The cinematography was nothing special and very lacking in a pathetic way . I've seen TV shows with better camera angles than the ones they shot in this picture . The acting was okay . Will Smith has still got it . I like the cute Hispanic chick actors . The white dude from the Lone Survivor was good . Martin Lawrence looks old and he has gained a lot of weight especially in the face . He didn't strike me as funny in certain scenes as he did in the previous 2 Bad Boys . The story was okay sucks Joe Pantolonis character gets shot . The story doesn't have to be that dynamic for a bad boys film but the directing has to be! And it wasn't ! All in all this movie was pretty boring and I wouldn't rewatch it like I did when I enjoyed the first two.,Bad Boys for Life

Although ""Jedimen"" is only Michael Bay's screen debut, but from the film's big action battle scenes, the mirror of the movie, which complements the film's soundtrack, lays out its unique director's video style.

It was good of smith and Lawrence to reunite togeather for a third installment but it's too bad Michael bay didn't return as director we all love him so much and without him it's underwhelming overall this film is not very much as good as its supposed to be and I am definetly sticking with the bay directed films,Bad Boys for Life

To have watched him in After Earth and Gemini Man, to then to see this waste of my time was disappointing. I don't expect much from Martin Lawrence, and both actors did a decent job with their character, the story line and screenplay were painful to watch. I absolutely can't stand a contrived police story where people are killed and the main characters are arguing back and forth in a jovial manner in the ext scene, like nothing serious even happened.

In addition, to a great performance by Martin Lawrence who was the MVP in my opinion, all these points are the positives. Now, let's talk about the negatives, first of all, this movie has too many plot twists that feels very inserted into the story just to avoid the possibility of its pointlessness. In addition, why did they add a witch to the story?, seriously this feels really pointless. I mean, I like the addition of the Teen Team, but other than that not very much.

I immediately started to laugh out loud. That was the lamest thing I've seen in a long time. Shaking my head and laughing at how pathetic it was. Please watch this scene and re-watch it, I promise it will grow on you and you will end up laughing too. :)Realizing I'd waste 2 hours of my life if I continued, I turned it off and did something else.Oh, and the movie had some weird oversaturated colors and filters which hurt my eyes too.

First two movies were not taking themselves seriously and have very cliche villians. And Bad boys for life's best addition to series is its villian. Villian in this movie is not so cliche like the first two and this situation brings some kind seriousness to the movie. Seriousness can be considered a good aspect of the movie because character are older now so it very fits the story.
If you like first two movies then you should watch this one too but I think 2nd movie still the best one in the series and shooting 4th movie is unecessary. Probably they continue it with characters included in 3rd movie but trilogy should be for the series. Briefly, it is not a bad movie for a january movie.",Bad Boys for Life

Will Smith and Martin Lawrence reprise their character from the first two movies along with a couple familiar characters as well as some new characters. GO SEE THIS MOVIE IT DOES NOT DISAPPOINT!!,Bad Boys for Life
357,jcdugger,I think this is the worst movie I've ever seen...,1,31 January 2020,"Man, this movie completely sucked balls. I can't think of a worse movie I've ever seen. Easily the most predictable movie ever. Will Smith gets badly shot 10 minutes into the movie...is he gonna make it through?!?! Aw, man, no way...he made it! You don't say! Martin Lawrence...""No, no no, I'm not helping you any more Mike Lowery...I made a promise to God...No, no, no...I'm retired"" - I looked over at my buddy at one point and I said ""Uh...I think he's gonna help"". It was really that pathetically predictable.And, wow, Martin Lawrence...at one point on set, the crew thought they were going to have call the paramedics because Lawrence was having trouble inhaling -- a pizza! He's so fat now, he jumped in the air for an action scene and got stuck! I'm serious...on the running/action scenes, you won't see Lawrence for more than 5 seconds straight, most likely due to being out of breath. I think he took the Cypress Hill lyric ""Fat boy on diet, don't try it"" to extremes! At one point when Lawrence was walking away on a wooden floor, It sounded like an orchestra of squeaky nails and groaning floorboards playing him out of the room!Back to the ""plot""...Lawrence whines throughout the movie about a promise he made to God. It seemed unlikely than a rather non-religious, non-churchgoer like Lawrence would be risking losing his friendship (and his friend's life because he was in danger) based on some mumbling he did while that buddy was in the hospital. Of course, Lawrence broke his promise to God at the end anyway because he did the Mr. Miyagi (""No fighting, no fighting, no fighting...ok, go ahead and fight"") and predictably went back into action again. So dumb.Rewind to the start of the ""movie"", Smith and Lawrence are driving like lunatics, being chased by cops, driving backwards through red lights and heavy traffic...they're trying to make you think the boys are in a dangerous situation...just to find out that Smith was driving Lawrence to the hospital to see his newly born Grandson. What?! They were driving full speed on a public beach for crying out loud! Risked many lives, including the lives of cops and women and children, just to hold a frickin' baby?! If it was so important, why wasn't Lawrence at the hospital when the mother was first admitted?!Then, a few minutes later, someone who turns out to be Mike Lowery's, well, um, no-black whatsoever Mexican son (yes) is doing some sort of criminal deal and he gets guns pulled out on him. Guy standing right in front of him with a gun, another guy standing off to the side. You'd think these guys with the guns would be pretty jumpy/trigger-happy at this point. But what happens? Well, he pulls out a knife from his belt and with hypersonic speed, stabs the guy in front of him with the gun and then stabs the guy to the side who had a gun on him. Who in the hell is so slow with a trigger that they're not going to be able to fire on someone who's pulling out a knife and taking time stabbing your friend?! Even the guy in front of him...really bro, you can't get off a shot before someone reaches to their belt and swings at you with a knife?! If not...Was Will Smith's son a superhero or something?! How could he move in fast-forward speed like that?!My favorite part is when the police team is gathered and is strategizing and they need the employee work schedule of 3 different bars. The computer guy is asked to break into their networks. He says ""Boy, Joey's bar really needs to upgrade their network"", he clicks about 3 keys on the keyboard, and voila...not only Joey's schedule comes up, but all 3 bars! How did he hack into 3 different networks at once?! He did he hack into ANY business network with just a few keystrokes?! How did he bring up the 3 work schedules from 3 different companies on 3 different monitors in a matter of seconds and with just a few keystrokes?! And if Joey's network was so bad...what does it say about the other 2 business networks...he got into those quicker than Joey's!!The movie is filled with one-liners that don't land, crying and religion from Lawrence, and numerous ""I'm gonna kill you after I say this one thing..."" then that person gets shot from behind type of thing. If Smith's and Lawrence's enemies had simply cut the chit-chat, the pair would have been dead at many points.At the very very end...Smith decides his no-black-in-him-whatsoever-son deserves a 2nd chance (after killing a half dozen FBI agents, one being one his best friends, and other cops with a sniper rifle) and the pair hug and make up. Ugh, I wanted to barf so bad. Then we find out the black Smith was, get this, on an undercover team infiltrating a Mexican gang...what?! They couldn't tell he wasn't Mexican?! How in the world did he pull that off???This movie stunk like rotten cabbage. Cliches galore. ""Hip"" cops even though they're over 50 years old a piece. Predictable. Bad acting. It's little wonder they brought this out in January instead of July. Like I said...Might be the worst movie I've ever seen.JD",Bad Boys for Life

360,krational,Feelings,6,4 June 2020,"As a personal favorite IP, when bgm sounded, my heart was still quite excited. Although the two brothers can't escape the years, Martin Lawrence is a little fat and evil. The brothers who originally called brothers and brothers have a gap in their senses. The film still continues the previous style, popcorn + teasing routine. Because of the change of directors, there is no such thing as the best in action scenes. It may also be that the director plans to use more obscure ways to highlight the material of the two brothers' ages. The film as a whole is still quite smooth, without delaying the plot or showing off the feelings. Some of the continued roles are still the original cast, and the details of the casting are still commendable.If there is a problem, there must still be some. You said that the special operations team was out and helped the brothers to arrest the criminals. I understand that after all, it's been a dozen years. But I think this son of Smith is quite brutal. I used to kill my father for not killing my eyes, but I didn't want to hurt the innocent; when I finally knew that my father was born, I fell away at once. The power of abilities really makes the whole show look bloody. Smith's romantic and suspicious appearance in this play as an illegitimate child makes me really unacceptable. Although he is older, his figure is still online, and he has never shown his longing for his family and children in front of the entire film. He should still be as good as the first two films, swaying the nightclub, and it will also be lawless. The image of men at home forms a strong contrast.As a movie fan, you can see the continuation of the Jedi police is still satisfied. Although it does not support the behavior of fried rice, every ip that can keep you in mind is also a memory of your youth.

364,janjeltes,Surprisingly Reasonable,7,27 March 2020,"The first half of the film is surprisingly fresh. The film has plenty of diversity that actually works (and that is very, very rare). The story is reasonably predictable, however, what surprised me was the lack of identity politics. When you expect a ""girl power"" moment (like every other film has pushed for the last 5 years), this film doesn't deliver. That's so refreshing. The decisions made by characters actually make sense (again, very rare today).However, the second half let's the film down a lot. Stupid chase scenes that reach farcical, plot holes like Swiss cheese, twists that defy credibility, action scenes that feel like a budget film.However, it's fun to watch. If you're looking for a mindless Will Smith film, this is fun and doesn't tax the brain.Points lost for the second half being weak and almost incoherent at times. If it matched the first half, I'd probably score it 9/10",Bad Boys for Life

When I heard another was coming out, I figured they were getting the last dollar they could wring out of a 25 year old movie. Nope. This latest one, totally unnecessary and too many years later, might be a better movie than the 1st. It still has alot of what made the 1st so much fun; the camaraderie, the laughs, the action, the sheer charisma of it's stars, cameos, and yes more than a little silliness and big 'splosions. It's also got heart and soul the other 2 lacked. Definitely could have cut down on the run time, especially in the 1st and 2nd acts, but all in all much better than expected.",Bad Boys for Life

Bad boys for life features great character development for the the two leads as well as some of the supporting characters.

375,wiredarp,A formulistic action movie with way less action than needed to make up for its shortcomings,4,28 March 2020,"The original Bad Boys was a great action movie. However, this one is just tired.While the action scenes are well choreographed, they only make sense if you squint after having a lobotomy. I mean, a guy being held at gunpoint pulls out a knife, spins it around his finger to show off, then knifes the guy holding him at gunpoint, a move that literally takes at least 2 seconds, during which both the guy holding the gun and his bodyguards just stand there.Unfortunately, thats pretty much one of the more believable action scenes, which abound with physics that 90's videogames do more convincingly. Don't get me started on the fact that neither of the two leads seem interested in catching the assassin with anything but bare hands, letting him escape by simply running off rather than shooting him, as you'd imagine you'd be inclined to do if you were a guy wanting revenge for being shot.The problem is that the action scenes are sadly the best part of the entire movie. The rest of the movie is rather slow. We have old, fat Martin Lawrence holding babies, sitting in recliners, caring for the injured in hospital, attending weddings and funerals, and... that's about it. Add a few scenes where one tries to convince the other to get involved in solving the crimes, and that's about it.While the final fight isn't too bad in terms of action, its still another example of unbelievable action filler. The final end scene is even less likely.While there are occasional patches of the originals buddy charisma, they are few and far between, and the whole thing comes off as a movie that shouldn't have been made in the first place.You can tell its not that good at all, simply by the number of 10/10 ratings you see on sites like this and others, always a sign that they spent more money on buying votes and gaming systems than on the script.Save your money.",Bad Boys for Life

Sadly there's just too much much inconsequential stuff going on everywhere else to make me care for it. Worst of all is the description to add a bunch of smug millennial cops, whose sole purpose seam to be to steal Smith's and Lawrence's thunder.

But Bay does make a brief cameo. Marcus got fat and Mike got old. The jokes are somewhat funny, but what I was missing was the over the top stunts, fast cars, & sexy women that we were all so use too in the first two films. It was a cash grab from the get go.

383,joesiegel,I expected something much worse from a movie released in January,5,17 February 2020,"The final act of Bad Boys For Life seems a soap opera drama with many explosions and unreal situations, obviously silly jokes can not be missed, the film is silly most of the time, full of cliches of action movies of recent years and a caricatured villain, who is there just to shoot the good guys, the unnecessary use of Latin culture and religion is irritating.It addresses two interesting premises that are retirement after a long career and nostalgia caused by retirement and parent-child relationships, all these issues are addressed superficially, but do not be pretentious, this is the third part of a saga created by Michael Bay, and in fact this movie is the most mature of all or at least tries to be, although the plot twist is a last stupid letter that the scriptwriters were removed from the sleeve without analyzing it and deepening it a lot, the film remains thanks to a funny story that doesn't make much sense if you think about it.This movie was intentionally released in January, the studio knows that this is the month of launching regular movies that will go to the dump directly and that will be quickly forgotten, however Bad Boys For Life is an interesting surprise among this cinematographic drought.",Bad Boys for Life

385,snookie-6,"Hollywood, stop doing this!",1,24 August 2020,"This movie is a parody of Bad Boys.
And it's not that the previous two were such cinematic masterpieces, but the point is they're really fast fun flicks that you can wholeheartedly enjoy without having to squirm in your chair or feel stupid for watching it.
Not with this one. Jesus Christ, Martin Lawrence doesn't deserve this. After all he's been through, to turn him into a has-been with this title is just inhumane to the guy. First half hour was the longest half hour I've had in years. Exposition, exposition, exposition, shaky camera action sequence. Then more exposition, even more exposition, the mother of all that is exposition, and then another shaky cam action sequence.
The dialogue is trash. It's Netflix-tier. And whoever wrote the script decided that the most relatable thing to do is to just throw a bunch of pointless and irrelevant mentions of youtube and 4chan, which is just awkward to sit through.
Add toxic sarcasm, cheap moments, ""jokes"" that could only be followed by cricket noise and, as I already said, unnecessary exposition, and you feel like you're sitting through a powerpoint presentation, rather than an actual movie.
It's not that Will Smith doesn't still have it. It's not that Martin Lawrence isn't still funny (which he absolutely is). It's not that Joe Pantoliano's rage isn't wonderful. It's just that they handed the rights over to some young amateurs with handheld cameras and said ""here's a bunch of money, film this fanfiction"".
It's horrible. There isn't a single original thing in this movie and the few moments that actually manage to get a genuine laugh out of the audience are immediately followed by garbage.

396,entertainmentish,Two thumbs Up!,10,22 April 2020,"It's been a long time since I have seen a cop movie with this amount of entertainment, comedy and interestingly good action with a great story. Bad Boys for life will give that to you. I truly wasn't expecting myself to be thoroughly entertained and focused into an action movie like this. . Usually action movies are fully action packed with less focus on a story and less dialogue. This on the other hand was well balanced with all three and I'm very happy with it.
Mike and Marcus are near retirement but a mother and son drug lords are on a killing spree in Miami with havoc and vengeance. So the bad boys for life are in it for one last time together to stop the drug lords.
Surprisingly Michael Bay did not direct this third installment.Adil Alarbi and Bilal Fallah did and they did not disappoint at all. There were so many good scenes . One scene involved Martin Lawrence wanting to do something repeatedly. It was very funny. Another scene was horrific , I didn't want to be in that room. And a third scene that had me almost fooled . But one scene really got my maternal instincts up , feeling sad and emotional. Alexander Ludwig (Vikings), Vanessa Hudgens ( Highschool Musical) and Charles Melton (Riverdale) have small roles in this installment. But if there is a fouth one, they might make them bigger. I personally liked Ludwig's role, didn't buy Vanessa's acting and Melton was annoying. Every time I see Vanessa in a new movie, I'm convinced she needs to stick in musicals. And work more on romantic movies. They suit her more.
They gave us such a beautiful view of Miami at night, I was blown away. I was surprised they didn't play Inner Circle's Bad boys song that much or at all.

The story immediately gets into a scene that is supposed to keep you in suspense when Mike gets shot, yet somehow recovers and like a miracle gets up out of his wheel chair only to go through the rest of the movie as if it never, even, happened.Also, the mexican gangster stuff is just tired. Everything is nonstop spanish for the villains (hope you like subtitles if you're not fluent like hollywood seems to expect everybody to be) and of course unrealistic amounts of money, rides, girls and guns that almost makes me laugh rather than feel any sense of fear.So if you were expecting something new and fresh with some actual thought, don't expect much from this.

Movie was entertaining and Will Smith and Martin Lawrence make a nice duo but ultimately story and mixing cop-action-comedy-with over the top gore was a bad deciaion. Characters feel like and behave like the ones you would see in 90s action movie but they added lota of gore which can confuse the viewer. Comedy and over the top gore ususally works in horror comedies like ash vs evil but adding it to Bad Boys in such a big volume was a weird design choice. There is absolutetly no consequencea to characters actions and story resolution was rather silly and post credit scene really daft. People who saw the movie will know what I mean. How one could redeemed after this rampage and killing such a important character. This remains a mystery even to the movie producers. Who signed off on this?

404,arthousefilms-68-939717,Fits the genre and it's franchise... if that's your thing. (Also Movie Mistake Revealed),4,20 January 2020,"This movie fits the genre and its franchise. It is very solid on action scenes and car chases. The action scenes were pretty standard. Too bad they weren't more creative like in John Wick 3.It was fun to see Martin Lawrence and Will Smith together. Their chemistry is familiar and nice, but falls flat in this film. The dialogue and relationship were overly formulaic and lost a lot of charm because of that. It seems like their barbs and jokes to and about each other were written by a committee... and then rewritten by another committee, causing them to lose wit and charm.The sound mix was first rate. The epic final gun battle was awesome to hear in the theater.__________ SPOILERS ______________ SPOILERS ____________________I was taken out of the movie a couple times by production issues and it was frustrating with such a big budget. It was like pulling back the curtain on the Wizard of Oz and completely pulled me out of the story.1) The parkour stunt double who (was fighting Will Smith on the roof) looked nothing like the body type of the guy Will Smith was fighting, so it looked silly.2) MOVIE MISTAKE: Vanessa Hudgens shoes literally change from one shot to the next and it completely pulled me out of the movie. This happens when the cops all meet in the headquarters lobby and head down to the armory to check out their cool gadgets (like the tricked-out food truck.) In the lobby she is CLEARLY wearing black booties and pants and in the very next wide shot wears black pumps.That caused me to drift off into a bunch of thoughts about if they had shot the two scenes months apart in completely different locations and literally forgot to bring the right shoes.3) When Michael Bay, the famous film director, shows up for a cameo, again it had the effect of taking me out of the movie and thinking about Michael Bay.4) It really bothered me how they are always talking about the Bad Boys song. It felt forced and also felt like they were breaking the ""4th wall"" and talking to the audience with a little jokey joke. I'm sure many folks thought it was hilarious, but to me it just felt phoney... again, taking me out of the story.Anyway, it's probably a fun ride if that is genre works for you. But the joy, charm and spontaneity of the franchise and characters seems officially tapped out.",Bad Boys for Life
405,Dark-Wolverine,"They are back for the third time..but, exhausted.",7,12 April 2020,"Bad Boys For Life (2020)Bad Boys For Life aka Bad Boys 3 is a direct sequel to Bad Boys 2 and takes place 17 years after the 2nd and 25 years after the first. This is also the first Bad Boys movie to be not directed by Michael Bay.
The movie takes place in Miami where Mike Lowrey(Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett(Martin Lawrence) have to face off again a mother and son pair of drug lords who causes havock to the city,and it's more of a personal investigation for the two(not going into much spoilers though). The movie takes only a few minutes to set up and it's a less energetic ride than the rest of the movies. The chemistry of Will and Martin is still great in here and shows us an enthusiastic Mike and an almost retired Marcus. The supporting actors were one dimensional yet exciting. The villain here is better than the last two movies and had some characterisation in it. The cinematography was actually better than the last two, had some really good shots and was actually ""colourful"" than the last two. The music was okish and they underutilized the theme song. The pacing was okay. It was comedic,at some points.
The main problem of this movie is that this was an exhausted movie. In the second movie,Bay set up the action scenes to a top level and this movie failed to even reach half of it's. Maybe because the characters are at their 50s now or maybe because the production cost was lesser than the last one and the existing sequences weren't even that exciting. You won't get the feel of the first two movies in here except for the character chemistry. It was also less funnier than the last two.
I recommend this movie for all the Bad Boys fans and buddy cop type movie lovers. For those who admire ""Bayhem"", you'll be dissapointed here.Rating- 6.5/10Sony Pictures

If you enjoyed the first two entries, you'll be able to have fun with this. It's pure escapism with some well choreographed action sequences and the usual comedic banter between the two leads, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence who reprise their semi-iconic roles.",Bad Boys for Life

425,nickijjohnson-16955,A weak watered-down version of a Bad Boys movie,4,8 February 2020,"This was a disappointing movie all around. The action, jokes, and even chemistry between Martin and Will felt forced as if they were going through the motions. The director seemed like he was trying to be Michael Bay but couldn't quite make it. Marcus was even more of a vagina (censored it) than usual and gets less action than ever before. The ride together mantra that seems constantly repeated throughout the film made it feel like I was watching a boring version of a Fast and Furious movie. Make no mistake I love the Bad Boys franchise. But this film is a weak watered-down version of Bad Boys. If they do make a part 4 which they are alluding to I certainly hope they make it better than this one.",Bad Boys for Life
426,westerfieldreviews,"""The Boys Are Back In Town""",6,6 February 2020,"""The Boys Are Back In Town""Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah teamed up to finally bring the long-rumored Bad Boys 3 to life after over a decade in order to reinvigorate the franchise with more new installments certainly on the horizon. ""Bad Boys for Life"" sees Martin Lawrence and Will Smith returning nearly sixteen years later to reprise their roles as detectives Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowry respectively, as they tag along with a fun team of newcomers. ""Bad Boys For Life"" is an entertaining film that offers exciting action and plenty of laughs for everyone to enjoy throughout its two-hour runtime, with the exception of a few hiccups and humorless scenes/jokes that occasionally fail to land. The narrative found within ""Bad Boys For Life"" takes a backseat causing the film to bring summer early.
""Bad Boys For Life"" picks up seventeen years after the events of ""Bad Boys II"" and rehashes some of the same plotlines we have seen before. Detectives Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) and Mike Lowry (Will Smith) are still going strong, but after witnessing the birth of his grandson, Marcus decides that it is time for him to step into retirement. The film transitions over and introduces us to a new duo of antagonists, that being crime boss Isabel Aretas (Kate del Castillo) and her son Armando Aretas (Jacob Scipio); we pick up with Isabel as she breaks free from prison with the help of Armando. With Isabel broken free, she vows to enact revenge on the men she deems responsible for her husband's death. Isabel sends Armando to the states with a hit list, and at the very top of that list is none other than Mike Lowry. Shortly after Armando's arrival, tragedy strikes prompting the film to jump forward in time by six months. During that six-month interval, Armando assassinates several of the targets all while building an empire in the city of Miami. With the case now being personal, Marcus and Mike are now determined to bring Armando to justice and end his killing spree once and for all. However, the bad boys are forced to enlist the help of the newly created, Advanced Miami Metro Operations (AMMO) unit which is comprised of four fresh faces, Kelly (Vanessa Hudgens), Dorn (Alexander Ludwig), and Rafe (Charles Melton) who are led by Rita (Paola Nuñez), Mike's ex-girlfriend. With our team fully assembled, they go forth meeting several colorful characters while shooting and laughing their way to Armando until the final body drops.
""Bad Boys For Life"" on many fronts is simply put, a fun film. Immediately the film reintroduces us to the stellar duo of Lawrence and Smith (it's as if the film knows they are it's greatest assets) and it feels so right. From the film's opening moments, the apparent chemistry both Lawrence and Smith exude on-screen feels completely natural for the long-standing crime-fighting partners. Regardless of if they are bouncing jokes off of each other and sharing a laugh or verbally mocking one another, this dynamic duo brings every moment to life in a riveting way that will have audiences smiling and laughing until the very end. When talking about the cast, it should be noted that every member pulls their separate weight. The newcomers from the AMMO unit being Hudgens, Ludwig, and Melton all do a serviceable job of being entertaining more often than not, despite being completely cliched one-note characters. All across the board, the major takeaway that I walked away with after viewing ""Bad Boys For Life"" is that everyone was having an absolute blast while on set. Another strong mark for this film is its high octane action (it was partially sold on it). ""Bad Boys For Life"" features a total of three different action set pieces; a close-quarters shootout, a high-speed chase that devolves into a shootout, and a final shootout in a ruined local. These action sequences are distinct in their visual presentation and feel wholly unique when next to one another. Unfortunately, when you look past the scope of the film, nothing done is enthralling or interesting. However, the film is not a complete generic snooze fest given the variance of the environments and the dynamic gimmicks that are added as a bonus ingredient in every shootout. But, barring a few small moments within each action sequence, everything committed within ""Bad Boys for Life"" has been displayed and executed substantially better in other bombastic action blockbusters.
Despite ""Bad Boys For Life"" being the only movie in the three-filmed franchise to not be directed by Michael Bay himself, Arbi and Fallah do a fairly good job of replicating his style as the film displays very clear shades of Bay. Does the story take a backseat to the action? Check! Do the characters crack a joke every few seconds? Check! Do several of those jokes fall flat? Check! Is the villain a false menace that accomplishes nothing? Check! (You get the point) ""Bad Boys For Life"" was not directed by Michael Bay, but it was certainly crafted with all of the ingredients from his shop. The film features a shallow plot with story beats that are quite frankly laughable at times but is enjoyable due to the fun dynamics that are on display by the cast and crew. ""Bad Boys For Life"" refuses to reinvent the franchise which some will find problematic, while others will find it endearing; personally, I do not love it or hate it, I am indifferent on it, I enjoyed many aspects of the film, but on the flip side could care less about just as many. However, if the next installment (which is definitely on its way) releases in a timely manner and takes no creative leaps forward, all of the glitz and glamour found here will certainly fade away next time.Final Verdict: C-",Bad Boys for Life
427,stebird-25957,"Bad Boys, Old Boys, what ya gonna do?",4,10 August 2021,"A needless sequel released nearly two decades after the last installment, and it begs the question as to why?Okay fair enough it was nice to catch up with the characters after all this time to see where they are in their life at this stage, but couldn't that have been left up to the imagination instead?The tone of ""Bad Boys for Life"" is very akin to that of the previous two films, only this time it feels stale and exhausted; you have Martin Lawrence thinking about retirement, Will Smith who doesn't want him to retire, altogether it's just really weak and kind of pointless.In an era of unneeded sequels, this one can be added to the list..., will they be bringing out a fourth film in the future, it wouldn't be surprising if they did.The fan boys will naturally love it, but that's about it really, the first two films are better.",Bad Boys for Life

I wanted to go for the ride. I just could not. It felt as if the second one did not grow with me.Last week I went to an Imax screening of the third installment. I went a long for the ride.

Lawrence was such a disappointment. Being a heavy dude myself, I don't have anything against fat guys, but sadly, it looks like the extra pounds had a deleterious effect on his acting.

It felt more cohesive than 2 with carefully placed recycled moments while still seeming less predictable. Don't get carried away, the first movie is the best.

But it also showed a bit more of the human side than just brainless action which appealed to me. My only gripe is that the pace really drops in between and the end also deserves a bit more detail. I mean which criminal son who has never met his father be so willing to go to the other side. And I also wished that Martin Lawrence had a bit more part than just being out of shape cop. Granted he was family man but it seems a bit imbalanced. But overall the movie was really entertaining.,Bad Boys for Life

When Bad Boys for Life came out, I only heard good stuff about the movie. And, at the time, it even got more than 7 points on IMDB, which is mostly an indication that it's gonna be a decent/good movie. However, the current 6,8 is still way too generous. Deserves to be below 5. The movie is just plain awful. Every action scene was just amateurishly bad.

The humour is bad to the point of embarrassing, with Martin Lawrence being worst of all, his jokes are just cringing. Maybe if you're 12 years old and this was the first action comedy you saw, you'd find it funny, but for grownups with a little more experience, not so much. Even the action scenes are lacking, with an almost total lack of realism. One can accept the disregard for the laws of physics, with unlimited bullets and no recoil, the bullet proof tables and other silly stuff, but it's just too much overall. Also, the support characters are nothing but cardboard characters, with the exception of Joe Pantoliano. All inn all, the film is approaching level terrible, and this being one of the most watched movies of 2020 is just sad.

Recently rewatching them as an adult, they are still decent, but don't hold up nearly as amazing as I thought they were as a kid. I used to think Bad Boys 2 was one of the greatest movies of all time when I was a kid, LOL! But recently rewatching it as an adult, it's actually quite dumb but still entertaining.Luckily for Bad Boys 3, I feel this movie is more mature than the previous two installments, it's almost like it grew up along with me. I was shocked that I almost found myself crying in this movie. This one by far has the best character development of the series. Plus the chemistry and comedy between Will Smith and Martin Lawrence is still there. I still might say the first two were a little funnier, but 3 still has it's moments.A minor complaint is the villain is a little cheesy, but it's okay for an over-top action comedy like this. One last minor complaint is lack of action or big action set pieces. I think there is mainly 2 main ones in the movie. Maybe I was just spoiled by the super action-heavy and fast pace of Bad Boys 2, that movie still brings out my inner child. But I still take Bad Boys 3 over Bad Boys 2 any day. Micheal Bay's strength has never been substance, just straight up action and he does that very well. I never heard of these new directors, but they inserted some extra substance that the previous two movies lacked. Don't get me wrong, it's nothing mind blowing, but pretty much as good as you can get with a movie like this. If I was still a kid, I would say Bad Boys 2 is better than Bad Boys 3, but as an adult now, Bad Boys 3 is way better than 2, and quite possibly the best of the series.This is how you properly do a long awaited sequel. This maybe the best sequel that took 10+ years. Because all sequels that take too long are always awful or not as good, but this is the rare exception. Doesn't feel like a rehash of it's predecessors, unlike the crap Star Wars Disney trilogy. Bad Boys 3 just adds more layers to the characters and doesn't disrespect them, and actually feels like a continuation rather than a rehash. Take notes Disney Star Wars.",Bad Boys for Life

I did not go see this in the movie theater.. thank God I didn't waste $20. 17 years later from the second movie .absolutely makes me angey. And I'm very insulted... Is it the worst movie in the world noo. is it the best noo. I'd rather go back and watch bad boys 1 and bad boys 2. at least the original bad boys had more action. It had a good director like Michael Bay . He filmed it professionally.it wasn't half assed. or rushed. Michael Bay's movies have good one-liners like Marcus Burnett and Mike Larry.. action to action good buddies .good pacing. they both raised the bar in those two action movies .way back almost 20 years ago.in this film 2020 it was just rushed .had 2 New directors who actually suck and do not know how to direct and put on a good movie for us fans who have been waiting nearly 20 years to see.. basically in the movie it's almost time to retire these two detectives which it is about time. hopefully when the old director comes back Michael Bay from the first two movies the fourth movie the last movie will be the best one of the series but the way this franchise is going its about dead as we speak right now....Yes there was a few good parts in the movie some of the parts in the movie we're pretty sad. love the return of Reggie... There is a few sad parts that almost brought me to tears but 90% of the film basically put me to sleep. that's how boring it really Got. explaining all this basically itsave your money .wait for it to come on TV .is it good for the new generationnot the old. it's basically for the New kids on the block that have never seen a real action film but for us like me that was born into these movies like Bloodsport hard to kill kickboxer true lies Terminator etc etc you put those movies up with the stupid new remake movies that are half-assed these new movies would be burned to the ground in a heartbeat have no chance of competing with Steven seagal Sylvester Stallone Arnold Schwarzenegger John Claude van Damme'.

474,tayangangambar,Okay 90s style action show,5,24 January 2020,It was light entertainment with the action and bromance moments. Its the typical 90s style cop movie with that kind of cheesy humour and over the top acting villians.I have mixed feelings about plot twists and the overall storyline formula is pretty generic. No amazing acting except the heighten bromance moments between the two leads which turned out better than expected.Don't expect an amazing never-told-before story or not-seen-before action sequences. Its just a Bad Boys sequel bringing back a few familiar characters that plays on their age and the duo showng it to the next gen of law enforcement how's it done.,Bad Boys for Life

478,jelaniwilliams305,It was worth the 17 year wait!!!,10,20 January 2020,"My favorite onscreen duo is back for the third installment of the Bad Boys franchise and it was well worth the 17 year wait because #BadBoysForLife was fantastic. If you've been a fan of this franchise for the last 25 years like myself, you'll notice some awesome call backs to the past films. The chemistry between Will Smith (Mike Lowrey) and Martin Lawrence (Marcus Burnett) is undeniable; they picked up right where they left off in 2003. It's unsurprising how hilarious this film is, as the 2 leads excel with their comedic timing; especially Martin. This is the funniest he's been in a long time; I now understand when Will said that Martin has the ability to be funny without losing the sincerity of the scene (paraphrasing); it's not forced but it flows well with the scene. What DID shock me is how emotional I got during a couple of scenes. When I say that, you may be thinking that Will was the one that made me tear up because he has the acting chops to invoke that emotion but you would be incorrect. It was actually Martin who had me teary-eyed in a few scenes, he dug deep and showed that he can play a dramatic role when he needs to. The action scene were great; it'll have you at the edge of your seat because, y'know, it's a Bad Boys film and the camera work in the 3rd act was amazing. This film will have you laughing, crying, angry, and there are some ""OH CRAP"" moments in there as well. It also builds towards an expansion of the franchise, which I'm all the way here for. I'm definitely going to be watching this film a few more times and will have a pre-order for the Blu-ray as soon as it becomes available. It's my favorite trilogy along with John Wick...Buy your tickets ASAP!!!",Bad Boys for Life
479,some-like-it-hot,"It made me laugh, but NOT in a good way.",2,22 January 2020,"I was honestly surprised they managed to screw up this movie. It's almost like everyone agreed from the start not to put any effort in and 'just go with it'. There were tons and tons of great opportunities here, especially considering the large time gap between all the movies. Instead, they decided to use the same old recipe, not for old time sake, but for money and greed sake. This is a sad depiction of the superficial movie creators (and watchers) that this movie tends to attract. No creative people, but wallets and smart investors. It's a good thing from time to time I see people making great films these days, otherwise I would get seriously depressed. If there is any hope, it certainly doesn't apply to the crew and production of this movie right here. Thank you for destroying a legacy, a nostalgia your own credibility...",Bad Boys for Life

It's probably a marketing departement at Sony positively influencing the ratings, but I don't buy it.Now the movie. I like that they got the main cast together. It really brings back memories. Will Smith doesn't seem to age ever and Martin Lawrence can almost go for another Big Momma film. Where has he been ever since? I figure it took as much effort to get Martin Lawrence to play in this movie, as it did with his character to go on the hunt with Mike.The first half of the movie is kinda boring, so we left the other half for the next day. Marcus got old and boring, Mike is still Mike and Vanessa Hudgens is pulling fashion show because there have to be more women in movies. And for the record: I'm not against women in movies, but I'm afraid this forced craziness will eventually turn James Bond into a Jane.The second half brings more action, with a high dose of comedy of course.The whole AMMO team plus the bad guy and his mother, in combination with the storyline, turned this movie into a poorly produced B-action movie from the early 00's. And thus my overall verdict is that this was just okay to watch, but they could've done it so much better...",Bad Boys for Life

Also, the twist.What I wanted: I really really hoped there would be a scene when Will and Martin get in the car and drive off into the sunset to do some cool stuff while Diddy's Bad Boy 4 Life song plays on the background.

The action scenes were good but not as good as the previous 2. The story was very much predictable and the Joker were really bad and poor. They should have let Michael bay made this one too. Michael bay knows his stuff,Bad Boys for Life
491,misfitone38,Bad Boys Derailed,4,2 February 2020,"I never thought I would say this...but I wish Michael Bay had directed this. Maybe the earlier entries hold something dear to his heart and he wouldn't have allowed this to go off the rails.The biggest casualty is the riffing between the Lawrence and Smith, which practically rips the soul right out of the franchise. The laughs from the first two movies came from the strong chemistry between the two leads and how they could argue in the middle of gun fights, car chases, etc. Here they just sound like an old married couple who have grown tired of each other.The other casualty is the action scenes. The great Sam Peckinpah once said of the violence in his films that he wanted the audience to feel the impact of getting shot. Modern day use of CGI and such does the exact opposite. It feels more like you're watching somebody else play a video game. While some praise the visuals, I criticize its effect of pushing the viewer further away rather than drawing them in.This could have been like Lethal Weapon IV and had some fun with its theme of the loose cannon dealing with aging. Instead its more like Beverly Hills Cop III and becomes a sad entry in an otherwise solid franchise.",Bad Boys for Life

503,astrostar-18501,Thought it would be better than it was,5,14 February 2020,"Firstly, don't be suckered in by all the 9 and 10 star reviews, as far as I'm concerned, those kind of reviews smell of shill posts to me. Those kind of ratings should be reserved for the classics, the kind of movies that linger in your mind long after the movie has ended. This movie is SO far removed from that, it's not even on the same planet. My suspicion should have been aroused when I read so many over the top positive reviews with such stratospheric ratings, but I got suckered in, like I suspect a lot of people did. I've learned my lesson. Was it a waste of time and money? Yes and no. There were some genuinely funny scenes, no spoilers, but I did have to smile at some of the scenes, counterbalanced by a plethora of shortcomings. Where to start. How about implausible plot points. Warning, some minor spoilers ahead. Will Smith's character infiltrates a Mexican drug cartel. Yes, a black man in a Mexican drug cartel, he blends in inconspicuously we are to presume, because those stupid Mexicans don't notice he is black I suppose. Secondly, Will Smith's character is shot three times in the torso, at close range, with a high powered gun and miraculously survives. The odds of dying when shot in the torso with a high powered bullet are over 90%, that's with one bullet, add a few more and that percentage only goes up, even if by some miracle, no vital organs are hit, blood loss alone will see you dead before any ambulance can reach you, but the angels were smiling on Smith that day, he lives and recovers so quickly, he is out on the street busting bad guys in no time, like he was never shot at all! No, months of recovery and rehab are for ordinary suckers, not supermen like Will Smith. At the start of the movie, we see the pair racing through Miami streets at high speed, including driving through the sand at a beach, at speed, when there are people on the beach. Never mind the risk to the public of being hit by such a car, which, if even no one was hit, would likely be bogged in the sand immediately once the car hit the sand, but such departures from reality are commonplace in this movie. I could go on, but others have explained the plot weaknesses better than me, so no point repeating them. The other thing wrong with this movie is the pedestrian script and the pedestrian delivery of those lines by the actors. At times, I felt like I was watching a low budget movie with B-grade actors reading a script for the first time in their lives. No, I was watching a high budget movie, with mostly B-grade actors reading a C-grade script and a couple of big Hollywood stars to add some sheen. The number of back flips the producers seem to have done to accommodate a VERY overweight, unfit Martin Lawrence for this role, must be immense, such as trying to cover up Martin being SO unfit, he couldn't run a five minute race without stopping and panting for breath every few steps, so it required multiple small takes to give the impression it was one continuous take. Martin has put on so much weight, his face looks a bit like a squirrel with it's cheeks stuffed full of acorns. He really is too old to play the role of the dashing crime fighter, chasing crooks down city streets. The visual effects were overdone as well. Ever notice a trend with Hollywood these days, the over use of whizz bang special effects to cover up a weak script? Sorry, it doesn't work. The movie is quite slow up to the half way mark, but the action does pick up in the second half, so I'll give it credit it for that. Overall, a disappointing third installment in what was a pretty good series up until now. I'll give it a five out of ten for the few times it elicited a smile out of me, but I'm being generous.",Bad Boys for Life

The worst was when Martin Lawrence's character falls off a ledge at a hotel but you have no idea how because of all the cuts. Did they even try? This feels like a cash grab.

Smith and Lawrence are great in this movie!! But the two best things about this third movie is the script and the directors, first this script is better than the two first movie combined!! Is personal and really take this characters in a actual arc trought the movie.

This movie put the story first! Yes, the explosions are there, the action are there, the cars chasings, but you understand everything! Its not a mess like in bay's movies.

520,npcbiz,Dull movie relying on violence and vulgarity to get by,3,16 January 2020,"Released today in Australia (for commentators hung up on US release dates)A simple revenge plot driven movie relying on graphic violence to float your boat and over scripted vulgarity lacking in delivery. If you get off on a steady stream of head shots, throats being cut (which covers the first 20 minutes or so), then this is probably one for you, plenty more tired death scenes to follow to keep you entertained)If you are looking for something a little more entertaining than this phoned in xerox of a movie, look elsewhere.The buddy buddy action doesn't really pick up until an hour and a quarter into the movie and seriously couldn't care less about someone gunning for Mike or his midlife crisis to live up to his reputation.",Bad Boys for Life

Great almost realistic pursuit Action (in contrast to Fast&Furious), nice Buddy chemistry and.... very Big Surprise... a decent storyline! Wow... and i can't remember When i Heard a Cinema Audience spending big hands to the ending credits the Last time... very well done!",Bad Boys for Life
523,jafhate,Watcha gonna do when they come for you?,10,1 February 2020,"Honestly, I haven't heard any news about the sequel as well as of any expectations of a new bad boys movie since the hiatus. When this movie came out, I watched it with zero expectations and trailer free. Boy oh boy was I really in a ride of excitement. Surprisingly, this third instalment is the best among its predecessor! Truly filled with action and comedy mostly which makes me for the first time giggled and shaking vigorously on the cinema seat. Damn this bad boys are funny as hell especially the 2 duo. Truly recommended and hoping for a sequel ahem the 4th instalment.",Bad Boys for Life

526,anthony-j-tota,After all these years,10,10 February 2020,"Is it me or do Will and Martin have even more chemistry, charisma and energy in this installment than any of the others?? It was a very refreshing feeling for a sequel.There are some great jokes, amazing action and some pretty deep moments. Not what I was expecting, but better than what I was expecting. They really pulled it off quite well.If you haven't seen any of the others movies, fear not. This is also great as a stand alone adventure for these characters.Overall, I was beyond satisfied and very surprised by how good the story was, how well the movie was made and how much love went into the characters. I highly recommend this film.",Bad Boys for Life
527,unwhosearmy,All about the money,4,10 April 2020,"I did not like the first 2...but somehow they pulled a rabbit our of the hat!
A dead one.
I watched the first 2, back in the day, on DVD, when there were no other new releases to watch. Sadly, somehow, this is not even on a par with those. I really like Will Smith. But..he does not need the money and I never took him for one for the attention. Clearly, I was wrong. Nothing to say about the film, because there is nothing to it. If you are going to spend 50-100 million on a film, can you at least spend $500 on the script?
Embarrassing. I originally gave this movie a 5, because I like Will Smith and because for some reason this became a trilogy...and I would be a hypocrite, since I have now seen all 3.
Hope we can officially call them Bad Movies. Even Inner Circle deserve better. Thought COPS was bad enough. What are you going to do when they name another movie-thing after you?
Inner Circle and cinema audiences, the real victims. Shame this movie did not come out a few months later, when the world ended up in lockdown.
To stay true to the move, I will not even be bother writing a proper review for this.",Bad Boys for Life
528,howarsmith,Oh dear,1,5 May 2020,"Why shoot Will Smith ten minutes in, then have him get better ten minutes and 3 seconds in and make the worst wedding toast ever. How do the people at the wedding know that the toast is bad boys for life ? Did they watch the movies ? Were the guests in the wedding in the car when the bad boys were doing there thing ? Did Will Smith walk around every single social gathering and tell everyone that was, you know, their phrase ? Did they guess ? Why didn't they point out that they were not riding nor were they boys and they they didn't want to be reminded of dying just now ? Why didn't someone tell Lawrence he wasn't allowed in the police anymore since he could barely breath ? Why is there no action in this movie ? Just why ?",Bad Boys for Life
529,dekoninck_pieter,El Arbi and Fallah become notorious world wide,9,23 January 2020,"This movie was excellent. I liked the story. Lawrence and Smith had no trouble finding their natural chemistry again, like they had in Bad Boys 1 and 2 as well. You could notice that Michael Bay was off and El Arbi and Fallah on.
I missed a moment were Burnett and Lowrey encouraged each other verbally around bad guys and then reach for their guns (BB1: ""It's for your lack of respect for other people's property). I also missed some experimental camera work (BB 2: ""A bullet in the head will really mess up your extensions"").
I enjoyed what the AMMO team brought to the table. This could have been worked out a lot better, I think. Hopefully they do that in Bad Boys 4. Hudgens, Ludwig and Melton did a great job, bringing their own humour and style.
There were some references to the other movies, but there could have been more. I really hope there will be a next installment with the same directors, and that El Arbi and Fallah will have a very rich career ahead of them.
If you liked this movie, then check out Gangsta, El Arbi's and Fallah's film before this one.",Bad Boys for Life
530,Garrett_Thorne,Bad Boys for Life Review,7,22 January 2020,"Bad Boys for life is the 3rd movie of the franchise staring Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. Going into the movie I wasn't expecting it to be very good but I was surprised! I was expecting a film along the quality of a former January action film release the ""Ride Along"" franchise (which I don't particularly like) but I really enjoyed this movie! Martin Lawrence does a great job in the film. He adds the perfect amount of comedic relief. A personal complaint in the film is I feel like the plot often reveals things or takes jumps that don't really work with me or that feel unearned, and that can affect the story and flow of the film. But the self awareness of the movie makers makes up for that and makes this a very viable January release!",Bad Boys for Life
531,dosehiwiza,Long and boring,1,1 May 2020,"Aaah man I had high hopes, I love Will Smith, but not like that.Well it was boring, too long and the forced banter between the 2 cops was hard to bear, like seriously.

533,rudy-12826,Watchable but nothing more,6,24 September 2021,Huge fan of franchise but still I have grudges. It looks to me Will is not for action roles no more. I'm not convinced by his acting. Comedy is something he is excellent. I just can't see the flare like in his early roles. Alltho in Concussion he was the best. Martin is the same. I agree Michael Bay should directed this. Something was left in the air with this sequel.,Bad Boys for Life
534,grainonbeach,Bad: Forced and Contrived,4,13 May 2020,"I was extremely disappointed with this movie. Nearly everything in this movie seemed forced and contrived, especially the attempts at jokes and humor, which didn't make me laugh in most cases. I was expecting a better movie based on the IMDB score, but this movie is much worse in my opinion. If it were rated 5, I would not have been disappointed because I would have known beforehand not to expect too much. This movie left a really bad taste in my mouth, and I wish I hadn't wasted my time watching it.",Bad Boys for Life

537,JohnPaulG07,This Franchise Has Struck Again,10,19 February 2020,"Wow, I am really impressed at how this movie turned out. I remember when Bad Boys 2 came out and having a friend who's father did some stunt driving for the film. I am not sure if he was involved in the sequel Bad Boys For Life but it doesn't matter because the film rocked anyway. I managed to see this movie a day before it released (Thursday night instead of Friday) and BOY was I impressed. Action, gritty violence, intrigue, and a villain that you could really sink your teeth into. The plot was intricate enough that you could really feel the suspense that was pulsing through the characters hearts as the events progressed. I felt like the film dealt with topics that pertained to life as we see it today rather than 2003 when the previous film was released. This is awesome because the way we view life is so much different from then! Both Lawrence and Smith have grown into their roles over the years. It is obvious that these characters are far from dead and can be resurrected and played virtually instantaneously. I really recommend that anyone who has managed to stay out of the ""crossfire"" pick up their ""gun"" and go see this film tonight!",Bad Boys for Life

Like Armageddon or so... or Midway.But this? This was just horrible. Honestly, the first hour was promising. Great filming, not so bad acting, and quite some well made action sequences.But then something weird happened, exactly after one hour. It was as if the whole movie changed at 60 mins. Another director, new producer, new script and .............. no more fx budget.It was just SO weird. We were entertained, had a great night and than.......uhm, yeah what? I can hardly explain how much the 2nd hour differs from the first. Its pathetic and mindblowing.Normaly I would say do NOT watch this, given it a 1.

There are too many scenes taken from old Hindi movies but badly done. Clearly the directors, Adil and Bilal have been influenced by Bollywood but they need to know that just copying scenes is not enough , they have to work in the screenplay and make it their own.

They brought back Marcus' family to reel in fans of the first two but it fell short with no cohesiveness to the overall story. Instead of having the squad help him avenge Cap's death, Lowry got some special dept feds, please. It would've been great to see the same cops from the BB2 to assist.

Basically the entire movie he is a whiny baby constantly complaining about violence, retirement, being at peace, etc...

Even in a packed theater on Saturday night there were maybe 10 times that got chuckles and only 2 or 3 solid laughs.Apart from a few highlights scattered throughout even the action scenes were dull.It's been ages since I considered walking out of a movie, and I would have if anything else was still playing in the cineplex I saw it, but unfortunately it was a late show so I stuck it out.As a counterpoint, one of the two girls I took to the movie enjoyed it, the other hated it even more than I did.

Become older didnt really make their both lose as the main Charm of this third movie. Maybe the only thing I missed is Michael Bay fetish of destruction that truly made the Bad Boys 1 & 2.Plus:
Will Smith & Martin Lawrence chemistry is still good. Not powerful as 2 bad boys before but still fun than nowadays buddy cop movies.The story about being old, worry about future, moving on, and revelation of Mike Lowrey son is truly fresh. Bad Boys never had a villain so meaningful and some situation like how Marcus cared about Mike and praying to god everyday hit me good. Continuity also suprising, almost every event in Bad Boys 1 & 2 still mentioned plus Reggie return.Comedy is still on point. Marcus out of shape truly works around jokes and the story. Their bickering in car, interrogation, bickering on bike, especially the plane scene is gold.The Villain have backstory and look menacing is good. Never realised they missed this from 2 movies before. I feel sad to Alejandro and La Bruja.Minus:
Some story is questionable and bad. I didnt really feel the AMMO squad truly needed, its good seeing those youngster tactics, gadgets, etc. But they dont really have personality that i cared about. Also i feel martin absence (after his daugther wedding until He fot called in the middle of telenovela) filled with bland story. Captain death also kinda bummer especially the 4th movie is announced, hes around from bad boys 1-3, he should be essential too. Yeah give him the shot but dont kill him.The Action scene is good but underwhelming from 2 past movies. Not enough destruction, not enough gun blazing, not enough explosion. This is why I miss michael bay...Bad CGI, noticed from gunshot wound of Will Smith body, (forgot his name) fall to top of Marcus Nissan plus no reaction from crowd at all, choppers down, and Will face tried to be burned with fire that should not be showed, this one is really bad.The miami filter is too much at certain scene. Like the opening i prefer it look more natural light to see how bad boys Miami world truly feel, the filter just making it looks like in desert or green screen, idk really annoying.Yes those bad 10/10 reviews is annoying.

581,Yizahi,Typical average cop+family action movie,6,24 January 2020,"Everything in this movie is average - completely unrelated to the plot first chase scene with canned humor and typical roles. Police scenes which are noticeably unrealistic and cut short. Shooting is decent but explosions go so over the top that it is annoying. Generic family storyline and by the time main heroes go over the same cringy script the third time you will hate it. Whole movie is basically a mish-mash of generic action movie tropes, half of which are done badly. You can enjoy movie as-is, but it is no masterpiece, far from it.",Bad Boys for Life

584,gordongeordie,Only for those who have never seen an action movie,4,31 January 2020,If you've never seen an action movie before then maybe you'll get something out of this. Otherwise it's just a boring rehash of everything that's gone before. For a film that is supposed to revolve around the chemistry of the two leads it fails dramatically. Did Will Smith do it as a favour to a less famous mate who needs a career lift? The jokes fall way wide of the mark as they are so predictable and the twist is ludicrous. Clearly there will be more to come but include me out.,Bad Boys for Life

IT'S OVER!!!.... AND NAUSEATING!!!
ENOUGH!!!!
Sorry, but someone had to SHOUT IT!!!!
And now the review!!!
First time feature film directors have made a HORRIBLE movie!!!
There isn't room to go into how many levels this movie FAILS on!!!... however, for you eternal optimists, I'll list a few.
1. Unrealistic and I mean WHOLLY unbelievable storyline!!!
2. Sub-par script.... Absolutely failed to coax ANY humor out of the ""Dynamic Duo"".... Truly... It's EMBARRASSINGLY BAD!!!
3. Uninspired acting.... Martin Lawrence looks and acts like he's late for bed or has just woken, but hasn't had his morning cup of ""joe"" yet!!!... Will Smith looks as though he's about to collapse... Everyone else just acts like they're under the influence of large doses of cough syrup!!!
4. Amateurish scene designs!!!.... The scenes come off looking like a television with the contrast setting cranked all the way up.... the brights are blinding and the darks are black... Very annoying!!!.... However, not nearly as bothersome as the overuse of colored lightening and this strange haze that seems to permeate most action sequences!!!.... Why is there pink powder exploding in an automotive repair shop???
Oh heck.... I mean... ETC. ETC. ETC. ... IT JUST GOES ON AND ON AND ON..... DON'T BELIEVE THE ""10"" REVIEWS!!!
Y'all are smart enough to know those are used to BOO$T a rating for commercial proposes and are BOGU$.... RIGHT???
Okay then.... TRUTH???... When the hype is over and the receipts are counted, this movie will be declared a flop!!!.... and RIGHTLY so!!!!
Hollywood is on a losing streak like I've never seen before.... C'MON GUYS!!!.. ONE GOOD MOVIE... PLEASE!!!!",Bad Boys for Life

They try to make this movie dramatic and forgot about one thing...fun. this is supposed to be an action comedy. Barely any comedy and the action is so dark. You just don't simply care about the characters. And it drags on and on and on. My gosh. Anyone who gave it more than four stars...

The acting of Will Smith and Martin Lawrence is always a joy to watch!It was full of comedic moments and the action scenes were great too. The storyline in this Bad Boys movie was better than the other two. I was quite impressed by the cinematography in this movie too and the multiple plot twists that made the movie even better.I'm going to give this movie an 8/10, it is worth watching, and it was enjoyable the whole way through!",Bad Boys for Life

606,scifighters-57738,What Was that!,3,1 May 2020,"The First one was great, I enjoyed the second one also even though it had it's flaws. But this man what was this...You know the biggest complaint most people had about the second one was what a whiner they turned Martin Lawrence into, so what did they do in this one they made him an even worse whiner (I really did not think that was possible). Lawrence was so whiny he was just annoying and any chemistry he and Smith had in the first 2 is completely gone.The directors also never heard of these guys but did anyone else notice they were just rippin off Michael Bay. Trying to do his style and failing at it terribly. Not to mention the story line just plain stunk, I am not sure who wrote this but wow it was sure a poor script.Save yourselves if you enjoyed the first 2 don't sully them by watching this one.",Bad Boys for Life

608,windozze,not good,1,11 April 2020,This movie was not even mildly entertaining. martin lawrence character was dull and irritating and for most of the movie he was making face grimace like he was constipated on a toilet. his whole character is portrayed like he doesn't want to be bad boys or risk taking cop. the first hour nothing happen noteworthy and actually both lawrence and smith felt uncomfortable in their roles due to their old age. it lacked the spark and charisma and the story was a bunch of nothing throughout. it was very superficial and disappointing movie,Bad Boys for Life

I'm glad we still get movies like this from time to time, not everything needs to be a gigantic money making superhero movie.
It's room for others too, with all the comic book movies these days, this felt fresh.The story is solid, acting was exellent and the humor was spot on, very funny.As soon as Smith & Lawrence was back together on the big screen i felt like... home.
It was really good to see them together again.
The chemistry between them are truly amazing.They are exactly like we used to know them, just a bit older and wiser.We had a blast with this film, everyone in the theater was laughing and clapping.Welcome back, Martin.

619,johnnydangelo000,Bad Boys For Life Review,4,19 January 2020,"Luke I am Your Father. Seriously. They may as well have just scripted that line. The filmmakers were painfully aware that they were ripping the father/son plot from Star Wars. It's just baffling that a 100 million dollar film can't come up with a better ending. I was waiting for Will Smith to say that line but I guess it would've been too much plagiarism.The directing and music were good though. The comedy landed here and there. I was impressed 90 minutes in but, as stated above, the so-called ""twist"" was just painful and cringeworthy.Go see 1917, Uncut Gems, or Little Women instead. You'll thank me one day.",Bad Boys for Life

638,mail-95391,It's a bad Bad Boys movie.,5,29 April 2020,"Quite a lot happens during the first 20 minutes of bad boys three: Bad Boys for life. There's a car chase, the birth of his first grandchild, his friend is shot in a drive by, his friends in a coma. Several other major important characters such as district attorneys, forensic agents, basically everyone that worked on a certain case is suddenly murdered by sniper in plain sight, mostly in daytime. Marcus has a religious awakening, makes promises to God, and there's even more if you keep watching the movie and you haven't turned it off yet.There's even a character that comes back from the dead. And another character who dies. That's sad, necessitating an entire funeral scene.So just to recap. Bad Boys three: bad boys for life contains the birth of a grandchild, a wedding, a funeral, a drive by shooting, aman in a coma. It's got everything. They even say the name of the movie, multiple times. I'd say at least three times. Is it a good movie? No. Bad Boys for life is probably the worst Bad Boyd movie that I've ever seen.Unlike the other Bad Boys movies, it fails to capture the fun exciting and musical life of being a police officer in Miami. It doesn't have any of the fun that you'd expect from a Lethal Weapon movie. The camaraderie, the buddy cops, the hilarious supporting characters? No they've replaced all that, with a slightly heavy Martin Lawrence, and a series of over the hill plot ideas. Clearly this is the bad boys in Lethal Weapon terms: they're too old for this crap. Will Smith is dying his beard. Martin Lawrence wants to retire, has a grandchild. There's no time for fun. There's not even any flirting with Tea Leoni or anyone like that. There's a bit of a love interest for Will Smith, but that's not really developed off screen. There's a strange, former love interest in a bizarre backstory that you wouldn't believe is true if I told you. Sure, if you've seen Empire Strikes Back, you already know that.It's a bad movie. I'm not sure if they made any good movies in 2020, but I'm going to continue to watching them because I've got a good chance of watching them all.Bad Boys three was a bad movie, but it's not as bad as birds of prey. I'm not sure you should watch it. But you could do worse. Thanks for reading this review, I hope you enjoyed it.",Bad Boys for Life
639,LTex,This movie stinks beyond comprehension,3,14 November 2020,"How did this happen?The cast contains several talented actors. Everyone knows that these people can act. So how did this group of people make a movie that would put almost any living, breathing, thinking adult into a deep sleep before the halfway mark?This movie lacked all the dynamics of the prevoius two movies (both of which I enjoyed very much). I don't remember anything funny at all. That's right, not a single thing.Honestly, the impression I got is that the movie was filmed in one take and there was virtually no editing. And most of the actors didn't rehearse until 30 minutes before the filming started.How did this happen? I have no idea, but the movie sucks.

651,eamirsaleh,Bad Boys fans don't even bother,3,12 April 2020,"I loved the original Bad Boys. It was a modern twist on the age-old Cops vs Drugs story. Cool, fun, and funny; it' a playbook that works. Bad Boys II is a repeat of the same thing. Drug war while being cool, fun, and funny. Also a great watch.
I have really been dying for this movie to be made and to be released, and it SHOULD HAVE BEEN the same playbook, instead it went in a completely different direction.
This new movie made NO sense at all. Action was okay, but the plot was sooo stupid. It is just so hard for me to even believe the plot; even if I try to believe it, it is just so stupid and childish.
I was only happy to see that they brought back so much of the original cast but I realized they only did this for show. Overall stupid and they have set this movie up for future, additional stupidity for a potential Bad Boys IV.Btw, it's fake reviews that gave this movie such a strong rating.",Bad Boys for Life

657,melissacarvell-45535,Why all the hate?,7,20 April 2020,"This film to me showed the most growth. It was an honest portrayal of the years that have gone by and where these cops would be now. In my opinion it was both Will and Martin's best performances out of all 3 movies because it was the first time we got to see some range from each of them.
I was really shocked that they killed off a long standing, main character of sorts so very entertaining.
The addition of the tech team makes sense as alot of crime elements have gone this way. Ivr read some comments about this being a feminist move but that's the biggest load of bull I've read. The team consists of 2 males and 2 females, all of which are skilled in their own area and act them very well.
The only reason I can see for people hating on this is that they have 'grown up' with the films and can't accept that they themselves haven't aged thus the characters couldn't have either. If they had they would find the main characters embracing the lose of eye sight etc as a hilarious anidote to that.",Bad Boys for Life

Mike and Marcus duo are back and better (and funnier) than ever beforeNew directors Adil & Bilall have definitely stepped up to the plate after the phenomenal Michael BayActionThrillerComedyAwesome soundtrack, and much much moreThis movie is just over 2 hours long and you know it is a good movie when the time passes by and you are stunned thinking ""can I have more?"". The plot wasn't exactly great but this is my being overcritical; it was good enough to carry the film over but with powerful performance from Will Smith and Martin Lawrence you know they will steal the show. This is not to discount the supporting new cast, and some old, to which they all helped to build this into a near perfect film.The narrative continues pretty much from where we left off from BB2 but the story and the cast have gotten older and wise (ummmm!) and sillier. For me the standout performance was MARCUS (Martin Lawrence), I am not sure what wavelength this guy was on but boy did he put the BAD in Bad Boys for Life.10/10 go in and enjoy this film :)",Bad Boys for Life

681,brianp-47-339568,Excellent... Action Packed and Funny Addition to the series...,8,28 March 2020,"Will Smith (Looking 10 years younger than is actual age) & Martin Lawrence (Looking his age plus the answer to the question: Who ate all the Pies?) - are remarkably good in this revisit to the 'rogue cop' genre of the 80s' & early 90s'.
Kate del Castillo - an excellent actress, appears only briefly (what a waste of talent) - and yet she still manages to create a detailed presence with the few lines and scenes given her.
Jacob Scipio - (Kate del Castillo characters son in the film) - does an excellent job of portraying the familial loyal son with doubts. Unfortunately, the writers couldn't be bothered portraying him with any kind of real personality, regular speech patterns or wit (shame on them).
I could go on, about how good the actors and actresses are in this film... but I'd far exceed my submission length here... so, I'm going to try and sum in up in a few sentences.
The movie is about the original 'Bad Boys' - but it should NOT have centred itself (almost in its entirety) upon them.
A man/woman who has enough hatred to kill you, is NOT - by definition - a bit part! - They must have a reason, unless you're dealing with a complete sociopath (in which case, there is still a reason!) - and that reason shouldn't appear in the last 2 minutes of any Movie or the last 5 pages of any book!With all of the above in mind - the entire casting effort was excellent - great actors and actresses who were under used in soooo many instances - but still excellent.",Bad Boys for Life
682,c-murray631,10/10's!!?? What the heck is going on here!?,1,30 March 2020,"I feel compelled to add my two cents to this review section, as it appears to be plagued with bot reviewers giving this rather terrible movie 10/10 ratings. Have a look through the review section, there are just waves and waves of 10/10 reviews with identical ""users found this helpful numbers"", which I think have been balanced out by actual people down-voting them (good on you).This movie somehow manages to be a blemish on the strictly average, but good in a b-grade movie sort of a way, legacy of the Bad Boys franchise. The first movie was okay, the second embraced its silliness completely and in my opinion, while very crass and low-brow at times, is very entertaining and re-watchable. The action sequences are unique and without having watched it in years I still remember the ""Reggie"" scene, the shootout with the Haitian(?) gangsters through the wall, Marcus getting shot  the mortuary scene, the big shootout at the end and many other things. Bad Boys two also felt like a more comprehensively planned out movie and was as tonally consistent as it could be.Bad Boys For Life is terrible, Smith and Lawrences characters have become incredibly cliche parodies of their former selves, which was already a pretty cliche buddy-cop dynamic. There are some awful narratives propagating through this movie, with Marcus being an even bigger wuss than ever and Mike being an even bigger moron than ever. All the new characters are laughably one-dimensional and make for some pretty painful dialogue and moments. Most of the action is not even laughably bad or ridiculous, its almost sad how bad or stupid some of the action sequences were. One particular moment that made me question what I was seeing was when Will Smith slid along the ground on a mechanic's creeper (skateboard thing) while spray paint cans explode behind him, it looked so clunky, almost as if they couldn't be bothered trying a few takes with it.Apologies for the rather poorly formatted rant, but to be honest this review is kind of befitting of the movie that it regards. Bad Boys For Life was a bafflingly poor and disappointing entry into this franchise. I'm all for dumb action-comedies, but this movie is weighted heavily towards the ""dumb"" side with the ""comedy"" and ""action"" aspects looking rather malnutritioned by comparison. I actually don't know how Will Smith and Martin Lawrence were okay with this script and the final product, but I suppose neither actor has actually been very good at picking roles or signing off on good movies. Hopefully this review provides a bit more of a perspective on the movie than all the ""10/10 The Bad Boys are Back, this actor/actress is good, the comedy/action/emotion gripped me by the nipples, you wont be disappointed, best movie I have seen in 2020"" reviews that are plaguing the Bad Boys For Life IMDB review section.",Bad Boys for Life

688,joshuapiasky,"Not about the boys, all about will",1,22 April 2020,"Bad boys for life. Well that's no much longer guys.It felt like a late 80's or early 90's movie. That would be okay if it was done with style but it didn't have that either. It was formulaic and generic. It makes sense due to the fact the movie lost every talented director and resorted to par talent and studio knowledge.
The plot was weak. It felt needless. The only thing I can say in the positive is that the pacing was constant. However the fact that the plot was weak, the core was generic, whatever the pace did for the movie, it was lost due to multiple eye rolls. Many pillars were used to hold this movie up that were very unnecessary to the plot. There is no weight or urgency. And when a plot is established, a power ranger like entity is introduced to establish needless variety and unrealistic content. Sexy swat. Asian Justin timberlake, Viking, no axe and venessa judgement packing heat.
The old movies were corny action, but it was stylish and grounded in the creative teams vision for the movie. It was hip and current. Ya it still had generic plots but it was carried by style, humour, action and none of it felt forced and the chemistry was relevant. This time the directors felt foreign to the material besides being a action movie and will smith being the lead. They leaned heavily on will smith and his Brody, gangsta attitude didn't quite fit with his age and felt forced compared to the originals. The movie was always about the boys. I did like the times Lawrence shined. But those are very few and far between. Instead the director made a plot that centered heavy on will.
I am not a fan of Bay. But that's not to say he knows his stuff. When it comes to in your face style and entertainment, Color and sound that melts your senses, a few cut and pasted scenes (hahaha), he's good at what he does. So I hope he does do a bad boys 4 and they aim more towards a lethal weapon 4 vibe.",Bad Boys for Life

690,sapetterson,Decent action movie with good humour and over the top characters,9,3 April 2020,"I agree with some reviewers that the plot seemed predictable at half of the film, but the setup was entertaining and the last third was not what I had expected and had me at the edge of my seat at times.The humour is top notch, the color grading was beautiful too and I liked the inlays of modern technology - like for example using a real mavic 2 pro as ""magic spy drone"" instead of some CGI thing. The hacking was a bit unrealistically quick but still doable. Also, some elements would be stupid in real world but are still in the movie to intimidate the viewer and visually tell about the characters, but in a movie it's ok IMO.Regarding the negative reviews; I think there's something different in this movie that comes from Will as he ages and spiritually matures, he seeks an alternative to violence and tries to incorporate that into violent action movies (spies in disguise is a prime example). This is what irritates some people, because it should be a violent action movie after all - but it still is, and I think it is indeed brave and much needed to bring something new into the genre, and I like it. But if you wan't ""none of that peace talk"" or get excruciatingly annoyed when people try to stay non-violent this movie maybe isn't for you.",Bad Boys for Life
691,oznoz,Did Martin Lawrence have a stroke?,5,22 December 2020,"Now it's been a while, but the first two Bad Boys movies were big, fast, dumb fun. I rewatched them both before this and while a bit dated, they'e still all that. This instalment even plays on that a little, with running in-jokes about getting older between Mike and Marcus. They largely fall pretty flat, but they tried.
However, there's no hiding that Martin Lawrence is just bad here. 90% of his lines are delivered in a druggy slur, and his comedic timing is entirely absent. Since he's also clearly not an action star, that makes him a massive liability, and he drags everyone else down around him.
Will Smith can't really carry it and the AMMO team are interesting enough, but the baddie's best moments are spent in their respective first 2 min on-screen, and there's a lot of dead air in-between those scenes and the finale while we talk about non-story, family, filler stuff.
It's okay. Lefty lawyers will hate it - there's a lot of disregard for the law and collateral damage including what must be dozens of civilian fatalities during a chase scene - but it's still mostly dumb fun. It's not nearly as big or especially as fast as it should be, but it's still okay.",Bad Boys for Life

Its gives you all the comedic action your accustomed to in the opening minutes and doesnt stop there. You can see early on that while the same, Mike and Marcus have aged physically and mentally from the last installment. They dont try to hide it either. They play off one another and their age. Compared to the other two movies though, this one has a more personal feel to it from start to finish. It does have its typical ""young cop vs old cop"" banter with some of the actors/actresses but it just works and they blend with this ""world"" well together. I for one think it was very well filmed, edited, and scored. For the most part it doesnt have too many over the top action sequences that make you roll your eyes due to unbelievablity.

The end action sequence especially is fun.Now to my issues. It lies in the story. And there are spoilers from here... Mike's son. The main bad guy who killed a lot of people including someone from previous films. He is kind of given a redemption moment where he says ""no innocents"" yet has killed people who have done his mother and deceased ""father"" wrong. They even him him help save Marcus at the end. This shouldn't happen. The guy killed a tone of people in the name of revenge. And the ending in which Mike approaches his maximum security cell and offers time off his sentence had me turn the film off immediately and walk away. If they continue with this series and shoehorn mike's son as a ""bad boy"" into the future installments I will pass. That one moment has almost ruined the entire series for me.",Bad Boys for Life

719,pilkjam,Really poor and odd,1,24 June 2020,I have never written a review before but I just felt I had to. I don't get this film at all as It has no similarities like the first 2 whatsoever (apart from the obvious). It is a completely random film given the name of bad boys for life - yeah whatever - with the same 2 actors. Dreadful story choice that doesn't live up to the film name or origins of the previous movies. Very disappointed.,Bad Boys for Life

721,spacey_kevin,Probably the worst in the series,5,7 March 2020,"I never would have thought, walking into this film, that I'd think that Bad Boys 2 could be better.I think that with a lot of revisited franchises the studios (or actors or writers) are trying to pass the baton to the next generation: we are in an era of remakes and 'passing the baton'. It seems like the Marvel, Disney, and Fast and the Furious movie model studios lean on to sell movie tickets is used here too; this movie wasn't able to escape that.I suspect that the next Bad Boys installment will see the exit of Mike and Marcus and the newer actors take over to lead the series, perhaps with spinoffs or carrying the story in a television format. In the description for this movie it says that 'Marcus and Mike team up for one last ride', and that theme is present throughout the movie. Here's an idea: can't a franchise end and new stories be made without the baton handover? Just end Bad Boys.It's clear to me that the two new directors were chosen on this film to direct a movie where the two lead actors hand over the reigns to a younger crowd. It makes sense - the studio wasn't going to give movie directors free reign over a blockbuster title. They were there to craft a transitional movie, or Jerry B. would have directed.I thought the writing was weak, and the story-line predictable. The opening is so outrageous it's laughable (police officers would never cause such mayhem to get to a hospital, in an unmarked car, putting the lives of citizens at such risk). In the first and second movie they were careful about shootouts and chases, wherever possible. Also, the writers and directors seem to have forgotten about the money the antagonists said was out there when the mother and son team was reunited. It was mentioned once and then dropped. It seemed like Will and Martin were strained to be in their roles and too much time may have passed for them since they last started in these roles.The movie seemed to be a mix of Hawaii-Five-0 and the Fast and the Furious. We know Will and Martin are getting older. We know they can't keep doing the same thing over and over again. Instead of making the two detectives at odds with the other team, perhaps the movie could have had the two leads using the new technology and embracing it as police forces do around the world. I now think Bad Boys should have ended with the second movie.",Bad Boys for Life

I recommend.",Bad Boys for Life
725,edwincervantes70,They're back and they're better than ever (literally).,8,29 March 2020,"Sequels for the past decade have been somewhat of a coin toss. Some prevailed (The Incredibles 2, Blade Runner 2049, Fast Five), others not so much (Taken 3, Terminator: Dark Fate). I had no illusions about Bad Boys for Life as Will Smith and Martin Lawrence undeniably have such good chemistry as Mike Lowry and Marcus Burnett respectively despite their outrageous movie plots.This movie takes place exactly 17 years after the second film was released in 2003. Mike and Marcus have obviously aged, but they don't ever skip a beat as they're still the outrageously crime-fighting duo they were more than a decade ago. Right away at the start of the film, Marcus and Mike ride through Miami in what appears to be another day on the job catching bad guys, only for us to realize Marcus is expecting his first grandson. It's a nice throwback to the first film when we meet them including the running gag of Marcus ruining Mike's car (by denting the door this time), and it also brought back most of the characters from previous films including Reggie who was undeniably a likeable character in the second film for being clumsy, yet good hearted.Elsewhere in a Mexican prison, we meet the main antagonist, Isabel Aretas who escapes with help from her son Armando. Aretas, unlike Fouchet or Johnny Tapia, is clearly a threat in this film due to her relentless manner and close affiliation to Mike Lowry. The movie wastes no time making this any clearer than when Armando shoots Lowry at the beginning and for a moment we see just how vulnerable Mike and Marcus are. Mike barely survives his gunshot wounds and Marcus finds himself in a tough position whether to remain in the police force or retire for good, ultimately choosing the later after what happened to Mike. Unlike the previous two films that had a lot of emphasis on jokes and action sequences, this movie balances drama, and comedy quite nicely.We see the aging duo facing somewhat of a midlife crisis as they come into conflict with younger, eccentric narcotic officers. Their wisecracks and jokes still bring plenty of humor. As for the action sequences, they neither distract from the main storyline nor try to substitute it for substance although Michael Bay's influence is till nicely prominent at times.What makes this movie exceptional is how it shows a great buddy cop story that couldn't quite nail in previous films. The stakes are raised a bit more as not only Mike almost loses his life, but certain characters die including Capt. Howard (who was played brilliantly charismatic by Joe Pantoliano), the duo become temporarily become estranged from the events of the film, and in a rare plot twist Mike realizes his attempted assassin is his own son he conceived with Aretas. In what was supposed to be the last installment in the Bad Boys movies, I was quite surprised it instead left room for another sequel rather than finish the series indefinitely. The ending was somewhat formulaic with Aretas dying, Mike making amends with Armando and the latter redeeming himself by saving Marcus and subsequently choosing to end his criminal path.Overall, this movie really went beyond what I expected to be another Bay ridden thrill ride and instead crafted the best buddy cop story in the film series. I'll still remain agnostic as to what future Bad Boys sequels can offer but I can say for certain this was their best film of the franchise.",Bad Boys for Life

So I started paying attention. I counted TWO white characters (named characters) and one dies! Even at the night club I saw a total of 2 possible whites. You have to seriously try to target in order to get such a skewed ratio. Another anti-white statement later in the movie and I was done. This was very simply another Bad Boys movie (just like the others) but with an anti-white agenda throughout. They of course had the ""women are the baddest-ass people that Hollyweird has been pushing as well.

And Vanessa Hudgens??? Who is she to photobomb or filmbomb my favourite TV shows and movies? Seriously, Vanessa as a black op? Oh, come on!
But you are right. These fellows weren't the worse part.
Imagine a completely useless Will Smith. A lifeless, pointless acting from his side. One of his worst acting.
And the lame, predictable and weak script. Oh man, why is it necessary to destroy all the sequels of good movies?
I also found the CGI (the green screen stuff) horrible. Something went horribly wrong with this movie.
And the assassin of innocent law men comes back as a hero soon in the 4th film. This is so sad. Hollywood is dead.",Bad Boys for Life

Not one decent actor in the movie so as not to overshadow the poor effort by Lawrence and Smith.
Mr Lawrence, can you please play the same role?
From Bad Boys 1?
No from all your movies.
Mr Smith, ""you're so old, the target audience for this movie had to google Bad Boys 1"" ...
This is a reboot or a remake at best for new generators as otherwise it is an insult to the original audience.
A mix of Fast and Furious mixed with Gemini Man mixed with The Expendables 3.Unless unless ... the movie was meant to reflect and emphasize the washed out concept and thus their over weight and sluggishness and reliance on a support unit.. be it in the movie or in real life.",Bad Boys for Life
798,coreyfazzle,Why?,3,22 April 2020,"When i heard they were releasing another bad boys i was so excited like most people as bad boys 1 & 2 are great films but this one....sorry but it seems like either someone put a gun to their head and said do it or someone just chucked a bag of cash on table and said do it, none of the actors looked like they even wanted to be there, Marcus just complained and so out of shape and in scenes looked like he was forced to take part, story line wasn't great either, in the end they make up even though for first hours he was trying to kill them all and even shoots their captain whos been one of all time originals just to get shot in some car park and boom over, the jokes seemed forced and wasn't funny, unrealistic shootouts where they would instantly die but hey bad boys means they have god mode.Please, no more! they should of just left it at bad boys 2...don't make a fourth whatever you do unless you're certain it will actually bang...",Bad Boys for Life

I don't know how to put the words to it, like they're trying too hard not to grow up, that they should have stayed in their time and place. Like, give it up to the new kids, it's their turn.",Bad Boys for Life
801,avhowimdb,"Bad Boys = Bad Acting, Bad Script... Just BAD",2,30 March 2020,Very disappointed. The movie starts with a chase scene where the bad boys are being chased by the police through city streets almost killing people and causing multiple crashes. Just to get to hospital to see the birth of Martin Lawrenece's grandchild. Any normal cop would be fired for that. I get that this is an over the top movie... But it went downhill from there.... The duo were full of bad jokes and their supporting actors were just plain awkward to watch... I cant believe so many people gave this such good reviews - were we watching the same movie even? Do yourself a favour - go watch the first movie again - and leave it there...,Bad Boys for Life
802,MHS_Movie_reviewer,Watch with friends type of movie.,7,30 March 2020,"Plot: 6.5 - 7.5, for comedy movies in particular, most have a terrible story and a few funny scenes which are memorable. For this movie although, the plot is actually above average and might surprise you. That said, it is imperative that you watch the previous 2 movies if you're critical on character development, plot direction, transitions etc. Beware that some scenes might feel a bit slow and may hinder your experience.Execution: 7 - 7.5, considering the plot, the directors did a pretty good job. For a threequel expected to fail below expectations due to a 17 year gap from the previous movie, the execution of the story truly stood out. From the comedic timing, sub amazing/cringeworthy fights, and dramatic conflicts over material objects. This movie definitely deserves a watch.Acting: 6.5 - 7.5, nothing special, above average at best. If you were expecting a monologue filled with vivid imagery and verbosity this ain't it chief. Most of the dialogue/facial expressions were based on comedy, as expected. Hence why no specific scene was truly memorable. Only actor that did stand out a little bit was Joe Pantoliano (Captain).Music score: 8 - 8.5, some great bangers with the music choice, beware you may burst into a sing-a-long.Action: 7.5 - 8, not mind boggling or exceptional but very good nonetheless, the use of guns, explosives, and raw power all serve a beautiful purpose, which is enjoyment. The fight choreography is a bit iffy but works.Comedy: 8 - 8.5, will you laugh? yes, will you cringe? maybe, is it worth watching the movie if you're into comedy based pieces? yes.... to an extent. The movie as with its name is a whole lot better if you watch it with more people, not saying like gather 30 people but a few friends allows the banter to expand.Overall score: 7.3, good movie.",Bad Boys for Life
803,Moriarty93,Does not fail to impress the hardcore fans of bad boys.,8,29 March 2020,"Some of it was a little cheesy but GOOD cheesy but that's always been expected with the bad boy movies. While it was trying to act serious there where many funny elements that made it very enjoyable to watch, with a couple of new characters that made it more than two guys fighting crime. Quite frankly if you enjoy the other bad boys movies you also going to enjoy this one as much as the others.
Its an ACTION - COMEDY - CRIME movie. you get what you get, the writing isn't as strong as the first 2. Think of it like taken 3 where the family that they have killed are coming back for revenge kinda thing, but is definitely worth the watch.",Bad Boys for Life

Two great actors i like to watch almost every movie makes the most stupid movie they can get.I don't get it, who gives this movie a 10? This is the most bad action/comedy i seen in the last 10 years.

My other half thought the first half was rather slow. It was beautifully shot though and still some chemistry between the leads but script was a little wanting. Sort of a remake of lethal weapon.

819,bissnez,The year starts with an epic experience!,9,16 January 2020,"I was really surprised that I had the chance to watch the movie yesterday, which wasn't my intention at all, but my friends wanted to give it a chance .First of all, the trailer couldn't hype me for the movie coupled with the abscence of Michael Bay, who actually has a cameo along with other stars from the second movie. Yet, it turned out unexpectedly great. I won't try to hype people unnecessarily and as a result of that someone to end up dissatisfied. However, if you want plenty of humour and action just to have fun for two hours, then you won't be disappointed. Again we have the hard R raiting, which is something that contributes a lot to the movie with bloody scenes and deadpool like humour. If I have to compare it to other movies, it is far better than the soulless ""Hobbs and Shaw"", who had 200 million budget and nothing special to deliver. If you are a fan of 21-22 Jump Street, then you will experience the same ride. Only this time we have a decent villain with pretty good twist, which solely set up the tension for an epic ending, reminding me of the ending of Beowulf, where they were pretty hight stakes. I even felt a vibe of the ending of ""Under The Red Hood"" , but the movie itself (Bad Boys) wasn't so dark, disturbing nor deep to deliver such conclusion with the potential the villain had. Don't get me wrong, it didn't reach the same level of those movies I've mentioned, but it was only because of the comedy settled tone of the whole movie.I won't go further in more details, but if you want to escape your stressful atmosphere, the third part of the franchise is packed with non stop comedy and action. Likewise, the cast is great and so the new additions. Both Martin Lawrence and Will Smith stole the show and if a good, yet less better movie Ride Along menaged to earn about 140 millions domestic gross, then Bad Boys will become a hit this month if people are still nostalgic about it and attend to see it.",Bad Boys for Life
820,MarenacioBanks,Worth seeing for yourself at least once,7,28 January 2020,"I do appreciate the camaraderie which is apparent between two longtime friends and great performers. However this piece feels a little contrived as it steers more towards pleasing a wider audience than it does towards appealing to the original Bad Boys fans and fanatics. In attempting to be something for everyone films with cult followings like this one tend to loose it's essence and ultimately becomes nothing for anyone. Even still there are a lot of fun witty and what will most likely become classic scenes in this film which are worth seeing. On another note the common theme in the industry at this time to play with the re aging effect is something which should be greatly reconsidered, it was well done in The Irishman for a meaningful purpose in that particular story but is becoming way over used. All in all had this Bad Boys For life been the second installment of the trilogy and the sequel had been the last of the trilogy that would have been much more fulfilling an end to this saga, but since it wasn't we take it as we can get it.",Bad Boys for Life

824,frequencylow,Corny,3,25 January 2021,"It had potential and the story kind of makes sense. The issue with the movie is that the pacing is completely off, the camera angles and shots are tiring to keep up with, and the effects are massive to the point that they're all you look at.

Compared with the first 2 films this one is the worst; although entertaining and sparkling with all the action, humour and dialogue, it is just not quite there in both plot and characters. I liken it to Jaws whereby by the time Jaws III came out the plots had dried up.

It feels more of a fast and furious movie than a Bad Boys movie. The acting is bad, the story is terrible and predictable. There are so many things going on screaming unrealistic that you can't catch a break. It lost touch with reality unlike the previous movies and it became more of ""phone gets hacked in 3 seconds"" police tv show kind of movie.It is really a sequel that didn't need to happen but happened just to fool fans and grab their money. Sad that there are new directors for this movie because the quality drop is extremely noticeable.

But when they introduce the idea that the story elements come from before the first two movies and have a revenge plot with a **spoiler** the main bad guy is the illigitimate son of one of the main characters and the under use of the ""AMMO"" team, and I quickly started to check out of the movie!! Plus what happened to Mike hooking up with Marcus's sister (from BB2)?!? There is only a quick mention of her, when Marcus brings it up when he is complaining he can't keep a woman. Not having her in this really hurt this movie! Esp. since they carried over Marcus's daughter dating that one goofy kid from BB2!! Long story short, it's a decent film, but falls short of being as good as the first two! The whole revenge plot is extremely week, since these characters weren't introduced from the previous movies and very little is talked about them! I give it a 6 out of 10. Above average.Here is how I would have done it, and not much would have changed!The movie would start the same, but the woman would have been in the Guantanamo Bay prison, being rescued by her son. But the woman's last name is Tapia. Yeah that Tapia from BB2!! And they want revenge for killing her husband (and his father) and loosing all they're fortune. See more interesting of a plot right?!? And after Marcus and Mike are celebrating they're retirement and Syd is there (no longer working as a cop), and Mike announces he and Syd are getting married. And Conrad (police captain) announces ""AMMO"" will be replacing the ""Bad Boys"" since they are retiring.At this point Mrs. Tapia and her son start accruing team members and getting weapons (similar to how it was in the movie). Well ""AMMO"" learns of this and starts going after them. A bust goes south, and half the team die. Later at Mike's wedding to Syd, Captain Conrad, tells Marcus about the bad news about ""AMMO"" and that he is being replaced for the screw up. Just as the wedding is ending and Mike and Syd are heading down the stairs, the son of Tapia does the same drive by on his bike. Killing Conrad and injuring Syd as she trys to protect Mike. And other people get injured as well.Now Marcus announces to Mike that these people have to get put down. No more mister nice guy retired! So they both go undercover without the backup from the police force. Going around investigating, finding out who is trying to destroy the police force and start WW3 on the Miami cops. Unlike the movie that got released with very little detective work! And eventually they start hunting these people down and finding out that the Tapia's are the ones behind the crime spree and violence towards the Miami cops, and killing the captain and almost killing Syd (through most of the movie Syd is in a coma). And what's left of ""AMMO"" helps both Mike and Marcus hunt the bad guys down. And at the end we get another wedding with Marcus's daughter and the goofy guy, just like it was in this movie..IMHO, this would have made a much better film with little changes! But this is one man's opinion.. Maybe BB4 will do a better job than BB3!",Bad Boys for Life

853,andreasi-15287,braindead action,5,27 January 2020,"Not a particularly good film if you have any sort of critical eye. The film turned Mike to a, frankly, quite unlikeable character, who's motives very not justified at all. The comedy did not hit it off, there was little to no emotional fulfillment, and the action sequences were so over the top to the point where there is no chance that either Mike or Marcus should have survived. The cast was unimpressive, and the big twist at the end was seemingly just done to have a twist, totally unnecessary.
The characters are supposed to be 20 years older than in the previous movies, and where as one of the charaters is acting older than his age, his trigger-happy counterpart seems like he is still 21 and not 51 years of age.

After watching bad boys 1 and 2, the third part gave a refreshing feeling. It had action, much more emotion than the previous 2, humor (sometimes a bit cheesy). Of course Will and Martin also made a fantastic duo in this film and it was certainly worth watching this in Imax. All in all, I enjoyed the 2 hours I spent in cinema. It no longer felt like a typical michael bay film thanks to the new belgian duo Bilall and Adil, who have indeed made a good debut in Hollywood. Keep it up!",Bad Boys for Life

885,abhinieats,The DUO came back with a bang,8,11 April 2020,"Unless you are new to the series, BAD BOYS needs no introduction, the duo Mike Lowrey played by Will Smith and Marcus Burnettby Martin Lawrence has been quite active and had brought overflowing manifolds topologies in terms of Action & Comedy since their formation in 1995. Fast forward to 2020, after a huge hiatus, they again bashed the big screen at the end of last month with absolutely smashing comeback 'BAD BOYS FOR LIFE'. My hubby and I are an avid fan of Will Smith and after Suicide Squad, we didn't watch any of his movies so it was must to watch for us..Last month we watched this movie on the second day-second show of release at Forum ShantiNiketan with 4DX effects. And yes the revamp third installment of an old series, Bad Boys is back!!! From the very beginning of this movie, you are guaranteed to hooked in and its gonna beguiled both, your eyes and ears too.This engrossing movie kicks-off with killingly funny moment set off in a car at the aisle of Miami Beach where Mike nailed the steering wheel with his driving force towards the hospital and I think without a speedometer(hehee!) and Marcus being besides the driver's seat, he is hilariously yelling and scared like he's gonna kill by Mike's daredevil driving... This is merely at the beginning scene, just imagine, what this powerhouse characters propound throughout its run? for that you definitely need to watch this action, comedy and mystery packed movie.After an immense successful first two season, both the leads are reprising their iconic role as Detectives in this movie too and we are delighted that the intoxicating chemistry between them is dynamically queer and uniquely comic as ever. Mike portrayed an eminent man of great intelligence with playful charms and macho charisma while Marcus apart from detective, is a very humble family man with surprising aplomb, who comforts and support Mike personally and professionally as he is like a family to him. Though it gives an impression of On and Off kinda nervous state at one point between the two; many thoughts come to our mind like, Will Marcus leave Mike? Does Mike need to handle the crisis alone? but the movie got the elements of hope and you'll find yourself oddly rooting for this detective couple and yes! Marcus ends-up by rallying with Mike in his downcast phase of life and at the same time, the duo's effect is as stupendous as the title and stay true to the movie name.Apart from the main two leads, few of the supporting characters from the first two series make an appearance too and one of them is Theresa Randle as Theresa Burnett( Marcus's wife) brings a light entertainment with a lot more laughter in betwixt plus lots of talented actors like Vanessa Hudgens features as Kell, Alexander Ludwig as Dorn, Paola Nunez as Rita and Charles Melton as Rafe, are the part of a special force and this group also diligently indulge in investigating Detective Mike's case along with Mike and Marcus to find the missing pieces of the puzzle that make storyline little interesting but its a real treat to see them.The style and nerve with which the Mexican Actress Kate del Castillo portrayed the role of dark, mysterious andJanus-faced woman as Isabel is very catchy and garnered attention with her acting skills, skilfully plan to take a revenge, also Jacob Scipio, a well-rounded actor as Armando justified the role of Isabel's son with high spirits in terms of action, giving you one more reason to watch this movie.Though the plot is quite common and filled with lots of twists and unexpected additions to the story, it overwhelmingly fun plus fill the bill movie and you won't be disappointed to watch it one time.",Bad Boys for Life

That saves this film from being the worst of all times. Horrible cliche driven wannabe expendables movie. The acting is below par for both Lawrence and Smith.

All of those involved in this film should be ashamed off pounding out the drivel they played off as an attempt at the third instalment of Bad Boys. A once incredibly respectable and well written, directed and produced action experience has finally exposed Hollywood's inner soul...garbage. They wanted money from Tik tok loving adhd automatons and sadly, they got a little from this effort. If you can call it that. This movie is worse than Robocop 3 if you can imagine.

They did not!Over all, ""Bad boys for life"" is a nice actionflick; mediocre but in fair OK.
The film has its flaws though, the script for one. Editing and direction being the other two. By their own they're not killing the movie but together they sort of do.The script has a story that, I'm sorry to say, does not work all the way. It's just way too long without any tension torgue. The editor and the directors (There's two) seems to work together, usually a good thing but here they copy the style of Michael Bays original style of direction. It's just copying, without any sort of personal touch to it. Lots of slowmo etc without any reason for example. Ok, but they're in the wrong places.As I see it there's two ways of making this film awesome.
1: Working on the script to make it much, much more tight.
2: Cut the film down to 90 min, maximum 100 min.An ok film. Not more. I thought it would be better.Grade 5/10",Bad Boys for Life

This film can't live up to the first two films even if it was a cat with 9 lives. I had two watch bad boys 2 afterwards to not leave my last memory of the franchise with this film.Forced cheesy ""bad boy"" moments and completely over used. the pacing was EVERYWHERE. Zero flow and continuity. The plot was thin spending zero time on the twist and areas of story development they should have really focused on. Too much focus was spent on the fact they're getting old. WHO CARES. Ultimately they turned a fast paced military ops level action movie into a family drama at best. Very very disappointed. I hope they have the common sense to bring Michael Bay back.Action sequences were good, but there was also a significantly less amount of action scenes vs the 2nd. But once again, all the action sequences and comedic ""bad boys"" moments were diluted by the lack of pacing and action based flow that bad boys 1 & 2 had from end to end. The comedic moments are meant to be the breath of fresh air from the tense action moments. Because the film didn't have this pacing, the comedic moments made the jokes fall flat most of the time.I'm very happy Bad Boys 4 is on the works.

921,waleed-ahmed01,"Bad jokes, bad comedy and bad acting.",1,11 April 2020,"Ridiculously bad acting coupled with boring outdated cold comedy. The actors were simply not ready to be back on the screen for a kind of production that had so much potential which has all gone down the drain.In a time where expectations of the audience and the competition with good actors in the market are both high, Will Smith should know when to resign and perhaps retire. You are simply not doing your past success any justice by throwing away so much investment in such roles with a performance like this. I won't even get started on Venessa Hudgens' unnecessary involvement on here.Also, producers should also know it takes more than a successful old title to simply reboot it years later. Storyline was no less than pathetic and a genuine waste of time. There was 13 of us watching it on a saturday night and honestly we could not wait for the credits to roll.Overall, bad acting, poor storyline, weak supporting roles, pathetic comedy okay maybe a few good action scenes but they are too filled with unnecessary cringeworthy jokes. Please stop rebooting good titles like Bad Boys and Charlie's Angels because they not only turn out to be a waste of investment for producers but also a disappointment for it's audience.",Bad Boys for Life

But this was a fun movie to watch, its not rehash of the old movies, yet it feels similar, the directors did a great job here. feels like they tried to mix the old ones with the styles of John Wick, which they pulled of great, at least for me. its not gonna win any awards or something like that. but I had a ton of fun watching this, this was 1 million times better than the garbage that was Hobbs and Shaw",Bad Boys for Life
939,mottaz-sharkawy,Waited for the movie for so long then wished it was never made,3,8 April 2020,"If this movie was not named bad boys it would have crashed hard. The only reason i am giving it a 3 is because of the title and Will Smith. The acting is mediocre, the writing is weak and the directing amateurish.
The writing is so bad and predictable with cheap jokes flying everywhere. It made me suffer listening to the dialogue.
At the beginning of the movie I was nostalgic and wondering why Martine Lawrence disappeared as an actor but by the end of the movie I was questioning how he became an actor in the first place. It was cringeworthy watching him. The new actors are so made up/fake, they look like they came from a bad soap drama.
Really dissapointed in this movie that I had high hopes for. Kept checking the clock waiting for it to be over and didn't even care how it ended just as long as the suffering stopped.",Bad Boys for Life
940,prineshaz,Pushes the franchise to new places,9,14 February 2020,"I was not expecting the movie to hit me emotionally like it did. This is less of a return to Bad Boys and more of a redemption of a franchise. Don't get me wrong I loved the original, and tolerated the sequel, Bad Boys For Life takes the spirit of the previous 2 and injects genuine heart and sincere struggle, it reflects on one's mortality and ask tough questions about when we cease to be what we hope to be. We get old, life takes on a different meaning, do we embrace that or go in the opposite direction and chase what we were instead of what we aspired. Both Will and Martin are as cheeky and dynamic as ever. Feels like a rebirth for the franchise, I look forward to the next one.",Bad Boys for Life

The acting by the two lead actors seem routine and tired and the forced attempts to revive the chemistry and banter from previous films simply fails.
The story is way too predictable and generally disappointing.But what I found disgusting was the racism in the film.
Why did Will Smith's character espouse racist slurs on several occasions when his love interest is of the same race he slurs?
And why repeatedly play on outdated stereotypes about age?
In this day and age where we should do an effort to move beyond bigotry and racism, it's just awful, outdated and really really bad taste.This film should not have been made.",Bad Boys for Life
945,teekness,Wow just wow,10,25 January 2020,"I have been a huge fan of this franchise ever since part one. I always liked the humor and action these movies provided. The villians is what usually attracts me, like the Russian in part one or Johnny Tapia in part 2. The villians in this one clearly knock the other 2 out of the water. I love how they never give anything about the villians away in the previews, so when your at the theatres it gives you that element of surprise. I thought without Michael Bay they were going to ruin this franchise but I was definitely wrong. The director here captured everything on film the action, the humor, the sadness, the whole level of love that the partners share of one another. I felt like I was in Miami sitting in the back seat of every scene in Bad Boys 3. With all that being said this probaly is my favorite movie to ever see in theatres or possibly ever seen.

It's not amazing by any means but it does do a lot of things right for an action movie. Fast paced plot, good action sequences, most of the humour is pretty good.Some the dialogue and the plot is a little bit funky but that's to be expected in an action movie like this. It's a little long, but it's fast - paced enough that it's not really an issue.In conclusion this movie lived up to what it was supposed to live up to.

I found it a bit slow to get started, expectations after a 17 year hiatus maybe a little too high, but once it got going it was filled with heart racing action, humour & gratuitous violence, this is a pure Hollywood no-brainer watch but has some twists that will make you gasp. Smith & Lawrence fall right back into their characters as if they've never been apart, the action scenes are pure Michael Bay (who makes a small cameo) and Miami has never looked so good on screen since Miami Vice in the 80's!

In times of the Black Lives Matter this feels wrong. I know it used to be a main trope from the 80s to early 2000s, but it's time for a change.
The scene in which Mick breaks the fingers of a black man to get information feel especially wrong. I know it wasn't meant like that and that Will Smitt is a big supporter of the BLM movement so I'm not pointing fingers or anything, I'm just saying what I felt watching this movie.Even without the bad trope, all the running gags felt repeative and off. Martin Lawrence got the worst of it, I feel like he spent the whole movie gagging and talking about his glasses...or God, which was worse.The whole son story was a great twist but was dealt with badly. The emotions just weren't there for me.
Plus, they gonna forget that the kid killed a DEA, judge, chief of police, etc...just because he came out of Will Smith's balls? That's just unrealisiticWell pretty much everything felt unrealistic and they should all be put to jail for what they did during that whole movie. The good guys broke more laws than the bad guys!

Great actions, Great cars, Great jokes (although it is now a bit cheesier than previous one) and Michael Bay's style and legacy in this movie is not forgotten by the new directorThankfully Reggie, Rita, inspector, and several other old character returned again and new characters from AMMO can keep up with the older one.

The jokes strike home, I don't remember laughing so hard in the cinema - ever, especially when watching an action movie. It also becomes emotional surprisingly often for such a film. Will and Martin did a great job and I highly recommend supporting their efforts by visiting your local cinema. We need more good films like this.",Bad Boys for Life
997,olsonbd,Worst of the Bad Boys Series,4,25 April 2020,"I really wanted to like this movie, but it didn't live up to the last two. This was Lethal Weapon 4 all over again. Yes, they're older (insert old guy jokes), and they try to be ""Bad Boys"" again but it was pretty lame. By far the worst part to suffer through was this 4-person specialized ""AMMO"" unit which apparently has the budget of Bruce Wayne. Coupled with the terrible acting, and Vanessa Hudgens? Really? I'm supposed to believe she's some badass SWAT operator, SUPER lame. And then of course just like Bad Boys 2 we find our hero's going to another country to finish the job and apparently arrest the bad guy somehow under the authority of the International Federal arrest powers of Miami Dade PD???

Total shambles and I am very surprised Will Smith and Martin Lawrence would agree to make this movie.The plot was dreadful and the delivery not much better.I am completely baffled by the good reviews this movie is receiving.Being how much I hold the first 2 movies in high regard (especially number 1). This one absolutely tarnishes its legacy for me. If you are a big fan of the first 2 then don't expect anything like that with this one.I give it a 2 stars for the few bits of humour and nostalgia the movie had.

The do a great job with the villains too and make this a personal story for the two main characters. I enjoyed so much to watch the Bad Boys for Life film.",Bad Boys for Life
1016,playere-46673,We waited 17 years and got a RUSHED script with a senseless plot and no character development,4,21 January 2020,"Bad Boys 3 was good as A movie, but for a Bad Boys sequel it was dumb!!! Saw it the first two nights it came out the 16th and 17th last week. As a fan of the series it was great just seeing Will and Martin back again but the plot holes couldn't be ignored. Remember this series runs in real time, as seen in 2 with mentions of 9/11. 4 issues listed here from worse to least. Also, HOW TF did the bad guy keep popping up at the exact places our Cop Duo is, without using any trackers, spies or even tv cameras or social media postings?!?1) TIMELINE - The whole ""start"" / reason for the plot is based on events that take place 1 year BEFORE Marcus and Mike become partners. Biggest plot hole here. In 3, the plot is said to start in 1995, 8 months before Isabel's son, the assassin is born in 1996 as shown in the movie. Problem is Bad Boys 1 was in 1995 and after the pool fight Mike tells Marcus ""I've been your partner for 6 years and I've been your boy all my life"". This means they've been partners since 1989 at least. *** Don't give the fans a timeline and dates to follow in 3, if you're gonna completely ignore the series foundation plot and timeline events. ***2) MISSING CHARACTERS - A few characters should have been in this movie but were left out with no explanation or mention of : a) Fletcher - Computer Hacker from 1 & 2, should have been in A.M.M.O. for 3. b) Sinclair - Internal Affairs Officer in 1, The Judge in 2 (mentioned but not seen) ""Judge Sinclair signed the warrants"" ""You just love missing Capt. Howard off don't you?"" These 2 should have been in the 3rd one especially Sinclair. KEY missed character there. It should have been Sinclair to have been the glue / rally call to give the duo motivation to catch the assassin. (Much like how Capt. Howard tells them in 1, ""Do what you do, only faster!"" ""I'm always taking it for you right? Do it for me!"" and ""it's time to get lucky, go do what you gotta do"" There was room for a surprise reappearance from a character in 3 for comedy value but not for plot value.3) REALISM - 1 & 2 have been keeping this realistic to a point but 3, goes left field more so with the very last scene in prison. Telling the assassin ""an opportunity has presented itself for you to knock off some of that debt"" . There is NO WAY possible to knock off multiple life sentences without parole, for killing a Judge,a lawyer, multiple cops and civilians. (yes it's just a movie but with realistic boundaries at least it was in this series) This is impossible in this day and age. ** This isn't the first time we've seen such in Hollywood, recent example F&F Jason Statham's character, but another story as F&F stopped being realistic after the first one.** Also opening chase scene was entertaining but plot wise dumb, reckless and would not have happened. Mike and Marcus have been chewed out for much less.4) BREAKING THE 4th WALL - In 3, this was done with overkill. I don't know how many times ""Bad Boys"" was mentioned within the movie itself. Not just the song but as a ""call to arms"". In 1, it was just the song while in the car. In 2, it was the song (wrong lyrics joke as a running gag) then the yearbook with ""we ride together, die together"". In 3, It's done in both previous instances mentioned but now ""Bad Boys, come on I need this"" ""Bad Boys one more time"" as if it was something they normally said / did all the time. I see how it was meant to be a rallying cry to team up one last time but it was overdone and unnecessary. *Had Sinclair been in this movie, it would have been on her to send in reinforcements and help, like in 2, where the CIA and DEA covertly want in on the action.",Bad Boys for Life
1017,biolanescucristian,Best bad boys movie,10,22 January 2020,"Very good movie whit great jokes.after so many years there still in a good shape. I din't like that the capitain died in the movie, because i really like him",Bad Boys for Life
1018,u-42129,The best one yet!,9,22 January 2020,"I watched the Bad Boys series and I enjoyed it a lot, but I will mainly focus on the latest addition, Bad Boys For Life. My first takeaway is that it's mainly a mix of action and comedy, just like the first two ones but the chemistry between Mike Lowery (Will Smith) and Marcus Brunette (Martin Lawrence) is better than ever before, which is surprising considering they haven't been in Bad Boys since 2003 and Lawrence hasn't been too active for the past decade because of unfortunate family problems. This movie also eclipses the other ones because it has a much more structured plot and direction with were it wants to go. I don't want to give away too much detail with the plot but you're getting yourself mainly into any action movie with gunfights, chases and explosions and even though that may not necessarily sound appealing, it definitely feels better if you watch the first two movies to see what you're getting yourself into, but this could also be your first one and you'd still fit right in. The director for Bad Boys 1 & 2 was Michael Bay, who is known specifically for extreme quick action movies but in my opinion, the Rotten Tomato ratings were really harsh with 1 getting 43% and 2 getting just 23%! Now the new director duo, Bilall Fallah and Adil El Arbi, brought back some of Michael Bay's craziness but they also brought a new aspect were the movie isn't so one-dimensional anymore and has some real life problems that Mike and Marcus have to overcome, which makes it so much more satisfying. The ratings for this movie (76%) also might be so much more of a jump because past watchers feel nostalgic for this since it's been a 17 year wait. If you're going to watch this movie, I stress the fact that you shouldn't take this too seriously and only to watch just for enjoying it since thinking too much and maybe looking for plot holes will sour your experience. The way the movie ended, we might also have a fourth Bad Boys somewhere in the near future. Both of the main characters are facing hardships, with Marcus Brunette considering to retire from the police force after becoming a grandfather and deciding to focus on his family while Mike Lowery quickly realizes he's not what he once was, and he might have to leave too. They both feel really vulnerable which is definitely something that I wanted in the past movies since sometimes nothing felt like a threat to them. Their relationship was in deep trouble since they were clashing their ways of thought and what they've been doing throughout their whole lives. The support actors are really strong with the likes of Vanessa Hudgens, Alexander Ludwig and Kate del Castillo who all did exceptional in their parts, with the past movies having Will and Martin taking too much of a portion. All in all, I would recommend watching this movie if you just want to have a good time and kick back for a classic. It's even better if you watched the former movies because this has been the best one yet!",Bad Boys for Life
1019,alexussbri,Best movie!,10,22 January 2020,Went to see this last week and it was great! This movie had the entire theatre laughing at how funny it was. Honestly a great movie to see and I'm already excited for the next one.,Bad Boys for Life

1021,jruffillustrations,21 chump street,5,24 January 2020,"I honestly cannot fathom why this movie has received such high reviews, maybe it was the hype or the long wait or Will Smith star power, but this movie was okay at best.To start with the story has been done many times before, and was awkwardly cringey.
Will Smith had zero chemistry with his supposed love interest and every scene they shared just didn't work.
Writers completely turned the previous idea on its head, shook it about and threw it in a wood chipper and by changing the Bad Boys formula it just didn't work, putting Martin Lawrence in retirement for near enough the whole film and the addition of AMMO unit was just weird and unnecessary. It really was reminiscent of 21 Jump Street but without the comedy. Action wise jumping on to helicopter rope ladders and riding motorcycle sidecars with built in machine guns is something out of a 70s Bond film (it's been done). It's almost as though they're trying to make a Fast & Furious franchise when a standard, well made sequel that stuck to the original bad boys idea was what I wanted.Martin Lawrence delivers a few funny lines, Vanessa Hudgens Looks stunning.

Same story that ruined the most recent Die Hard reared its head here and was just totally unbelievable.I loved the first two movies, they were original and entertaining as well as hilariously written.This instalment leaned far too hard on the old movies and the constant need to continually repeat ""we're bad boys"" just felt overdone.

Just shoot him! And then a guy on a dirt bike picks up a grenade and throws it forward while driving at full speed I mean come on! then mike kicks the side car off the bike?

No one drives a car fast through Colins av, even the police are a street for grandfathers in cabriolets who take their grandmothers to ocean drv to treat them with a cocktail, and the plot with a DJI drone for a thousand dollars watching indoors is just a masterpiece, a complete utopia for the foreign market, such films disgrace America and the American people",Bad Boys for Life

1038,watcherphone,"Pathetic, stopped after 4 minutes of free streaming; not worth the bandwidth.",1,29 March 2020,"First the jokes....wow. It's like they wrote them terribly on purpose. The lines delivered by smith and lawrence seemed forced and again, they seemed to be acting poorly on purpose as if they were being blackmailed or something and did the absolute worst job they could do. Lawrence delivers lines and is in my opinion a funny guy based on passed movies and his sitcome; Smith has never been funny but at least decent in line delivery. The time was rubbish on line delivery. The writing may actually be the first movie in history to be written by A.I. as either it was a computer script that wrote the script or some intellectually impaired adults at summer camp that had a ""scary story"" writing contest. I've seen Lawrence do some pretty funny roles as a female dressing up and sometimes it required latex and ""overweight person"" suits. That's the first thing I thought of when I saw Lawrence; it looks like he's wearing a fat person suit and looks sad. Yes, people get old and it shows (no really with Smith so much) and no grey hair, no aged and weathered wrinkled face on Lawrence, just a big fat turkey neck. The ""chock full of action"" in the ""TOP"" review was obviously written by someone who worked for this company or that person is a very......very very VERY simple person who really does enjoy the very.....very very VERY simple things in life. The stunts are not worthy to be classified as mediocre, you'll see better action on the golf course with Adam Sandler movies and the filter they used to give it that ""smokey/dusk"" effect to add that ""miami-sunset"" feel to the actual natural light was painfully insulting to my vision as it served no effect other than to balance the unnaturally white hot sunlight and act as a tint to reduce glare. I may be exaggerating a tiny bit on the 4 minutes before I decided to create an account after reading the poorly masked copy writer who (or very very very simple person) which had the top comment that made me waste my time, but looking at the pause on the stream; I was close. I made it to 4 minutes, 25 seconds...the part where they get out of the car after narrowly missing a bus and Smith making a really dumb remark (shame on you AI writers!) about ""don't throw up or spill something or whatever on my corinthian leather man!... then they get out and Lawrence bangs the door of the not very impressive looking car Will Smith seems to have a sexual relationship with the way he over exaggerates numerous times within the course of 4 minutes ""don't do this/do that"" repeatedly in regard to rules about his car. I was really looking forward to a good show tonight and decided to as how can a comedy go wrong with Lawrence in it and Smith there to do some great acting and filmed in beautiful Miami...damn was I wrong. This may be a fun movie for children; I'm not sure, I won't watch anymore. of it but decided to refute the guy's bullspit about the movie along with it's fake ratings that lured me in to a sequel I thought couldn't go wrong. This dribbe I'm writing is FAR more entertaining that the movie I bet and you this probably isn't the type of movie you need more than four minutes to determine it's a failure. Enjoyed the first movie somewhat but this is garbage. Don't waste your time, or do waste your time. I used to write copy for companies pretending to be a regular person while knowing to spam key words no more than five percent of 500 words for organic rankings with google and know how these huckster-bamboozling-pay4raters work and you should too. I could recommend some good movies instead of this flotsam with actors who appear to be doing it out of fear of blackmail, a death threat, or are so stoned out on pills or alchohol they are incapable of the once great timing and believable acting they had.

The biggest issue I had with this movie is the fact I live in Miami and hated how much they pushed the city. All the crimes happened in the most touristy parts, where no miami local will be caught dead in. Ok so let's move past the geography and more into the people.. they used every Miami ""influencer"" for roles that seem they were just name dropping more than adding to the actual film. While there's a million cliches about Miami the final thing I couldn't overlook was the fact that Mike lived in a six million dollar apartment and Marcus in a house that won't go lower than 8 million.

As a big fan of this ""franchise"" this movie broke my heart. Martin and Will gave us A GAARbAAGE of a movie and should've left us at BB2. I can't believe there are any good reviews for this movie. Not sure how Martin and Will allowed this to be released IT's that BAD! They completely desecrated the legacy of Bad Boys. As a fan of both actors, Martin's and Will's acting came across as tired and uninspired. I'm sure the script played a major part given it made no sense and had no direction.Will and Martin we know you made some money off this movie because the fan base came out to support a much missed and needed sequel but YOU NEED TO DO ANOTHER ONE FOR THE FANS with all that money you guys made with this worthless release.

Instead it was full of comedy chatter which made no sense? A group of "" skilled"" teenagers flying drones abojt the shop blowing things up? The script was horrible as well. Truly disappointed.

1058,khandokar-shariful,Whatcha gonna do when they come for you?,7,16 September 2020,"Bad boys, bad boys, whatcha gonna do when they come for you?
Bad boys for life is the third bad boy's movie. I would say that was a fun messy movie a symphony of violence and comedy. There was a lot of violence and I lounged a lot. There was a some stuff in the third act I'm not gonna say what happens with the third action sequence is where myself the most and then it went completely jumped the shark and I was like that was fun. The movie has lot of funny moments, there was a lot of part where I chuckled I didn't laugh all everything the movie laughs there's almond. Which is surprising because considering they have not been in Bad Boys since 2003 and Lawrence has not been too active for the past decade because of unfortunate family issue. This movie is better then other ones because it has a much more structured plot and better direction with were it wants to go. I do not want to give away too much detail with the plot. However, you are getting yourself into any action movie with gunfights, chases and explosions. However, that may not necessarily sound appealing. But it definitely feels better if you watch the first two movies to see what you're getting yourself into, but this could also be your first one and you'd still fit right in the movie. The director for Bad Boys 1 & 2 was Michael Bay. Who is known specifically for the extreme quick action movies. Now the new director duo, Bilall Fallah and Adil El Arbi brought back some of Michael Bay's craziness. Nevertheless, they also brought a new angle were the movie is not so one-dimensional anymore and they has some real life problems which Mike and Marcus have to overcome. This makes this movie so much more satisfying. Because it has been a 17 years wait. If you are going to watch this movie, I think the fact that you should not take this too seriously and only to watch just for enjoying it. Because thinking too much and maybe looking for plot holes will make your experience sour. The way the movie ended there might also have a fourth Bad Boys somewhere in the future. Both of the main characters are facing suffering with Marcus Brunette consider retiring from the police force after becoming a grandfather and decided to focus on his family but Mike Lowery quickly realizes he's not what he once was, and he might have to leave from the police force. They both feel vulnerable which definitely something that I wanted is in the past movies. Because nothing felt like a threat to them. Their relationship was in deep trouble because they were making their ways of impression that they have been doing throughout their whole lives. They all did exceptional work in their parts, but in the past movies having Will and Martin taking too much of the movie. Overall, if we're talking a good action movie with two great action stars with phenomenal chemistry. If you're a fun of this franchise oh boy I cannot wait for you all to see this goodness. I cannot wait to see what the response is and if you're not a fan this could win you over and It is my favorite movie of 2020.",Bad Boys for Life

CGI used for no reason, like why do you need CGI for a simple fight scene? Like a REALLY simple one, two guys just punching each other and chasing for a bit. Two stunt man would do perfectly here with much better results. CGI fire everywhere.No humor, the jokes were just bad, did not land or didn't make sense.On the same line the scrip was super bad, dialogues seemed forced.Plot, like whatever , it could be OK if everything else was better. It's not a movie that is supposed to make you wonder what's next etc. But the background story of the whole situation doesn't make sense if you watched the other two movies.Will Smith did a great job but could not save this project. The best part of the movie was to hear the song again. All the rest was a bad joke.

I love where they took into account characters from 2003's BadBoys2 and continued stories to lighten up the movie and bring soft edges to something that is actually pretty intense. I thought the vehicle scenes were better choreographed and more skilled than almost anything I've seen out of any FastnFurious movie. The comedic relief was entertaining, Martin Lawrence and Will Smith make an incredibly talented duo but with the additions of Paola Núñez Rivas, Charles Melton, Vanessa Hudgens and Alexander Ludwig it took the Smith&Lawrence familiarities to a new aged vibe and it was great.

If you really want to enjoy a movie then i suggest that you watch again the first one. Most actors when they get old they do not have the same spark as when they were young. Quality drops significantly. This movie proves all of the above stated. Shame on you!",Bad Boys for Life

I didn't like the movie much, and I can appreciate that there is bigger fans out there than me of the Bad Boys franchise, and Will Smith and Martin Lawrence that have been entertained much more seeing this movie than yours truly, and therefore will rate it higher than me, fair enough, but come on people....10!!! Really?!!!

Everything felt forced. The first two installments were amazing for what they were. Yeah, they were over the top for the most part... I mean, it's a Bay film. But that simply means the action sequences were likely explosively exaggerated. But at least the acting was there. I'm sure some will refer to the first two has cheesy but the charisma between Smith and Laurence was so natural. You can feel the 17+ year gap in this most recent film. It's choppy. It's too scripted. It's not the same over-the-top scenarios we wanted. The ""Miami"" illuminated colors are there but that's honestly about it. Bay is honestly missed.",Bad Boys for Life

1133,tjfall3704,It is alright. Not Great,6,18 January 2020,The only reason people are rating this movie so high is because there were such low expectations for a Will Smith movie. The movie was entertaining but once again Will Smith showed he is an overrated actor. It had some good action but the ending explosions and action were completely unbelievable. Martin Lawrence looked bloated and the supporting cast was a hodge podge of first time actors. Overall it was entertaining but for those giving this 8 stars and above they must be huge Will Smith fans and willing to overlook the poor acting.,Bad Boys for Life

1135,phil_2000-41-603840,"Really surprised by the amount of glowing 10 star reviews on here, i thought the film was pretty woeful",1,23 January 2020,"I was hugely disappointed in this film from minutes in right the way through to the end. I just thought id have a glance at the reviews here after having seen the film expecting the ratings to echo that disappointment but was amazed to find out so many people loved it, makes me wonder if maybe they have all been payed by the production company to keep viewer numbers up, each to their own i suppose.Personally i thought it was really lacking in any humour and the attempts at humour were very forced and awkward, just a lot of we're both to old jokes, there was no story line as such, well there sort of was, but it was a pretty lame excuse for a plot, and it was completely unrecognisable to the 1st films, I'm not saying that instantly made for it being a bad film but the majority of the other reviews are saying ""if u liked the 1st two you'll love this one? It was just a bit cringeworthy in places, some very overly American emotional tug on the heart strings bits that were pretty pathetic and very cheesy and predictable.And now for a more general rant:
Just recently i have noticed more and more that alot of films massively overdo the action visual effects and stunts to the extent that i almost find myself getting bored from action overload. I know that sounds ridiculous when talking about an action film but hear me out. I mean there is so much happening on the screen with the hugely over exaggerated shot em ups and impressive unnecessary elaborate stunts with out any story line what so ever, im beginning to think it is done deliberately to daze and distract the viewer from the fact that the film is lacking in any real structure or content and is in fact crap.
If your staring wide eyed and open mouthed, drooling slightly, at the barrage of pretty colours and blur of movement on the screen, your unlikely to notice that there was a script let alone how bad it wasFor example why when on a motorbike mid chase winding through traffic and trying to shoot at someone with an uzi would u think i know what would help with my shooting accuracy lets pull a wheelie at the same time or a stopie (travelling along on just the front wheel) whilst trying to shoot. Very impressive that this stunt guy can do that but why? What did it actually bring to that action sequence? Silly little thing to pick up on i know but when this sort of thing is going on every minute of every film it just gets a bit daft. Its as relevant as having a hit man doing a 1 handed handstand off the bike while weaving through traffic and trying to shoot, very impressive but bloody ridiculous.
I'd just like the emphasis to be on making a decent very watchable film rather than lets fit in as many daft stunts and shoot outs as we can and make this into a visual circus.If I am, as i suspect, correct in my thinking that this is all just distraction from a glaringly bad film then it is obviously a tactic that is working - judging by the reviews attached to this curd of a film.

Will Smith once again ""against some versions of himself"" and uncle Marcus (Martin Lawrence) at their best! The AMMO team, good as a group, even Marcus the baby was awesome.

1201,nampadit,An enjoyable Friday night movie!,7,25 July 2020,"Not as good as the first two and it certainly lacks the ""Bad Boys"" vibe in it. But as a standalone movie, it is an enjoyable action-packed movie.",Bad Boys for Life
1202,alessandro-71822,Lots of the same..,6,10 October 2020,"The first was new and fresh. The latest is much if the same. Same wise cracks, same racist anti white jokes (then it seems to be funny). Some new good characters coming in. Most fun in this movie the scenery of Miami and Mexico. Great locations too.",Bad Boys for Life
1203,harrisonjohnm,Bad Boys for Life!,10,23 February 2020,"I walked in to the cinemas ready and prepared to watch and expect it to be another bad remake of a movie, and walked out satisfied with what I just watched. This movie was spot on with the environment and the comedy back to its old days. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch something with tons of comedy, and tons of action at the same time.Good job!",Bad Boys for Life
1204,andreidracea-39282,Wow!!,10,20 January 2020,"In my opinion, the best of the 3 ""Bad boys"", and one of the funnyest moviea i've seen in the last years!
I might not be 100% objective because i was a fan, but people should see this!
Good job Will and Martin and the whole crew, and please don't stop here!
Let's see more of this!",Bad Boys for Life
1205,carolinar-32698,All I have to say is WOW!,10,17 January 2020,"I wasn't sure what to expect but I know that I love Martin and Will Smith! I have been waiting for this for a while now and I was not disappointed at all. This movie had a little bit of everything. It had action, emotional moments, comedy, and suspense. I cried, laughed, and bit my nails a few times during the suspenseful scenes. I wouldn't mind watching it on the big screen again. It was worth every second and every penny.",Bad Boys for Life

Good story and comedian",Bad Boys for Life
1209,haythamsaid-49447,Was amazing,10,20 January 2020,"Just saw it today, was expecting a failure as a 3rd movie, after 16.5 years....but i was totally amazed , it is a comedy, action and the combo of smith and Lawrence amazing",Bad Boys for Life
1210,pjb-15291,A transition to extend the lifetime of the franchise,3,10 April 2020,"I have always been a huge fan of Bad Boys. I and II both have some great plots and overall I like the Bad Boys concept.I believe this movie was meant as a transition from Martin Lawrence and Will Smith to a new set of actors. We see a lot of new faces, a plot that clearly offers an opportunity to create a BB IV starring Jacob Scipio as main character backed by a new captain and the AMMO team, and several deaths and closures that leave so many familiar faces behind.I could imagine Smith and Lawrence both felt great about the two first movies, but needed a way to ""leave"" the franchise independant from their contribution in future movies.This results in a movie and story going at a very fast pace, lots on scenes that ""just had to be made"", scenes that didn't require many retakes, lots of CGI (some may say rather poor CGI) made solely to keep people engaged and occasionally look up from their smartphones.It is not the best movie ever, and I wouldn't necessarily recommend watching it, but... Let's say my hypothesis is true - then I believe this movie would feature as a good prequel to what is coming next.Note: You won't miss a great story by not watching it now, but should we see a BB IV coming out in the near future, I would probably recommend watching this before just to catch up to speed. Until then, you are good.--I give it 1 star for the attempt, 1 more star for having the same actors from the beginning, and 1 more star for featuring Vanessa Hudgens, simply because I still have a massive crush on her since High School Musical.",Bad Boys for Life
1211,josephhibbs,Good,7,25 January 2020,Missing that Michael bay touch but still satisfied. Pretty funny buddy buddy cop movie,Bad Boys for Life
1212,koenverc,Recorded by students ?,3,14 June 2020,"I wonder why they can't make a movie where the complete head of the characters stays in the picture for more then 3 minutes, the top of the head was missing a lot, it was like a bad photographer recorded this movie. Once I noticed this I started to get annoyed to the complete movie by the level of amateurism.",Bad Boys for Life
1213,alvisbugis,Good boys good boys...,7,1 April 2020,"Funny action field movie, a must watch if you're into Will Smith , and pretty similar to to the first two movies with some grimm blod scenes",Bad Boys for Life
1214,kdensern,AMAZING,9,28 January 2020,"Love the music, the actions, the jokes, and so much more!",Bad Boys for Life
1215,jacobbjorkman,Bad boys for life,9,19 January 2020,"I give it a solid 9/10 just because it was 17 years from the second one but the same feeling was there. They put in some new jokes, it was good comedy in the movie. It was a thought-out story and it was perfect for this movie. Will smith and Martin Lawrence still play it good and they put in some new actors like Alexander Ludwig,Vanessa Hudgens and Charles Melton. Some as a summary it was a great movie with awesome action and comedy",Bad Boys for Life
1216,amosprayogo,Very cool story,10,21 January 2020,"Bad boys, has a very cool story and a important message. The message is about praying to gods. It's also very funny movie too. Very worth watching. 10/10 👏👏👏",Bad Boys for Life
