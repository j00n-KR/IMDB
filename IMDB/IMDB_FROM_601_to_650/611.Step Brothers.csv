0,MartinHafer,"Yes, it is very stupid and yet I am ashamed to admit I enjoyed it.",7,2 August 2009,"Okay, I must admit that this movie was incredibly stupid, offensive and awful...but somehow I still laughed and enjoyed myself. Maybe it was because the film had no pretenses--it never even tried to be deep or intelligent--just appeal to our baser instincts.The reason I watched this film is because I loved TALLADEGA NIGHTS so much. Another Will Farrell/John C. Reilly film sure sounded great--even if it didn't match the quality or laughs of this earlier film.The film is about two total losers who still live at home with their parent, even though they are 39 and 40 years old. On top of this, they both have the common sense and maturity of 7 year-olds---very, very slow 7 year-olds! And in both roles, Ferrell and Reilly both sounded like little boys in adult bodies--and this provided a lot of laughs. When both their parents met and married, however, both Ferrell and Reilly handed it like most immature children--they sulked and threw tantrums. Then, in a strange twist, the two losers realized how much they had in common and became fast friends. The problem, however, is that as friends they both had a lot of crazy and destructive energy--and perhaps it was better when they were fighting and arguing all the time! The film manages to entertain because it is well-written, plus the actors seemed to have a lot of fun acting like total idiots. This fun translated to fun for the audience as well. However, I should warn you that the movie is very, very crude--with lots of colorful language, a pair of fake testicles and lots of sexual references. While kids love Will Ferrell movies, I don't recommend this except for older and more mature audiences (that's ironic, isn't it?).Overall, lots of primitive and crude humor that manages to make you laugh throughout. It ain't pretty, but it is fun and worth seeing.",Step Brothers
1,TheLittleSongbird,Laboured and laughter-free,3,6 April 2011,"I have never been the biggest fan of Will Ferrell, but I saw Step Brothers anyway because the premise did appeal to me somewhat and I never try to judge a movie by my dislike of the actor in it. But aside from the premise at first glance, a decent visual look to the film and the supporting performance of Mary Steenburgen who does at least show some comic timing and allure, Step Brothers is a laboured and laughter-free comedy that doesn't live up to the premise.When it comes to the other Adam McKay-Will Ferrell collaborations, Step Brothers is a major step-down from the entertaining Anchorman:The Legend of Ron Burgundy, but it is significantly better than the dreadful The Other Guys. The premise is great, but the execution is not. Step Brothers is too uninspired and predictable to live up to what it promised. The film feels rather laboured in the pace, and it doesn't help that the film just ins't that funny to me. The jokes are misconceived, unoriginal and feel like the same old tired schtick and the script is sorely lacking in wit and charm.McKay's direction is quite lazy as well, and the acting apart from Steenburgen is not great. Ferrell and John C. Reilly can be good, but their acting style feels recycled and forced and their chemistry is unnatural and bland. Ferrell's performance especially feels phoned-in, and while Reilly fares better he overdoes it in a valiant attempt to elevate the poor material.All in all, disappointing and laboured. 3/10 Bethany Cox",Step Brothers
2,SnoopyStyle,Two is not better than one,5,19 April 2014,"Brennan Huff (Will Ferrell) and Dale Doback (John C. Reilly) are both man-childs still living at home. When Brennan's mom Nancy (Mary Steenburgen) and Dale's dad Robert (Richard Jenkins) get marry, the sons are not too happy and are forced to share a room. Things get out of hand and Robert forces them to get a job within a month. Brenan's younger successful doucher brother Derek (Adam Scott) becomes their nemesis bonding the new stepbrothers. On the advise of Derek, Nancy and Robert finally plans to sell the house retiring on a sailing trip around the world. Meanwhile Derek's wife Alice (Kathryn Hahn) has the hots for Dale.Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly are once again playing their man-child characters. In this one, we get a double dose. It's possible that the old schtick has grown old especially when it's so overloaded. They are essentially playing the same character. I found the duo selfish childish idiots aren't as funny as just one. The movie improves slightly when they work together. They are actually funny as best friends. However it's not enough for me to recommend and it's a little late.",Step Brothers
3,claudio_carvalho,Moronic Comedy,2,17 February 2009,"When the middle-aged Dr. Robert Doback (Richard Jenkins) and Nancy Huff (Mary Steenburgen) meet each other in a conference, they immediately fall in love for each other and get married. They discover that in addition to their love and wish to sail around the world after retirement, they both have unemployed sons of about forty year-old that still live with them. When Nancy moves to Robert's home, there is a great friction and jealousy between the spoiled losers Brennan Huff (Will Ferrell) and Dale Doback (John C. Reilly), and Dale needs to share his room with Brennan. However, when Brennan's successful young brother Derek Huff (Adam Scott) visits Nancy and Robert, Dale hits Derek on the face and this attitude changes the relationship between the step brothers. Derek promises to sell Robert's house for his early retirement while Dale has intercourse with the repressed wife of Derek, Alice Huff (Kathryn Hahn). However, when Dale and Brennan destroy Robert's yacht in a wreck, the life of each member of the family is affected.The overrated ""Step Brothers"" is a moronic and not funny comedy. I believe that only underdeveloped mentally adults (a.k.a. retarded) and children may appreciate the stupidity and bad taste of the jokes. I like low-level comedies and gross jokes in a context, but the storyline and the screenplay of ""Step Brothers"" are ridiculous and I did not laugh with any scene. I can not understand why the elegant Mary Steenburgen and Richard Jenkins decided to make this crap. My vote is two.Title (Brazil): Not Available",Step Brothers
4,kosmasp,"Hard ""R""",6,20 April 2009,"For an ""R""-rated movie this is pretty out there. Gross and cruel with crude humor, which won't fly with everybody, especially if you expect a more family friendly structure! But Will Ferrel and John C. Reilly are a great team! Those two can make you forget some of the weaker moments of the movie and for some they might even elevate the movie into ""awesome-ness""! But seriously though: The paper thin plot, won't fool anyone (not that you should have expected much in that area from the get-go), some cliché moments and a few jokes that miss out. For the home entertainment section there is also the ""unrated"" version available, which I haven't watched yet ... but I'm sure it's (still) worth a watch!",Step Brothers
5,jboothmillard,Step Brothers,5,21 December 2011,"I think I may have seen this film mentioned on Film 2008 with Jonathan Ross, and with two good actors I certainly wanted to see it, from director Adam McKay (Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy, Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, The Other Guys). Basically thirty nine year old loser Brennan Huff (Will Ferrell, also writing), and forty year old loser Dale Doback (John C. Reilly, also writing) have become step brother's when Brennan's mother Nancy (Back to the Future Part III's Mary Steenburgen) and Dale's doctor father Robert (Let Me In's Richard Jenkins) have got married. At first Brennan and Dale have no connection and pretty much resent each other, especially while they are forced to share a bedroom together, but as they find out more about each other, such as their taste in music and stuff, they get on much better and form a pact. Robert tries to lay down the law for the boys, and he is insisting that they both try and find jobs, but with their child like natures they find it very hard to do adult things and want to have fun more than anything else. There is the point when tension rises again between the step brothers, but in the end for the sake of their parents and making up in a public performance of ""Por ti Volare"" Brennan and Dale do make amends. Also starring Adam Scott as Derek Huff, Kathryn Hahn as Alice Huff, Andrea Savage as Denise and Lurie Poston as Tommy Huff. Both Ferrell and Reilly do well as the childish spoilt grown ups who just want to muck around, most of the jokes come from the juvenile behaviour, the title concept and Dumb and Dumber style may lose its buzz after a while, but overall it is a funny comedy. Worth watching!",Step Brothers
6,moonspinner55,From Judd Apatow's School of Rude...both relentlessly funny as well as supremely obnoxious,5,3 July 2010,"Crass, over-the-top comic chaos from producer Judd Apatow. A lovely divorcée, with a 39-year-old slacker son still living with her at home, meets and falls for a medical practitioner who lives alone with HIS 40-year-old slacker son. When the two families combine, things get off to a rocky start between the step-brothers--until the two overgrown boys find out they actually have a whole lot in common. A flagrantly foul-mouthed and cartoony-ridiculous star-vehicle for leads Will Ferrell (who co-wrote the screenplay with director Adam McKay) and John C. Reilly (who also had a hand in the story) actually begins well but gets progressively weaker after the 30-minute mark. Some of Ferrell's and McKay's comic ideas fail to take off (such as the brothers both sleepwalking and destroying the kitchen), however the cast is truly good. As the parents, Mary Steenburgen and Richard Jenkins are genuinely funny without the sight-gags, and Reilly's desperate comic-confusion and hair-trigger temper results in some laugh-out-loud scenes. Still, the 'plot' is half-assed, with one foot set in a semi-realistic scenario and the other on a slapstick limb. By the time Ferrell is burying Reilly in the backyard, the laughs have pretty much been replaced by a wayward sort of improvisational silliness which seems funnier to the people on-screen rather than to the audience. ** from ****",Step Brothers
7,Quinoa1984,"funny and disappointing, which is hard to do unless you're Will Ferrell/John C. Reilly",5,25 July 2008,"I don't throw around this criticism lightly, as it seems to be used often as an aside for material when it's not usually warranted, so here goes: Step Brothers feels, looks, and sounds like it was written by 13 year olds. This isn't entirely an awful prospect, particularly if you're able to somehow tap into your inner 13 year-old, whatever that is; last summer with Superbad my inner 15 year old was perfect for the material. But with Step Brothers, Will Ferrell and his co-writer/director Adam McKay have stretched a premise into comic oblivion; it's a series of expletives, obscenities, and just plain-ol' stupidity stretched like pure elastic for 90 or so minutes. There's barely even a plot; the big climax is a shindig where Will Ferrell breaks out the singing guns with John C. Reilly on drums.And yet, even with this in mind and against the movie, it's still funny, very funny at times. There's so much that does work, like just simple and crazily inspired scenes between the father/step father Richard Jenkins plays between his son/step son, that it's a shame then when they don't work. The problem lies in being able to conjure enough inspiration without dipping too far into the pit of crudeness that sucked up the likes of American Pie and the lesser Farrelly brothers movies. When all else fails, after all, what's funnier than a pair of testicles just hanging out in the open? Sometimes things that are funny become a little warped in this continual running gag-turned-psychosis of the two ""sons"" being complete man-children. I'm reminded of Freddy Got Fingered if it didn't take itself too seriously... or had so much fake ejaculate spraying everywhere.So, some of it is just silly, and gross and tasteless and terrible and gross, and the expletive meter (which I don't mind, curse all you want fellas) runs the same amount as the average Scorsese gangster flick. I can't recommend it nearly as highly as I would any of the former Ferrell comedies (save for Night at the Roxbury, which we all can agree was a mistake), and yet it is when it's at its best as funny as past Ferrell/Reilly comedies. If you're 13 and (probably) a boy and can somehow see the movie, or know how to tap into that age-range, or, frankly, if you're into truly idiotic stuff, Step Brothers is the shiznit. Others beware like napalm on a frosty. 5.5/10",Step Brothers
8,edwagreen,This 'Step' Brother is Way Out of Line 0*,1,1 August 2009,"One of the most ridiculous films made in a very long time. It is inane, absurd, outrageously stupid and an insult to movie viewers to see John C. Reilly and Will Ferrell act like absolute morons.Amazing that Mary Steenburgen and Richard Jenkins allowed themselves to be part of such nonsense.The plot is asinine. A middle-aged couple marry and have the misfortune of having their sons still living with them. The 2 jerks immediately can't get along. The two guys needed to be institutionalized as did the writer of this very awful film. As if the film weren't bad enough, the constant vulgar language that was used was certainly not appreciated.The riot act should have been read to these two idiots before the marriage took place.Obviously, dealing with 2 fools like this would put a strain on any marriage.What kind of comedy was this? When Reilly passes gas during an interview, we're supposed to laugh at this?Of the over 1400 films that I have written about, this is by far the worst I've seen so far.",Step Brothers
9,Hey_Sweden,"Sometimes funny, mostly pretty forgettable.",5,17 May 2015,"Brennan (Will Ferrell) and Dale (John C. Reilly) are two middle aged losers, still living with their respective parents, Nancy and Robert (Mary Steenburgen, Richard Jenkins). All during the course of the opening credits, Nancy and Robert meet, fall in love, and get married. This shatters the ""perfect"" little worlds that the two men have created for themselves, all the more so when they're required to share a room. Eventually, they realize that their crass antics can have consequences on the people around them.Tolerance for this very Hollywood comedy will depend on tolerance for stuff that is, at its core, formulaic, and decidedly raunchy in the modern style. It will also depend on just how long one can stand the two main characters, who are such idiots that it does make for rough viewing for a while. Ferrell and Reilly are in fine form, but the men-children characters that they're playing simply weren't that funny to this viewer. A lot of the humour just fell flat. That's not to say that there aren't laughs to be mined from the material, because occasionally I did chuckle. Be prepared, however, for some in your face gross out gags and a plethora of F- word usage. Not surprisingly, the two leads are eventually going to have to learn some lessons about acting their ages and accepting adult responsibilities. (At the same time, ""Step Brothers"" submits the idea that people should still never lose sight of their inner child. This seems like a mixing of messages to me. And the fact that Nancy is an enabler is mostly just kind of glossed over.)The supporting cast is fine. They're actually the main reason to watch this. Both Steenburgen (looking very lovely) and the always fine Jenkins are appealing. Adam Scott has a field day as Brennans' successful but jerky younger brother, and Kathryn Hahn is amusing as the brothers' unhappy, oversexed wife. Look for a couple of familiar faces in small roles and cameos.Reasonably entertaining, but may be hard to take for some due to the childishness on hand.Five out of 10.",Step Brothers
10,dbborroughs,Better than most Will Ferrell movies,6,29 December 2008,"Exceedingly stupid but occasionally funny tale of two forty year old live at home guys who become step brothers when their parents marry.Its Will Ferrell so you know that the IQ level of the film is going to be pretty low (if it was a person it would just have language skills). Better than most Ferrell movies in that there actually are some laughs, but at the same time thats kind of like finding an upside to chewing on aluminum foil. Snotty comments aside I actually like the film some what. I've seen it a couple more times in pieces since its been out on DVD and I have to say that there really are some funny pieces. I still don't think that the film works as a whole but it is amusing enough to try at some point.",Step Brothers
11,zardoz-13,Ferrell & Reilly Are The Best Buddy Act Since Abbott & Costello,10,13 August 2008,"Former ""Saturday Night Live"" comedian Will Ferrell and his Oscar-nominated co-star John C. Reilly are every bit as funny in their new dumb comedy ""Step Brothers"" as they were in ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby."" Incongruity serves as the best source of comedy, and Ferrell & Reilly have the arrested development routine down pat. They play what you might call 'man children.' Aged 40 or thereabouts, they behave like spoiled eight-year old brats and their first-rate performances capture the eternal immaturity of a lot of guys grown-up or otherwise. Mind you, Ferrell perfected this kind of nonsense earlier in the 2003 family friendly movie ""Elf."" Ferrell excels playing cretinous half-wits, and Reilly has him evenly matched. A formulaic exercise in immature male bonding, ""Step Brothers"" relies heavily on crude language, homophobic taunts, and hopelessly puerile conduct. For example, wannabe musician Dale (John C. Reilly) forbids Brennan (Will Ferrell) from touching his drum set. Brennan waits for the right moment when Dale isn't around and polishes Dale's tom-toms with his privates. Director Adam McKay, who penned and helmed both ""Talladega Nights"" and ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy,"" has an unerring knack for skewering juvenile masculine behavior. It helps matters that co-writers Ferrell and Reilly are game for almost anything remotely buffoonish. You'll die laughing at the scene where actual teenagers assault our dumbfounded protagonists and force them to lick petrified doggie poop. Now, if any of this seems remotely tasteless, ""Step Brothers"" isn't fare for you.A widowed doctor, Dr. Robert Doback (Richard Jenkins of ""Me, Myself and Irene""), and a divorced mother, Nancy Huff (Mary Steenburgen of ""Time After Time""), meet at a conference and hit it off immediately like two randy teenagers. During their first encounter, each reveals their burdens to the other, specifically that they have forty something sons living off them. Robert has Dale (John C. Reilly of ""Walk Hard"") sharing his house while Nancy houses 39-year old Brennan who recently lost his job at Petsmart. Dale is a virgin who has never had a job since he dropped out of college, but he feels a sense of entitlement that amazes even his father. Nevertheless, it is love at first sight for Nancy and Robert and they swap vows. Nancy moves in with Robert and brings along a reluctant Brennan. An outraged Dale refuses to move his sacred drum set from a spare bedroom and Brennan has to sleep in adjacent beds across from Dale. Before they go to sleep, they snarl profane threats at each other, ridiculing each other's masculinity.Dale and Brennan spend the first forty-five minutes feuding until they lower their collective guards and realize that they share a great deal in common. They discover that they would be T-Rexes if they were dinosaurs and that John Stamos is the sexiest man alive. Anybody who gets the John Stamos joke will cry tears of laughter throughout this hilarious hare-brained baloney. Not only are Dale and Brennan their own worst enemies, they drive Nancy and Robert up the wall with their infantile exploits. These dimwitted dunces walk in their sleep. Nancy and Robert awaken the following morning to find the kitchen trashed. Dale has stuffed sofa cushions into the oven, while Brennan has put his mom's purse in the refrigerator crisper. Ultimately, these boobs break the proverbial camel's back when they run Robert's sailboat aground on a reef. Robert had planned to retire and take Nancy around the world in his vessel. Robert and Nancy give the boys a week to find jobs and get an apartment. Predictably, neither Dale nor Brennan can get a job because they alienate every personnel manager that they meet. Eventually, our heroes push Nancy and Robert over the edge and they divorce. Dale and Brennan spend the remainder of the movie trying to reunite their parents and elevate themselves in the business world.""Step Brothers"" gets pretty raunchy and lives up to its R-rating. The F-word is uttered about forty-four times so people distressed by profanity are forewarned. As riotous as Ferrell and Reilly are, Richard Jenkins and Mary Steenburgen hold their hold, maintaining straight faces amid their son's shenanigans. The scene where Dale and Brennan enter their parents' bedroom and plead childishly to convert their beds into bunk beds exemplifies this restraint. Ferrell and Reilly grovel while Jenkins and Steenburgen behave as if they were June and Ward Cleaver from ""Leave It to Beaver."" Meanwhile, supporting player Adam Scott is terrific as Brennan's obnoxious younger brother Derek who grew-up, left the nest, got married, had two kids, and carved fortune out of the real estate business. Whereas Brennan failed at every turn, Derek has succeeded at every turn. He rubs older brother's nose in it. The flashback scene where Brennan sings a pirate's song in make-up while his brother teases him, prompting both the chorus and the audience to heckle him as a 'man-gina"" is hysterical. Ferrell and Reilly have perfect chemistry and a lot of what they do seems so genuine that it must have been improvised. If this movie were about actual teenage step brothers abrading each, it wouldn't be a third as funny, but Ferrell and Reilly deliver their lines with such deadpan earnest that you cannot help but guffaw. ""Step Brothers"" qualifies as a tip-top guy's night out movie but the kind that would only confirm the worst suspicions that many females have about the inherent adolescence of men in general.",Step Brothers

13,anaconda-40658,Step On This Film.,1,11 August 2015,"Step Brothers (2008): Dir: Adam McKay / Cast: Will Ferrell, John C. Reilly, Richard Jenkins, Mary Steenburgen, Adam Scott: Adam McKay directs this foul comedy rather half-heartedly. It is an extreme smaller reduction after having directed such hilarity as Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy and Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby. It regards family, friendship and teamwork as Brennan and Dale become 40 year old step brothers when their parents meet in a rather rushed premise. From there the two fight and bicker then arrive at a truce. Routine charade of profanity and vulgarity. That pretty much stifles any potential message it could have had. Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly overplay their children in adult bodies roles and this is sad considering that Ferrell was at his comic best in Anchorman, and Reilly just came off one of his best performances in Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story. Mary Steenburgen and Richard Jenkins as the parents deserve better. They are basically there to scold these two grown men. After performances this bad, they should be scolded. Adam Scott plays the snotty successful brother of Ferrell. A major setback for a director whose previous films were funnier. Basically we are left with two actors making an embarrassing attempt at being juvenile within a film that should be flushed down a toilet. Score: 1 / 10",Step Brothers
14,zetes,Thin but often hilarious,8,27 July 2008,"A movie with a paper-thin premise  two grown men (or man-children  they act like they're six, not forty) who still live with their parents resent each other when they become step-brothers. The two men are played by Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly, and director Adam McKay, who directed Ferrell in his best vehicle, Anchorman, lets them do pretty much whatever they want. It's just these two dopes playing off each other for an hour and a half. It's impossible to defend the movie as cinema, and I think most people would find it extremely obnoxious. But I really like these two actors, and I laughed myself silly at Step Brothers. Besides the two leads, Adam Scott is hilarious as Will Ferrell's d-bag little brother, who, unlike his brother, is a great success. Also Kathryn Hahn as Scott's wife, who becomes smitten with Reilly after he punches her husband. She has the best two scenes in the movie.",Step Brothers

I love Mary Steenburgen who played WIll's stepmother in Elf and Richard Jenkins as the divorcée and widower who get together so quickly. When he admits that his adult son still lives at home, she responds ""so do I."" Dale and Brennan are grown adult men but they have child-sized minds. They don't want to grow up and their parents marriage have made them stepbrothers. At first, they hate each other. Slowly, they bond over Brennan's super-successful brother Derek who outshines his older brother and has scarred him for life regarding music. Dale and Brennan have to get a job and move out in a month. It's not easy since they botch interview wearing tuxedos.

There are some really hilarious scenes that my wife and I still talk about after ten years so to me that says something about the quality of the humor. Other movies I just forget about it, but then you have some gems like this one. The whole movie turns around two actors, Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly. They really lift this movie to another level.

19,StevePulaski,"Delivers some laughs, but falls flat on it's face quickly",6,4 February 2011,"I saw this movie in the theaters on August 26, 2008. That was almost three years ago. I haven't seen the film since, but boy have I heard a ton about it. Everyone of my friends has seen it, and cites it as ""their favorite movie"". I pay no mind, but I'm sick and tired of getting asked my opinion on this film. I say ""from what I remember it's kind of funny"", but people have to constantly give me their two cents and say I like too many old movies. Which is definitely the case. I'd choose Friday the 13th over Drag Me to Hell, License to Drive over The Hangover, and Clerks over Step Brothers.To be fair, Step Brothers has it's perks. It's a very slapstick oriented film, and those films are seemingly not hard to do. I've always been a fan of the classic slapstick like The Dean Martin Variety Show and anything from the work of Chris Farley.The reason those are so well done, and this pales in comparison is because slapstick only works if two people have great on screen chemistry. Like Farley and Spade. Those two nailed both the movies did they together, and never disappointed me. Ferrell and Reilly are somewhat funny, but also somewhat forgettable as they try a bit too hard to be funny.Brennan (Ferrell) and Dale (Reilly) are two forty something losers who sit on their couches, and have done nothing memorable in recent years. Their lives come together when Brennan's mom and Dale's dad come together to get married, and live together. Naturally but oddly, Brennan and Dale can't stand each other when they move in. May I ask why? They're both losers that do nothing, and just sit around all day. How are they not the best of friends? Maybe because both have been socially awkward hermits their entire lives? Could be. Regardless, they hate each other, but they grow to do some brotherly bonding together. Somethings are entertaining, others are just over the top and nothing special. Nothing is as funny as I remember, and I can't see how this improves with multiple viewings. If anything, my rating would gradually decrease after watching this too many times.Will Ferrell is funny in places, but I find him unnecessary sometimes. The ""balls on the drumset"" joke isn't nearly as funny as I remember, and his whole filmography is just unappealing. In this film, he is okay, but like I said, not really worthy of the much recognition he gets. While Reilly is funnier, he also isn't very noteworthy.Two and a half years later, Step Brothers disappoints. I remembered it as such a funnier movie in theaters, but it's nothing short of cliché. You know they'll wind up liking each other, and there is just no suspense. I grew tired of the characters, and this could all be settled if the parents intervened and said ""look, you guys may not like each other, but maybe you guys need to talk out your differences and figure out some things you both like to do."" But that would make the movie end too soon.Starring: Will Ferrell, John C. Reilly, Mary Steenburgen, Richard Jenkins, Adam Scott, and Kathryn Hahn. Directed by: Adam McKay.",Step Brothers
20,Smells_Like_Cheese,Better than the average Will Ferrell movie thanks to John C. Reilly,7,29 July 2008,"When I first saw the trailer for Step Brothers, all I could think was ""Oh, great, Will Ferrell again?"", I know this guy has a ton of fans, but I don't understand why, he can't really hold a movie together. But I got to see Step Brothers for free and I love John C. Reilly, so I decided to go ahead and just check it out with an open mind. Now there is no doubt, this movie is definitely a lot better than I expected, it's pretty funny, has some really good moments, but still once again, with the older men acting like children, not too original and a lot of the humor seems a little forced. Another comedy brought to us by the Apatow crew, naturally the comedy is over all decent, but please, for the love of God, can they stop with the friggin' penis jokes?! It's getting old, and so are Will Ferrell's balls, that's one thing in life I never did wanna see, and now it'll haunt my dreams forever.Dale and Brennan just became step brothers, one is 40 and one is 39 years old, but they both have the maturity of an eleven year old. They still live with their parents who have just pretty much crippled them into not growing up. But they hate each other, fight like crazy and destroy everything around them, so their parents finally tell them to get jobs and move out. But seeing how they're enjoying their care free life styles, so naturally they ruin their interviews, but what they don't know is that they are about to ruin their parent's marriage when they've finally discovered they're best friends.Now Step Brothers has some really funny moments, the dad played by Richard Jenkins is just hilarious, even though you wanna smack these parents since they've crippled their kids into not being grown adults, he delivers his lines well and is actually going crazy with the boy's behavior. Also how Dale and Brennan are wearing tuxedo's to their job interviews killed me, some of their scenes were just hilarious, like when they finally discovered they were best friends and what they had in common. Over all, I'd say this movie is worth the look, but I would recommend this more for a matinée, it's just an average comedy, no more or less.7/10",Step Brothers
21,disdressed12,the extended version,4,6 December 2008,"this was a very disappointing movie for me.the red band(restricted)trailer i saw made it seem very funny,raunchy and edgy.the reality is,it was none of those.i found it much too tame,considering my expectations.a lot of what was in the trailer was toned down.and i barely laughed.if you're expecting edginess,this is not the movie you're looking for.there are a few crude and lewd moments,and some crude language but nothing that hasn't been seen or done before.i also thought the movie was slow,and on the verge of being boring in some areas.you might like it if you're a Will Ferrel or John C.

22,KineticSeoul,A suppose dumb comedy without the comedy,3,22 August 2012,I really can't understand how anyone can find this movie to be funny. I know a comedy doesn't have to be clever to be funny. But this movie has two characters going at it with each other while being stupid. Which is fine if it was funny but all the jokes in this fall flat. You can tell Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly tries really hard to be funny but they just aren't cause the jokes are terrible. Overall this is a comedy that is dumb without it being funny. The constant toilet humor in this just didn't work. I give this movie a 3 because of one memorable part that is alright which is the Catalina Win Mixer.3/10,Step Brothers
23,sddavis63,Crude But Very Funny,7,3 September 2009,"This movie is always dumb, often crude and sometimes even offensive. Usually, that particular combination of attributes turns me completely off a movie. In this case, though, somehow it all worked together and actually created a very funny movie. The plot is both ridiculous and shallow. Two grown men (Brennan, 39 & Dale, 40, played brilliantly by Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly respectively) have never grown up - they still live with their parents, they're lazy, they're unemployed and they act like 8 year olds all the time. Ferrell and Reilly worked really well together and played off each other superbly. Then, their respective parents, played by Mary Steenburgen and Richard Jenkins, hook up, fall in love and get married, making these two step-brothers who now have to share a room. Steenburgen and Jenkins were also very good. I would never in a million years have thought of casting these two as a couple, and while they did lack romantic chemistry together, they still worked together well, and since the movie wasn't about them (it was about how they reacted to their sons) everything still worked. My only niggling point here is that Steenburgen is kind of young to have a 39 year old son. (It's not impossible. She was born in 1953, so would have had Brennan when she was 16, but it still jarred me a bit.) There were a couple of things that didn't work well for me. I really disliked the character of Derek (Adam Scott) - Brennan's over-achieving younger brother. I thought he added nothing to the movie. However, it is true that the funniest scene in the entire movie might have been when Derek's wife Alice (Kathryn Hahn) confessed her love for Dale, and as she was pouring out her feelings for him, talked about wanting to roll him up into a ball and stuff him inside her vagina! (I didn't see the outtakes but would assume that Hahn must have had trouble getting that scene out with a straight face; it was hilarious.) Also, I didn't care much for the scene where the kids make Brennan lick dog poop (and, for that matter, thought the whole idea around the kids was also unnecessary.) I did rather like how this movie ended, basically making the point that you can try to conform to society's expectations, but unless you're being true to yourself and who you are - even if you're Brennan and Dale! - you won't likely succeed. If you're easily offended, you should probably look for a different movie, but otherwise, this really is very funny. 7/10",Step Brothers
24,Buddy-51,all windup and no delivery,4,27 July 2008,"""Step Brothers"" is what ""The Brady Bunch"" might have been had the kids been middle-aged and the dialogue foul-mouthed and R-rated. Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly play two developmentally stunted forty-year-olds who still live at home, have apparently never held down a decent job, and possess the emotional maturity of a couple of temperamentally-challenged pre-teens. When their respective parents get married, Brennan and Dale are suddenly thrust into the role of bedroom-sharing stepbrothers. It's hate-at-first-sight for the two until Brennan's overbearing and obnoxious brother, Derek (Adam Scott), arrives on the scene, giving the boys an enemy whom they can both finally unite against in common cause.Co-written by Ferrell and Adam McKay and directed by McKay, ""Step Brothers"" is one of those high-concept comedies that runs through its limited bag of tricks in the first five to ten minutes or so, then just keeps repeating itself over and over again for the remaining hour-and-a-half. Ferrell and Reilly perform their umpteenth variation on the superannuated-adolescent shtick, while Mary Steenburgen and Richard Jenkins struggle hard to maintain some semblance of dignity in the role of the parents. As with any hit-and-miss comedy, there are a few good laughs to be found in what is otherwise a pretty arid desert of obvious slapstick, flat-footed one-liners and envelope-pushing raunch.If ""Superbad"" and ""Knocked Up"" proved anything last year, it's that crude humor can be both sophisticated and palatable if left to the right hands. Unfortunately, the makers of ""Step Brothers"" failed to learn that lesson.",Step Brothers
25,thesar-2,These Step Brothers Needed Terry O'Quinn as Their Stepfather,5,24 January 2011,"Maybe I wanted to like Step Brothers more, or perhaps I need to see it againbut seriously speaking, it was just silly.Silly as in fun, that is. It's harmless fun, though not for all audiences, and it's just plain ridiculous. It's almost like an excuse for Will Ferrell (as step brother, Brennan) and John C. Reilly (as other step brother, Dale) to get together and horse around (listen to the audio commentary for proof.) That's all good, if you're looking for a leave-your-brain-at-the-door comedy. And I did find it funny, knowing not to expect too much. I laughed about a dozen times, though more ""at"" its screwball comedy, especially during the interviews, namely with the obligatory Seth Rogen cameo.One group of adults: Nancy (Steenburgen) and Robert (Jenkins) agree to marry and bring together their 40ish kids who haven't yet flown the coop. Originally, the ""boys,"" and I'm using that loosely, don't get along. After realizing they have some things in common, they bond and manage to screw up interviews the new stepfather, Robert, set up. Okay, okay, they screw up everything, but in the end, naturally, they're gonna learn to grow up and take on responsibility.Really, there's three minutes of a plot here, and nothing's really new – just the typical grown-men goofing off, à la Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Vince Vaughn, Paul Rudd etc. But, again, if you just sit back and let them do their thingover and over againyou might have fun. Just don't expect much, or even clever jokes. Just gag, fight, rinse and repeat. If that's your bag, this is the movie for you.Personally, I probably have to watch it again and perhaps it will become a guilty pleasure as it really couldn't be anything of substance – just mindless entertainment.",Step Brothers

27,Robert_duder,Oh my goodness...it's funny...it's actually so stupid that it is hilarious!!,8,2 March 2010,"I don't really like Will Ferrell much, in fact I have never been a fan of silly, stupid, gross out comedy like Adam Sandler's early films and Anchorman and every possible spoof film out there. I don't know what possessed me to watch Stepbrothers...boredom and it was on the movie network. But within minutes I was smiling, five minutes later I was laughing, and a half hour I was shocked to discover I was having an amazing fun time. The movie was outrageous and silly, and disgusting, full of gratuitous sexual references and bad language and gosh darn it...I was loving every minute of it. Movies are meant to entertain and the makers behind Stepbrothers weren't trying to teach anyone anything, or make any sort of statement but take two actors who are really good at playing really stupid stooges and putting them into a ridiculously good idea. Adding in some really great supporting cast members and have them belt out equally ridiculous things and you'll be rolling in the aisles despite yourself. I'm actually shocked that many consider this to not be one of Ferrell's comedies because this was ten times more entertaining than crap like Anchorman. It actually makes me rethink watching Ferrell comedies.Will Ferrell plays a 10 year old, maybe a little less trapped in the body of a 40 year old. Not an entirely original concept given movies like Big, 13 Going On 30, Jack (Robin Williams)...but this is a whole different ball of wax. Ferrell is at his silliest and terrifically stupid and it works perfectly for this film. If anything could be said about John C. Reilly he is a versatile actor but obviously likes being silly. He's not your typical slapstick comedian, in fact I think he's a serious actor that can let go and be silly. In this case he manages to meet Ferrell's level of silly childishness and the two of them together are an absolute riot. They have terrific chemistry and deliver the lines like true children. They literally couldn't have done better than get Oscar nominated Mary Steenburgen and Richard Jenkins (Jenkins was nominated after Stepbrothers but not FOR Stepbrothers ha!) The two of them together are amazing and perhaps the true highlight of the film. They are so prim and proper and have this hot (if not a little strange romance) and then when things start to fall apart...well they are both hilarious. The four of them make this film incredible.Am I gloating about a silly movie? Yes definitely because I am the first person to condemn stupid comedies but this one just caught me off guard and made me laugh like I hadn't laughed at a comedy in a long time. Director and writer Adam McKay comes straight from Saturday Night Live and has worked with Ferrell before, neither of these things necessarily make him a good director. In fact, most times SNL alumni make rather poor films. Skits don't translate well into an hour and a half or more...hear that makers of ""MacGruber"" UGH! Anyways...put your brain on hold, and be prepared to simply laugh and laugh and feel good. The one liners that come out of this movie and the chemistry between every one of them is just unstoppable. No matter what kind of comedies you like I encourage you to check this out. If your friends like stupid gross out comedy and you don't...this one will be the one you can all enjoy despite yourself. Just plain fun. 8/10",Step Brothers
28,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Sometimes hilarious and wickedly entertaining throughout.,7,12 May 2018,"Like with all of Adam McKay's comedies, the plot of 'Step Brothers (2008)' isn't really the main focus and as such isn't too refined. It hits all the necessary beats and feels more planned than some of his other work, though. The piece feels longer than it is and also skips over some of the more important narrative elements. Still, the movie is laugh-out-loud funny on more than one occasion, thanks mainly to the absurdist improvisation of its excellent cast, and is wickedly entertaining throughout. 7/10",Step Brothers

The 2 don't have jobs and are basically the most irresponsible 40 year olds one could imagine. They start off as enemies but team up when Brennan's brother shows up because they both hate him.As long as you are no prude and not completely offended by the language in this(in my opinion way too many f bombs, but if it is funny, it's funny) then you should find this movie hysterical.A few scenes I remember are just the way they act when grounded from TV, the job interviews, Brennan on the drums, the rap video and destroying the boat, Alice and Dale in the bathroom, getting beat up by Gardoski.FINAL VERDICT: If you like adult comedies and are a fan of Old School, then you should watch this.",Step Brothers

About the direction which was made by Adam McKay I have to say that it was simply amazing and it consisted of many great scenes. Regarding the interpretations, Will Ferrell who played as Brennan Huff was for one more time simply outstanding at his role and John C. Reilly who played as Dale Doback was equally good. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Richard Jenkins who played as Dr. Robert Doback, Mary Steenburgen's who played as Nancy Huff and Adam Scott's who played as Derek the brother of John C.

I recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that you are going to enjoy it very much and you are going to laugh a lot.

34,Floated2,Comedy in its own sense *update,3,30 January 2010,"OK so received this movie as a gift on DVD and decided to watch it last night. For off, I expected this to be really funny like the DVD said, but it wasn't. The jokes are the typical vulgar swearing. There's no humorous reason for it other than the words themselves (way too much unnecessary cursing). No form of intelligence can be found within the humor. Just a bunch of one liners. Vulgar parts of movies can produce some of the funniest movies and movie moments. The humor in this movie seems to be aimed at a much younger audience than its R rating suggests. The acting is....well there is no real acting. It's just Will Ferrel and John C. Reily behaving as their usual characters on silver screen. At many points both of their characters just seem too over the top even for their childish roles. Now the movie did have its funny parts, and I did laugh at some of the scenes. Most of the movie, however, had me disappointed and waiting for the next scene, hoping it was less dumb and more funny. This movie isn't even worth a rental; the laugh-to-dollar-spent ratio is so low it's almost zero.In short there are a few good laughs to be had, but for the most part this film is just one recycled bad joke that just isn't funny.==================================================================== ====================================================================As a rewatch 07/31/17' this film does have its silly and over the top antics but that is what makes the film as a whole funnier. Understanding the point of their humor is understanding the film isn't meant for awards. After rewatching it along with other silly comedies of the last few years, this film is quite funny to each of its own. Not much of a plot but the joy comes from the chemistry of Will Ferrell and John C. Reily. Not a film for everyone, clearly but has this film grown over the years. Rating changed from 3 to 8.

36,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Sadly Ferrell fans, the ""Step Brothers"" laughs are immature and unsatisfying",3,12 August 2008,"I consider myself a Will Ferrell fan, although nothing since ""Anchorman"" has ever compared to it and I didn't even see ""Blades of Glory"" or ""Semi-Pro."" That aside, ""Step Brothers"" made me shocked that this was the same duo that made me laugh so hysterically in the past. Now I wouldn't call any of Ferrell and director/writer Adam McKay's collaborations ""mature"" by any means, but ""Step Brothers"" is a giant immaturity-seeking missile that really doesn't best utilize the humorous talents of its stars. Maybe the obscure insults and mythological references have gotten cold with me, but this film shows that this duo's work is out of gas.The premise is pretty much an excuse for immature humor, as two jobless, loser 40-year- olds move in with each other when their parents get married. From the get-go, stars Ferrell and his favorite cohort, John C. Reilly, stay committed to acting 10 years old the entire movie. No, they're not acting like 40-year-olds with 10 year-old tendencies, they're literally acting 10, just with fouler mouths. So, like all 10-year-olds, sometimes they're funny and sometimes they're annoying and stupid. Unfortunately, there wasn't enough consistently clever humor to excuse the dumb jokes at any point in time.I don't know how much was improvised or not, but the dialogue was pretty terrible. Either that or that humor has just gotten too stale. I definitely didn't expect this to be as good as Ferrell's best films, but it wasn't even close. I can quote most of those other movies, but I won't remember many lines from this one. I'll admit I laughed frequently during this film, but at it because it was dumb, not with it because it was clever.The rest of the cast was, as expected from anything Apatow produced, a broad range of crazy characters with their own quirks. The only guy I really liked was the father of Reilly's character, played by Richard Jenkins. He was able to pull off the two-faced nature of his character, being both goofy at times and really serious and uptight. The rest of the cast were actors getting a chance to climb up the Apatow ladder, none of whom stood out.""Step Brothers"" is pretty much ridiculous, enough to make me laugh, but not enough for me to say I actually liked it as a film. This is nothing more than a DVD rental for those who simply need a dose of shenanigans.",Step Brothers
37,Anonymous_Maxine,Could have been good if it was made for people old enough to see it!,4,11 August 2008,"Few people in Hollywood can play awkward losers better than Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly, so clearly casting can't be blamed for the lack of laughs. I noticed a light chuckle pass through the audience as the movie started with that old ""wings take dream"" quote from George W. Bush, but for most of the rest of the movie, the majority of the laughs were coming from the kids, who really shouldn't have been there in the first place. Will Ferrell, for example, ""tea-bags"" a drum set in the movie.I should admit that I find the majority of this American Pie-style humor to be immediately and intensely boring, like seeing someone get kicked in the nuts. In the right situation, such a thing can generate a response, but generally it's just bonehead toilet humor, and I have come to expect more than that from Ferrell and Reilly.You may remember that Adam McKay teamed up with Will Ferrell twice before, for Ron Burgundy and Talladega Nights, and this is essentially the same film with a different name. The plot is pretty meaningless, as it's mostly a vehicle for Ferrell and Reilly to conduct some crude skits, like a Saturday Night Live show without the constraints of TV censors. Since all the stops are pulled, the movie overflows with lots of cussing and sex jokes and more cussing.Mary Steenburgen and Richard Jenkins play Nancy and Robert, who are the unlucky parents of Brennan (Ferrell) and Dale (Reilly). Both have a 40 year old loser of a son still living at home and unemployed, and when this causes them to fall in love and get married, suddenly Brennan and Dale find themselves living together and, get this, sharing a room.Now, there are two ways to make a cookie-cutter comedy like this. One is to have the guys just be lazy couch potatoes too irresponsible to get off their asses and find a job and get a freaking life (note: that's the one that will make a better movie), or you could just have the two lead characters be 40-year-old children.Unfortunately, Step Brothers chooses the latter. Brennan and Dale are essentially 10-year- old kids, but we're supposed to fall over laughing because they're 40. They collect action figures, get grounded, sleep in their jammies, receive spankings while bent over daddy's knee, cry at the dinner table, and get beaten up by groups of kids.I would be lying if I said the movie was completely devoid of laughs, but I'd also be lying if I said the movie was funny. There are a few chuckles (one of the job interview scenes has an amusing moment in it, thanks to a brief cameo by Seth Rogen, who I recommend you go see in Pineapple Express rather than wasting your time with this), but the majority of the movie is too obviously an excuse for a lot of sick jokes and bodily noises. No thanks.The relationship between their parents is also a completely separate soap opera drama that seems completely out of place in this movie except for their occasional bouts of wild profanity. Their disintegrating marriage is so seriously presented that it's even harder to laugh at any of the tasteless comedy.In the movie's defense, there are some good moments involving Dale's jerk brother Derek (a scene-stealing Adam Scott) and his bizarre family that almost make up for the rest of the movie. There's a classic scene where they're all singing an curious version of ""Sweet Child O' Mine"" in the car, where Derek viciously berates his wife's pleasant singing and then belts out his lines like a dying cat. I hadn't seen this guy before, but he is so good at playing a massive tool that it's almost weird!Unfortunately, the rest of the movie might be a good rental on a Saturday night when you're hanging out at home getting drunk with your buddies, but any laughs you get in the theater will soon be lost when you remember that you spent $11 to see it",Step Brothers

Nothing more would be asked for, nor would anything else be expected. We know we Aren't going to leave the cinema with a different view of the world and hence we go in with the ability to just enjoy what is being provided to us.The film has many laughs, but could perhaps be faulted on lacking any really genuinely hysterical moments. The humor is thrown at us non-stop but fails to ever really take it up a gear and have us in fits on the floor. It must be said though that the consistently funny method is highly preferable to the odd really funny moment with nothing in between. Combining the two is what separates the good comedies from the great. Dumb and Dumber being on of the prime examples of this.John C. Reilly and Will Ferrell are as always superb in their uniquely, fascinating to watch, way. They seem to have an ability also to influence the actors working with them to adapt to their style. Richard Jenkins on this occasion seems to have been influenced the most. It works well with everyone firing on the same cylinders and leads to laughs coming from a lot more angles and situations.Step Brothers whilst undoubtedly very good, just can't quite seem to take it that final step to the top level to separate it from other comedies like perhaps Anchorman did.

Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that the direction and writing were sharp, the performances were superior, the costume design was fabulous, and the production design was excellent. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this truly hilarious and sometimes crass comedy about dealing with a parent's remarriage and getting along with their spouse's children from previous marriages.",Step Brothers
43,hu675,Very entertaining R-Rated Comedy.,8,13 September 2008,"An overgrown slacker named Brennan (Will Farrell), who still acts like an teenager and he lives with his mother Nancy (Oscar-Winner:Mary Streenburgen). His mother has fallen in love with an successful doctor named Robert Doback (Richard Jenkins). Her loves has an son named Dale (John C. Reilly), who's somewhat worse slacker than her son. Then Nancy and Robert gets married but now these two step brothers are forced to know each other and live in Dale's room. At first, they truly hate each other until they realized... they have something in common. Brennan's brother Derek (Adam Scott) convinced his step-father that he should sale his house to realize his life-long dream to sail around the world for a year. Now these two step brothers decide to team together to save their home and as well pleasing their parents to find a job.Directed by Adam McKay (Anchorman:The Legend of Ron Burgundy, Talladega Nights:The Ballad of Ricky Bobby) made an enjoyable silly comedy that is better than McKay's two previous funny comedies. This is Farell's best role since ""Anchorman"" and he also toned down somewhat his annoying/overbearing comic character moments. It's fun to watch Farrell and Reilly together on-screen. They have more laughs together than ""Talladega Nights"". This was one of the most successful films of 2008 and it's certainly one of the funniest this year so far. Seth Rogen appears in a cameo. Screenplay by the director and actor:Farrell. From a story by the director and actors:Farrell & Reilly. Super 35. (****/*****).",Step Brothers
44,rooprect,Literally crying with laughter at the end,8,5 January 2020,"Tears streaming down my face, I was laughing so hard. I have never cried this hard, not even after Old Yeller. As the other reviews have covered, ""Step Brothers"" is unashamedly dumb. But it's not stupid-dumb like slipping on a banana peel. It's smart-dumb as with the satirical scenes of Will Ferrell's horrible singing and the deadpan reactions of absolute rapturous amazement from the crowd. It's this sort of straight-faced silliness that characterizes the whole film, and if you enjoy this sort of comedy you won't be let down.Comic absurdism is really hard to pull off. Probably the first and most notable master was the late great Leslie Nielsen (""Airplane"", ""Naked Gun"", ""Police Squad in Color"") and the entire troupe of Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker who introduced us to this concept of surreal, straight-faced humor. The Z-A-Z team took it to the realm of utter silliness (with great success), and here in ""Step Brothers"" some 25 years later we see that concept refined to subtle perfection.The deliberately paper-thin plot of ""Step Brothers"" is that two overgrown infants, each pushing 40 years old but still living with their parents in an emotionally-stunted if not cereberally-stunted existence, find themselves forced to live together as one big happy family. At first I was skeptical of this premise, expecting the characters to be sad, pathetic and annoying, but they took it in a different direction. Both Ferrell and Reilly act as if they're truly 14 year old punks, basically Beavis & Butthead in the flesh. By instantly immersing us in this absurd premise, the entire film takes on a hilarious tongue-in-cheek vibe, not quite ""Airplane"" but getting darn close.If you enjoy that sort of comedy--ironic deadpan humor such as with ""The Office"" or ""Spinal Tap"" but with the silly factor amped up to 11 (while the straight-faced factor remains a solid brick wall) then you'll really enjoy ""Step Brothers"".A final note for those who noticed it's a Judd Apatow production and were wondering if there's a lot of gross-out sexual humor, I would say this flick is low-to-medium on the Apatowometer. There's a ton of foul language but it's hilariously delivered the way a pair of teenage boys sound when they learn their first swear words. There are 1 or 2 sexual gags but they are handled so over-the-top (and fully clothed) that it's not gross. Warning: if you watch the unrated extended cut, there's a gag showing Will Ferrell's nut sack. And although there aren't any fart jokes, there's 1 extremely long, painful, tuneful fart (as if they were saving all the fart jokes for that 1 gag) which I'm ashamed to admit had me in stitches. So I'd say keep this one away from the young kids but don't freak out if you catch them sneaking a peek.",Step Brothers
45,jfgibson73,One of the lowest of the low-brow ever made,7,19 July 2015,"All I really want to say about this movie is that I thought it was very funny. I thought it was a great premise, and I enjoyed almost every moment. Since I have to add unnecessary lines for this review, I will also say I really liked the performances from the six main actors. Will and John of course play their man-child roles with total commitment. Richard Jenkins and Mary Steenburgen are both driven career professional but display a softness that makes them likable even as they let their adult children walk all over them. Adam Scott is always great at the slimy stuff, and Kathryn Hahn gets to just go nuts. This movie works as an R-rated comedy, since it lets the humor get filthy and outrageous, but take the explicit stuff out and they could have made a kids movie. Will Farrell, Judd Apatow, and low-brow humor are three categories that divide people into love it/hate it just on their own, but reading the comments section, it seems this movie gets people especially worked up about which side they're on. Personally, I laughed out loud several times.",Step Brothers

47,slokes,Hold On To 13 As Long As You Can,7,6 June 2012,"""Step Brothers"" is a goofy, gut-gripping if not -busting celebration of what it means to be young at heart - even if it means being the two oldest adolescents in the history of Western Civilization.Brennan Huff (Will Ferrell) and Dale Doback (John C. Reilly) still live with their aging parents, a situation that creates conflict when their respective parents (played by Mary Steenburgen and Richard Jenkins) meet and fall in love. It's a rough couple of days as the two grown men share a bedroom and bicker like profane versions of Felix and Oscar. In time, though, they find they have a lot in common, like the same favorite dinosaur and a penchant for sleep-walking.""I know we started out as foe,"" Brennan tells Dale after another bonding experience when Dale punches Brennan's obnoxious brother Derek (Adam Scott). ""But after that courageous act...maybe we can become friends, friends who ride majestic, translucent steeds shooting flaming arrows across the Bridge of Hemdale.""I don't know what he means, either, but it's Ferrell and it's funny. So is the rest of the movie, most of the time, playing off the loony central characters and a universe crazy enough to reward their refusal to put aside childish things.Director Adam McKay, who also co-wrote the script with Ferrell, knows how to get his stars to deliver funny lines, many of them apparently ad-libbed on the spot. I think he was aiming for the same quotable craziness of the earlier McKay/Ferrell collaboration ""Anchorman."" You can't fault them if the result isn't as solid (""Anchorman"" is one recent comedy that has been rising, deservedly, in public estimation over time). What you get here is too loose in structure at times, and some of the running gags push crudity over wit. At the same time ""Step Brothers"" hangs together, especially with the bond that develops between Brennan and Dale.One thing the film does well is celebrate the lost-in-time quality of Brennan and Dale's existence without overdoing it. There's no period music from the 1970s, and the presentation of the world around the boy-men is given its own zany spin.Scott seems to be channeling Tom Cruise's ""Magnolia"" character as a Type-AAA personality who shows off his surprisingly well-oiled abs (he hasn't tasted a carb since 2003) and teases his brother mercilessly, and the office where he (and later Brennan) work is a clever send-up of testosterone-fueled capitalism. ""It's the Catalina Wine Mixer"" becomes one of the film's signature lines, usually with an obscene modifier before ""Catalina."" Watching Derek and pal Randy (Rob Riggle) say it over again is one of those things about the movie that should get more tired than it does. I just enjoyed watching them carry the bit off well-past the point of no return.You do feel the film stretching for laughs at times, and it doesn't always work. A subplot between Dale and Scott's wife Alice (Kathryn Hahn) feels like a weak attempt at giving Reilly more to do, and the seams of this relationship really show on the extended edition.Meanwhile, other bits that wound up on the cutting-room floor seem worth including in the released package, like Randy getting in such a lather he has a heart attack he tries to wave off. (Ferrell underplays this scene marvelously.) I also like the extended version of a dinner-table stand-off where Brennan won't share his ""fancy sauce"" with an equally hostile Dale. I think it builds some necessary tension that dissolves a little too soon. The pair is funny as friends, but funnier as adversaries.Steenburgen and Jenkins are fantastic foils who find their own strange magic as the movie progresses, and whoever picked out Dale and Brennan's T-shirts should have gotten some kind of special wardrobe Oscar.Worth watching? Definitely! Memorable? Sort of. A marked improvement over the lame and loud ""Talladega Nights""? Yes, very much.""Step Brothers"" scores most especially as an opportunity to watch improvisatory geniuses practice their craft, with some heart-warming moments and a clever musical revelation scene built in at the end. If it doesn't feel classic, that's because it's not, but it whets the appetite for what this team will come up with next.",Step Brothers
48,aidanratesmovies,"Hilarious, although stupid, film that shines in the silliest of ways",10,7 November 2019,"By far ridiculous, but an amusing riot, Step Brothers may not be the smartest comedy around but it does prove to be one of the most entertaining. The returning pair of Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly make for some great chemistry, as well as longtime collaborator with Will Ferrell, as well as John C. Reilly on a film the three all did together (Talladega Nights), Adam McKay. McKay's solid directing makes for some well executed remarks, and the script, written by both McKay and Ferrell, is easily to blame as well. The acting in the film, besides the two leads, for the most part is not great, though Adam Scott does shine brightly as Will Ferrell's incredibly spoiled brother Derek. In the end, the film is obviously not perfect, but it a fun silly comedy with some excellent situational comedy and a nostalgic sense of wonder.

I cant answer these questions so perhaps you can help me.Brennan Huff is a sporadically employed thirty-nine-year-old who lives with his mother, Nancy . Dale Doback is a a terminally unemployed forty-year-old who lives with his father, Robert . When Robert and Nancy marry and move in together, Brennan and Dale are forced to live with each other as step brothers. As their narcissism and downright aggressive laziness threaten to tear the family apart, these two middle-aged, immature, overgrown boys will orchestrate an insane, elaborate plan to bring their parents back together. To pull it off, they must form an unlikely bond that maybe, just maybe, will finally get them out of the house.At the very start of this movie there is a funny quote that comes on the screen it says. "" families is where our nation finds hope, where wings takes dream"" : Actual quote from George W Bush. I laughed for the one and only time during the movie. Because its funny . It's just a shame George W Bush didn't have any input into writing the script. In fact he could have played one of the step brothers. His natural stupidity would have been more interesting than either Will Ferrels or John Reilly performances. If you like the though of watching to grown men pretend to be retarded while relaying countless butt jokes then maybe you might just like Step Brother but if you do , then god help you. Yet again Jud Apatow is credited as a co writer for this film and I'm tired of his humour. I know i keep moaning about his films and really i should stay away from them but they remain extremely popular so i feel i should do my duty to warn people as to how bad they are.Step Brothers is maybe not Ferrels worst movie ( there are so many) but it is certainly the worst Apatow film i have seen and if you don't mind i need to go have a lie down as i think I'm coming down with a case of apatowostrophy....

I had no hope for this movie so, big surprise, I laughed more than I expected to. Yeah, it's a stupid movie, but it has its moments. The opening banquet with it's two outbursts, the sleepwalking scene, the asbestos bit, etc. The usual godawful, sentimental ending to Will Ferrell, Mike Myers & Adam Sandler movies (where everyone has to do a 180 to accept the hero) is actually worked out kinda nicely here.

If you like Ferrell and Reilly's brand of humor, then Step Brothers will be right up your alley. It's unabashedly dumb. The whole premise is so absurd that it can't help but be amusing.

The characters collide and bounce off each other in some truly funny moments, although the ""Dumb and Dumber"" format is a little worn. But, whenever the film just about takes the audience into its universe, it tries to take the cheap and easy road to low brow humor by blasting the eardrums with endless usages of that word. After 2,000 uses, it is no longer even shocking or funny. It's just pointless noise that obscures the real comedy that is there. It's presented in the film almost as a virus, too, as the two slackers inspire everybody else, one by one, to eventually stoop to saying the word.The story line shows some thought, and what happens throughout (especially the ending) is brilliantly exaggerated for great comic results.

Rather than pushing any political stance, I think this movie is trying to tell us it's going to be about a couple of mongoons.The gag, of course, is that both Ferrell and Reilly are probably no more than ten years younger than the people who play their parents (Richard Jenkins and Mary Steenbergen). Thrill to the drama of the parents giving the spoiled step brothers an ultimatum of finding a job or moving out; cringe at the brothers' attempts at making an informercial while destroying their fathers boat; vomit at the eventual success of the brothers as an unlikely musical duo, saving the day at a business symposium (where Horatio Sanz solicits one titter from us as an ""80s Billy Joel Tribute Band"")...There are a few good lines (all said by someone other than Will Ferrell), but if you're whiskied up enough to enjoy this movie, you deserve everything you get.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",Step Brothers
65,KUAlum26,"Ferrell and Reilly painfully resisting ""growing up""",7,15 August 2008,"I was at the point of laying a 6/10 on this film for the following reasons: the overall premise of the show relies heavily on the bad behavior of the two characters,the usual comic devices used by director(and writer?)Adam McKay is becoming a bit predictable and trite and the follow-through of this film's story seems a bit forced(particularly at the end,which I won't give away). But the main characters' full and complete physical commitment to this movie makes it not only whoopingly funny but also strangely compelling.The tag-line says ""They grow up so fast"",but really Brennan Huff(Will Ferrell,on the slow-burn)and Dale Doback(John C.Reilly,for whom someday people may forget he was once renown for DRAMAS)have done anything BUT. Both staring at forty and spoiled,their individual worlds are stood on ear due to their single parents' union. The lengths they go through as rivals,enemies,friends,allies and ultimately...wait for it...brothers will stretch the tendrils of credibility,but if you dig either Ferrell or Reilly's antics and quirks,you'll be laughing through most if not all of it.Sympathetic turns by MAry Steenburgen and Richard Jenkins as the boys' parents are pretty much the sum highlight much of the supporting cast(though some may think that Adam Grant's turn as Brennan's nasty younger bro could be it). While not my idea of a ""Best of"" movie for Ferrell(or anyone else involved here),it's still a basically good,hearty ""Guy"" comedy,replete with grossness and absurdity.

66,pyrocitor,A lament for the now butchered contemporary comedy,3,10 February 2010,"The comedy genre, among all others, demonstrates a remarkable potential to generate timeless, classic hilarity from the most skeletal of premises, particularly when perfectly utilizing the talents of its impeccably talented leads. It also demonstrates a remarkable potential to generate complete creative excrement, as is ably demonstrated by the mere existence of Step Brothers. Warping the aforementioned winning combination into something grotesquely un-funny, the anxiously awaited re-teaming of director Adam McKay and stars Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly could not have culminated in a more horrifyingly poor product. Or, if such a film did exist, its creation could only be for the purpose of a sadistic form of prison camp psychological torture for particularly resilient inmates, inevitably prone to attracting complaints of excessive cruelty from human rights groups. Needless to say, Step Brothers falls a mite short of its potential.The real problem is, it is easy to run a skeletal premise in a comedy if the creative team behind it has enough energy, innovation and juice to run with the idea, as was the case with McKay and Ferrell's now infamous first collaboration Anchorman. As it stands, it seems filmmakers and studio alike were struck by waves of complacency, likely pitching the idea of Step Brothers as ""Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly acting like kids and ad-libbing"", but forgetting to continue the creative development past that point. However, such an announcement would seemingly be news to those involved, as Step Brothers still struts with a boorish, irritatingly cocky confidence in the midst of its flaring inadequacies, as if firmly believing itself to be funny and attempting to manhandle its audience into also seeing it that way, thereby making the final product embarrassing as well as downright shoddy.And yes, the idea of centering a film around two 40 year old men acting like children is a skeletally silly one at best, but not one without potential, hinting at a potential to cuttingly satirize a society of complacent conveniences where individuals could age to such a point without moving forward in life, coddled by overeager parents bred on 'soft love' parenting books. Predictably enough, however, McKay's film has no such designs on potential thematic resonance. In fact, it has little designs whatsoever, begging suspension of disbelief to the point of screeching collapse with its 'man-children' antics and lumbering from woefully contrived plot point to plot point, finally ending on a 'moral' so pedantic and clichéd that viewers may find themselves pummelling the closest bystander pretending they are one of the characters. Such a mess could have been avoided with even a shade of the manic, inventive stupidity or demented, inspired performances or one liners from any of the collaborators' past hits, and while the occasional moment of fleeting humour (the only noteworthy example is the joyously amoral epilogue, slaughtering political correctness with the sort of gleeful inventiveness the rest of the film could sorely have used) and dregs or worthwhile heart may pop up, they are precariously few and far between. And if the film's content wasn't enough, its nausea-inducing musical score seals the casket, settling the matter that yes, a film can be resoundingly poor on just about every front simultaneously.With the entire film balanced solely on their shoulders, Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly do, to be fair, maintain a comfortably affable and inherently comical chemistry and interplay, and generate the occasional spark of chuckle-worthy material, but to say both peddle their schtick on lazy autopilot would still be a polite way of putting it. Both appear largely convinced that in the absence of good material, simply screeching the lines louder and louder will make them funnier. Not surprisingly, it doesn't. However, they are still the closest to worthwhile element the film has to offer, with a slew of universally irritating and useless supporting characters (even Amy Sedaris, who initially shows potential as a sex-obsessee fawning over Reilly is devoid of charm or mirth). The one exception is Richard Jenkins, who, despite being visibly uncomfortable to be present, at least has the merciful sense to have some fun with his role, infusing his wearily clichéd 'strict father figure' role with credibility and dashes of unhinged energy (his t-rex impression threatens to make the film worth watching for one glorious moment).What could have been another triumphant example of the recent 'less is more' school of comedic film, previously exalted as having resurrected the genre, could instead serve as its sad epitaph, now reduced to a tired, drawn out and downright boring shadow of former hilarity. McKay's Step Brothers may initially have talked the talk, but it certainly does not walk the walk... or even stumble the stumble. What it does do is offer a work shockingly devoid of laughs, which only the most adamant and forgiving fans of the stars should dare to experience, as all others will find avoidance of Step Brothers not only a matter of sensibility, but continuing mental sanity.-3/10",Step Brothers
67,Sirus_the_Virus,Better than expected.,7,21 September 2009,"What is wrong with the recent Will Ferrel comedy Step brothers? To me, not that much. I will admit that Will Ferrel and John C. Reilly are a bit childish, but that is the point of this film. Hey, I didn't think it was a great movie, but I thought that it was pretty funny. I wasn't a big fan of Taledegga nights. I just thought that it was pretty silly. This is director Adam Mackay's third film, not his best but better than Taledegga nights. I think that a lot of this film is funny, but some of this film is silly. You see, I was actually convinced by their performances though. I could actually see them being so childish that it causes divorce. Will Ferrel stars as Brennan Huff and John C. Reilly stars as Dale Doback. They are two forty year old losers who live with their parent. One day, both parents decide to get married. The two guys must become brothers. Richard Jenkins and Mary Steenburgen star as the parents. As they still live with their parents, they fight, and then start to get along. The brothers(Step brothers) get irritated when their parents decide to go on a trip on a boat all around the earth. Living the dream. But when the brothers crash the boat, their parents go off the deep end, and it causes bad things to happen. It should be obvious.It's easy to laugh at this film. I thought it was Will Ferrell's best comedy since Blades of glory. I would say that, because besides this, I didn't see any Will Ferrell comedies. I am not saying that Step brothers is a great film. But it was pretty funny, though weird at times.Step Brothers:***/****",Step Brothers
68,areatw,Very much a 'marmite' comedy,8,25 June 2017,"Everybody agrees on one thing when it comes to this movie - it's incredibly dumb. The plot, the characters, the script, everything about this film is remarkably stupid. Luckily for me, I'm a big fan of remarkably stupid comedy films and 'Step Brothers' is certainly up there as one of my favourites.This is one of those comedies that I know is guaranteed to crack me up when I put it on. Ferrell and Reilly are both hilarious as the brothers. They know how to get laughs out of any content and this material was right up their street.'Step Brothers' is very much a 'marmite' comedy film that certainly won't please everyone, but when it comes to plain stupid comedies, there aren't many better.",Step Brothers
69,blott2319-1,Goofy and sometimes obnoxious,6,27 March 2021,"I have enjoyed other movies about men who never matured past a certain point in their lives. However, I tend to like the ones that present these man-children as more innocent and unassuming. Step Brothers is on the other side of the spectrum and basically makes these grown men act like they have been stuck in their early teens, so they have much more annoying qualities. I disliked a lot of the things they were doing with this film, and was ready to hate it in every way. Yet there's something about Will Ferrell that always wins me over. I don't know what it is, but his brand of comedy works for me, and I found myself genuinely laughing a number of times when I would ordinarily be annoyed.Later on in Step Brothers things get even more ridiculous and that actually elevated the comedy for me. I liked the nonsensical climax and found the ending just barely worked on an emotional level. It's not a great movie with a well-thought-out plot, but there's something about it that works. There are still plenty of things that did nothing for me in the movie. I was thoroughly irritated with most of the characters at one point or another, and I had some real trouble accepting that these parents would put up with their man-babies for so long without forcing them to grow up. Still, there are funny elements in Step Brothers that make it a movie I didn't mind watching, and would probably even watch again.",Step Brothers
70,ElijahCSkuggs,"Silly, stupid humor done pretty well.",7,25 July 2008,"Usually I don't see comedies in the theaters, but since my car was in the shop and wouldn't be ready for another two hours, I decided why not. So I walked the mile to the theater and bought a matinée for Step Brothers. Which, I'm surprised to say, wasn't that bad. Pretty good actually.As you already, know the flick's about Will and John - two grown men who live with their single parents. Well, Will's Mom and John's Dad meet, fall in love, and this is how they become Step Bros. At first they hate each other and they cause havoc, and then they love one another and cause even more havoc. This is causing problems with Mom and Dad and eventually things start falling apart. Can two man children grow up and save the day? I'll be the first to admit that I'm not gaga over Will's flicks. I'm entirely used to his humor and it's become pretty predictable. Here, tell me this doesn't sound like a Ferrell line, ""If you don't watch it I'll take your stomach and punch it. Hard. With my fists!"" Line after line like this tends to become just moderately entertaining and you're left there just waiting for something outrageous to happen. Relying on things to happen, especially in a comedy is ingredients for failure. But with such talented actors who are fully invested in their roles, this movie maintains it's silly charm pretty much the entire way through.It's not about the kinda weak writing, it's about the fantastic delivery that he and John produce during the film. They ham it up to huge heights and I'd be lying if I said it wasn't funny. The sleep walking scenes were incredibly silly and probably my favorite scene from either Talladega or this. Overall, this should easily appeal to people with a sensitive funny bone. I.E. Will Ferrell fans. Low blow? Naaaah. Silly, very stupid and a fart joke for good measure, you could do much worse than this.",Step Brothers
71,jaredmobarak,A combination of Fergie and JesusStep Brothers,7,19 July 2008,"I never in my wildest dreams thought I'd ever utter these words about a Will Ferrell vehicle, especially one with Adam McKay as collaboratorbesides that Pearl video The Landlord on the internet last yearbut here it is. Step Brothers is an absolutely hilarious film. From end to end, I don't remember the last time I've laughed this hard, without stop. This is what Ferrell needs to do, no more of those bio-spoofs of idiots that fall flat due to their tired joke. He is unstoppable as a part of an ensemble when he doesn't have to be the center of attention for an hour and half. The guy is obnoxious, and while funny, the more freedom he gets, the more annoying he is. Having a guy like John C. Reilly to play off of helps rein him in and give the audience a break, allowing the jokes to breath and not become stifled by the monotony of his schtick. Like Old School before it, Ferrell kills in smaller doses. He has shown me that ability again here and whereas I won't even keep Anchorman or Talladega Nights on screen when flipping through the television, I seriously can't wait to revisit this one again.There is no bloated plot involved or even a love interest to distract from the comedy like the previous two ""Everyman"" entries in the Ferrell/McKay tag team's canon. I do believe that is the most refreshing aspect here; they finally see that you don't need a contrived romantic bent to be successful, we as an audience don't need to see the schlubby guy get the attractive girl, that is a cliché used way too often. We go to see a film like this to be entertained and to cause us to wet our pants with unstoppable laughter. As a result there are no lulls as even when the two stars begin to see how they must shape up and become adults for once, the awkwardness brings the laughs as well.Step Brothers isn't winning any Oscars any time soon. With a premise involving the union of two older professionals, both of whom have 40-year old sons still living at home, devoid of responsibility, and lacking serious occupations, what do you really expect? Nancy Huff, (Mary Steenburgen showing that she is still around Hollywood), and Robert Doback, (Richard Jenkins letting his funny side out to complement the wonderful dramatic turn he gave in this year's The Visitor), are in love and perfect for one another. Their sons, unbeknownst to them at first, are also soulmates in the best friend platonic way. Completely the same person, right down to the hiding things in the kitchen while sleepwalking at night, Brennan and Dale are children trapped in adult bodies who waited forty years to be brought together. The chemistry between Ferrell and Reilly is unstoppable on screen, they are having fun, they must be improvising, and truthfully not a second falls flat.With so many gags, one would think it'd all seem a bit disparate and thrown together, but the filmmakers and stars have sewn everything up nicely. You want a rap video that is the most offensive thing you'll hear all year? Get Brennan and Dale to create a music talent agency. You want an a cappella rendition of Guns N' Roses? Give Brennan a cocky, pompous brother who can afford singing/voice listens for his entire familyabsolutely priceless, and Adam Scott kills in this role, ""Pow!"". You need some gratuitous fake nudity? Give Ferrell a chance to rub his genitalia on Reilly's drumset. Check, check, and check. These guys cover all their bases, not to mention the swearing quota. I am surprised that they approved an R-rating here because it is so vulgar. The fact that a couple lines from the trailer didn't make the final cut shows that the actors must have improvised and done multiple takes of each scene. As a result, I'm sure they all tried to be as creatively crass as they could and to fantastic result. Some of the gems that spew forth ever so naturally are one-liners that will be repeated over and over again.Really, it is these vulgarities that make the film that much more enjoyable to me. I think that McKay and Ferrell took a page out of the Apatow machine's book realizing a hard-R can and will sell. No one holds back at all, some of the sarcasm even makes the characters cry because it is so harsh. I love this aspect as it plays into the fact that these are 8-year old adults. Their excess of childlike exuberance and simplicity of mind and lifeand let's not forget the way their parents react by either screaming and going to the Cheesecake Factory bar or coddling them as only a mother can doadds to the absurdity of the situation and the laughs. Dale and Brennan fight, bicker, and eventually do everything together because they aren't just stepbrothers, no they are brothers for life in terms of their internal makeup. Think you and your sibling growing up in grade school, multiply that to the nth degree in terms of sex, violence, and language, and maybe you will be able to imagine what's in store for you once you sit down at the theatre. Just don't forget to stay after the first short run of end credits as the best jungle gym park brawl ever is awaiting you. Those kids didn't even have a chance.",Step Brothers
72,Beta_Gallinger,"So puerile, mean-spirited, disgusting, and...funny?!",7,20 September 2009,"I don't recall hearing anything about this comedy, starring Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly, when it came into theatres last year, but this year, I've come across a copy of it in one of my local video stores more than once, and finally decided to rent it the last time I was there. I knew nothing about its general reception, but had seen Ferrell and Reilly's previous collaboration, ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"", which was also co-written and directed by Adam McKay, just like this one. I thought that film was pretty good, so I figured I should give ""Step Brothers"" a chance. After seeing it, I can safely say it is NOT the same as ""Talladega Nights"". It's definitely more shocking than its predecessor, to say the least, and I can see why so many people would hate it with a passion! However, I have to admit, although comedies like this sometimes disgust me, I found this one pretty funny! Brennan Huff and Dale Doback are two unemployed, underachieving man-children, both around forty years old and still living at home. Brennan lives with his mother, Nancy, and Dale lives with his father, a doctor named Robert. Nancy and Robert are in love, and after they get married, Nancy takes her son and moves in with her new husband and stepson. So, Brennan and Dale are now stepbrothers, forced to share a room, and they immediately hate each other! After a big fight, the stepbrothers soon discover that they have a lot in common, and their rivalry turns into friendship, but their troubles are not over! Dr. Robert Doback tells his son and stepson that they have a week to find a job, or they're out of the house, and their idiocy will make it hard for them to succeed. Other problems in their lives include their sleepwalking, Brennan's arrogant biological younger brother, Derek, who has been successful in his life and wants to sell the Doback house, and the fact that Nancy and Robert want to retire and sail around the world without their sons! There are lots of crude modern-day comedies featuring stupid, childish losers as the main characters, and ""Step Brothers"" is another one of those. These comedies aren't always that funny, and can perhaps sometimes even be terrible, but with this one, the antics of Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly's characters managed to make me laugh many times. There were some parts I found hilarious, such as Brennan touching the drum set Dale has warned him not to touch, and the fight that ensues! Mind you, I didn't like the scene where Brennan rubs his testicles on one of the drums. Graphic genitalia gags like that are part of what made me hate ""Scary Movie"", but fortunately, there's only one of them here. Other parts that made me laugh hard include the job interviews (except maybe the last one, ruined by a long fart joke), the things Brennan and Dale do to try and stop Derek from selling the house, the two stepbrothers' rap music video, and others involving family squabbles, sleepwalking, etc. I may have sometimes even found Alice, Derek's lonely, sex-crazed wife played by Kathryn Hahn, amusing as well. There are also parts I really didn't care for, or wasn't sure exactly what I thought of, such cruel gags as the ""Brennan has a mangina"" flashback and the way the stepbrothers are bullied by elementary school kids. The sex jokes get to be a bit much in some scenes, even for me.When it comes to crude humour, this recent comedy pretty much has it all – jokes about the penis, the vagina, masturbation, bodily functions (though definitely not quite as much toilet humour as sexual humour), etc., plus a lot of swearing and some nasty name calling. It seems to me that it has several things in common with ""Freddy Got Fingered"", a 2001 comedy starring and co-written by the talentless Tom Green, which I hate! Both films have man-children still living at home, lots of crude and juvenile humour, shock value, a man-child getting into a relationship with a sex-crazed woman, and a scene with a father spanking his physically but not mentally grown up son (or stepson, in this case). And yet, so many gags in ""Step Brothers"" actually made me laugh, something which the Tom Green film as a whole failed miserably to do! A major reason for that is probably that the gross-out gags in this film aren't quite as extreme. Still, it's understandable why so many people would despise this Adam McKay/Will Ferrell/John C. Reilly collaboration and look down on anyone who likes it. It's obviously not for kids or anyone who hates crude/juvenile humour in general, and if you ARE into this kind of comedy, then you might laugh or you might want to throw up! At any rate, since it made me laugh so much, I had to give this movie a favourable review, regardless of how many readers might hate me for it!",Step Brothers
73,KnightsofNi11,Hilariously entertaining for what it's worth,7,23 July 2010,"Step Brothers is an uproariously hilarious comedy showcasing the hysterical comedic talent of Will Ferrell (Anchorman, Elf) and John C. Reiley (Magnolia, Chicago). When Brennan Huff's (Ferrell) mother marries Dale Doback's (Reiley) father, tensions immediately grow. Ferrell and Reiley play the perfect immature man-child characters, making for a great amount of hilarious situations to ensue. The two step brothers immediately despise each other. It isn't until they realize that they are the same kind of ridiculous, nerdy, and insane people that they become best friends, wanting nothing more than to please their parents and have a great time doing it. There are plenty of scenes memorable for their disgusting hilarity.Step Brothers is what you would expect from two comedic geniuses like Will Ferrell and John C. Reiley. The movie is nonstop fun with plenty of laugh out loud moments that will leave your stomach hurting, partly from the laughter and partly from the disgusting greatness which their antics entail. It is hard not to laugh at this film, and for what it's worth, it really is a film worth watching if you enjoy the ridiculous kind of comedy Step Brothers thrives on. As the story progresses it brings in a great cast of funny and awkward characters such as Brennan's younger and much more successful brother Derek (Adam Scott). He adds a whole new level to the bizarre and entertaining progression of these characters. Each character is different and, pardon the cliché, special in their own odd way.To me, this is the kind of movie where it isn't necessary to dissect, looking for excelling cinematography or intricate plot and multi-layered characters. It is a film which only serves the purpose of making you laugh. The movie delivers, without taking itself seriously at any moment, and just having fun. If you can't enjoy this film for what it is, then it's your loss. Step Brothers isn't perfect, but it's not trying to be. And that's what makes it the fun little film it is. The story has it's issues, but it's not meant to be excelling in all fields. For this kind of film there's nothing wrong with that. It does somewhat drop off towards the end and felt very strange and rushed. But this is honestly my only valid complaint. It feels as if the filmmakers possibly got a little lazy towards the end of the story, and just wrapped it up with no substance to an otherwise fun and enjoyable story.Step Brothers delivers the laughs, and for a film like this, that is its only intention. It made me laugh. I enjoyed it. It's worth seeing overall.",Step Brothers

75,cultfilmfan,Step Brothers,10,26 July 2008,"Step Brothers is about two single middle aged people who fall in love and soon after get married and of course decide to move in together. There's only one small problem with that because both of them have 40 year old sons who have been used to their parents spoiling them and they have lived at home for their whole lives so now Brennan and his mother Nancy, are moving in with Robert and his son Dale. Naturally, Brennan and Dale don't hit it off at all, which results in a lot of bickering and pulling pranks on the other while their newly married parents are getting tired of their extreme behaviour, their attitude having been spoiled their entire life and pretty much the parents went them to each get a job and move out. This is a much more difficult task than it sounds for these two men who might need to learn to get along together in order to keep their parents together. For the past few weeks the last few films I have been reviewing with the exception of Mamma Mia, have been big Hollywood blockbuster superhero films and as I have stated in those reviews, I was getting tired of those films very fast and other than one or two real knockout films this year, overall it has been quite a weak year for films. Just when I was starting to lose hope for this summer's film line-up, along comes Step Brothers and apart from some critics who just didn't seem to get the film, I personally thought it was great. The film starts off and has continually running through it for most of the time a darker tone to the story and a style which I really got into and admired. Also the film had it's own originality and surely made itself different than a lot of recent comedies. Like some of the more recent R rated comedies, it does rely on a lot of crude and sexual humour, but the writing is all very sharp here and I admit I'm not one to laugh out loud easily, or at all, but this film had me laughing quite hard a couple of times and I was really enjoying myself. The movie also had a different style and tone to it for a mainstream comedy because of the darker tone it starts out with and while it does use a lot of crude humour and gags, it also uses sharp writing and the comic talents of the two main actors involved to pull off some of this material. Some of the funniest and sharpest scenes are just between the two stepbrothers arguing with each other because the writing is on target and the performances completely pull it off. When, I say this film had a darker tone to the first half of it, I don't mean that it's a bleak and depressing film, no, not at all. What I'm more referring to is a more unique and sometimes morbidly funny situations and not morbid because they are gross, or anything like that, but from watching such dysfunction there is a great deal of humour to it, but if you were to live in a family like that one would have to seek therapy, so I think you are beginning to see what I mean by dark. There are a number of feel good parts in the film and overall I left the film in a very good mood after laughing so hard. Normally a film like this wouldn't be the type of thing that I would give a perfect rating to, but for being darker and more original and having top notch comedic performances, writing and just the fact that I haven't laughed at a movie like this in awhile is why I'm giving this film that rating and I'd go as far as to say it's one of the best comedies this year so far. Hopefully next month's schedule of comedies like Pineapple Express, Tropic Thunder and Hamlet 2 will also do the job.",Step Brothers
76,Ruskington,Will Ferrell hits rock bottom,2,17 November 2019,"I have no problem with goofy comedies and I generally enjoy watching Will Ferrell, but this film fell way short of the mark. The bizarre casting choices, the lazy toilet humour, the cartoon-grade acting (the sleepwalking scenes are just pathetic) and the woefully thin plot all combine to leave you feeling bored and, to be honest, a little unclean.The film isn't helped by some truly atrocious casting. The blocky large-framed Will Ferrell looks completely unrelated to the dainty Mary Steenburgen and the pint-sized Adam Scott, making for a ridiculous looking family. And it gets worse with John C Reilly, who looks pretty much the same age as his supposed father Richard Jenkins and shares no physical similarities with him whatsoever. I know this is only a slapstick comedy, but these details still bother me.I hate the fact that we have no explanation of why Ferrell and Reilly have ended up as 40-year old basement-dwellers when just a little bit of backstory would have been enough for this strange scenario to make any sense. The film also gives the message that the parents are the victims here, forever plagued by their useless sons. Many would argue that the situation these characters find themselves in is largely the result of neglectful parenting.And to further confound all this, we see the two sons pull their lives together so quickly and easily at the end of the film. We don't really get to see how they do this- it just kind of happens- which makes you wonder exactly what they've been doing for the last 20 years. Ultimately, instead of a properly developed character arc, we just get an abrupt and illogical redemption story. A real stain on the resume of all involved.",Step Brothers

79,DarthVoorhees,Immaturity at it's finest,7,25 July 2008,"Step Brothers isn't a great film but in this mediocre year for movies it is surely one funny ride. I love Will Ferrel but I haven't been a huge fan of his recent sports films, it seemed that the character he was playing was the same in every film and the premise all ways had Will as a superstar challenged by a set back or competition. I began to get somewhat tired of the typical Will Ferrel film luckily for those who agreed with me Step Brothers' Brennan Huff is actually below the typical Will Ferrel. Let it be known that Step Brothers is not a comedy for everyone, it's highly vulgar and immature and I guarantee that it will be a box office disappointment simply because it is not for mass consumption. Despite that those who like Will Ferrel will love it and I thought it was absolutely hilarious. The script and material is very hit and miss, if we had Jonah Hill in one of these roles it might misfire. There is so much energy and enthusiasm in the performances that we are able to forgive some of the excessive language and vulgarity that lead to some silent moments. Ferrel and Reilly are golden together. The duo are a force and when they are on screen everything is moving fast and humor is thrown at you at every minute, some of it is overly silly but when the two make contact they hit grand slams. There are some moments in Step brothers that I can say were funnier than 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up and Superbad which have been hailed as Holy Grails of comedy. Seth Rogen makes an appearance in this film and while he is funny, he is dwarfed by Ferrell and Reilly. I could see them become a buddy comedy duo similar to well Abbott and Costello or to be more fair Spade and Farley. They have tremendous chemistry and keep the other one on their feet. Upstaging Will Ferrel sounds like am impossible feat but Reilly does it and does it well several times through out the film. Step Brothers falls of being a comedic masterpiece because it doesn't take place in a real world. Everyone surrounding Brennan and Dale are as silly and twisted as they are. Anchorman is a modern comedy masterpiece because Ron Burgundy and his co anchors are clowns living in a world that shows them for what they are. Sure Brennan and Dale are the most eccentric characters in the film but their parents are pretty close behind them.The dialogue is plagued by some of the vulgarity, we get people saying **** for the sake of saying ****. Granted I have the mouth of a sailor myself but it just get's tiresome when it doesn't serve any purpose other than to be edgy.And it isn't just Dale and Brennan who overuse the phrase. SOme of the scenes we think the script is giving us a wink saying ""Look this is edgy and adult humor"". It got ****ing tiresome at times.",Step Brothers
80,qormi,A Little Too Disgusting,1,30 July 2010,"This movie had its high points and I'm not ashamed to say that I was laughing a lot throughout most of the movie. The snotty younger brother was played to perfection. The moments where the parents lost their cool and began swearing was hilarious. The job interview scenes were hilarious. The stay -at-home loser step brothers were hilarious for the most part. The first three quarters of the movie was very funny. Towards the end, it was not. The Catalina Wine Mixer was a disaster. The part where the pychiatrist falls for Ferrell was dumb. The boat - as - treehouse was a terrible way to end the movie. The writers seemed to settle for a bad way to tie things up at the end and this caused the movie as a whole to fail. I also could not get past the vulgarness of some of the routines. The part where Ferrell places his scrotum, in full view, on the drum set was very sickening. The loud, intense farting was very insulting to a sophisticated viewer. The masturbation scene, where Ferrell slips his hand down his pants while watching TV, was very sick. The scene where the younger brother's wife has sex standing up and then relieved herself in a urinal was very sick.It's a shame that a movie that was perfectly cast and had such potential was ruined by blatant, sick vulgarness. Imagine if the great Pink Panther movies, for example, submitted to such base humor. Unnecessary catering to the uncouth members of the audience.",Step Brothers
81,DonFishies,"It is really funny, but suffers from feeling like one sketch after the other",6,4 August 2008,"Brennan (Will Ferrell) and Dale (John C. Reilly) are grown-up, unemployed, and still living at home with their single parents. By chance, Brennan's Mom Nancy (Mary Steenburgen) and Dale's Dad Robert (Richard Jenkins) meet at a conference, fall in love, and decide to get married. The four move in together, and of course, Brennan and Dale cannot stand each other, and begin a love/hate relationship.I went into Step Brothers expecting another great film to add to the plethora of hilarious films from producer Judd Apatow. Unfortunately, I think I was expecting a bit too much.Yes, the movie is downright hysterical in some instances, but there is no grounding for it. The story is there, but it is even less than half baked. The story just grinds from one plot point to the next almost by chance. Halfway through, they throw in the curveball of the parents wanting their sons to make something of themselves, and even add in a subplot involving Brennan's over domineering brother Derek (Adam Scott). But neither seems to help make the film any stronger, or make the story feel any less useless. It just feels like a bunch of random improvisation thrown at the camera, and then edited into a cohesive whole. I realize this is the true beauty of many of the films under Apatow (and one of the reasons his work is so well liked), but there is so little here that you need to wonder if the screenplay that is credited to Ferrell and director Adam McKay actually exists, or is merely a bunch of sketch notes on the back of used cocktail napkins.With such a small scale to work with, you would think that McKay's direction would have outpaced the retro Anchorman or the rather detailed Talladega Nights (with all the spot-on corporate sponsors and NASCAR racing sequences). But even with a smaller budget and so much less to worry about, it seems like McKay just let everyone do what they wanted. Some scenes go on endlessly; others could have been done without entirely. His work here just looks lazy in comparison to his other two films, and it looks like he did very little at all to try and avoid making this fact so blatant. It only makes the thrown together nature of the film feel so much worse (and this comes from someone who thoroughly enjoyed Anchorman and Talladega Nights).As well, other than Ferrell and Reilly, no one else seems to really know what to do. Steenburgen stands helplessly for the majority of the movie, unsure whether she should try to be funny, or just look horrified at the ridiculousness of some of the things that take place. Jenkins has a few genuinely entertaining moments, but he too is stuck negated to watching what is happening, as opposed to acting alongside it. Scott is not funny at all, and looks like he is trying way too hard to be funny in every scene he is in. Some may be amused by cameos by the likes of Horatio Sanz and Seth Rogan, but again, they don't exactly seem all that useful. Kathryn Hahn as Derek's wife Alice gets a lot of laugh out loud moments for her character (perhaps, even more than the two main characters), but her role seems more like a tacked on afterthought than anything else.Now it may sound like I absolutely hated the movie (if for no other reason than the fact that it screams ""Unrated DVD!"" despite being restricted already). The vulgarity and raunchiness that so many critics have been quick to pounce on bothered me very little (as mentioned before, it is the beauty of Apatow's style of comedy). In fact, I could not stop laughing for a lot of the movie. If there is no story, blame that fact on the film being a mere exercise for Ferrell and Reilly to say silly things and act even sillier.As we saw in Talladega Nights, both Ferrell and Reilly have a great sense of chemistry and even better comedic timing. They worked off each other excellently there, and do an even better job here. While their gift for improvisation and quotable dialogue seems to have not let up from years past (delivering some of the year's funniest lines to date), their knack for physical comedy seems to have gotten even stronger. And while there are some rather violent scenes, they all play out to be more hilarious than the last because of the work these two clowns put into them. Even when the film begins to drag its heels, waiting for its finale, these two never let up for an instant. They are dedicated to their craft, and while both have had extraordinary turns in dramatic films (well, Reilly more so than Ferrell), their hearts obviously lie with comedy.Even though I am still quoting Step Brothers days after seeing it, I still cannot help but feel disappointed by the fact that it seemed so thrown together. Step Brothers is not a bad film by any means. But is not a great, or even a good film either. Yes, it is hilarious, and yes, Ferrell and Reilly are a near perfect comedy duo, but the man child shtick this movie plays up has seriously begun to run its course. While it started off as a great idea, it is starting to just stop being funny. Instead of having an actual storyline here, the writers decided to pen their story around these aging ideas. When it gets to the point that there is no need for an actual story, then there should be no need to make a movie. I can only hope that Apatow continues his run for a reason, and not just because he can help get together people who can make good jokes.6.5/10.",Step Brothers
82,the-movie-guy,Hilariously funny but filled with meaningless crude humor,4,24 July 2008,"(Synopsis) Brennan Huff (Will Ferrell) is a thirty-nine year old who has never left home and lives with his divorced mother, Nancy Huff (Mary Steenburgen). Dale Doback (John C. Reilly) is a forty year old who also has never left home and lives with his widower father, Dr. Robert Doback (Richard Jenkins). Both of them are unemployed and have been living off the goodness of their parents their whole lives. Nancy meets Robert; they fall in love, marry, and move into Robert's home. The two sons are forced to live together in the same room as step brothers. Brennan and Dale hate each other, because they don't want to share their parents or change their lives. They are like 12-year olds trapped in adult bodies who haven't grown up and live in their own little worlds. However, things are about to change.(My Comment) This is your typical Will Ferrell movie, and if you are a Will Ferrell fan, you will like this movie. The chemistry and interaction between Ferrell and Reilly is remarkable, and you will begin to believe that they have child-like minds of 12-year olds. The movie is full of one-liners, sight gags, foul language, and gross scenes. Some of the scenes were simply stupid, and put in for shock value. There is a lot of poor dialog with meaningless crude humor that went over the line, and swearing that didn't add anything to the movie. While watching the movie, you get to a point where you can't stand the two characters' immaturity, and you want them to get a life and become men. The movie is funny, and there are some hilarious scenes, but overall don't waste your time. This is not a movie for young children. (Sony Pictures, Run Time 1:38, Rated R)(4/10)",Step Brothers

84,christophe92300,Same path,6,26 November 2012,"Step Brothers follows the same path as the other McKay-Ferrel collaborations: a fast and strong start in a good first half, dynamic, funny and captivating. Then the movie runs out of steam in its second part, with overlong passages and a script that becomes messy and sometimes even boring.The only difference here is that this heterogeneity is a bit less noticeable, maybe because the movie is not as long as other ones like Talladega Nights for example which felt very long.Still, the movie is enjoyable as usual, with crazy characters and a dumb, absurd humour that does the job. Ferrell and Reilly are good like always.",Step Brothers
85,beresfordjd,Warning!!,1,14 January 2011,"This movie will suck the intelligence out of you. I just cannot believe that any grown up actor would want to be part of this pile of manure. What on earth were they thinking? It has no redeeming features at all. It suffers from an unbelievable story and even more unbelievable characters. It is a sorry state of affairs when people who are interested in movies (they must be if they are part of IMDb) can say this rubbish is the best comedy they have ever seen. How dumb can you be? I feel really dumb myself because I keep trying to watch Will Ferrell comedy movies-I should know better because there is not one I could say I really liked. The only decent film I have seen him in was Stranger than Fiction. He seems to repeat himself over and over in each movie, none of them with any idea what comedy is. Avoid this, and anything with Ferrell in it, like the plague. You will be less intelligent after watching this crap. If this is the sort of thing that makes you laugh then you are beyond sad. It is witless, dull and without any kind of merit. I was horrified to see that Mary Steenburgen would lend her talents to this pile of ordure. It is though it was written by 15 years olds but not performed as well as 15 year olds would manage. Will Ferrell is his usual lame self and John C Reilly must have felt like he was dying inside - he is so much better than this. To think that an adult would read this script and think that it was worth doing is beyond my comprehension. Everyone involved should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves. It seems to me that anything with Judd Apatow attached to it will be of this sort of quality, likewise Will Ferrell.",Step Brothers

87,PyroSikTh,Watching Middle-Aged Men Act like Children is Pure Cringe,7,22 October 2018,"Tep Brothers is yet another absurdist comedy from Will Ferrell where he just plays an over-the-top, ridiculous character again. But what can I say? He does it so well. Elf is great precisely because Ferrell just has a knack at being able to tap into his inner child and running with it to its extreme. Paired up with John C. Reilly, who have proven multiple times to share great chemistry, and you get a recipe for success. Step Brothers takes the concept of the overgrown Manchild, and runs to its most extreme form; forty-year old men who are literal children. This is the backbone of all of the humour in the movie, so if this doesn't sound funny to you, this isn't the movie for you.When Nancy and Robert meet on a business trip, they're instantly taken aback by one another, and the similarities they share at home (namely middle-aged Manchildren) seals the deal, forcing Brennan and Dale together. What follows is nearly an hour of these two middle-aged men acting as children thirty years their younger. You could literally refilm the whole movie with ten-year-olds and it would probably work as a coming-of-age drama. Everything from their mannerisms to their off-the-cuff insults, and the way they view the world and their situation is exactly as you'd expect a ten-year-old to act.That's pretty much the whole movie. At least until the end when the family dynamic breaks apart and Brennan and Dale are forced out in the world, and forced to grow-up. The miserable reality of adulthood is painted so painfully yet so hilariously (such as Ferrell wiping his arse with a rug). This all comes to a head with one of the film's most poignant lessons from Richard Jenkins' character. He tells a story of when he was seventeen and enjoyed acting as a dinosaur, until one day he decided he needed to grow up, and put the dinosaur thing on hold, until he got so caught up in being an adult that he forgot how to dinosaur. His lesson was simple; Everyone needs to grow up and act their age, but no-one should completely lose their childish side. As children we have boundless imagination, we have a view of the world so full of innocence, we're driven by curiousity, our number one priority is having fun and enjoying life, we have dreams and ambitions and we're hungry for them, and we live every day without a care in the world, just taking it as it comes. Every adult could do with keeping a degree of these things, and the trick is keeping a balance between them.However I will say, as amusing as I found the movie from beginning to end, it was pretty much 100% cringe. Watching two middle-aged men acting like ten-year-olds is hilarious, but it's also terrible. It's terrible to think of the sheltered lives they have lived, to think of their stunted emotional growth.You can't help but feel for those around them and everything they have to put up with. I particularly felt for the parents as, even though I haven't even been a dad for six years, it's hard work, and these fictional parents put up with it for forty years. Oh my god it's too painful to imagine. On the flipside I saw so much of myself in both Brennan and Dale. Even though I've moved out, have my own family, and enjoy adult responsibilities, I'm still a child at heart. If I hadn't met my wife, I would've been them for sure.So what is it about Step Brothers that makes it a successful comedy? I'm not really sure. Ferrell and Reilly go so deep into the Manchild psyche that it can be a really hard movie to get into. It can be a super uncomfortable watch, and half the laughter you blurt out with his nervous laughter. But Ferrell and Reilly are both masters of this kind of comedy. They improvise their way to some of the most quotable lines in comedy, and they have a brilliant supporting cast to bounce off of. While on some level it definitely looks like someone told Ferrell and Reilly they look like brothers, and they took that as an excuse to act stupidly for an hour and a half, on another level it looks like some genuine thought and enthusiasm went into it as a movie in its own right. I give it a solid 7/10, purely because I don't think I could watch it again.",Step Brothers

89,Shattered_Wake,Will Ferrell returns with some big laughs,8,15 June 2009,"After the extremely disappointing 'Semi-Pro,' Will Ferrell returns with an amazing partner in crime: John C. Reilly. These two light up the screen together as 39 & 40 year old stepbrothers still living at home with their newly wed parents. At first, their animosity keeps them apart and forces them to quarrel like dog and. . . another old dog. But, as they learn more about one another, they become the best of friends. . . things get complicated, however, when their unhappy parents decide to kick them out of the house due to their plans for a divorce.This is, without a doubt, the funniest film I've seen all year. The humour ranges from slapstick/physical stupidity to hilarious insulting comedy to cheesy family-style laughs. The story works well and Ferrell/Reilly perfectly capture the twelve-year-old-in-a-40-year-old-body roles they had. The writing is a little iffy at the start, but once the story gets rolling, everything flows wonderfully, all the way through the great conclusion.Overall, this is a can't-miss for fans of Ferrell's (and similar) work.Final verdict: 8/10.-AP3-",Step Brothers
90,jts0405,Ferrell does it again!!,10,25 July 2008,"Will Ferrell has always been known for his stupidly scripted dumb comedies that have made him well known all around. Earlier this year he came out with Semi Pro, which wasn't as great as it could've been but still was a decent comedy. But I just recently saw Step Brothers and literally laughed from the opening credits to the end credits. This movie is definitely a hilarious movie. It was really a great choice to team Ferrell with John C. Reilly again.I was strangely surprised that this got an R rating, but it definitely was worth the R rating. Ferrell continues to make the most pointless movies, but somehow I enjoy all of them because he really just makes you laugh uncontrollably for very long periods of time. I definitely recommend that those of you who haven't better go see Step Brothers in theaters. It was well worth it for me.10/10",Step Brothers

93,diac228,Warning: This film is very dumb. Warning 2: It is also hilarious to watch.,7,14 June 2009,"Welcome to Masterpiece Theater. In this program, we study, analyze, and praise only the most prestigious, mature, sophisticated, and acclaimed works in modern cinema. The next film in our program features male nudity, random humor, quirky one-liners, obscenities sprinkled like spices on meat, and enough immaturity to make Saturday morning cartoons appear to look like Mozart's 22nd piano concerto. The highly sophisticated and charming Will Ferrell teams up with dashing John C. Reilly as they deliver us a trip down a level of integrity rarely ever seen in movie-making. The result is a comedy so low in the intelligence scale, it doesn't require anything past a 2nd grade education to truly appreciate what a show they've put on.In this comedy full of Shakespearean integrity, we find two men who fail to live up to their dreams, being forced to share the same house and the same parents. With their personalities being so alike, they start clashing like two extremely powerful magnets facing each other. However, as time moves on, they become close like brothers (as the clever title states) and attempt to succeed with each other's help. This script, helmed by Reilly, Ferrell and Adam McKay (Our director), combines crude humor with more heart than a dead flea for approximately 98 minutes. So, it's never too long and never too preachy.Full of whimsical material, Step Brothers never quite loses focus in the art it's portraying. Whether it's engaging in a nasty battle against much younger kids, having to come in contact with feces, rapping about anatomy below the waist, fighting multiple times, making detailed threats about extraneous activities, speaking like a careless sailor, or even playing around with an extremely dangerous weapon in multiple instances, our heroes of the story encounter many, many obstacles. Just when you think the plot runs out of ideas, we get another surprise.That being said, before engaging in a viewing session with this work of classy art, one must develop a taste for it. If you didn't quite comprehend the quality of Anchorman or Talladega Nights, then odds are you will not appreciate Step Brothers. You must be immune to absolute stupidity, absurdity, and crudeness that you just usually do not see. Ferrell has perfected his art of being a lovable oaf with the smarts of a sack of refined beans. If you do enjoy this sort of art though, then there's no reason why you will not engage in a spirited chuckle once in a while. You will be referencing the movie long after the credits roll; it's just a part of nature.Bottom Line: On the offchance that you missed every hint towards sarcasm in the previous several paragraphs, Step Brothers is quite possibly the most immature movie in the history of modern film-making. With that being said, as long as you have the acquired taste and are willing to accept stupidity for a long period of time, you'll have a blast. The chemistry between the actors is phenomenal, as Ferrell and Reilly seemed destined to work together. The plot throws our main characters into many different scenarios, disallowing you a chance to see what's going to happen next.

It was kind of supposed to be guys night for our Home Group guys but we were the only two who showed. On the way James made it known he was looking forward to seeing this movie probably about as much as I was keen to see ""Titanic"" back in the day. By the time we got to the cinema we had a little dilemma on our hands as several other options had been discussed, one being that we see ""Mummy 3"" instead. Obvious that neither of us would be happy seeing each others suggestion, we did what any 2 guys comfortable with each other would do- we saw our pick by ourselves (note: no two girls would ever do this. Ever. Too many feelings would be hurt). Here's my IMDb.com review.With the lack of decent comedies coming out these days, and the ""mailing it in"" efforts of late of such screen giants as Stiller and Sandler, not much not featuring Will Ferrell grabs my attention. So when his latest movie came out, stamped with a hilarious premise, they had me hook,line and sinker.""Stepbrothers"" is the story of two losers (Ferrell and Reilly) who's lives living with their single parents is torn apart when their parents meet and marry, meaning they have to move in together. Initially they hate each other, but soon discover some similarities and form a bond. This is dashed though when their invasion on their parents lives cause them to separate. Can they get their parents back together and live together again? See it to find out.Pretty crude at times,but that comes with the territory these days with Will movies. The thing I appreciate is he tries lots of quirky stuff, some of it fizzes and other bits are gold (see the fight with the kids,Billy Joel tribute band, the psychologist scenes, the name pronunciations etc). Some great costumes,often stealing the scenes eg the Chewbacca mask. Ferrell and Reilly are great, with great support from Adam Scott as Derek. Not a comedy classic by any stretch, and dragged a fair bit in stretches when the comedy was dull, but some good moments.I gave it a 6/10, which was interesting when reviewing the IMDb ratings .Basically under 18 males gave it a 7.8, 18-29's gave it a 7.2 and the 30+'s gave it a 6.4, which is right in my demographic.For the record, James and I caught up at the end any had a lovely dessert and chat at ""The Pancake Kitchen"".

A comedy that searches for the lowest common denominator, is devoid of life and invention and replaces ideas with formulas is in very big trouble. As a result I award my lowest ever IMDb score.Director and writer Adam McKay is hopelessly out of his depth with a feature length, his history with Saturday Night live (which he shares with co writer Will Ferrell) is the clue. As a 90 second sketch the premise of this film has legs,at 98 minutes it is 96 1/2 minutes too long.Ferrell and Mckay are both the same age that they are writing about, but do so with no comic ingenuity or insight.The premise of the film is of two mature singletons who get together with 40 year old sons still living at home. The joke is that they behave like 15 year olds. this is funny for about 30 seconds.It then moves into weird, bordering onto infantilism.I have no problem with base, gross, profane, crude humour aimed at amusing 13 -15 year olds.But in casting the protagonists as grown men playing children it patronises children whilst causing adults to question the sexual motivation of what is going on here. and when in doubt say ""fuck"", thats bound to get a laugh isn't it?

I'll start off by saying that I don't get it. I just don't get it. I'd have thought comedy had hit its low with the Seltzerberg movies. Those ""films"" are the most dreadful excuses for comedies ever. I had put off seeing Step Brothers because I had a bone to pick with Ferrell for that painfully unfunny ""Semi Pro"". OK SP wasn't that bad, but it did have its moments, which, unfortunately, just never amounted to anything that wasn't ""A handful of funny moments that somehow just didn't manage to make a comedy effective"".And then there's Step Brothers.Come it's DVD release, everyone raves about it. I'm being called an idiot for not having seen it. Unable to take any more pressure, I rent the movie.This film does have a few funny moments, but they only amount to chuckles. I refer to when Ferrell, dressed as a Nazi, asks his brother ""Sprechen zie D--k?"", and the music video created by the brothers. Aside from that this just isn't anything new from Ferrell OR McKay. Will Ferrell plays the same character he did in Old School and Reilly does the same, with his character in Talladega.The formula of the film is annoyingly simple: ""I'm your step brother, I f--king hate you."" *cue music to show how much they hate each other* ""GAAAAH I FRACKIN HATE YOU I HATE YOU OK never mind I'm sorry I love you let's go bug mom and dad off."" *insert music to show how tight as buds they are* ""Hi Will Ferrell, I have a family and am more successful than you losers."" *insert music to show the dilly of a pickle they're in*. Now imagine a whole movie 2 hours of that. That in itself is pretty annoying.Furthermore the movie just didn't give me a reason to love these losers. I spent the whole movie rooting for the parents really. It made me feel depressed- me being barely out of my teens I couldn't help but feel for the parents that they're stuck with their jobless loser sons. Moreover, you know something is wrong when Adam Scott and Mary Steenburgen are funnier than Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly in a comedy full of WF and JCR humour.To Adam McKay, PLEASE don't let Ferrell have a hand in writing your next comedy!!! Penises and Masturbation isn't a passable topic for jokes anymore. Teabagging a drum kit isn't funny. A flimsy bunk bed, as you guessed it, isn't funny. Pummelling a playground full of kids isn't funny. And the ""Cops"" joke??? Are we stuck in the 90s or something? Mind you half the film was improvised, and while this worked for the brilliant Anchorman since that film was a subtle parody of 70s news workplace sexism, it's just bad here.I cry for our society.

Reilly, is a highly stupid and irreverent comedy that is far from forgettable or average. Two forty-year old losers with serious mental issues are forced into becoming step-brothers when their single-parents marry and move in together. Initially, they are hostile towards one another and after a brawl on the front lawn in front of the entire neighbourhood, they finally find common ground in their resistance towards the punishment that their parents inflict on them, as though they were eight year-old boys. Turns out that they may as well be biological brothers, because they are one and the same. And no drum-set, boat or person, for that matter, is safe.The most memorable thing from ""Step Brothers"" is a rap music-video that features the two leads dressed up as sailors and rapping on a cruise boat. The brilliant John C. Reilly's father marries Will Ferrell's mother. In another hilarious scene at the beginning Reilly is trying to convince his father not to let his new wife and her son move in with them. His reasoning being, just because you're married, doesn't mean they have to live here. He then goes on to paint a scenario where his new step-mom will see him naked when he gets out of the shower and will decide that she has had 'the old bull' and now wants 'the calf.' Richard Jenkins's reaction is priceless.Extremely crude, what differentiates ""Step Brothers"" from a run-of-the-mill gross-out is some fine tuning from director Adam McKay, who originally wanted this to be a serious drama, so the script is somewhat polished. His two leads could not have been better; two natural-born comedians. Unfortunately, it does degenerate at points and unnecessarily reduces itself on one occasion to a lame 'fart joke' that I found to be extremely poor. It's just redundant and something that stopped being funny in the schoolyard. Ferrell rubs his testicles off of a drum-set in one scene, now that was much better! Can't say I've seen that being done before. On a serious note, Adam Scott's rendition of 'Sweet Child O' Mine' with his on-screen family is truly magnificent. Even if he does end up swerving in to on-coming traffic...",Step Brothers
108,dommercaldi,Family Fun Comedy With Will Ferrell At His Best,7,1 April 2020,"Pros:
1. The humour is laugh-out-loud and provides for great family entertainment.
2. The scene where Derek (Adam Scott), Alice (Kathryn Hahn) and their children sing their rendition of 'Sweet Child O' Mine' is one of the best comedic scenes ever, and serves as a good introduction to the pretentious character of Derek.
3. There are fantastic comedic performances by Will Ferrell (Brennan Huff) and John C. Reilly (Dale Doback), which accompanied with equally fantastic side performances by Mary Steenburgen (Nancy Huff), Richard Jenkins (Dr. Robert Doback), Adam Scott, Kathryn Hahn, and Rob Riggle (Randy).
4. There is brilliant chemistry between all of the actors. It's clear that they had a blast filming this movie.
5. Even though this film is an over-the-top comedy, it still does a decent job at hitting home emotional moments. Whether it be the adverse impact of Brennan Huff and Dale Doback on Nancy Huff and Dr. Robert Doback's marriage, or highlighting how adulthood saps the natural joy, wonder, and creativity that comes with childhood.
6. The ending is suitably warm and light-hearted.Cons:
1. The rivalry between Dale Doback and Brennan Huff could have been developed more, as it comes to a stop after the first 20 minutes.
2. The film is over-edited at times with too many cuts.",Step Brothers

110,noahgibbobaker,A pleasant surprise.,5,22 September 2020,"I thought I was going to hate manchild the movie, and I hated some moments. In the end though I was pleasantly surprised with a curiously cute story.I didn't think a lot of the humor was funny, I don't like Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly throwing tantrums and saying stupid things, we get it their dumb and immature. This happens so much throughout this film and it really got on my nerves by about the 30 minute mark. A lot of the gags also felt like they were only in the movie, so one there are just more jokes in it, and two to pad runtime. I hated these unnecessary scenes that I didn't find funny for the most part. I don't think the jokes are all bad though I definitely chuckled quite a few times, but I didn't get the same hilarious experience that others seem to have with step brothers. I can't deny how quotable many of the lines are either, I was quoting this movie before I had even seen it.Technically step brothers is very boring, nothing is done awfully but nothing is don't really well either. I know that the technical components are not a focus of this movie at all but they are still an element that I thought was extremely lacking.Step brothers is not a dense movie so I only have one more thing I'd like to mention and that's the ending. I love the song Por ti volare by Andrea Bocelli, Will Ferrell's cover of it is not as bad as it could have been, and one of the funniest moments in my opinion.I was surprised I liked step brothers at all as it is really not my type of movie. I really see the appeal of this movie and get why a lot of people love it.",Step Brothers

Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly work well together and pull off some great humour in this moderate film.A crude, coarse, unimaginably insane film with some stand out moments.Modest yet funny.4/10",Step Brothers
112,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,"Formulaic and predictable, yet will get roars of laughter despite being downright flat",8,26 July 2008,"I had an epiphany during this movie. And it was this. Will Ferrell's (and others) brand of humor may make me laugh during the film, but afterward, his act has become stale. Unfortunately, Ferrell proves with this film that most comedians are like light bulbs. They're bright for awhile, but eventually they will burn out.There's no denying that Step Brothers is hilarious when you're sitting in the theater. I found myself screaming with laughter numerous times. You're going to be bombarded with the typical silly Ferrell humor (which is actually kind of refreshing after 3 years of sports parodies), but instead of the usual silly jokes, the writers (which include the Lord of all things vulgar, Judd Apatow) decide to create the most inappropriate, vulgar, cringe worthy comedy of the last few years. It's dirtier than all of the related Apatow joints.As for our comedic talent, there's no denying the comic abilities of Ferrell and John C. Reilly, but to be honest, I am getting tired of seeing Ferrell do this with his career. He has the potential to do a lot more with his career (see: Stranger Than Fiction), but here he stays stuck in this endless rut of boring and repetitive R-rated kiddie jokes. It's excusable for John C. Reilly, who has shown a ton of flash outside of the world of silly comedy (Chicago, The Good Girl). He's great in his role, though both brothers are very shallow characters which I didn't really care for. The best way to describe both the performances of Ferrell and Reilly, as well as the film's humor, is to say it's basically as if you take a time machine to when you were 8, but you brought with you the jokes you've learned from your teen and young adult years and were not afraid to yell them at your parents. The parents in this film are admirable, especially from Richard Jenkins, who provides more than a few laughs. Adam Scott is also great in the typical ""a-hole"" role.The character development wasn't as good as a typical Apatow brand product, however I believe this can be credited to the fact that Apatow's dirty-yet-clever humor was blended with the ridiculous and silly comedy of Adam McKay and Will Ferrell. On paper, it sounds like a brilliant collaboration, but it ends up being an offensive, dirty mess. The film is also very formulaic and predictable.I saw this with a girl that I liked, and I've never recalled walking out of a theater feeling more awkward. We shook it off, but we both agreed that it was a movie we would rather never watch again, and that when we looked back on the night, we would instead think about the conversations we had, not the movie. Once again, there's no denying that Step Brothers will make the audience roar with laughter. It's just that when the film ended, I found myself feeling very awkward and uncomfortable. Men, if you go with a group of the guys, I think it could be a decent guy's night. Ladies, I don't know what to say with you. The one I was with laughed, but in the end she really didn't enjoy herself.",Step Brothers

I'm not a big fan of Will Ferrell; he has some great films but most of them are just lame. He shines in this one and the whole film is about brotherly love. John C. Reilly also plays and surely is a great role for this. The line delivery and overall dialogue is definitely note-worthy and great to share. They're just too damn funny! Then after the parents split up, it's up to them to get them back; hilarity ensues. I'm sad that all the serious people find this movie to be the stupidest thing ever. They need to find a sense of humor and understand that the film is just plain fun, nothing more. I found it to be one of the funniest movies ever, I was laughing NON-STOP!

I also felt it was too crude at times and those scenes weren't as funny as they needed to be to justify their inclusion. In ""There's Something About Mary"" you forgive the ""bleeder"" and ""hair gel"" jokes because there were plenty of other gags to keep you laughing.You have to admire Ferrell and McGinley for both making themselves look really silly and for their work on the script but that didn't make up for the films other deficiencies.",Step Brothers
116,dobbin-4,Good Random. Quite Happy With Ferrell and Reilys efforts.,7,7 October 2008,"Will Ferrell is a hit and miss sort of actor. He has many extremely good films to his name but every known then his man child character is just lame. This is indeed one of the good ones in my eyes.The Movies starts off funny and builds from there, and the film always has you laughy throughout. Sure the film is not brilliantly made but it is good to sit down and watch, maybe even twice. The silly humor really fits in as well as the premise fits that humor perfectly.As for the actors themselves, Ferrell and Reily have got to be some of the best actors for playing the man child, and I cannot honestly decide who does the best out of the two. Both comedians have had sensational careers this past few years (Ferrell has Talladega Nights, Blades Of Glory, Anchorman and Reily has Chigago, Walk Hard and Talladega Nights) and this movie is honestly laugh a minute.Overall, this film is a great one to watch with a friend, remembering not to take it seriously at all as there is nothing in there that can be taken seriously. I will give this film 74%. It was funny and there is nothing wrong with that even if the comedy is not extremely clever.",Step Brothers
117,HelloTexas11,fairly amusing Ferrell vehicle,5,23 January 2009,"According to my own unscientific survey, Will Ferrell is one of the more polarizing figures in comedy to come along recently. People either really like him or really detest him. Not much middle ground. Fortunately for Ferrell, those in the former group make up sufficient numbers to have propelled him to the top of the comedy heap when it comes to profitable movies. I count myself among that group. Having said that, 'Step Brothers' is not one of his better efforts. Teamed this time with John C. Reilly, the film is deliberately profane and low-brow, so that's not the problem. Its main conceit, that the two are forty-year-old men who operate on the emotional level of thirteen-year-old spoiled brats, is not really adequate to carry the flick and comes perilously close to wearing out its welcome early on. But 'Step Brothers' soon becomes more of an excuse for Ferrell and Reilly to riff off one another, like (dare I say?) an extended Saturday Night Live skit featuring their respective characters, Brennan and Dale. Though the batting average for the various gags is not high, it is to the two comedians' credit that they come up with enough funny stuff over the course of the film to keep us from becoming too critical and walking out of the theater. Whether or not a lot of the material is improvised, I don't know, but it feels like it is. The interaction between Brennan and Dale much of the time is like watching an episode of 'Whose Line Is It Anyway?' Occasionally you think, these guys are good, and other times, they rate a groan. Actually, Richard Jenkins, as Dale's put-upon father, steals many scenes with his frustrated, infuriated responses to the two overgrown kids' mischievous and at times, near-fatal tomfoolery. He is crucial for the comedy to work as well as it does, and his dialogue is often the funniest, as when he listens to Dale spew line after line of bs for what must be the thousandth time and then finally screams, ""Would you shut the f*** up!"" 'Step Brothers' meanders along without much point, veering wildly between humorous scenes and ones that fall flat, reaching not so much a climax as a place where the filmmakers seemingly decided to just turn the cameras off. Neither Ferrell's best nor worst, it's an okay way to kill a couple of hours if you're a fan. Not much more than that, though.",Step Brothers
118,jemps918,Not for the easily grossed out!,7,9 September 2008,"Who knows how much longer these Judd Apatow/Will Ferrell types of comedies can be sustained? Just when we thought their jokes were getting old, they come out with Step Brothers, a comedy directed by Adam McKay starring Ferrell and John C. Reilly, both from the similarly bawdy Talledega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby.This time, they play spoiled 40-year old brats still living with their single parents (Mary Steenburgen is definitely MILF-material as Ferrell's mom). More vulgar hilarity ensues when their folks wed and live in the same house, and the newfangled stepbrothers have to live with each other. This is when the cliché ""all hell breaks loose"" would be appropriate.It's difficult not to laugh at this movie especially during the incredibly irreverent, shocking and embarrassing situations every cast member so straight-facedly portrays.

Some of the jokes are very funny (and I won't give those away).

120,kingofdanerds,A spiritual sequel to Talladega Nights and a spiritual prequel to Holmes and Watson,7,10 March 2021,"2006 saw the release of Talladega Nights, a film that starred Will Ferrell and John C. Reily. The pair would team up again in 2008 with the film Step Brothers and again in 2018 with Holmes and Watson (which I do not recommend watching). Of those three films, it is Step Brothers that seems to have a bigger following is more fondly remembered. For me, Step Brothers was for the longest time one of my favorite comedies of all time. But, now that I am much wiser, does Step Brothers still manage to hold up? Step Brothers was released in 2008 with mixed reviews but in recent years has managed to get a massive following. To a point that fans demand a sequel and to another point to where people were tricked by the Holmes and Watson trailer where it was made out at first to be a trailer for Step Brothers 2. Step Brothers was directed by Adam McKay who directed Talladega Nights and the Anchorman films. The film stars Will Ferrell and John C. Reily in the main roles with people like Richard Jenkins, Mary Steenburgen and Adam Scott in the film as well.Dale and Brennan are middle aged men who still live with their parents. Both of their parents get married to each other and now Dale and Brennan are step brothers. Simple as that..... well, at least without giving everything away........Step Brothers has a very simple plot. For some, that can be a good thing or a bad thing. For big shot critics, it is probably a bad thing. But for just a casual viewer, it works. Which also makes for easy repeat viewings of this film. Step Brothers is a feel good type of film. When one is down in the dumps, Step Brothers is there for you. Big thanks in large part to the cast. The two leads have great chemistry together and it works best in this film. I think the two leads really play the whole immature adult act really well. They act like teenagers and it all makes sense because of how they live their life and whatnot. There is just nothing to read really deep into here. The comedy is really funny and this film relys on the raunchy potty mouth humor. Which is fine for me as a viewer. But do know that if you are not into that type of humor, this is a film not for you. There are a few moments and plenty more if watching the extended version that it is just not all that funny. The humor that is funny, is quite memorable and even quotable. Chances are, you have probably heard someone quote this film. The humor is often described as dumb smart comedy and that is right on point. It is not smart, but for a dumb comedy, it really is smart. The extended version adds nothing new in terms of story or anything. Just extra scenes that clearly were not all too funny to be in a theatrical release. So, just stick with the original version of the film. Other than that, the story overall follows a familiar formula making for an overall predictable film in terms of stories. The jokes though, will leave you surprised.Step Brothers does not entirely hold up as much as I would like to remember but it is still a fun dumb-smart comedy that I will certainly go back to plenty more times in the future.",Step Brothers

Tropic Thunder was hilarious yes but this one is just plain hysterical, a laugh-out-loud raucous fest from the powerhouse comedy duo Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly. Directed by Adam McKay, Step Brothers is about two immature dorks who move in to each other after both their single parents gets hitched. Will Ferrell's hilarious antics and great improv skills are best used when he's sparring with another comedic actor, his best bud and Talladega Nights co-star John C. Reilly. He shares the spotlight with John and honestly, he's actually more efficient and effective when he's not the lead star and making all the laughs. This way, you never get tired of the movie and after it ends, you'll want more of their crazy adventure.The obnoxious jokes, the hilarious antics of both actors and their characters and the display of immaturity is staggering, and you will laugh hysterically, you might even pee in your pants that I'm sure of.

122,Gideon24,Silly but watcable,7,23 May 2015,"Will Ferrell and John O'Reilly reunite for Step Brothers, a silly and over-the-top 2008 comedy that asks the viewer to accept a lot, but if you can, finding major belly laughs here shouldn't be a problem.Ferrell plays Brennan, a 40-something unemployed bum still living with his widowed mother (Mary Steenburgen). O'Reilly plays Dale, a 40- something unemployed bum who lives with his widowed father (Richard Jenkins). Brennan's mom and Dale's dad meet, fall in love, and decide to get married forcing Brennan and Dale into a familial relationship neither wants that we watch morph into a friendship and eventual business partnership.First of all, you have to wonder why Brennan and Dale's parents are still allowing their 40 year old sons to live with them. You also have to wonder why the parents tolerate the guys' childish behavior or why they didn't tell the boys to hit the road the second they decided to marry. I'm pretty sure there isn't a parent on the planet who would continue to support a 40 year old unemployed child, but if you can just let all of this flow over you, there is fun to be had here.Ferrell and O'Reilly prove that the chemistry they created in Talledega Nights was no fluke and it is kind of funny watching the relationship change...the beginning is especially funny when they are forced to share a bedroom and begin snarking at each other in the dark, trying to make each other feel like the intruder. Even when their parents give them 30 days to get a job, they actually job hunt together, evidenced in a couple of very funny scenes, especially one that features a cameo by Seth Rogen.Adam McKay's direction is loose and having worked with the actors before, seems to know when to let them go and when to rein them in. The presence of Steenburgen and Jenkins actually give the piece a touch of class that I'm not sure it really deserves. Adam Scott is also very funny as Brennan's snotty younger brother, as is Kathryn Hahn as his wife, who starts lusting after Dale after he punches her husband in the face.The comic gold in the on screen chemistry between Will Ferrell and John O'Reilly is reason enough to breeze through the over-the-top silliness of Step Brothers.",Step Brothers

What the rating system needs is a zero or negative numbers as this movie does not even rate a zero. The group that was watching this flick were all Ferrell and Reilly fans, but after 20 minutes most had left the room. I'll have to admit that no one stayed to watch the entire flick, even the most die-hard Ferrell fan, so this review is only based on what was watched. And even then it was painful. What were Jenkins and Steenburgen thinking when they decided to be in this movie? Both are fine actors, and if not for them this flick would have been turned off sooner.

It is degrading to the intelligence of anyone who actually condescends to watching it, it offers nothing of worth in any category and it loses itself in a festering ball of pathetic, sorry ass-felching crap that I would rather have a root canal than watch again. It's about two thirty or forty year old guys who live with their single parents. When the parents end up meeting at a business conference of sorts, the two men are forced to try and get along. Well, they don't, and what follows is a gamut of immature genitalia jokes, farting jokes, masturbation jokes and, to top it all off, Will Ferrell's balls rubbing on a drum set. I swear I'm not making that up.So, yeah, the jokes are by far the worst part. Will Ferrell had a hand in writing this screenplay, and to that I say, don't let this man touch any more scripts. Seriously, this is awful. Do you still think jokes about penises and masturbating are hilarious? Do you like watching grown men cry and shout curses at each other at the top of their lungs? Well, then, you're a disgrace to humanity, and this movie is for you! Every moment of this godforsaken piece of cinematic bowel cancer is just painful, every last minute of it. It's clear that there is a story trying to happen here, but when you have dialogue about wanting someone to crawl into your vagina and live there, well, it's a bit hard to let it blossom. I swear, I'm not making that up, either.The worst part about this movie is that our two main characters are supposed to be likable, more so than Will Ferrell's brother character, played by Adam Scott. The brother is made out to be a horrible, obnoxious and rude person who takes pleasure in talking down to and humiliating his older brother, who, if I might remind you, is forty years old and living at home. Yeah, this movie wants us to feel sorry for Will Ferrell and his new buddy, but the problem is that they're even worse and more asinine than the brother is! It doesn't work as an inspirational coming-of-age story not just because the two characters are already OF age, but because we don't like the two main characters! They're insipid, shallow, rude assholes and I just wanted to shoot them for the better part of the story. It doesn't work as a comedy because nothing is funny, it's just sad.Yeah, and there's one part where they try to bury each other alive, which is where the movie officially hits an all time low. It's like something you'd read out of a tabloid newspaper column after you've already read through everything worth reading. Or maybe like something off of one of the online 'weird news' categories. It's pathetic, and all it really does is make you embarrassed to still be watching this movie.So then we get the end of the movie, which turns things around and sees the two guys reforming themselves and starting to live real lives. It is kind of nice, at least as an apology for the rest of the insufferable crap on here, but in the context of the movie? It's like two completely different films mashed together, and it's even kind of insulting that a movie that features insurmountable levels of grotesque and puerile farces against the film industry's integrity would actually try to have, in the same movie as the dialogue about crawling into a woman's vagina, a ""moment"" between the two brothers. Yes, we're expected now to put down our barf bags and pick up a tissue box. Good god.Well, I don't buy it. This movie is wretched. It is unpleasant, it is unfunny and most of all it is mostly unwatchable. I've never seen anything quite so shameless. This whole movie is actively detestable and hateable.

This movie pulls out all the stops in crude language, cheap sexual references, childish adult behavior, Three Stooge's type violence and all around cruelty. It can be outrageously funny but it is mainly a man-boy movie. I think most women and sensitive, moral, sophisticated or artistic types would be turned off by it. Not only do we have the crudeness duel between step brothers Reilly and Ferrell, but Ferrel's upscale stage brother, his business colleagues and his family are all vying for the brass ring of crudeness too. Trouble is that such a juvenile movie is so crude that it got an ""R"" rating. If they cleaned it up a bit they could have gotten a ""PG"" rating and opened it up to a larger audience of children whose emotional maturity would be a match to this movie's.

Oh that's right, Adam McKay, the guy who directed and wrote that movie and also directed and wrote this one (There was a script? Really?). It felt like amateur hour at an imrov club. Occasionally something funny gets said or done, but you have to wait through a lot of crude, unfunny crap inbetween.Reilly seems to have abandoned subtlety in comedy altogether. Ferrell plays an even bigger dumber lout than usual, still mistaking screaming for comedy. They are beyond quirky to the point of being cartoons. Make that cartoons you feel kind of bad for. Only Adam Scott comes out of this retaining his dignity as the sort of evil other brother to Ferrell's character. Seth Rogen shows up for a cameo scene to remind us how people can seem like real characters and still be funny.Yes I love Anchorman, but I'm beginning to think that McKay is like a comedic M. Night Shymalan. He had one good movie in him. Period. The bar for taste could not honestly get lowered. There were some surprise laughs once in awhile, but I was considering leaving about half-way through..Once the ""rift where the characters learn about growing up"" occurs, McKay tries to squeeze this monstrosity into the cliché comedy mold, and it all feels even more awkward. Like only then they realized how ridiculous and unfunny it all was. The cartoons try to become actual people, and it's all just too painful. There is one bright light: Ferrell can actually sing (which I already knew from The Producers). Did we need to go through an entire movie to see it? Painfully dumb, Step Brothers gets a D+",Step Brothers
128,Bravesfan17,"Not as good as Talladega Nights, but still funny",7,22 May 2010,"Step Brothers marks the third collaboration between director Adam McKay and Will Ferrell. This movie is not as good as Talladega Nights, but it still has a lot of laughs. Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly become step brothers when Ferrell's mom (Mary Steenburgen) and Reilly's dad (Richard Jenkins) get married. Neither Brennan (Ferrell) or Dale (Reilly) are happy about it. They hate each other and then get into fights. Then they start having a good time when they find out that they both have common interests.McKay makes the laughs keep coming and makes a solid effort. It lacks the originality and morality that Talladega Nights had. Ferrell and Reilly show that they can repeat the same chemistry that they had in Talladega Nights. Anyone who is a fan of Will Ferrell, John C. Reilly, or any other Frat Pack comedies should check this out.",Step Brothers
129,Jamie_Seaton,one of the best comedies this year,10,15 October 2009,what a brilliant movie. it made me laugh all the way through. its kinda weird because the last film i seen with Will Farrell and John C.Reilly in was Talledega Nights which i thought was rubbish. but they are both flawless in this movie as two dumb people who still live with there family. well the story sort of goes like this. Will Farrell and John. C.Reilly's characters are basically middle aged wasters that have to get used to each other because there parents get married. the silliness in this film is unreal and the 2 main leads are brilliant. i thought the very brief appearance by Seth Rogen is fantastic too.i really do love the films these directors are making. they work amazingly as a team and really do a brilliant job of making films so funny. i hope Judd Apatow and Adam McKay make more brilliant comedies like this one. if you love this movie then try The Dewey Cox Story and Superbad........ 10/10.......j.d Seaton,Step Brothers

134,jaredpahl,Smartly Stupid Comedy Classic,8,24 April 2019,"Lists of the greatest movie comedies often include the likes of Tootsie, Moonstruck, Annie Hall, or other sophisticated, amusing, but not necessarily laugh out loud hilarious films. All of those movies listed are great, some of them are exceptional, but for me, the question of comedy greatness revolves around one thing; laughter. While the ""smart"" comedies are often richer dramatic experiences, they don't make me laugh with a fraction of the delirious joy that the absurdist riot, Step Brothers, does. Adam McKay's third collaboration with Will Ferrell is among the funniest movies I have ever seen (Its only real competition is with McKay and Ferrell's other collabs) because of its total commitment to funny. There is a surplus of cinematic talent here, and all of it is put to the task of making me laugh. Step Brothers proves once again that smart comedy can be incredibly stupid, and stupid can be very, very funny.How exactly are these major laughs accomplished? Well, start with a premise that opens pathways for humor. How about two 40-year-old man-children (Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly) who still live with single parents? How about their parents get married, and they become step brothers who hate each other, but bond over time? Good start, I'd say. Now, think about a put upon dad (Richard Jenkins) as the straight man, an insufferable douche bag brother (Adam Scott), and a sweet mom (Mary Steenburgen) who simply does not want to believe that her son used a bicycle as a weapon. There you have the ingredients to a great comedy. But Step Brothers pushes even further. It is acutely aware of adolescent human nature, and it exploits that perceptiveness to exquisite comedic ends. This is an unreasonably funny movie.Adam McKay, the director, brings to the film an inane and endearingly mean energy which all but supplies the humor itself. Unlike most comedies, Step Brothers isn't really populated with ""jokes"" in the traditional sense (moments of laughter preceded by a set-up and finished with a punchline). Instead, the ridiculous tone and premise make every single thing funny. You can't intellectualize humor, and Adam McKay doesn't try to. He simply thinks funny. He knows that the sight of two grown men speaking and acting exactly like 12-year-olds is funny. This is the triumph of Step Brothers. Thanks to Ferrell and Reilly's brilliant performances, not to mention a script that effortlessly imagines universal teenage experiences through the eyes of middle-aged men with no self-awareness, Step Brothers taps into the unexpected recognition that separates good comedy from great comedy. Every man on the planet remembers showing their stupid crap to friends, so when Ferrell reveals to Reilly a Samurai sword signed by Randy Jackson we laugh at the stupidity of it while also recognizing that we probably did something similar at one time. The pithy digs (""I remember when I had my first beer""), the macho posturing, the pretending to be cool. We've all been there, and Step Brothers knows it.About those performances I mentioned. They are actually brilliant. With respect to the tremendous supporting work, especially from Jenkins, Ferrell and Reilly own Step Brothers. As boys trapped in men's bodies, they are unbelievably convincing. Every line reading works. They make each word funny, all the while capturing precisely the way boys talk. In the film's funniest scene, they are even asked to cry. The result is legendary. It might be the hardest I have ever laughed at a movie. Absurdly hilarious but oddly, unsettlingly real, it should have been Ferrell's Oscar showpiece. And I'm serious about that too. Will Ferrell is our funniest actor. His role in Step Brothers is not only hysterical, but technically remarkable. I can't name five better leading performances in 2008.Step Brothers is juvenile in the most perfect way. It is stupid on the outside, comically genius underneath. Delightfully aware of the silliness inherent in all adolescent boys, the film is hilarious in its bones. It made me laugh very long, very hard, many times. A true comedy classic.88/100",Step Brothers
135,haydenluz,Step Brothers,6,4 July 2020,"Going into this film not a huge fan of Will Ferrell & John C. Riley, I wasn't expecting to enjoy it one bit... I was wrong. Step Brothers embraces this absurd premise, with brainless comedy that hits most of the time! Overall, this is a great ""turn your brain off"" type of movie.",Step Brothers
136,MovieProductions,A surprisingly tolerable comedy,5,8 July 2010,"** out of (****)When I saw that the director of ""Talladega Nights"" was helming this film, I cringed a little. While ""Talladega Nights"" was not an abysmal wreck, it still was pretty awful. Fortunately, ""Step Brothers"" is a step-up from the directors' past project. The jokes pack more of a punch, your heart strings are tugged on more, and overall, it's just a whole more satisfying experience. While this film is not the Holy Grail of comedy, it doesn't even come close, it still is a pretty good film that you won't mind revisiting a few times, here and there. The performances are strong, the script is pretty nifty, and the film is paced very smoothly. I typically hate films that portray the immature nature of adults, but this one is an exception. That may be due to the star power that these two leads demonstrate. Step Brothers comes slightly recommended.Step Brothers revolves around Dale and Brennan, who's parents are getting married. Now they both become step-brothers and at first loathe each other. Although, they develop a friendship as the film progresses, but they're friendship is still miss and hit as more situations include between the two. Moreover, Brennan's stepfather, which is Dale's biological father, is tired of their shenanigans and wants them to act more mature and get jobs. The two, Dale and Brennan have to get a job, act more like adults, and also go for therapy.First of all, the script is pretty strong. The laughs in this movie are really a knockout. While there's more chuckles than laughs, the film still delivers and has great comedic timing. Moreover, I thought the performances were very promising. I really cared about what happened to Dale (Reily) and Brennan (Ferrell) and the situations they were in. Despite the two leads, everyone else was great as well. Furthermore, I thought the pacing was very smooth and scenes didn't feel too abrupt or too slow. Additionally, I loved the soundtrack of this movie. To add to that, I really liked the irony in some situations. In order to understand what I'm talking about, you have to see the movie.While the pros outweigh the cons, there were some problems. First of all, this movie is pretty forgettable. This movie doesn't aim at winning Oscars and it shows. While it is a comedy, most films these days, which are modern comedies are getting praise (i.e. The Hangover, Forgetting Sarah Marsall). Also, I found this movie very predictable in some scenes. I'm not going to spoil anything, but the film did have its predictable moments. Moreover, the more childish jokes almost detracted from the experience. The mature humor is really what shifted this movie into gear. Overall, ""Step Brothers"" will not be a comedic classic a few decades from now. However, it is disposable fun while it lasts. The jokes are simply great, the performers are solid, and the script is pretty strong. The film is also smoothly paced and will not leave you bored or tired. In brief, ""Step Brothers"" a solid comedy. While it's only a notch above mediocrity, it's still worth a look.",Step Brothers
137,rebecca-ry,"Lots of laughs, catchphrases and heart",8,6 October 2012,"'Step Brothers' is probably one of Will Ferrell's best films.Ferrell and John C. Reilly work really well here; they are both hilarious with Ferrell being only slightly funnier. Supporting actors such as Adam Scott, Richard Jenkins and Mary Steenburgen have their moments and were as vital to this film as its main actors. The plot and script are really funny but a lot of credit should be given to all the actors for ad-libbing scenes. The performances in this film definitely carry it as any other actors used here would have meant 'Step Brothers' would not have seen the success it has today. Overall, this is a brilliant comedy that hopefully will be remembered for a long time; it's got lots of laughs, catchphrases and heart in it.",Step Brothers
138,robertallenandersonjr,A new kind of comedy,10,25 July 2008,Step Brothers delivers many great laughs throughout. It had to be the funniest movie this summer and thats hard because there's a lot of good comedy's this summer. It was a new kind of comedy and was just very fun. It wasn't boring at all. It had me entertained the whole movie. The music that the brothers in this make up is funny. It had many different scenes that will make you laugh. It was very original and the story was funny. It was better that it was rated R as well. The rating made it a whole lot better. I would recommend not taking a young child to take this though. The acting was very good. Will Ferrell just might be the new king of comedy. He was very funny in this movie. John C. Reilly was funny as well. Having them both playing the brothers made the whole movie better. Nobody else could have done a better job playing the step brothers. I do think the movie in a weird kind of corny way had some heart toward the end of the movie. The only really bad thing I can say about the movie was the fart jokes. The movie wasn't to long and wasn't to short it was just perfect. This is definitely the must see comedy movie of the summer. I guarantee nothing can top this comedy movie this summer. Go and enjoy this movie it is well worth it.

139,MairegChernet,Mostly childish humor and some not so childish humor in a movie certainly not intended for children.,6,26 July 2008,"There is no surprise here. I wasn't expecting much from Ferrell. I always thought that he was overrated and about half his movies should not have made it to the big screen. In Step Brothers, a movie he co-wrote, he stars along John C. Reilly who doesn't much appeal me either. Step Brothers goes too far, I've seen movies like this before, such as Superbad who would make you fall out your seat and make you laugh so hard and deliver fewer gross jokes. But in the case of Step Brothers it has twice the crude humor and about half of them hit their target and make you laugh, the other half is just a pile of crap. To be honest, some of the stuff in this film did make me laugh hysterically and I thought I was going to get the same humor throughout, but after a while it becomes very predictable and makes you want to walk out of the theater. Overall, It's another one of those sad attempts of humor by Ferrell, but still worth a look.6.8/10",Step Brothers

141,hung_fao_tweeze,I must be missing something,3,27 July 2010,"After viewing this I am compelled to immediately post to IMDb. For me, this movie was that bad. It involves two 40-ish men still living at home and their single parent's become romantically involved. Eventually they become a bizarro kind of Brady Bunch. It seems like every time I watch a Will Ferrell movie I am reminded why I don't watch SNL alumni movies anymore. Their characters are good for brief giggle stints (maybe) but rarely full-fledged 90+ outings. Considering that many people actually liked this I feel I must be entirely missing something here. (I didn't get the Hudson Brothers either although their eventual movie was much funnier than this dog.) I didn't come close to even smiling once during the affair - and I really wanted to. This comes across as frequently ad-libbed situations. If so, the biggest problem is that no-one in the cast is a gifted at ad-libbing. In fact, I found the cast to be annoying more than anything else. However, if the brothers had been replaced by actual adolescents (which is about as high as the humor goes here, if even) then the movie might have worked. At least some sense of realism would have provided some grounded in an idiotic script. As it is, there seems to be no reason for these two grown men to be as backward as they are. They simply 'are' and we are forced to accept this despite every fiber of our being wanting to slap someone - especially the creators of this torture.",Step Brothers

I think this movie was even funnier than Talladega Nights, Ferrell & Reilly's first collaboration.There was a very thin and outrageous plot, but it lent itself to tons of improvisation, and in turn creating some of the ridiculous scenes, circumstances, and dialog. And seeing Mary Steenburgen curse like a sailor was hysterical. Ferrell and Reilly both play their characters to the hilt, as does Adam Scott, the evil younger brother, and his insane wife played by Kathryn Hahn. Overall there is an equal amount of slapstick, dialog, and potty humor (well okay, probably a bit heavier on the potty humor).Though the movie itself is very hysterical, there are also some equally good bloopers, cut scenes, etc. on the DVD bonus materials.

Seems Ferrel needs an opposite to really shine.The real brother to Ferrels character was played very well over the top.Oh, and the incredibly sexually psychotic wife of Ferrels real brother was so zany it was actually disturbing and funny all at the same time.

The two ""boys"" act like children, if children were sex-obsessed narcissists who played with Star Wars toys. Think Tom Hanks in ""Big,"" but armed and high on meth.The movie is supposed to be a parody of the infantilization of American society and the dysfunction of the postmodern family, but that gets lost in all the dog feces and dirty magazines that this movie vomits up.Granted, there are moments that are just so viscerally ridiculous that something in you HAS to laugh, but every time you do, you feel like the morons in the audience who are just laughing because they think a close up shot of a grown man's testicles is funny.Do I recommend?

I have a few guilty pleasures now even as a 22 year old, but all in all, I don't care for stupid comedies anymore. You really can't once movies like Citizen Kane and The Night of the Hunter make your top 10. Not that every movie HAS to be a masterpiece of course, but still.The only reason why I watched Step Brothers is because on Wednesday some friends bought me a mystery box of DVDs at a used merchandise store, and while I read the titles to them they both enthusiastically told me that I needed to see Step Brothers. I had heard others praise it, so I tried to have an open mind. And Saturday night I watched it. And HATED IT. It's one of the stupidest movies I have ever seen, and one of the worst as well.Step Brothers starts with a man and woman spotting each other at a meeting and having sex soon after. They admit to having sons who are 39 and 40, still living with them. They decide to marry, making their sons step brothers. (They are played by Will Ferrell and John C. Reilley. I don't care enough to look up their character names.)The boys hate each other at first, but once they see what they have in common, they begin to do their immature activities together, which ends up including Dad's demand that they find jobs so they can finally move out.This movie has some positives, but very few. I laughed 2 or 3 times, one I distinctly remember. In one scene, the boys ask their parents if they can turn their beds into bunk beds. They agree, and the boys do so hastily. John C. Reilley hops onto the top bunk, and crushes Will Ferrell. Reilley runs to tell his parents that there's blood everywhere, but it turns out to be a single cut. I played that again, and I will see that on YouTube from time to time.However, there is far more bad than good. Someone who wrote a 1/10 review perfectly described this as ""For 12 year olds, but Rated R."" It's very immature in how crude it is.Examples: Will and John meet some elementary school kids. They make them eat dried poop on the playground. They are too scared to face kids who are literally 30+ years younger than them. In a more major example, John has a rule that Will must never touch his drums. They later have a fight, and Will says he's going to touch his drums...with his balls. He does. ONSCREEN. Granted, they are fake, but still, really?For a final example, the boys have an interview for a job and John fart for a straight roughly 10 seconds or so. Fart jokes rarely work, Hollywood. Mel Brooks pulls it off in Blazing Saddles, but few others can do it.So there's fart jokes, scatological jokes, sex jokes...99% of which fail. I felt my brain numb at points and I gaped in utter shock of how bad a ""comedy"" can be. And yes, maybe that is because I am 22 years old, but the number of adults I've heard praise this movie honestly disturbs me. I've heard some call it the funniest movie they have ever seen, showing that they must have never seen There's Something About Mary, The Hangover, Get Smart, or the aforementioned Blazing Saddles.If you have never seen Step Brothers and you want to save some brain cells, then please skip it. I get that this movie wasn't trying to be a movie like Citizen Kane, but even with expectations dropped I was still sorely disappointed. For a movie labelled as a COMEDY, Step Brothers was a huge STEP down.Reverse Recommendations: Will Ferrell's best role in my opinion was Elf, and Reilley is good in Magnolia. Apart from the comedies I suggested 2 paragraphs above, I also recommend ones like(in no order) The Life of Brian(my favorite comedy), Groundhog Day, Good Boys, The Naughty Nineties, Borat, Meet The Parents, Airplane!, Coming To America, The Nutty Professor, and Planes-Trains-and-Automobiles, to get you started.",Step Brothers
159,mephotography2001,Not the Funny I was Expecting,4,27 November 2013,"I saw Will Farrell and John C. Reilly together in a comedy and expected a pile of stupid-funny and got all of that...plus a bunch of over-the-top sexual ""humor"". It's like they ran out of real jokes and thought mixing in 100 unnecessary dick jokes would make it funny, and I'm sure to many people it did. The premise was funny: 2 30-somethings acting like 10-year-olds who still live with their parents, now being forced to live together when their parents get married to each other. But it all goes downhill from there. Farrell has done a lot better. With Reilly, I keep holding out hope, but I'm beginning to get the feeling his greatest role was as one of the fishermen who drowned in ""Perfect Storm"".",Step Brothers

It's about 2 guys who move in with each other when their parents get married, when hilarity ensues. The movie is very very funny, and great for Will Ferrell fans. It is a bit inappropriate though, not recommended for anyone under age 14, yet most jokes will just go over a younger kid's head. I recommend you see this movie unless you hate Will Ferrell.9/10 or: A- Rating: R for pervasive language, some comic violence, and crude & sexual humor/content.",Step Brothers
162,mkm-hermanjnr,Will Ferrell at his most crass and idiotic rather than his sharpest,3,28 December 2020,"Will Ferrell is perhaps one of the most polarising modern American comedians. To some people he is a comic genius, a man imbued with a similar kind of aura as Jim Carrey. Capable of amusing physical comedy and good natured silly hijinks, he is beloved among this group of ardent fans.To others, he's a low-brow hack comedian who plays the same role in anything and everything - the dumb loud everyman who shouts and acts stupid, with a heavy reliance on crude humour. Where do I sit on this spectrum? Well, oddly I feel like I fall into both brackets. I think he's a really talented guy who stars in every movie he can, regardless of if it's worthy of his talents.In movies like ""Anchorman"" and ""Blades of Glory"", Ferrell manages to temper his madcap personality a little and despite hamming it up and injecting some crudeness, he is genuinely hilarious at times.Perhaps my all-time favourite performance of his is ""Elf"", in which he is able to make his silly man-child act genuinely heart-warming at times.These movies have something in common - a good script and a good premise. Given these things, Ferrell can be great. Yet Step Brothers has neither, and it quickly devolves into one of the most puerile, low-brow, cringe-inducingly idiotic ""comedies"" I've had the misfortune of sitting through.The basic idea is that two middle-aged man-children still living with their parents end up becoming the titular Step Brothers. That's not just the basic idea, though - it's the entire joke.The first problem is that the two characters are *SO* stupid, *SO* crass, *SO* unbelievably dumb that I can't empathise with them at all. They're also vindictive, which renders them almost completely unlikeable, and in fact, the film actually makes me feel very uncomfortable. Why's that? Isn't that strange for a comedy?It makes me feel uncomfortable because these characters are basically outright portrayed as mentally disabled. Yet they are supposed to be unthinkingly demeaned and laughed at. It feels mean spirited to say the least; the movie is essentially asking you to laugh at and mock two people who, for all intents and purposes, have learning difficulties and mental handicaps. It's kind of gross when you realise that's the movie's take on things.Secondly, the ""humour"" itself ranges from moronic to toilet-level for the entire movie. Many of the scenes are only funny if you think that people shouting loudly is funny (apparently some people actually think this). Oh, the script sucks? Let's just shout it really loud and act like idiots.There is an entire musical scene entirely built around describing crass sex acts and measuring bodily fluids - and worse yet, it's not even funny or witty unless you never developed beyond being 10 years old.There's not necessarily anything ""wrong"" with low-brow humour, or stupid characters. ""Dumb And Dumber"", for example, while not the best movie ever made, is considerably more good-natured and entertaining than this film. But Step Brothers epitomises Will Ferrell at his most lazy and generic, it squanders the acting ability of Reilly and also takes a really nasty, mocking take towards it's low-IQ characters that is actually pretty unpleasant on a deeper level.",Step Brothers
163,pax03,"Clearly better than recent ""comedies"" from Farrell and Reilly",8,30 July 2008,"I will give it this... I went into the movie not expecting much since Farrell's last (semi pro) was semi funny and actually quite bad, and Reilly's last (walk hard) was fair and had some funny spots. but this one was a whole lot better than the previous works of either star. It was R rated for a reason, it had some bad language but now days if comedies are rated R, then be prepared for some real foul language. This was a breath of fresh air for me, I didn't expect much but I got a lot in return. it had some classic scenes and some classic lines from its characters. It was well written for what the stars are good at: which is acting like children in mens bodies. I give it a 8 out of 10 because it surprised me and it had more than enough funny scenes and lines in it to keep me entertained and I would say this is up there with Forgetting Sarah Marshall as one of the funniest movies I've seen this year.",Step Brothers

Now I'm a fan of Will Ferrell, but after being not so pleased with ""stranger than fiction"" I gave this a try because John C. Reily's in it, and he was very good in ""Walk Hard"" . After I saw this movie, I knew these two actors must be destined together to make an excellent comedy like this.Two 40 year old men who hate each other because they're step brothers. And what makes it more funny is that they don't even have jobs, and they live in with their parents. Now I can relate to having a step brother, hell, I still hate the bastard even now.The drum room scene was the best in the whole movie, I nearly cried of laughter. But every scene had me dead of laughter. It's genius! So far, this is still the funniest movie for me, it even beats the recent ""hangover"" movie. When Will Ferrel puts his comedy face on, he's just unstoppable. John C. Reily was also a great addition to this movie. After seeing his performance in Walk Hard, I knew that I'd expect some very good laughs, and it did that for me, plus it exceeded my expectations. I'm calling this the movie of the year 2008.

I really thought it was the funniest movie I had seen in a really long time.So I purposefully stopped watching it and ordered the Blu-ray from Netflix.I got home, poured myself a tall Jack and Coke and reclined ready to laugh my ass off.Unfortunately, the profanity started with the first sentence and was thick throughout the movie.Now, I like movies such as Scarface and Glengarry Glen Ross, so profanity, done right, enhances dialog. But the constant profanity in this film distracted me from otherwise really funny scenes.I am thinking that the director said to himself half the scenes wouldn't be funny unless someone says Fu*k or Sh*t. Which explains why it was so funny on regular TV (edited) and not so much off the DVD.Without the constant profanity it was really good. With the profanity it was just ... blah.",Step Brothers

For me this is always the tough test when it comes to comedy. I watched it at a packed cinema which as you know in itself can make a film ultimately funny without being so. But i have to say this film still delivered the goods so well.First up this film is STUPID it is ridiculous but it's a comedy with Will Ferrell in it what did you honestly expect?! But my god it's funny it really is hilarious Ferrell and Reilly make an awesome on screen team and the comedy moments just bounce off one an other , each man just helps make the others role as funny as it could have been. It gives you hilarious jokes , stupidly funny scenes , it's one of those comedy's that so so often tries to catch you off guard and every time it absolutely nails it! And underneath all the stupidity bonds are formed , compassion is found and what really matters in life is discovered.

I've never laughed that hard at a movie, i'm still sweating as i'm writing this from all the laughter i made! Easily, it's Ferrell and Reily's best film to date and Kathryn Hahn was amazingly funny and she nearly stole the film away from Ferrell & Reily! The only thing i know, they are cast her in a lot of movie in the future, she's is absolutely hilarious!! The movie indeed has a lot of swearing & sex (not really bad) but that never stopped the movie from being so good, so you don't have worry about that but don't take your kids that are under 14 years old because in my theater, a mom brought her kid (about 7 or 8) and when the movie was over, she started swearing and repeating the words over and over, the mother was very angry and should of been ashamed of herself for that. Will Ferrell and John C. Reily have excellent chemistry and this isn't the last time they will make together for sure, we will see them again, that i'm sure of. They are the best comedic duo since Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon. So, if you are a Will Ferrell & John C.

Maybe it's something to do with American humour (or should that be humor?) but there wasn't one single point during this total waste of 98 minutes of my valuable life that I even so much as smiled! What are the chances of two people meeting, falling in love (or was it merely lust?), getting married and finding that they each have a son in his forties who has the mental age of a first-grader? I wondered if the two sons (Farrell and Reilley) had actually been first-graders, whether the story might have been more believable and, dare one hope, funnier. I decided it wouldn't! Those two ""men"" (sorry guys, I realise that's a bit of an insult to the adult male gender) ought to have been in institutions and, maybe, the whole movie changed its genre to one where the parents worked together to make the world a better place for such unfortunate people.Then there was the gratuitous profanity from just about every character for the entire duration. I am lost for words to attempt to comment on that - other than to say it served absolutely no useful purpose whatsoever! In my movie collection, I have a copy of the original silent version of ""Nosferatu"" and ""Santa With Muscles"" (another fairly pathetic waste of time - mine and the film-makers), but THIS has to take the prize for being the worst movie I have EVER seen. I can only assume that there are people out there who obviously have some sort of empathy with the characters of Step Brothers and who saw something in this travesty to make them laugh. They have my abject sympathy! I wish I had spent the 98 minutes watching my front lawn grow! It would have been a LOT more fun!

It isn't anything that will be worshiped as a comedy classic, but thats not what they were aiming for when they made this. This is the ideal ""popcorn & soda"" movie. Just flip the shoes off, pull out the recliner, and let the laughing begin. This may not be as good as ""Talladega Nights"", ""Anchorman"", or ""Elf"", in a sense of good story and plot. However, it will make you laugh harder than you did at any of those other movies.The plot is pretty stupid actually, but there is just so much up close and in your face comedy to laugh at in this movie that you'll think of it as highly as you do of Ferrell's past masterpieces. Both Will Farrell and John C. Reilly drop some of the funniest lines you'll ever hear, so hats-off on the dialogue. Most of the laughs in this movie come from dialogue, but there are some other things here and there. Plus i was just happy to see Seth Rogen make a cameo. Adam Sandler's officially dead, so if anyone else is on Ferrell's level of comedy these days, it's Seth Rogen. I would definitely recommend this movie to comedy lovers, but again, it's never going to be some hallowed masterpiece.

I went in with my expectations set somewhere between good and bad, that way if it exceeded them great, if not oh well. It met them right where I had them. The idea of two forty-year-old men still living at home forced to cohabitate when their single parents marry is interesting, though I thought it played out a bit one-note, I mean there's only so much you can do with the direction they chose to take the plot. I thought Will Ferrell was a bit sub-par, he kind of gets swallowed up and doesn't stand out to me as much as usual. Plus he's doing his umpteenth version of the outrageous man-child. For me he just does better when he's creating a character, like Ron Burgundy, Buddy the Elf, Chazz Michael Michaels, Jackie Moon, etc. Here he's just...Brennan Huff, the unemployed, homebound 39-year-old. John C. Reilly is good and plays off Ferrell well, but like Ferrell he's just not as good on his own in this movie. This all being said, the movie is funny; I was entertained. There were several great lines and situations, though I don't think this is destined to be as quotable as say Anchorman. The movie definitely benefits from its R rating, I don't think a toned-down Step Brothers would work as well.

This might be the finest McKay-Ferrell-collab yet. I am aware of the public opinion for these kinds of comedies, they get silly, nasty, annoying at times. To me, this one stands out as the finest, because it walks the thin line that divides the teams of haters and lovers.The dimwitted, silly, yelling characters - they are all there but they are placed in a perfectly normal environment. The parents are normal American grown-ups that bring the more crazy aspects of the story back to the ground and enhance the fun of them. One-week-TV-bans are a parental measurement which we all remember too well - but as a reaction to the loony schtik of the step brothers it feels almost ""too normal"". We all remember running up the stairs as loud as possible, arguing about our favourite dinosaurs or being taken to dull apointments in the backseat - but seeing to grown up men in these positions feels really out of place. So many moments feel like: ""I've seen this before - but here it feels weird."". I mean, look at the movie poster. We've all taken photos like this as kids. But with grown ups it just looks - in spirit of this film I'll choose to speak immature - gay.And this is what breathes magic into this flick and attests the fine feeling for comedy McKay and Ferrell have: Taking well-known bits of human life and throwing them in uncommon territory.

But coming out of the theater, I was still laughing at some of the jokes. If you're a fan of him, you will enjoy this. If you are not, then you will be in for some laughs. Nothing worthy of an Oscar (though comedy isn't usually in that) and most likely won't become your favorite, but is still an enjoyable film to see. Be sure to bring your sense of humor, because without it it is just two grown men fighting like toddlers. If you are into more sophisticated jokes...then this is not for you. But if what you're in the mood for is laugh after laugh, then I recommend it.",Step Brothers
188,Kevbo1985,One Of The Funniest Movies I've Ever Seen,8,4 April 2012,"Before I actually dig into the review of this movie, I suppose it would be appropriate to state that I am of the type that finds nonsense, done right (which is relative, I know, just bare with me), incredibly entertaining. Certain people do it better than others. Will Ferrell, without a doubt, does it better than almost anyone in Hollywood. I can absolutely understand those that just ""don't get it"", or those that get it but are just not of the same inclination to find it at all funny. Like everything else in life, it's okay to disagree and it's okay to feel strongly, one way or the other, about liking or disliking any given thing. In short, it's all in the eye of the beholder.The premise of Step Brothers, much like the nonsensical humor contained within, is absolutely ridiculous; two grown men, hovering around 40, live with their parents. These men are portrayed by Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly, a comedic duo whom I've come to absolutely love due to this movie and Talladega Nights. They work so well off of each other, their sense of timing and overall chemistry makes them a natural pairing for a solid comedy. In Step Brothers, they end up being forced to live together when their parents fall for one another and attempt to make a big happy family out of the four of them. A sensible, predictable recipe for disaster.And as each disaster piles onto the next, you may find yourself absolutely aching at the gut from laughter as I usually do. Or you may not. That's okay too. But I really have a hard time distinguishing between ""smart"" comedy and ""stupid"" comedy; to me, funny is funny and cannot be a universal thing. Will Ferrell's brand of comedy is that of silly, unbelievable characters, ridiculous dialog and absurdly stupid physical maladies. And, despite the immaturity and childishness of it all, it works better than most any other comedies being produced today.A variety of supporting actors lend their considerable comedic presence to the overall bottomless pit of funny this movie represents. Mary Steenburgen and Richard Jenkins are excellent as the brother's parents, Mary as the naive, heartfelt mother and Richard as the businesslike, stern and increasingly perturbed father. Adam Scott does a bang-up job as Will's brother, a do-gooder who has seemingly spends his entire life attempting to belittle and one-up his buffoon of a brother. And, although his time on camera is short, Rob Riggle's role of Scott's business associate/crony offers up a few of the movie's funniest moments. It is his presence that forever changed the word ""POW!"" for me and made it a sort of catchphrase in certain circles.And that little aspect of Step Brothers is something that, the more I think about it, begins to sum up what Will Ferrell's movies are all about; incredibly funny one-liners that end up getting quoted repeatedly between me and several of my friends. From this movie alone, we were given classic lines regarding drum kits, attempting martial arts in garages, an interesting solution for shoulder pain, the importance of the Catalina Wine Mixer, and a host of others. For those that ""get it"", Step Brothers seems to be amongst the very best of Ferrell's work in movies. And I am certainly of the opinion that, were it not for the superior ""Anchorman"", Step Brothers would be his finest moment.",Step Brothers

Sadly, whereas an 80s version would most probably have been funnier and less crude, this modern comedy fails to deliver anything truly memorable.I have the feeling that the writers tried to copy 80s style humour, but are so locked into the modern 'shock value' mindset, that the whole project ended up being a waste of time and talent.Will Ferrell is a funny, talented guy, but he obviously can't find scripts that do him justice.

The funniest scenes were the two men fighting over a drum set, being introduced to Brennan's snobbish and conceited brother Derek, the two men being bullied by a gang of children and of course the scene where they build a bunk bed that breaks due to poor joinery.However the film gets boring towards the end as there is nothing much to laugh at except the post credits where Dale and Brennan get one back on the kids.In all and all the film was very funny except the last half hour of the film.",Step Brothers

The only time I actually laughed-out-loud was when Brennan and Dale tried to turn their separate beds into a bunk bed and it crashed. And then there was the odd moment where I smiled, but overall, the movie was just completely ridiculous and dumb (""Can you wash clothes in a dishwasher?"") Yes, believe it or not, that is an actual line from the movie.

I was therefor thoroughly surprised, when I came to this site, to learn it had a $65,000,000 dollar budget and grossed $30,000,000 in it's opening weekend. I say this so you know my mindset, When I tuned in to this I was expecting a bad movie, bad jokes and brainless humor. Nothing could have prepared me for this though. In the time I watched I did not laugh once. The jokes are painfully unfunny and/or have been used so often that any fun has been beaten out of it years ago.

But, as they grew to know another, they realize not one of them is bad at all. Moving in with part of your new family, is not easy to accept. I know how they feel. Brendan thought Dale's father wouldn't have gotten along with him. Dale figured Brendan moving in with him would make him feel even worse. No one expected that to happen.Then, they wound up being friends treating each other with pride and respect. They did have many things in common. It seemed like they were the same type of guys. John C. Reilly and Will Ferell was definitely the perfect choice to cast as fighting brothers.Their stupidity is mostly what made audiences laugh. They acted like they didn't know what to do even when they really do know what to do. They are a couple of guys who have no real lives of their own. It's pretty embarrassing to be 39 and 40 and still live with your parents LOL. Their immaturity makes up a lot of hilarity. Always fighting, yelling and carrying on day and night.This is a comedy movie to remember. They act just like children. Sometimes, Dale and Brendan overreacted too much.

Eventually they get married and become a happy couple with a happy family. John C. Reilly also stars in this film as Dale Doback, the son of Dr. Doback.

This movie was actually a blast to sit through because I thought that the concept was very entertaining, Will Ferrell and John C.

Not every joke works or will hit each audience members' funny bones. But the hits out number the misses and when the jokes land, some of them create deep belly laughs.Reilly and Ferrell, as seen in their previous manifestations, have a delightful comedic chemistry and are a joy to watch play off of each other. Adam McKay directs with precise timing (directors of comedies are often overlooked, but McKay's success has shown he is doing more than just pointing the camera at the actors). ""Step Brothers"" further pushes the sarcastic absurdest humor genre and transcends much of its contemporaries, because the Ferrell, Reilly, and McKay team actually craft intelligent humor. It may not appear that way at first glance, as much of it is ridiculous and crude, but there are real life parodies occurring.

It's rape, any way you slice it. I've never found rape funny. I'm not condemning those who do - it is a fictional movie, after all - but what annoys me more is the pointed inclusion of such a scene in the movie.LOGICAL VERSION OF THE SCENE: He comes into the bathroom. Just as she comes out of hiding and starts getting busy with him, we cut back to the dinner table they have just left. We come back once they've finished.HOW IT REALLY HAPPENS (EVEN IN THE RATED VERSION): We get to be privy to the entire scene oh no, you _see_ nothing, but there is absolutely nothing to this scene beyond the sex and noises. I felt my IQ drop 20 points.This movie had the potential. Sadly, it never reaches that potential. It has a hugely creative setup and showed some of its funniest gags in the trailer, but that's about all you need to know about this movie. I'm astonished it even has any likable quality outside of the porn booth.This movie would be okay and passable were it not for that scene. Yes, it ruined the entire movie for me.

""Last week, we put liquid paper on a bee, and... it died"", ""Better get out of my face, or I'm gonna round house your ass!"" and so many other stupid lines.Bet let's me honest.

At first they rival each other, but as a little time passes they realize the things they hated in each other were really similarities, and they become best friends.

You'll be close to crying when it's all said and done feeling as though you laughed through the whole thing. This movie was certainly a great way for Will Ferrell to step back from his non-stop drunk and over the top characters, and to finally play opposite someone as funny as he is. And in a Rated-R film, no less. Brennan Huff's (Ferrel) brother in the film played the successful and insulting jerk to Ferrel's and Reilly's character. His role could've been a little less obvious with his cruel characteristics and not so sudden and constant with his remarks. Other than that, however, there really wasn't any other flaws in the characters or story that would make anybody leave the theater or quick watching.The outrageous dialog between the Step Brothers was comedy at its finest.

The film, overall, is about maturity. The movie tells you that maturity doesn't necessarily mean you have to work hard and never play to be an adult, but that you have to do the right thing when the time comes, even if it means putting some of your own desire and aspirations down momentarily. I would say that the only thing stopping this movie being really good is that it constantly treats its audience with extremely unfunny comedy whenever there's a touching moment that slows the story down for an emotional note. It's a good story, but it's not a very good movie. It trades emotion for gags that never seem to work (although, Adam Scott was pretty damn funny as the alpha male douche bag).",Step Brothers

Profane, ridiculous, and outlandish humor, with little story line.The basic plot is this: two middle-aged men, each with a single parent whom they still live with, become step brothers when their parents marry. They hate each other at first, but then become best friends. Their parents then decide they should get their own jobs and move out. They help each other discover their capabilities, blah blah blah...the plot is mostly lost anyways. What really matters is that there are 2 middle-aged men acting like 10 year olds.There are some gut-bursting laughs and one-liners in this movie. Most of the film is filled with just senseless, stupid humor, as is with most Ferrell films. However, some things went a little too far, and the swearing went a little overboard. Yes, I know the movie is rated R, but the movie would've been fine without all of the crudeness.I'm not a huge Ferrell fan, but I thought he and Reilly had great chemistry, and delivered the comedy well. They both really seemed to be 10-year-olds trapped in a middle-aged body, which seemed to be the whole point of the movie--laugh at some immature adults. I think there could've been a bit more story line, and this coming from me, a HUGE stupid-humor and slapstick fan! I think this is one of my favorite Ferrell movies, and overall the movie delivers what it promises--big laughs. 7/10",Step Brothers
224,eddyvlad,Stupid but entertaining comedy,5,3 March 2009,"At least its not as stupid as most teen comedy. I have to say this is some kind of a cross between adult & teen comedy. Much of the scene involves trying hard to make the audience laugh by inventing unrealistic acts. Fortunately the movie is all about 2 40 year old who behaves like a kid, which is very unrealistic already. So I don't expect this to be the kind of comedy which I can relate to in real life and laugh about it.The sex part annoys me very much because the lady keeps screaming and moaning loudly even though they're supposed to be discrete and I don't find it funny at all for her screaming and loud moan.Bad part aside, I like how the story evolved from weird to happy to funny to sad, back to happy + some weird feeling and then funny. Even though this is a stupid comedy, there are some scenes which are quite moving. And best of all, entertainment level is high on this one.",Step Brothers

I lasted about half an hour before I tapped out, but honestly, the concept of the film isn't terrible. I think if the story focused around two kids or older teens going through this scenario, it could have worked. As a child of divorce, it is strange to have a whole new family become part of your own, but watching two 40-year-old men act this way was just... Rough.",Step Brothers

228,king_nick_the_1st,"Worth a watch for fans of the genre, but lacks heart.",6,27 July 2008,"Funny?... Yes. Laugh out loud?... Absolutely. Empty?... Unfortunately, yes as well. While the new Will Ferrell and John C. Rielly collaboration does work on every possible level it should, for some reason it lacks a certain charm that recent stellar raunch comedies of the same nature seem to have, (namely other pieces with Judd Apatow's name attached) 40-Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up, and Superbad.Now this shouldn't suggest the movie was bad, by all means in some places this movies was flat out hilarious. Most of these moments come at the expense of raunch, profanities, and Will Ferrell doing what he does (You know, that sort of dead, half opened mouth smile. Oh, and when he talks in short bursts as if he is out of breath. Yes it reads stupid, but funny as hell when he does it.)It's not that raunch comedies are dying or they aren't funny anymore, it's just that this one lacked the heart to make it memorable. After a nights rest, from seeing the movie, few scenes in the movie really stand out. Another problem I found was that the swearing seemed to come across as forced, at times the dialog could have been quicker and in turn funnier if the chase was cut to, by removing dropped f-bombs. However, some scenes are made gut bursting by the characters pure lack of social dignity (Rielly's opening scene in the kitchen with his father, the interview with a cameo by Seth Rogen, and Rielly's romp in the bathroom)Pros:Will Ferrell is a star for a reason, he can always find a way to make us laugh, and Rielly has some great moments also. Some moments are so outlandish, one can't help but laugh. While, others were brilliantly carried by Ferrell and Rielly. From couples, to groups of dense frat boys in their tacky affliction t-shirts, some scenes had the whole theater roaring.Cons:This movie lacked heart, the ending of the movie felt like it was just placed in there, with no real point as was the case with the story. It left an empty feeling by providing the means, to the two leads antics.Some of the script, dialog, and scenes could have flowed better if there wasn't a forced need for ""raunch"", while this does work more often than not, the times when it doesn't seem to stand out more to memory.Overall:I would recommend this movie to most people who are fans of the raunch comedy genre, not exactly a family film. Good movie to go see with your buddies, or if you've already seen The Dark Knight. If your still unsure if this is the movie for you but your still into this kind of genre; maybe, you'd be better off saving your money for Pineapple Express, which opens August 8th.",Step Brothers

Step Brothers came a long way and I had trouble to stop laughing at some points. Will Ferrell is great. No doubt about it, always found him funny. He is very loud and rude, as usual, which makes it very funny. John C Reilly is also a funny guy. Too bad Seth Rogen did not have a bigger part in this, because he suits perfectly in this movie. The way Reilly and Ferrell work together is brilliant. It's terrible, childish and loud but that's what makes this movie so funny.This movie is about 2 guys in their 40s; one of them living with his divorced dad, the other one living with his divorced mom. The mom and Dad meet, fall in love, and decide to move in together. The 2 guys become step brothers this way, and childish as they are, they don't get along at all. Great acting in this movie.

It just so happens that Brennans mother and Dales father meet up and get married. They all move in together and hell basically breaks lose between Brennan and Dale.I went into this movie excepting to see another Will Ferrell movie, with him running around in his underwear. Surprisingly enough Reily is the one who has least on in this movie.This isn't a clever written quick witted comedy but is a fight comedy. What i call fight comedy is movies with a lot of shouting and swearing that with the right context can become quite hilarious.I didn't think much for the acting as most the actors in this movie, well all of them really are playing their usual part.Basically this is a fight comedy, although is pretty hilarious and will have you near tears at parts.

You can tell they must've had a lot of fun filming this, and were at their best when they were hurling insults at each other. And how can you resist that cheesy marketing photo, posed like little boys as parents would in a studio photog opp? ""40 Year Old Virgin"" had that same kid-stuck-in-an-adult-body feel to it.

Their t-shirts were so funny and general bad attitude and laziness.I liked the physical comedy and all the things to make us laugh throughout. The extreme lack of caution in these two's lives is astounding. The random punching of strangers at job interviews was great, and the tuxedos, really it is such an awkward process that pretty much sums it up.There is a slight bit of inspiration here, where you can follow your dreams and stick at something. If those clowns can be global success, so can anyone.The lovebird parents were perfect, mom being all sweet and kind and the dad being so irritated he could barely stand it. Parts of the film just sum up a lot of living arrangements in real life, really.Highly recommend.",Step Brothers

I then watched his other films that I'd previously watched and didn't like and loved them!!!! Weird. He's now one of my favorite comedians, he's such a funny guy and very talented. Will and John do a great job of being a couple of 'man kids' who still live with their parents who all have to live together once their parents get married to each other. It's great watching the transition between Will and John when they start to like each other after hating each other, it reminded me of the beauty of the youthful mind. This whole film in my opinion is great, brilliant acting, funny and heartwarming. One of my favorite scenes is when Dale pops Derrick in the face in the tree house when Derrick eggs him on to do it!

Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004) and Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (2006)are two Will Ferrell movies I've watched maybe a dozen times each. I also thought Blades of Glory (2007) was funny. However, I did not find this movie funny, or even interesting. The only funny scene I found funny was the interview scene where the two brothers interview with the uptight woman ""Pam."" They never pulled off the ""40 year old acting like a 13 year old"" act. They seemed to me like adult men acting foolish. The theater was nearly empty; it seems like people are voting with their feet. This movie was a definite two thumbs down for me.

Although the list is quite extensive its not his best by any stretch of the imagination , but nether the less . very very funny.

With more laughs per minute and less crude.)Step brothers is the story of two single parents both with kids (40 year old men) who come together and marry. They move in-together and their spoilt 40 yr old s don't get on. what follows is a series of events which depicts these mentioned men , trying to get rid of the other. Evetually they become friends ... from start to finish these actors work together like ant and dec.

After seeing Richard Jenkins in ""The Visitor"" (for which he has received an Oscar nomination), it is inexplicable that he would have had anything to do with this garbage. Or was he simply trying to display the full spectrum of his talent? I dunno, but I just don't find the premise of two middle-aged men living with their parents and acting like they are still 12 years old very funny - especially since both characters were also so obnoxious and unlikeable.

What's worse is that I have to watch Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly doing it. Ferrell only has the potential to be funny in 2 minute increments when he does films like this. The gags just get old too fast. I know Reilly is a good actor. He proved it with his roles in films like Chicago and The Hours. So why does he have to participate in films like this? The premise is dull and pointless, the script is unnecessarily vulgar, and the characters are beyond irritating. It's irrepressibly juvenile in the worst way.I understand that some people like this kind of comedy, and that's great. To each their own. It's great for you guys, because there's so much of it around now. It falls along the same lines as Old School, Anchorman, and Dodgeball, this brand of comedy that seems to have the film industry in a strangle hold.

241,greamamerican,Very crude and mean spiritly,2,24 July 2008,"What the hell happened to Will Ferrell in this one? He got a critical and box office hits of Anchorman and Talladega Nights. And this film Will is actually tearing off the humor in this movie. Guess what. Adam McKay is mistaken for directing the comedy that was supposed to be clean and charm but the extreme foul language and dirty humor content however didn't add up to my repetition of what was supposed to be in this film. Adam Mckay thinks an R Rated would be the best hit of the summer but not of this extreme immaturity and stupidity humor that didn't add up to the handicap of it like Wedding crashers and There Something about Mary. and also with poor story.It's simple: Mary and Richard got married and two mid 40s adult Brennan played by Will Ferrell and Dale Doback by John C. Reily was forced to live as Step brothers. Brennan and Dale was portrayed as adult immature dimwits who started to hate other for the start and acted as if there were 11 to 12 years old. Until Brennan younger brother Derek played by Adam Scott made him and Dale realize they were wrong about fighting each other and were bonded. Got off the pretty start. That is just a weak point start of the story. They was almost no plot either and the rest of the movie was very unpredictable and very overwhelming mean spiritedly crude. Most of them shout were the lots of ""F"" words and slang terms and it didn't add to the theme it was supposed to be. Maybe for funny for a 12 year old but not for me it is.

There was so much cursing and vulgarity that I simply could not finish watching it. I tried to watch it close to three times. Each time something occurred that was so abhorrent to me that I just had to quit watching it. The whole thing about the drum set was completely gross. The fact that viewers were shown some version of the male anatomy without warning was completely objectionable. I do not know if I will ever trust Will Ferrell again. He truly let me down. As for John C. Reilly --to be so talented and waste it in a movie like this is so sad. I am also disappointed in Mary Steenburgen. This is definitely a ""guy"" movie. I do not know many women who would be interested in watching something that displays so much immaturity. I find it outstanding that someone would really consider making a movie like this in our day and age. I do not know how it did at the box office--but I would suspect that it did not fare very well.

Apatow and Ferrell are at their best when they create their own fictional world based on reality like the local news in Anchorman and Nascar in Talledega Nights.

Unfortunately, I know a fair share of older people who have never left the nest. None of them are as big of goons as these two, and much of it was due to the parents' lack of motivation to kick them out as anything.Most of them were stoners rather than being stupid morons like these two...or were just plain lazy to the nth degree. It seems like these guys are idiots by choice as it seemed they could switch it off just in time to save the helicopter event. That was so much a stretch and contrived that even suspension of disbelief didn't help. What were the odds of hiring a Billy Joel type band with another man-child as the lead singer that happened to go nuts at the big event...cripes! A really bad revealing error at the end was when they went to finally take on the kids...and as they charged upon them, you could easily see they were 20-something and older stand-ins. I could only wonder if that was done on purpose it was so easy to spot. As for the song Will sang toward the end...where oh where is Chuck Barris and his gong.I really liked Will Farrell in ""Stranger than Fiction"" but aside from that one wonderful role, he's sucked since his SNL days and has never come close to even Chevy Chase in ability.

They put comedy back on the map, along with all the great work Judd Apatow is doing, because lets face it, in the past few years comedies have become lackluster with slap humor and bathroom jokes.

They become step brothers and their behaviour is very predictable. They hate each other in the beginning and they start doing the same old: pranks on one another. Unfortunately, the jokes and ideas these two grown up men have used to be funny when I was twelve. Putting your balls on a drum set, 'gina jokes and all that tasteless humour is beyond me now. This film took everything to the extreme. You had a bad joke but that was not enough. It had to be pushed, and pushed, and pushed until it became so lame that the premise wasn't even funny anymore. The plot thickens when Dale shacks up with Derek's wife. Derek is Will's brother in the movie. Typical brother, very successful but the biggest moron on the planet. So, back to the shacking. That was so random and it lowered the quality. Her lines were taking from a porn film and they were very explicit. The scene where she pees in a cubicle is simply overkill.What was funny in this film, I do not know? Every scene involves explicit sexual organ description or sex related images.",Step Brothers

261,andrewhamil,Dumb and Dumber revisited!!,7,24 August 2008,"All I can say is that this film is down right hilarious! The idea of two grown men living at home, living of their parents and acting like children works so well here. I read a review by Roger Ebert, who I generally respect, totally slate this film. He said it was crude, unpleasant, violent and just not funny in any way shape or form! I think what Mr Ebert fails to realise is that times are changing and that the comedy genre, which seriously needed a revamp, has to have all these elements in order to succeed. Thats not to say that this film is vile the whole way through, but it has some over the top scenes which are needed in order for the rest of the film to work! In short its just two men having a laugh and clowning around. Will Ferrell and John.C.Reilly are great together and its a bit reminiscent of Harry and Loyd in Dumb and Dumber, a film that Mr Ebert does not like either. The story, especially for young adult men, is so easy to relate to as we have all done things as daft and stupid as these two. The beauty is that Dale(Reilly) and Brennan(Ferrell) are just like two 12 year old kids, but just happen to be middle aged men. However the most refreshing aspect has to be that there is no love interest for either character! Like Dumb and Dumber there are women on the horizon, but it does not sell out the way most comedy films do where loser gets the girl that everyone wants!! Its more about Dale and Brennan growing up a little, but not too much! A quick mention has to go to Richard Jenkins who plays Dale's father Dr. Doback. Apart from Ferrell and Reilly he really does steal the show with his dry and sarcastic humour. Overall this is one of the better comedy films to be made recently and will be right up your street if you like anything by Jud Apatow or the Farrelly brothers! But most of all you will enjoy it if you have a strong sense of humour, unlike Mr Ebert!!",Step Brothers
262,dongraham22,Another poor performance,3,24 August 2008,"Was looking forward to this film, I really thought this was going to be the one that I would be talking about. Well I am talking about it but not in a good way.. the only thing I'm saying is for you not to waste your time and money going to see it. Poor from start to end. The funny parts were a tiny bit funny but that was it so imagine the rest of the film.In reading some other peoples comments I feel like I have watched a totally different film as I would not say this is the funniest film of the year. Will and John is a good pairing but they both have not done a good film in a while and I think we are going to have to wait a little longer.Certainly would not watch this again",Step Brothers

While I laughed here and there the movie never took off; in fact it ran dry early on. There are no real jokes in this movie. It is a series of events in which Ferrell and Reilly act like brats and blurt out outrageous things, which could be funny even. It wasn't. It dragged on until the one premise: Adults acting as children died of exhaustion. It's a shame because these two are capable of so much more. A huge disappointment and I am a fan of both mens work. I would hope that despite this they will work together in the future and that they will find a better script. If you have to see this good luck.",Step Brothers
264,nathjmc,The Texas Chainsaw Massacre of comedies,2,19 March 2010,"Will Ferrel is kind of hit and miss for me. I thought Anchorman was not so good but not complete shite. I really enjoyed Blades of Glory. I have no doubt that some people will think two grown men acting like thirteen-year-olds is hilarious and to be honest some parts were amusing, but all in all this movie disturbed me.The basic plot is man meets woman, man and woman both have thirty-year-old sons who live with them and are juvenile, woman moves in with man, sons don't like each other.That's it really. there's a bit about Will Ferrell's younger brother being successful and a dick but...I didn't watch till the end coz honestly it got a bit boring and the comic aspect gets tired but I don't think it could go from mediocre to brilliant in twenty minutes or so. It's really just the same Will Ferrell concept.",Step Brothers
265,EmmaWatson42,Hilarious!!!!,8,7 June 2010,"This movie is absolutely hilarious. Will Ferrell is one of the funniest actors, and John C. Reilly was hysterical in this movie. Every joke, scene, character, everything was incredibly funny. The scene after the credits, where Brennan and Dale beat up the kids at the playground was the best and funniest pay back scene of all the movies I have seen. I loved it when Dale punched Derek out of the tree house. This movie is easily one of the funniest movies ever made. Will Ferrell's movies are always funny (Anchorman, Blades of Glory, Land of the Lost) and I can't wait to see more of his movies coming up. I also realized that the song that Will Ferrell sang near the end of the movie was the song at the beginning of Blades of Glory, which made me laugh hysterically. Overall, Stepbrothers is a funny, yet disturbing movie.",Step Brothers
266,Chezna,"Disappointing, Rushed",3,3 December 2008,"I love both the leads; loved Old School, Talladega Nights and Anchorman and all of Ferrell's other films, even Blades of Glory. So I'm sorry to say this was a bomb. I laughed out loud twice - that's it - the Barbara Walters scenario line and the ""we do men stuff"" line retort. I smiled a half-dozen or so times and did watch the whole movie, but was thoroughly turned off by the characterizations of two adult men as so incredibly infantile (think to the point of developmental disability)and Derek's wife as so desperate and passive. Jokes - like the sleepwalking bit - seemed forced and ""tacked-on"". I feel if the writers had taken another few months to fine-tune the script, perhaps making the two brothers a little more mature from the start but simply unmotivated to change and not so grossly incompetent, it could have been a lot funnier.",Step Brothers

268,deepfriedmike,Surprisingly Funny,6,25 March 2015,"Being a huge Will Ferrell fan, I took the time off to watch one of his more successful movies. The entire premise of Step Brothers seemed cliché at first, but a couple of minutes into the movie, I managed to spew some pretty big laughs that left my roommate wondering what the hell was happening.I'm quite strict when it comes to comedies. I tend to enjoy quick, sarcastic humor that is really well scripted. But Step Brothers caught me by surprise, being so childish and insane, that I simply couldn't hold back the amusement.Will Ferrell and John Reilly work incredibly well together. You could honestly picture them as overgrown man-children. And I just think Mary Steenburgen is absolutely gorgeous, and playing the part of the overly casual mother was icing on the cake.Although Step Brothers may seem a tad bit farce and filled with fart jokes, I did have plenty of hearty laughs from all the hilariousness. It is definitely one of the better comedy movies that actually stay as it is, a COMEDY movie. I can guarantee you will get a great chuckle from watching this.",Step Brothers
269,irgifted87,"Dumb, but sometimes a dumb movie is what you need to see",5,29 July 2008,"I saw this movie because it's gotten to the point where I'm willing to watch anything Will Ferrell does in front of a camera. Sad, I know. I didn't really have high expectations for this film but I felt like I needed to see it because Ferrell has won my affections in previous roles. Some people don't like Will Ferrell, they think his humor is stupid and they don't get into him. That's a completely legitimate opinion, and honestly I'm glad those people have it. His humor is crude and not the wittiest or driest out there, but so what, he makes me laugh.Anyway, this movie was stupid. Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing. I think the production team intended to make a stupid movie from the get-go, and they succeeded. However it's totally OK for a comedy movie to be stupid. Sometimes you just need a break from thinking, and it's good to sit down in front of a movie that doesn't make you think at all and just laugh with some friends. If this isn't your thing, that's completely fine, I recommend you move along, there are hundreds of movies out there you'll love (I can recommend a few if you'd like).All that being said, this movie wasn't that funny. The main enjoyment that I got out of the film was imagining the fun that John C. Reilly and Will Ferrell had while filming. You could tell they really had a great time making this one, the production costs must have been super low, with basic costumes and no special effects so to speak, and the only real acting required was the two of them acting silly in front of the camera.This movie was somewhat enjoyable, and I did laugh at some funny parts, but will it go down as the next Anchorman or Talladega Nights? Probably not (we'll have to wait for the third installment in the Mediocre American Man trilogy for that). Is it a decent comedy to finish out your summer with? Sure why not. Just don't go expecting your life to change, and with the cost of movie tickets rising, it's even harder to justify a ~$10.00 movie ticket for something that's only passable.5/10",Step Brothers
270,toastyinva,OK but not a classic by any means,6,24 July 2008,I wanted to really like this movie more than I did. There are some very funny scenes but there are too many unfunny ones as well. Most of the best gags are in the first third of the movie then the movie slumps and only slightly gets better at the very end. One of the funniest scenes is after the credits so make sure to wait for it. The humor is crude and the language is foul. Lots of YELLING! The scenes jumps all over the map in between jokes to make for a very unstructured movie. Don't go into this with high expectations and you might at least have a few good laughs. I still think Ferrell is funnier in cameo roles. Dumb comedies have their place so this will amuse some people while others will realize that a decent premise gets old quickly when the jokes aren't all home runs.,Step Brothers

I really wish it had been better.The step brothers' characterizations were all over the place. One minute they're slightly eccentric, the next they're seriously deranged morons. And the film's tedium is almost unbearable (though I did manage to watch it to the end - just in case it got better). It didn't.And why anyone would care about these spoilt, middle class, psychotic losers (especially when they're not funny) is anybody's guess.

Throughout the entire movie was pervasive language talk about sex, masturbating, porn, and sexual reference after sexual reference and then the guy pulls out his testicles and puts them on the drum set. Yes there were a few funny jokes here and there and yes the story line was pretty good and it had a couple of good lessons to learn in the end. It was not worth going through over an hour of junk to get to the couple good things in it. I myself was very disgusted with it. I would say its one of the movies that you could definitely skip. To sum it up it was -10 out of 10 not worth spending money to see in fact it probably isn't even worth being paid to go see.",Step Brothers
277,madaseel,A 90-minute Saturday Night Live Skit,2,27 July 2008,"I went to a free advanced screening of the new Will Ferrell/John C Reilly vehicle Step Brothers tonight. I want my money back.You may think you've seen plenty of films with a one-joke premise. Step Brothers, however, pushes this cliché of bad film to terrible new lows. By now you've seen the trailer, you've read the previews- Reily and Ferrell star as children forced to co-exist under one roof after their parents get married. Like any pre-pubescent boys, they have their problems. The rub, of course, is that instead of pre-pubescent boys, they are 40 year old men.Not laughing yet? In case you don't get it, Step Brothers is a film about grown men who act like boys. Their parents wonder how in the world to handle these men-boys who make bunk beds, wear ironic Urban Outfitters clothes, and love the show Cops. At first rivals, they bask in their common hatred for yet another grown man-child, Ferrell's evil brother. He gets punched, yknow, in the tree house out back. Later, the Step Brothers eat poop and get spanked. Just like little boys! Um, yeah...Like many Apatow films, this movie seems like it was conceived in the basement of a man-cave, probably in a cloud of smoke emanating from a large glass art deco fixture. Sometimes, the ideas work like clockwork. See: the brilliant comedy Knocked Up and the occasionally hilarious Superbad. However, equal times there comes movies like Walk Hard and Step Brothers. Apatow has a mind of gold, but Step Brothers should have been aborted in the morning, instead of what surely was an early script-writing wake and bake session.That being said, if you like Blades of Glory, you'll probably like this. I didn't quite make it through Blades, so I don't know how it ends, but I think I can guess. Probably similar to this. With porn, right? 2/10, only because there were a few fleeting moments of humor. Also- still not the worst film I've seen at the cinema this year. That honor has to go to Wanted.",Step Brothers

Okay, I admit, ""Stranger than Fiction"" was crap, but I had high hopes for the guy.Will is 40 years old and plays a guy who's 37. But Will looks 48 in this movie... maybe even 50. Hey, no problem, let's suspend our belief in that one.The ""brothers"" are not technically retarded, yet in this movie they are clearly emotionally and mentally delayed. They have no desire to progress in their lives, and the ""big"" point of the movie is to reject that in life which is mundane and hold on to that which makes you different.Sadly, the only different thing about these guys is that they're both 13 years old... in 40 plus year old bodies. It's like the movie ""Big"" in reverse.This movie sucks and I'm fairly sure marks the end of Will Ferrell's dominance in modern comedy.I wanted to like this film. It was marketed very well. The best parts of the film are clearly in the trailer. The audience laughed the hardest during these scenes, not so much because they were classic in their humor but because it was opening night and the forgiving fans wanted so badly to give every benefit possible to this dog-feces of a movie.As my adoring fans know, I never pay to get into a movie. I always use bogus, printed passes I conjure up on my PC. If I liked the movie I go back and pay. If I loved the movie I go back and buy multiple tickets. I then rip 'em up and throw them away. If I don't like the movie I don't pay jack squat.With this movie I almost faked a ""I want my money back"" scenario.By doing this I reward the movies and their creators that are great and help to kill the movies and their creators which suck. And yes, I sleep very well at night.Download this movie over the internet or red-box it. Not even a matinée on this one. Might appeal to 13 year old boys, but I suspect they become confused as to why these old men are so hell bent on being buffoons.And, of course, the bottom line: The moral of the story is to be yourself and not let others shame you into mediocrity. Nice moral, amazingly stupid movie.",Step Brothers

I also enjoyed the star appearance of Seth Rogen which had me in tears. The lines from that film will be living in my mind for a long time now. I wouldn't say it was up to Anchorman standards but it was definitely better than Talladega Nights. Will Ferrell is an amazing actor and writer and should work so much more with Adam Mckay and John C Reily.

284,SnoochieBoochies89,You will love this movie...if you're into that sort of thing,8,8 April 2009,"If you seek this movie out, you fall under two classes of people: Will Ferrell-style, arrogant-yet-lovable, shulbby man-baby bro comedy fans or the soon to be disappointed. If Anchoman didn't get you laughing, this will never rev your laugh engine. You need to be in that state of mind. The comedy is fairly generic to the newly-formed genre of ""bromance,"" a word that is annoyingly prevalent yet entirely useful. If it helps, Bromance is the evolution of the Frat Pack -- they are slightly older but not at all more mature. The story is fairly ingenious, because while it could be real, there is something so basely Hollywood about the conversations. The dialogue cracks me up so much that there's no way real people could talk so comically. But this isn't Tarantino, and that's what makes it so hysterical. It's ridiculous to the point of surreality. So, if you're into that kind of humor, you will fall in love with Step Brothers. The bond between John C. Reilly and Will Ferrell is so strong and real that it makes the story so much more heartwarming. The story basically goes that these two 40-year-old men both live with their mother and father, respectively, and once their parents marry, the pair are forced to deal with the others intrusion. Eventually, they truly become the brothers they always wish they had. I won't give away more, and I don't need to. I've said it before and I will say it forever: if you're into Will Ferrell's dumb and sublime blowhard, you will need to see this movie. If you find it asinine and overrated, skip it, or your resentment will grow with each chorus of ""Boats and Hoes.""",Step Brothers
285,jasonhansencof78,Mean Spirited?,7,2 January 2014,"Because I felt that they were so mean to each other, I couldn't quite get into the comedy. At the very least, shouldn't the characters at least be likable? Granted, Ferrell and Reilly are master comedic artists at the top of their game, I'm not attacking their talent. I just couldn't become emotionally invested in their characters and that's on the script/story. I just watched a movie called Lars and the Real Girl with Ryan Gosling and another movie called The Evolution of Andrew Andrews with Will Klipstine. Although these are 2 indies and Step Brothers is a Hollywood movie, the leads in the two indies still come across winning the audiences sympathy in the end. It's okay for a character to be unlikable in the beginning and have to change by the end but sometimes I think the character doesn't quite earn it by the end. My two cents. I might give Step Brothers another chance some time. I definitely recommend the Andrews movie and the Lars movie. Those characters really earn it by the end and it's fresh in my head. Reilly and Ferrell are fun to watch do their thing, though...",Step Brothers

I enjoyed anchorman, and hoped this would live up to that level of weird comedy. It did. A couple of things though. This movie is not a thinker. If you had a long day or just want to laugh without engaging too much, this is the movie for you. Will Ferrel and company are hilarious in their roles. The first dinner scene in particular was great. One of my life goals now is to attend the Catalina Wine Mixer. Is that even a thing? Under all the comedy, there is a nice message. Don't lose yourself, or become something you don't want.

288,shaftfinder,"Not stupid - in fact, genius",8,27 February 2009,"I don't understand people who criticise this film as being stupid, or for having a predictable plot, or for the crudity, or for anything like that. I think they're seriously missing the point...behind the surface humour, the slapstick and childish behaviour, there is a truly subversive quality to it. It's taking all your expectations, built from years of watching predictable films, with predictable dialogue and plot development, and running with them - and I think that's where a lot of the laughter really comes from. It's almost, at points, as if the set-up for a typical gag in this film is your preconception of what these characters will do next, and the punchline is what actually happens - a ridiculously exaggerated version of what you have come to expect.The film is actually a parody of dumb comedies, as well as being (on the surface, at least) a dumb comedy itself. The singing in the car is a good example of this...it starts off and you're thinking ""yes, OK, they're the most annoying family in the world, having to be the best at everything, seen this sort of idea before""; but then they take it up a notch, and the arrangement of the song gets more and more complex, then it's revealed that Derek has been paying a small fortune in singing lessons JUST so they can do this, then it goes up a notch again when he almost crashes the car because he cares so much about it...you can't criticise the film for being stupid or for the plot as being predictable, when the film is actually playing with the whole idea of predictable plots and exaggerated stupidity as a source of the humour.I've read reviews criticising the film because the characters are too OTT, but again that's the whole point. Sometimes the characters lines are so dementedly over the top it takes the satire to a whole new level of plain weirdness and makes it almost disturbing at times. Dr Doback at the dinner table: ""you ARE impressive"" with a look on his face that's so unhinged in its level of butt-kissing it's genuinely odd; I think the humour also comes from this extremity. The film is a satire of these characters' stupidity (and not just Brendan and Dale either), not a celebration of it. I think Will Ferrell and John Reilly are so under-rated in a lot of these reviews. I don't think the comic talent it takes to come up with some of these incredibly random, and ultimately memorable, lines is really appreciated enough.",Step Brothers

It is a great film. Its a total guy movie. All the females i know who went to see it loved it too, but really its the kind you go to with your friends. I have yet to meet anyone who didn't love it. they must be the ones without friends.",Step Brothers
293,PeachSlice,An excellent comedy. But painful after an hour of viewing,9,22 July 2010,"One of my favourite comedies and really good for quoting. However, it feels like they used all their gags on the first part of the film. It was just flat. Also the character 'Alice' is so annoying and really doesn't help the plot of the film. The actor sucked in this film and also in Anchorman. But back to Step Brothers. I gave it 9/10 due to its hilarity in the first part of the film but the end really lets itself go. Im now struggling for something else to say about this film, (stupid 10lines guideline!) There are moments of the film that I HATE like the singing part in the car. I just cringe because it is just not funny. Basically whenever Alice arrives on-screen. The ending was a bit of a let down because there is no gag at the end so when the lights dim in the cinema you have to walk out in silence rather than in hysterics.",Step Brothers
294,Russxlrs,Complete Garbage on Film !!!,1,9 August 2008,"Just saw this last night, and nearly every moment I wanted to leave. This movie had exactly 3 moments that made me laugh for a second, and thats in the previews. I love humor and craziness and consider myself a blond Jim Carrey, now he is funny. But Will Ferrel, Mike Myers, and Adam Sandler consistently turn out the worst crap I've ever seen. I liked Elf, and Talladega Nights was OK, but the last several movie making ventures for Will Ferrel are crap, and this turd on film was my breaking point. I will never see a Will Ferrel movie again. I would like my money back! This movie is full of failing humor, the ""F"" word fly's around so much, even from the mature parents that it gets tiring. I've never seen such over blown attempts at trying to be funny and just see them fall on their faces. No person of intelligence could stand this movie.",Step Brothers
295,shawn0193,I'm Blown Away!,10,24 July 2008,"I Just got back from the midnight showing of Step Brothers. It is freaking HILARIOUS. I seriously laughed so hard that I almost passed out during the part will Farrel sings for his ""step brother"". Not a quiet moment in the theater. I never thought I would find another movie that could get more laughs out of me than Superbad, but this movie definitely did it. Don't even think about passing this up, you'll regret it. The movies contains some male and female nudity so use discretion when deciding to bring a younger audience. Phenomenal movie! Will Farrel brings the performance of a lifetime with co-star John C. Reilly.",Step Brothers
296,djl1187,Convincingly Uninspiring,3,4 August 2008,"Before viewing this movie - I really wanted it to be funny, but the movie is just another shamefully unimaginative promotion driven flick. Talladega Nights was funny with the product-integration, because NASCAR really is full of advertising. It seems every Will Ferrell movie though has countless shameless advertisements plugged into the script - it really takes away from the already paper thin script, which leaves nothing to the imagination. This is another movie where they degrade themselves to male nudity (as they did in ""WALK HARD"") it's uncalled for and played out. After seeing this I am convinced Will Ferrell is in it only for the money at this stage of his career. Do not waste your money on this film, or 90 minutes of your day.",Step Brothers
297,sam-vegas,Finally !,10,31 August 2008,"It has been 4 years since the epic release of Anchorman, which in my eyes is the greatest movie of all time. Following this movie, it was obvious that Will Ferrell would release many more silly comedies along the ""Anchorman"" lines. For a huge Ferrell fan, this was great news. However, they all really disappointed. Talladega Nights, was a breath of fresh air, showing the potential of Ferrell's abilities, but not as funny as i would have hoped. Semi-Pro, which is without a doubt the worst Ferrell movie to date.So, 2008, and another Ferrell movie for us to sink our teeth into. And it really hit the spot this time. Finally, a Will Ferrell movie which is on par with Anchorman. The comedy double act of Ferrell and Reilly is truly amazing. The story is completely original. It has one-liners that you will be quoting for years to come.To be honest it was a relief to see Ferrell's abilities used to their full potential in this movie. And also Reilly's. This will definitely be the kick off point for Reilly's career.So, if you are a fan of silly, childish comedy, you'll love this.Welcome back Mr Ferrell!",Step Brothers
298,samlikeschicken36,Funniest Will Ferrel Movie Yet,8,25 July 2008,"OK, first of all: all of you people that are saying this was crude and stupid humor are obviously not very observant, because if you saw any of the trailers for this movie, you must of realized it was that type of comedy. What were you expecting, a smart comedy? Not to say this movie didn't have some clever lines, but the whole concept was obviously going to be ridiculous. Second, my review: I've got to say, this movie had me laughing harder and longer than i ever had in my life. It did have some very crude moments, but most of which were gut- wrenching. There were very few moments in this movie when a joke failed to register with the crowd. Will Ferrel and John C Reillys' work in this movie is top notch. The way they act off each other just makes everything laugh out loud. I must say, I thought this was just gonna be another B+ Ferrel flick, but him and Reilly really pull the ridiculous humor right out of the script and turn it into something great. I really hope we see another Ferrel/Reilly film in the future, because at the moment, they are the funniest comedy actor duo in the business.",Step Brothers
299,spgarner,They had more fun making it than I had watching it,1,27 July 2008,"Will Farrell tea bagging a drum set is not funny. John C. Reilly in bicycle shorts or a Chewbacca mask is not funny. The two stars pulverizing a playground full of eleven-year-olds is also, you guessed it, not funny. In fact, it is desperate and pathetic.It is small consolation that one of the egregious scenes in the movie takes place after the credits roll. Unfortunately though, the aisles and exits at the theatre I saw Step Brothers at were clogged with spectators who, beyond any intelligible reason as far as I can tell, were amused enough by the first 100 minutes to stick around for the encore, so I was stuck.I find it necessary to qualify my above remarks, as well as those I have not yet written down, by saying I do not object to raunchy, low-brow humor. Any one of the images mentioned in the lead of this review could have been as funny as the pie scene in American Pie or the testicle/zipper shot in There's Something About Mary. But there needs to be some context and perhaps a little motivation as well. We need to know why something is funny, and understand how it fits in with the world its movie occupies. The images themselves do not suffice, no matter how shocking or disgusting.If you are not yet familiar with the general set-up of Step Brothers through the movie's excessively aggressive and ubiquitous marketing campaign, it is rather simple. Will Farrell and John C. Reilly play two slacker children- one is forty years old and the other is pushing forty with a short stick- whose successful, motivated single parents get married, and therefore begin the weirdest Brady Bunch type family in movie history. Farrell and Reilly's characters hate each other upon sight and bicker insufferably until they realize they are cut from the same degenerate cloth and then become best pals.Eventually, the father, a revered and important physician played by Richard Jenkins, becomes so enraged by the overgrown adolescents' antics, that he delivers an ultimatum to them. Get jobs and move out by the end of the month. I feel this is all the plot exposition this film deserves, because Step Brothers is more about a series of failed gags and profanity for profanity's sake.I consider myself to have a very high tolerance for explicit, raunchy sexual behavior and an even higher tolerance for foul language, but even I found Step Brothers to be puke-inducing, more than a bit rough. Remember the tea bagging scene mentioned in the lead. We do get to see every hairy inch of Will Farrell's scrotum. It does not advance the plot. It is not the logical conclusion of a series of events. It is not executed with any sort of subtlety or surprise, it is telegraphed a week ahead of time. It serves no function whatsoever except to show Will Farrell's testicles because Farrell, who co-wrote the script with director Adam McKay, thinks it is funny. It is not, and neither are the endless gags which continually use sex, genitalia, cursing, etc. as bludgeons. It is not so much a movie as an exercise in arbitrary weirdness and manic perversion.The clerk who sold me my ticket said that while most of the younger audiences seemed to love the film, many middle-aged moviegoers had left the film enraged, demanding to be refunded. To me, this does not demonstrate a schism in tolerance, but a schism in taste. Today's middle-aged moviegoer grew up with Animal House and Porky's, and was quick to embrace the aforementioned American Pie and There's Something About Mary. And anybody willing to put down ten bucks to see a movie starring the man behind Old School must have been prepared for some politically incorrect humor. However, in Step Brothers it is not funny, just depressing, mean-spirited and reprehensible.Even more depressing, is the fact that there is a kernel of a good idea here. There is endless comedic possibility of two social misfits with Peter Pan complexes who are seemingly oblivious to all real world expectations. Unfortunately, this movie is completely unwilling to push the frontiers of any sort of substance whatsoever. It just falls back on the same safe, broad humor that so many of Farrell's previous efforts are marked by. Worse yet, is that the two lead characters' quirks are made less interesting by the supporting characters in the movie. Everybody is pretty much the exact same. Even the supposed smart, successful people in Step Brothers behave like social deviants, giving Farrell and Reilly nothing to bounce their energy off of. They hardly even stand out as weirdos. Even the straight-laced father succumbs to visions of being a T-Rex. It is not a fantasy, but a goal.There is something potentially fascinating about a successful doctor who aspires to be a member of a different species, one that is extinct to boot, but like so much of the rest of the movie, the joke is undercut by the tone of the rest of the film. The undeniable chemistry between Farrell and Reilly is the only thing that makes this film supportable. They really embody these characters and go all the way with them. Unfortunately, that is all the way to the toilet. The film displays many symptoms of Farrell's classic ""Ain't I cute"" syndrome.This film makes the classic mistake of believing goofiness is an adequate substitute for wit. All comedy writers, directors, and actors would serve themselves well to observe a few basic lessons. Smart people are funnier than dumb people. Secure, well-adjusted people are funnier than zany outcasts. And most importantly, a bad gag done loudly is even more annoying than the same bad gag performed at a humble volume.In a summer of surprisingly strong major studio releases, Step Brothers does what it can to taint the cinematic gene pool.",Step Brothers

The slapstick comedy used was at times funny, and the relationship between the two main protagonists was excellently played out, but not enough. I like to watch a film and to at least feel some sympathy with the players, to like them, or want them to succeed...not in this film. In the end the two step-brothers were annoying in their lack of get-up-and-go, and the way they scrounged off their parents. By the time they did develop some hope for the future and proved themselves, the film was over. Unfortunately the clips used to advertise the film in the end were the funniest bits.",Step Brothers

This isn't the best Apatow film, but it is good and funny, definitely not a waste of time and you will find yourself quoting this movie, like all the other Apatow films. Don't go into it expecting 40 year old virgin quality, but similar to anchorman and Talladega Nights in its humor. The story could have been developed better, but saying that it's not as good as Talladega Nights misrepresents the movie, because all of his (Apatow's) films are funny and consist of the same type of humor. If you're older, i definitely wouldn't recommend watching this with your young children, or if you are easily offended because there is a lot of swear words. But i do highly recommend this movie, enjoy!",Step Brothers
304,tung_webster,Not a bad comedy,8,30 November 2008,"Step Brothers - 2008 had caught my attention a long time before it came out because of Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly, especially after Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (2006) in which both of them intertwined superbly. The fact is, in Step Brothers, both Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly are still very good. They can still make people laugh from the beginning to the end. The plot is basically interesting enough to set up a condition for Will and John to play baby. The filming is okay which virtually has nothing to be criticized. However this movie kind of received many opposite comments. Many people like it because of many laugh-out-loud scenes (fighting, cursing, struggling, sexing, etc). And some scenes are more like theatrical comedy with a lot of funny lines/quotes that I like. But some people didn't really like this movie. I guess the flow of the episodes upset some audience. I also feel that the director can either make it better in some way or the plot can be changed a little bit by adding or reducing characters. I think after Step Brothers, there will soon be a truly better movie with both Will and John.",Step Brothers

308,ruelland,"Same old, same old.",3,17 August 2008,"It's taken four or five films, but it seems like Hollywood has run of out occupations for Will Ferrell to have while he acts like a man child. From anchorman to NASCAR driver and some other sports, the apparent remedy of this problem comes in Step Brothers: make him a jobless man child. Oh, and have two of him this time and get John C. Reilly to play the other. That's the basic set up for this, Ferrell's third collaboration with ""Anchorman"" and ""Talladega Nights"" director Adam McKay, a tired, annoying, and sometimes cringe inducing display of the same shtick you've seen many times before.The movie follows Dale (Reilly) and Brennan (Ferrell), two single, unemployable 40 year old losers who still live at home with their single parents (played by Mary Steenburgen and Richard Jenkins, two very good actors that don't have much to work with). When said parents hook up and eventually marry, the two find themselves under the same roof and an hour and a half of them screaming and getting hurt ensue. The two despise each other at first, but eventually become friends, especially when their parents grow tired of their immaturity and force them to try and get jobs. This sets the stage for what essentially boils down to a series of sketches. One supposedly funny situation after the next that the boys find themselves in, barely connecting to form a plot at all, let alone something overly funny. Set pieces include Brennan's diabolically cruel younger brother, his crazy wife who finds herself infatuated with Dale, a street brawl with some grade school children, and a rap video (groan). Like previous McKay outings, this movie is a gag a minute, throwing out a lot of things, most of them missing the mark.To deride the humor as stupid is incredibly pointless. That's what one is expecting with movies like these, and even people who loved this movie would freely admit that it's stupid. The ""stupid"" factor of the humor isn't even my major problem with it. I've enjoyed movies like Anchorman and the indefensible Kung Pow: Enter the Fist, but there has to be some kind of wacky and over the top charm to a film's stupidity in order for me to be on board. Not only are Dale and Brennan un-charming, they're barely even likable, and even a little creepy. Seeing these men scream obscenities, beat the crap out of each other, act like children and destroy the lives of those around them wears thin very quickly without any charm acting as support. The film also suffers from a degree of unoriginality, nothing is recycled directly from the previous McKay movies, but I couldn't shake off the feeling that I've seen this all before, or that McKay and Ferrell weren't even really trying anymore.Ferrell and Reilly are gifted actors, and have proved in past films that they can be funny, but they have nothing to do here but repeat the same joke over and over again. Dale and Brennan are moronic man sized children, look at how stupid and childish they act, etc. etc. I'd be liar if I said the film was devoid of any laughs, because it does deliver some, but they just feel cheap, coming solely from Ferrell or Reilly's tone of voice or facial expressions, and not from good writing. You also get the feeling that, if nothing else, the actors are having a good time, which keeps the film from being something truly terrible. I'm also a sucker for randomness, and it succeeded at making me crack a smile a few times because of it. But the majority of the jokes just don't work; coming off as McKay trying to be as immature and senseless as possible (think Ferrell rubbing his balls on a drum kit is funny? Then you're in luck).The supporting characters don't help much either, most acting as one note and unlikable as the step brothers themselves. Brennan's brother and his wife try to be so frantically funny you feel like patting them on the back and saying ""You came on a little strong"". Steenburgen and Jenkins try their best, but as mentioned, they simply have zero material to work with, forced to simply act as straight-men to Dale and Brennan's idiocy. Until, of course, the movie finally decides to have some sort of conflict and makes the parents fed up with them, eventually resolving in conclusion just as asinine as the rest of the film. By that point I couldn't have cared about the characters any less.The film is bad, but not terrible. It's far too uninspired to get that strong of a reaction from me. It is simply McKay and Ferrell reusing their tried and tested formula once again, and failing completely in an attempt to capture any real sense of comedy or fun. If you loved the other movies made in this vein, then you'll surely like this too. If you find yourself tiring of Ferrell with each release, then save yourself some time and skip it, because ""Step Brothers"" will probably be the film that'll break the camel's back. Then fart on it or something.",Step Brothers

""I want to wrap you up and put you in my Virgina"" - Say something extremely inappropriate in a normal voice The first hour is basically a rip-off of the scene in Anchorman where Ferrell is arguing with Veronica Corningstone (""I'm going to shoot you in the back of the head with a BB gun"") followed by the scene in Talledega Nights where he makes up with John C ReillyThere's really not much else.First we lose Mike Myers, and now Will Ferrell... bad times",Step Brothers

He writes humor like a blind pig; every now and again he'll find an acorn, but by and large you're left waiting for something actually funny to come up on the screen.Now I am a fan of stupid-funny. I really, really am. I love dick and fart jokes when they're used to push an already funny scene a little farther. The bathroom scenes in Dumb and Dumber and American Pie left me with sore sides and tears in my eyes. Unfortunately, like most of Will Ferrell's flicks, he doesn't seem to even try to make scenes funny. Funny elements are thrown together helter-skelter, a bunch of foul language is added and the cameras roll, hoping that someone in the audience will find it funny and laugh.Now the movie did have its funny parts, and I did laugh at some of the scenes. Most of the movie, however, had me disappointed and waiting for the next scene, hoping it was less dumb and more funny. This movie isn't even worth a rental; the laugh-to-dollar-spent ratio is so low it's almost zero.Stupid-funny is a great genre: Zoolander, Dumb and Dumber, American Pie, Eurotrip, Road Trip, Me Myself and Irene... All great flicks. They pull off stupid-funny very well. Will Ferrell as an actor is great, he can do the schtick. But as a writer... no thanks.I think I am done watching Will Ferrell's movies.

Just a bunch of one liners. Vulgar parts of movies can produce some of the funniest movies and movie moments. Take a look for instance at Forgetting Sarah Marshal or Wedding Crashers. The humor in this movie seems to be aimed at a much younger audience than its R rating suggests. The acting is....well there is no real acting. It's just Will Ferrel and John C. Reily behaving as their usual characters on silver screen. At many points both of their characters just seem too over the top even for their childish roles.

In all honesty it wasn't the funniest movie I've seen, but it is a great movie to go see with friends for some cheap gut wrenching laughs.

323,e-27111,Great Film,9,22 January 2020,"Written by: Liam WormsA ""Step Brothers"" Film review
Have you ever noticed how stubborn and just plain stupid kids can be? If yes, do you think it's funny or do you think it's annoying? Either way it doesn't matter, this movie is HILARIOUS. Will Ferrel and John C. Reilly play 40 year old men, Brendon and Dale, still living at home who struggle with the idea of being an adult in yet another comedic gem staring the pair. Now if that sounds like a dead end to you don't worry there is genius behind this film that makes it worth watching. Brendon and Dale are not your average 40 year old losers who live at home with mom and order chinese take out every wednesday. The two brothers seem to have stopped aging at the age of about 6 or 7... at least mentaly. This is what makes the movie one of the funniest I have ever seen and seems to get funnier the older I get. From the little angry-face expressions to the crying like theres no tomorrow, Ferrell and Reilly are perfect in this movie.
There's one scene in particular that jumps in my mind when I think, ""what set the stage for the viewer?"", and that would be the dinner scene when Brendon and his mom first move into Dale and Dr.Dobeck's home. This scene consists of some of Ferrel and Reilly's best when it comes to acting and impressions. The two absolutely nail stereotypical poorly behaved children at the dinner table. They make snarky little remarks and make faces that are hardly distinguishable from a toddler. It's truly very funny. The First Dinner together Step Brothers.
At the beginning of the movie the two brothers start out as foes. As they go through failed interviews, a stuck up brother, and a parent divorce they slowly become closer, so there is something emotional to learn and take away from this movie which I like.We are getting a Divorce.
Even though the main focus is on Brendon and Dale there are other characters that have their funny moments. Derek, played by Adam Scott is the stuck up, cocky, arrogant, successful younger brother of Brendon. Derek perfectly represents the annoying little brother that always seems to get his way but in reality he's a little snot. I can relate because I have two younger brothers. What I like about Scott's character so much is he serves as the icing on the cake of the Step Brothers comedic set up. Whenever Derek shows up in this film he creates tension between characters causing for Hilarious bits.
By far the best thing about this movie is Brendon and Dale and how well they are played by Ferrell and Reilly. Everytime these two converse they produce at least two classic lines that viewers will never forget. Ferrel and Reilly are the perfect 40 year old toddlers and I say that without a doubt, but there is one thing I don't think is the best. There's one point in the movie where I think it goes to fast. One moment Brendon and Dale are dumb... then the next they seem to figure it all out. Not major just a little 0 to 100 type thing. One thing besides the great acting that I like about this movie is the running up and down the stairs. Throughout this movie there's short little cuts where you can see just Brendon and Dales feet running up or down the stairs. This perfectly creates that child-like feeling the movie has.
The one thing that makes this movie so funny is the talented acting put on display. Throughout the whole movie Ferrell and Reilly put their incredible skill to the test but never go over the edge. They never act too childish or too dumb...it's just right. I once heard it takes a highly intelligent person to play a highly dumb person in a movie, so you have to give tons of credit to Ferrel and Reilly and all the Actors of this film.Did we just become best friends",Step Brothers
324,jabmusic,An absurd film,1,26 July 2008,"One of the most idiotic films I ever saw. The humor is infantile with an absurd story line. There are a couple of funny jokes between Ferrel and his step-dad but that is about it. It seems as if all of the actors stretch the absurd humor to the limit. None of them give a credible performance with the exception of Jenkins who does a decent job as the father. As the movie progressed, the laughter thinned out in the theater. The story line was reduced to more absurdity as the film neared its conclusion. I wouldn't waste my time or money on this film. Wait for it to come out on DVD. That will probably be in about two weeks.",Step Brothers
325,schmittg,Not very good,5,3 August 2008,"I went and saw Step Brothers yesterday hoping for a good dumb comedy. While there was plenty of dumb there wasn't near enough comedy. My friends and I really enjoyed Talledega Nights and find ourselves quoting it constantly and from this movie we were hoping for another hit form these two. What we got was barely half of a movie. The first half of the movie is just alright, if you like the kind of stupid humor from will Ferrell movies, with a few laugh out loud moments. Then about halfway through the movie its as if the writers forgot that there was absolutely no plot so they'd stop being funny and try to throw together a dumb and unfunny plot to end the movie. While i was laughing pretty regularly when the movie got started I barely laughed at all for the last 40 minutes and left very disappointed. I would not recommend this movie to anyone its a pretty big disappointment in my eyes.",Step Brothers

There are big laughs left and right, non stop! and thank GOD it was rated R, it wouldn't have been nearly as good! It was well written by Ferrell and Adam McKay. The dud that was Semi-Pro put a kink in Will's career in my mind with his whole typical type-casting character he gets in scripts and the way he writes and lets be honest, it was getting old, but Step Brothers put out more than what i needed to get back on the bandwagon of his movies. The spotlight is equally shared between Ferrell and Riley throughout and it really makes you feel like being 12 again and living off of your parents, but watching 40 yr old men doing it is way funnier than any 12 year old can make their childhood seem!! A MUST SEE FOR ANY FERRELL OR RILEY FAN!! We all now can have faith put back into Will Ferrell!",Step Brothers
329,soccertad7,More Nut Sack,9,1 August 2008,"This movie clearly needed MORE nut sack, if you don't enjoy a good Teabag joke I'm not sure what you can enjoy. This was easily Will Ferrell's crudest movie, surpassing Semi-Pro as his most crude movie.Hilarious movie, however it relied a lot on shock value for the humor, that didn't stop the fact it was still amazing. They also have hundreds of memorable quotes and one liners that I will be joking about with friends forever.In conclusion, MORE NUT SACK, and I'm sorry for anybody that is too prude to enjoy a good cock joke. I personally think they could've used the teabag joke on at least 3 or 4 more scenes and it wouldn't lose its humor. I hope people can enjoy a movie for what it was, and if you went to this movie for good family humor you clearly didn't watch the previews or Will Ferrell's career very closely.",Step Brothers

Ferrell played a role similar too that in elf, slightly annoying and i wasn't a fan of Reilly.Very little happened and the film was one of those average comedies similar to that of a adam sandler film; worth the watch and one you may for some reason end up watching again, but not entertaining!Overall im disappointed as I expected more.",Step Brothers
331,nebojsarako-busa,hello my lady......:D:D:D,8,20 October 2008,"OK, i gotta admit that i was a bit skeptical about this film at firs. So i went to the cinema to see it and i was just surprised How the originality of the plot came to be. Ferrell and Riley turned out to be once more a great comedy duo. although Ferrell didn't play his usual arrogant characters, he did a great job playing the goofy, shy, not to self-satisfied mommas boy Brennen huff. On the other side we have Riley who plays this wannabe-macho,insane drumming freak that proves to be in some parts even funnier then Farrell (who would have thought). OK, enough bullshitting. The plot is great and original. Brennen and Huff are both sons of a single mother and father. Well the mother and father( played by Richard Jenkins and Mary Steenburgen) under funny circumstances get together and believe it or not they get married. Now it comes to the moment of moving in together, so the two step brothers gotta live under the same roof, what turns out to be a great motive for some ass kicking /funny/ torturing scenes. But after meeting Brennens real brother Derek(played by Adam Scott) they decide to join forces to make a full of him. But in the process they realize that they have a lot more in common then they first thought. They soon get all the wacky ideas that a kid would get- from making a bunk bed out of two regular ones( bad idea, trust me :d, to the idea to make their own business:D. But time is short so the two newly married parents decide to go on a trip around the world so they have to sell the house , which will force the two brothers to move out of the house and for the first time in their lives get a real job and start living like adults all in all for the whole time they play 40-year old mommas boys which is a great comedy recipe and if you add the great duo by Ferrell an Riley you get a smashing instant classic comedy.",Step Brothers

The worst was how total lack of respect for your parents is not only tolerated, but in some cases deemed acceptable. I became so incensed at how the infantile antics of these two 40 something losers were celebrated I had to turn the thing off. It is really sad what Hollywood has decided is comedy these days.More and more it seems that bad behavior and disrespect to others has been deemed acceptable and, in some cases, preferred behavior.

This movie is unbelievably stupid...and I don't mean funny stupid, I mean I can't believe anyone would find such basic, simple, absolutely ridiculous jokes and situations, funny. It's an almost impossible task to watch it to the end as they get worse and worse. I felt so bad to have spent my money on such a poor poor comedy-wannabe movie. I just can't understand how this even got to the cinemas. And also how is it possible so many people found it funny?? Think twice before watching it, it doesn't bring anything useful to your life, doesn't even make you laugh.",Step Brothers
334,orangerhymepictures,It gets better every time!,9,17 February 2009,"When I first saw this film last summer, I was not sure if I liked it or not. I went into it quite skeptical I thought oh, it would be another Apatow-Ferrell comedy-money-machine... but it wasn't. After it came out on DVD, I watched it again and I just about died. The film's problem is beyond Apatow's control it's our expectations. Most people expected the same thing seen in Semi Pro, Blades of Glory, or Talladega Nightsbut this film was much more clever and classic. The concept itself was extremely original. But people wanted to see Ferrell exercise the same formula goofy, huge man playing a professional sport and at some point fighting an animal (cougar, bear, etc.). To my surprise, this was not the formula in Step Brothers. Instead, we saw some true comedy genius: tons of great improvisation (see the one-liners on Youtube or on the DVDs) and musical elements (""Boats and Hoes"" and the ""Time to Say Goodbye"" rendition at the end). I mean, if you enjoyed Ferrell and Reilly (with Jack Black) at the Oscars a couple of years ago (see: ""Comedian at the Oscars""), you'll love this. While a lot of this film has slapstick elements (ridiculous fight sequence, etc.), it is very clever. Underneath all of the silliness, you see that Ferrell and Apatow are really commenting on something that is becoming increasingly common in the US: parents letting their children leech off of them. Obviously this is a parody on that, but much of the behavior, interactions, and lines are pretty spot on. Like when the parents take away TV for a week and Ferrell and Reilly scream at them. It's genius.See it. Don't expect it.",Step Brothers
335,Aadyii,I thought that it is supposed to be a comedy...,1,6 November 2008,"I like both actors and most of their movies, but Step Brothers was a 1 hour and 45 minutes of boredom and mixed feelings.I seriously thought that this movies is a comedy but after a 10 or 20 minutes I realised that I did not have any laugh so far, not even a single smile on my face... The movie bet on two points that might make people laugh. One of them is situational comedy but many times so absurd it is not funny at all. More like pathetic or awkward. The other point is Will Ferrell and John Reilly cursing on each other. There was no intelligent humour whatsoever and my first laugh came like 10 minutes before the end.I expected much much more and so this movie is a big disappointment. I hope that these two actors will forget this movie and try to work on something more enjoyable.",Step Brothers
336,trickyboarder93,Will Ferrell just not funny anymore?,3,28 July 2008,"This movie had funny parts but a large portion of the movie was amateurish and vulgar. There were a few jokes that after I though thats a sorta joke a 12 year old would make. Also there was lots swearing that had no wit and just left me feeling dirty, and not in a good way. There were also some jokes that after I just thought holly crap thats weird and didn't laugh at all, like I don't find rolling someone up and sticking them into your vagina to be funny, I don't know what Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly were thinking when they put that in. This movie seemed more like Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly goofing off then an actually production level movie. One scene in this movie were Will Ferrel put his testicles on Reilly's drums set seemed to be a scene that was trying to get a comedic effect from being purely vulgar with no wit.After all that I have to say I had a few good laughs and had a good time watching this with my friends, but I still think you would be better off renting a movie then going to this.",Step Brothers
337,stickymickysdicky,"silly, light-hearted fun.",6,12 August 2008,"Step Brothers is far from a perfect film... its plot and progress are cumbersome, and it doesn't seem to know if it's pro, or anti ""grown-ups"" being bums. Like Anchorman, it is full of one-liners and physical gags that, while quite funny, have pretty much nothing to do with the actual plot itself. For the most part they work, but for me it was pretty hit-or-miss in places.It sees a reunion of with Ferrell and Adam McKay (the director who usually normally ""brings out the best"" in Ferrell), be it as a sketch writer and short-film director on ""Saturday Night Live"" or in bigger features like; ""Talladega Nights"" and ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"", both of which like ""Step Brothers,"" were co-written by Ferrell and McKay, with the pervasive Judd Apatow producing.It's nice to see Will Ferrell returning to what he does best, after watching him try to duplicate the character-and-slapstick formula much less successfully in movies like ""Semi Pro"".One of the more commendable things about Step Brothers is that it gives Ferrell the opportunity to be understated at times, something he has seemingly forgotten to do in his non-McKay / Apatow films. He also does a lot of squinting, bringing back memories of his old George W. Bush impressions.Reilly is also pretty funny, but Richard Jenkins (dead Father of ""Six Feet Under,"" fame) is the big surprise.As mentioned before, it's pretty hit-or-miss in many parts, so don't expect too much... that way you won't be disappointed.",Step Brothers

Look, I like these guys, but I just often felt that these two guys obviously have mental and emotional delays - and if they didn't have them 20 years ago they have definitely developed them since. Sometimes I felt like it was a film on the strains of looking after mentally/emotionally-dependent-adult-offspring.""Oh no we can't go on our honeymoon because it turns out our sons need 24 hour care so they are not a danger to themselves or others"". Ha ha ha?*possible spoiler* The dinner scene where we meet the younger brother (yay! Parks and Rec!) underlines this. If an adult man interrupted a story with a juvenile question in a childlike manner, people wouldn't be affronted, they would probably be kind and polite, assuming the man has a mental issue.Unfortunately the whole 'men acting as teenagers' thing is funny until you realise these guys can't just be kicked out of home & arranged with a job like teenagers - they look like they need professional integration and support to the real world...If you can get around that, it really ain't so bad :) Maybe the guys should have written the script but got younger guys to play the characters so it wasn't quite so...sad.

339,paulweigel,May be the worst movie of the year!,1,25 July 2008,"Okay -- I'm normally a Will Farrell fan, but if there were a movie where you look back and say he jumped the shark, well, this is the one.You can read the summaries of the premise of what the movie is supposed to be, but whatever it is, it just doesn't work. Anyone who thinks the chemistry of Will and John C. Reilley works in this movie has to be smoking the same amount of crack that these guys were while developing the film.I mean really -- two guys in their late 30s (or early 40s) are living separately at home with different parents? At the start of the movie, I didn't know whether to feel sorry for the guys or try and appreciate the humor. Instead, I was looking at my watch -- 10 minutes in. There are lots of cameos from Judd Apatow's crew, and each time you thought to yourself ""wow, they were funnier in XXXXXX"". To bad...All of the humor throughout the film is directed at an audience somewhere between the 13 year old male and the 17 year old male, because no one with a high school degree would find any entertainment out of the film at all.Is it a bad thing when the highlight of the film is right after the credits when the characters beat the crap out of junior high school kids? I don't know if I laughed because the film was over, or because the film was over.To top it off, I saw this film at the matinée, and I still thought it was a waste of my money. This thing should have gone straight to DVD, or maybe never should have made it to the public ever. If Apatow productions wants to give me and my fiancé's money back, that would be great.

340,landon-lichtman,Stupid comedy,6,26 July 2008,"While Step Brothers did run an above-average marketing campaign, I believe it did not live up to the hype. Then again, who enjoyed Talladega Nights. I'm 18 years old, and every other viewer of Step Brothers was either this age or less. Sadly, this is the only audience this movie would appeal to, unless you're incredibly immature.Will Ferrell is fair, lighting up the screen with a few memorable quotes, and John Rieley (sp?) was equally mediocre. While various sub-plots emerged throughout the movie, it was hard to truly grasp what exactly the step-brothers were going to accomplish over the hour and a half. The humor was perverted and crude, but garnered laughs from the audience.To conclude, I can't say I've ever really liked Will Ferrell, with the exception of a handful of SNL skits and Anchorman, so my judgment may be flawed, but this movie wasn't any diamond in the rough for comedy movies. I think John Rieley excelled more in his role, but with that being said, he looked like more of a dumbass than Will Ferrell.

With that said however they are making WAY too many movies with him as the lead comic role, and he plays the exact same character in each one. They have been slowly killing his humor for me. As for Step Brothers I think its the worst of all his movies so far. The jokes were fairly brainless and had little wit to them. There was also a lot of swearing. At some points in the movie I felt like people were laughing because some one in the movie used an F-word. I can understand a 12 year old laughing at that, but thats it. Characters like Derek (Brennan's brother) made the movie seem like a children's movie because he was played so over the top and unrealistically. However he swears a lot and is very vulgar so I doubt kids would find it funny either. All in all I laughed maybe two and a half times at the movie just because Will Farrel is still pretty funny, but he had little to work with in this script.",Step Brothers

The 'toilet humour' in it is terrible, you would think this movie was made for 8 year olds or people with a similar aged sense of humour.The high point of the whole movie for me was when the end credits came up because i'm not one to leave a movie halfway through (although I was very tempted with this one!).So before anyone actually watches this movie, if you like Will Ferrell movies it DOES NOT at all mean that you will like this one, I thought it was a huge let down! and I want that hour and a half of my life back!",Step Brothers

Its one of those movies you could watch a few times and still laugh. i have it in my DVD collection and have seen it a few times, still laugh at it...If you don't like silly comedies then you probably wont like this. or if you don't have any sense of humour at all..If you're one of the type of people who says stuff like ' oh this isn't realistic two guys acting like that ' well you wont enjoy it...

357,levi-timmer,This movie was one of the most hilarious movies ever made.,10,9 November 2012,"Step Brothers Movie ReviewThis movie will give you the best time ever; however, it is for mature audiences ONLY. If you are not over, at least 18, this movie may not be for you. If you like extremely crude humor, you will definitely fall in love with this movie. This movies curses all the time and sexual humor is also involved. Also, as most movies do, this one has a moral.Step Brothers has extremely crude humor and will make anyone laugh and have a good time. Step Brothers uses crude humor as one of its primary sources of comedy. The brothers act very rudely towards each other and their parents in the beginning of the movie in a very comical way. A quote to prove this statement is one that takes place when the two brothers are grounded and Brennan Huff (Will Ferrell) says, ""This house is a f***ing prison, on planet bull sh**, in the galaxy of 'this sucks camel d****!'"" Another aspect that this movie shares with its crude humor, is its sexual humor. Although Step Brothers doesn't use sexual humor quite as much as it does crude humor, it still learns to use it in a very humorous way. A situation in the movie to prove its sexual humor is a scene in which Dale Doback (John C. Reilly) doesn't want Brennan Huff (Will Ferrel) to touch his drum set. Brennan Huff (Will Ferrel) then threatens to put his genitals on Dale Doback's (John C. Reilly's) drum set, and proceeds to do so.As fun and humorous as this movie can be, some bad elements go into it as well. People may not like the fact that this movie introduces a rather stupidity type of humor. Also the fact that many things that show up in this movie, aren't at all relatable to the ongoing story happening throughout the movie; However, this movie still shows a good side to all of the characters and a good story.As most movies do, Step Brothers has a very good moral to its story. The moral is, in my opinion, that people need to learn to push through their differences and get along. This moral goes very well with the story for reasons such that the two brothers are meeting each other for the first time and absolutely hate each other. Throughout the movie, they learn that they actually have a few things in common and learn to push through their differences, and become best friends, or in this case, brothers.Do step brothers really act this way? Maybe they do, maybe they don't, this movie says they do. Watch for the end of the movie in which the brothers get a little present.",Step Brothers
358,dhdman,Just a couple of Jagaloons,8,12 November 2012,"Step Brothers, directed by Adam McKay of Anchorman fame, may be one of the more underrated films in recent memory. Not because it's a groundbreaking comedy worthy of accolades, nor will it go down in history as an all-time great. However, Step Brothers gets such a bad rap as 'stupid' or 'crude' that you have to wonder if the people saying that understand its purpose. This is not to say it isn't stupid or crude; if you are easily offended or have a problem with juvenile humor, I suggest you run in the other direction. If you are like me, a plebeian of such low class that you can actually suspend belief and appreciate pure entertainment for what it is, you will love this movie.As was the case in Anchorman, the plot serves only to advance the comedic performances of it's stars, in this case Will Ferrell, John C. Reilly and the lesser known Adam Scott. Ferrell and Reilly play Brennan Huff and Dale Doback respectively, two forty-something misfits who still live with their single parents. Brennan's mother, Nancy, and Dale's father Robert, meet at a conference and upon realizing each other's common plight, fall in love and get married. This union brings Brennan and Dale under the same roof, with sometimes crude but always humorous results. Fuelled by sibling rivalry, they become fast enemies. After an incident involving Dale's drum set and Brennan's genitalia, and an ensuing fight, they are grounded, and the two begin to bond. Their friendship is further cemented by Dale and Brennan's mutual hatred for Brennan's younger, successful brother, Derek, played by Adam Scott. Derek is the unsung hero of the film, and relishes the opportunity to be a character you love to hate. After a split between Nancy and Robert forces Dale and Brennan into the real world, they must make up for all their years of dormant maturity and learn to be adults.The most endearing quality of Step Brothers is that it does not try to be anything it isn't. If you came into the film with knowledge of Anchorman and Adam McKay's style of film making, Step Brothers will deliver a similar experience. The larger than life personalities of Ferrell and Reilly, deliver the type of over the top performances fans have come to expect. Ferrell, who describes himself in the film as a ""world class singer"" and the ""songbird of our generation"", has a fabulous solo towards the end where he performs Por ti volaré by Written by Lucio Quarantotto and Francesco Sartori. It is a little known fact that he actually sang this song in the movie, which only adds to the comedic effect. John C. Reilly thrives in his role, and it's easy to picture a young person acting as he does, only in this case he's a middle-aged man. These strong performances aside, it is Adam Scott's character that manages to steal the show. Derek is the perfect juxtaposition to the sometimes over the top immaturity of Dale and Brennan. His overall arrogance and absolute douchiness allow you to sympathize with Brennan and Dale on some levels. Without a doubt, Step Brothers is character driven fare. The common theme of sibling rivalry is prevalent throughout, and is made especially funny by the fact that both Dale and Brennan are grown men. From their meeting in the opening credits to their stare down at the dinner table, the interactions between the two are quite believable in many ways. For those in the audience with siblings, there are numerous interactions that will strike a chord. Dale's drum set, and his absolute insistence that Brennan never touch it, is one perfect example. The juxtaposition of Derek as the successful son, and Brennan as the failure, is another example, and allows the viewer to feel just a little sympathy for the half-witted duo Step Brothers is not a film that will go down in history as an all- time great, or for that matter, even be mentioned in the conversation. In the times of Shakespeare, he would famously implore his audience to ""suspend their disbelief"", and that is exactly what viewers must do in order to enjoy a film such as Step Brothers. For better or worse, centered on the performances of it's stars, fans of Anchorman and this style of comedy will find Step Brothers to be a satisfying follow-up. Detractors of this style will dismiss it as juvenile and shallow. Step Brothers is unabashedly crude, dumb,offensive, and for those who can get past all of that, side-splittingly funny.",Step Brothers

360,mi-16evil,One of the funniest Judd Apatow movies since Anchorman!,4,14 July 2008,"Just got back from an early screening of Step Brothers, and oh man is it funny. While starting off a bit slow, about twenty minutes in you will be rolling in your seat. Will Ferrel and John C. Reily are perfect together and look for a surprisingly brilliant performance from Kathryn Hahn, who all I can say nearly steals the show in her scant time on screen. The main drag in this film is the beginning and the climax, both of which were slow and dull. Also the film at times seemed to be reaching for a point where there really wasn't one set-up. Also this movie is foul, with a few gross out scenes but especially a LOT of language. While I'm not usually opposed to foul language the level in this film is almost absurd, which takes away from a lot of potential jokes. Overall this is a great film from a fabulous director and a breath of fresh air from the stale slew of comedies this year.",Step Brothers
361,Chadbradshaw1,Ferrall and Reilly step up once again in this great comedy.,9,23 October 2013,"Summary: Two newly formed step brothers start off fighting, then after a sudden change happens for the both of them they realise their common interests.In the beginning... The story starts with the two main characters called Brennan Huff aka Knight Hawk (Will Ferrell) and Dale Doback aka Dragon (John C Reilly) being introduced by their newlywed parents played by Richard Jenkins and Mary Steenburgen. This leads to a number of confrontations and very funny outcomes.Background: Step Brothers sees the welcome return of director, producer and screen writer Adam McKay who's done various films and TV credits including Hansel and Gretel the Witch Hunters, Anchorman and Saturday Night Live. The film re-sparks the collaboration of Adam McKay and his comedic partners Will Ferrell and John C Reilly they have worked together in films such as Talladega Nights and Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues.Conclusion: In my opinion Step Brothers is a brilliant film. It's funny, entertaining and great to see Will Farrell and John C Reilly working together on the screen again. A definite 9 OUT OF 10!",Step Brothers
362,zuixon,Extremely funny,10,28 November 2013,"This is one of those rare movies that had me laughing out loud. By now I must have at least watched it about 17 times with my girlfriend. We often randomly quote the movie to one another. Watch it, don't think too much and just enjoy and it'll be an excellent movie. And not just the step brothers but all the supporting actors are great as well. The enabling mother, the passive aggressive father, the weird sister in law. All of them did a great job. I still cringe at the scene where Derrick and his family are singing in the car. There's just something about the boy that isn't right. Though Derrick is the reason why the step brothers become friends and that's where the real fun begins. This definitely is Will Ferrell's best movie and I'm kind of hoping there's gonna be a number two. Though I doubt there will be. John C. Reilly and Will Ferrell know what they're doing.",Step Brothers
363,user-13-143268,My favorite film ever,9,28 May 2014,"this film is my favorite film ever, although the comedy is not the highest brow comedy. I laughed so hard i cried, i can honestly say its hard to make me laugh so hard and in the 6 years that have passed since it was released i have still not found a film that comes even close. Its not hard work to watch and although the comedy is not complex there is a bit too much balls and self appreciating in the movie. If you like Ferrel and Reiley's brand of comedy then you will love this. I personally think if you don't find this funny and i have seen reviews that slate it, then i feel you need to go and get an emergency comedy transfusion. How can anybody not find 40yo men acting like kids building bunk beds and failing. Not to mention scrotum's being placed on a drum set thats sacred to its owner. O and any movie that has white dog poo in it is OK with me. If you are looking for an intellectual experience look elsewhere if you are a real person who doesn't take life too seriously then you will love this movie. Look out for the song ""Boats n Ho's"" how it never got to number 1 is beyond me.... enjoy",Step Brothers

I am slowly loosing hope for comedic films as a whole. I refuse to hop on the ""so stupid it's funny"" bandwagon. Have writers simply decided they don't want to work on meaningful comedy anymore? I am not a fan of Will Ferrel movies in general but I will admit that I have, once or twice, chuckled while watching one of his films. This film, in particular, contains not one redeemable moment. Characters are unrealistic and unlikable. The premise of the film is cringe worthy. I do not plan on ever watching a Will Ferell movie again.",Step Brothers

Riley and Will Ferrell feed off each other. This is no masterpiece by any amount, but it had its moments that were able to make me laugh out loud.Some of the humor is a bit crud so this isn't a movie for children. If you enjoyed Will Ferrell's other movies this is probably a film you'll enjoy. If you don't enjoy Will Ferrell movies then odds are this one won't win you over either.Even though the plot was silly and juvenile, this is a movie that will give you some good laughs without having to do a lot of thinking.",Step Brothers

To be fair, you'd probably like it if you enjoyed Anchorman and other recent Will Ferrell movies. This one just steps up the stupidity. Poor dialog and pointless humor were supposed to be redeemed by being so unpredictable and OVERWHELMINGLY crude. Most jokes are the equivalent of shouting, ""Penis!"" with the expectation of the audience giggling like kids. Both stars appear pretty desperate to accept these roles. Dozens of people left the theater within thirty minutes and I did after an hour; a friend who stayed said it got worse after I had left. Don't go see this movie. If you do, don't bring a date, parents, mentor, children, or anybody whose respect you crave.",Step Brothers
369,eurekavfx,It exceeded my expectations!,10,16 July 2008,"I saw an early screening of this flick tonight, and I absolutely loved it. When I first saw the Red Band trailer for Step Brothers, I knew immediately this movie was going to be funny. The trailer made me laugh each time I watched it, which is absolutely not common for any comedy movie trailer I've previously seen. But my God, I did not expect the movie to be as funny as it turned out. Will Ferrel and John C. Reilly are comedy gold in this movie. The two of them, Dale(John C. Reilly) and Brennan(Will Ferrel) are two adults that still live with their parents, and because of that both of them are very childish. But once the two come together, you cannot help but laugh. The chemistry between the two is brilliant, and no matter what, you will find yourself laughing your ass off when they're interacting. At first, they're always throwing the most funny and imaginative insults at each other, and once the two become best friends, they're a god damn gut-busting mess. They have such child-like minds at times - one moment in the movie that displays their immaturity is when a girl tells Dale how much she wants to have sex with him, and he has no idea what exactly is happening. He's so confused by the fact a girl is actually hitting on him. Ferrel and Reilly are the reasons why the movie is fantastic, even though a few of the supporting characters, like Brennan's younger brother, are also quite funny. This movie had me in stitches from beginning to end. It was absolutely consistent in laugh-out-loud moments, and I haven't found myself laughing this hard in a film since Superbad. There's one line in the film made the ENTIRE theater laughing uncontrollably, and I'm not going to spoil it, but it involves Dale describing Brennan's singing voice.All in all, Step Brothers is quite possibly the funniest film I have ever seen, and my favorite film of 2008. See it.",Step Brothers
370,zacharymblumenthal,Amazing! Nostalgia at its finest.,10,13 December 2016,"Step Brothers is one of those movies that polarizes and divides. Some consider it one of the funniest films they've ever seen, and others write it off as another slapstick, goofball comedy that relies on gimmicky jokes and childish expletives. What people don't understand when they take this movie seriously is that it is basically an intentionally paradoxical satire of the over- privileged youth of white suburban America. Only the main characters aren't bratty children, they're bratty and unemployed 39 year old adults living with their parents. The concept seems preposterous, let alone the absurd behavior of both Dale Dobak (John C. O'Reilly) and Brennan Huff (Will Ferrell) who become stepbrothers during the film's opening, but it has this unrelenting charm that makes it impossible to not laugh at. We are introduced to both of the main characters after their parents meet at a business conference and proceed with a shotgun wedding of sorts. Both Brennan and Dale are unsure about their parent's decision and they have no problem expressing their concerns. ""I didn't want salmon! I said it four times!!..This wedding is horse sh*t."" Brennan exclaims as he storms out of the wedding reception. Later, after the pair have a physical altercation due to Brennan touching Dale's drum set, Dale's father punishes them by announcing ""No TV for a week!"". ""What?!"" Both Dale and Brennan exclaim in unison. ""This house is a f*cking prison!"" yells Brennan. ""On planet bullsh*t!"" adds Dale. ""In the galaxy of This Sucks Camel D*cks!"" Brennan loudly concludes. It's humor like this that infects the movie with wacky charm and awkward character interactions. It's borderline cringe-worthy as you watch ""normal"" characters react to Dale and Brennan's antics, but it only helps push the ""manchild"" narrative to new heights. Throughout the film, Dale and Brennan are eventually forced to get jobs and move out of their parents house after essentially causing them to divorce. The movie concludes when Dale and Brennan co-work the Catalina Wine Mixer for Brennan's ultra-successful brother, when Dale's father, feeling nostalgic for Dale and Brennan's bizarre, yet intrinsic childish nature, tells the boys to ""never lose their dinosaur"", basically telling them to be themselves and screw everyone else. The movie ends with both Dale and Brennan returning to their goofy selves, but with good jobs and respective significant others. I watched this in my senior year of high school, and coming back to it feels like I'm watching a piece of my past. It really is excellent entertainment, even if it's almost impossible to take seriously. 10 out of 10!",Step Brothers

372,daycharlie,"An outstanding Comedy that is still so funny your lungs will hurt, even 9 years on.",10,9 September 2017,"So I have seen this film many times over the years from the first time I watched it with my dad I must have seen it roughly 100-150 times in the last 9 years and I can tell you it has aged well. The film is one of my all time favorites and it has me in stitches every time I watch. This type of comedy relies on just childish stupidity and naivety in 40-year-olds and is so ironic it is just so hilarious. The way Will Ferrell and Adam Mckay made this film it keeps you constantly laughing through out and just keeps the jokes coming. There are none of the long pauses to add context to the story, whilst keeping the context of the story with many short and unbearably hilarious breaks from the main skits. This is one of the reasons the film is always laughable and cannot be beaten in my book. Through out the main sequences, the use of ironic humour is constant and even though at some points slightly over used it is inescapable and funny as hell. This is due to a number of awkward scenes, such as when the entire family are eating dinner for the first time and the two go back and forth with immature and petty insults like ""I remember when I had my first beer"". this line said at dinner whilst Will (Brennan) is sipping on blue gator aid like a small child and then when met with a retaliation from John (Dale) proceeds to wail and cry. That is just one example of the Immature and hilarious moments in this film and give the audience an easy laugh by making them feel superior to the morons on screen. This, I believe is why the film has been so successful and why it is a classic, in my opinion, this is one of the best comedy films ever. I would write more, but this is my first review and I wanted to keep it rather short and concise. If you haven't seen the film I highly suggest it and if you have, watch it again. thanks for reading hope you enjoyed it. C_S_S_D",Step Brothers

375,w-63899,Great movie,10,1 June 2018,"I chose to do my movie review on the hilarious comedy step brothers. It got a rating of 54% on rotten tomatoes which means roughly as many people did not enjoy this movie the same amount enjoyed it. It has many well known actors throughout the film including the two main characters, john reilly, and the king of comedy will ferrell, along with many other well known actors, like richard jenkins (father), mary steenburgen (step mother), and adam scott (brother). Although there were many other characters throughout the film these were the main characters throughout the entire film. If i were to give my rating of this film i would give it a 92% because it's an extremely hilarious movie but also has a story behind it but also leaving the 8% space for yes the fact that it is immature but that still doesn't outway the comedy put into this movie.
 
 The plot of the movie first starts off with Brennan Huff (Will Ferrell) and Dale Doback (John C. Reilly) as two men around the age of 40 with something very common. both very lazy and unemployed men who one who lives with his mom Brennan Huff (Will Ferrell) and the other with his dad Doback (John C. Reilly). Both with many excuses of why the aren't on there own living their lives. When at a work conference Brennan's mother and Dale's father meet and hit it off very quickly. they decide to get married and move in together. This makes the two boys very upset and turns their relationship into a war rivalry. But throughout this rivalry start to change and they soon realize that they are very similar and become best friends. But not realizing The way Their actions have impacted their newly wedded parents they soon drive them apart forcing them to get a divorce. With their parents getting the divorce they start to blame each other for the cause which drives them to gain this rivalry back again. As time goes on they both get a job and begin to live on their own to only meet once again at the Catalina wine mixer. At this moment we see that the two boys have grown and matured as men and their parents see that. So the ending of this movie is the start of how they get their life back to the way it was, step parents get back together and they get to act like young childish boys again. Although every film has negatives but this particular films positives outweigh the negatives by a long shot. A big factor that makes this film so good is the great comedian actor will Ferrell. We've seen him throughout many comedy movies including talladega nights, anchorman 1 and 2, elf, get hard, and plenty other comedy movies. What I believe makes will Ferrell such a good actor is the fact that he has one job and this is be blatantly hilarious and just weird and do roles that many actors can't fulfill. One of the best scenes in step brothers is right at the beginning when dale (John C. Reilly) and Brennan (will Ferrell) are sitting down at the first family dinner when Brennan starts to slurp is blue juice and dale doesn't appreciate him doing that in his dad's house so he makes a snobby remark to Brennan so of course he can't let that slide so he decides to say back to dale, ""haha I remember when I had my first beer"" (Brennan) but if you know dale he can't just let that slide so he says back, ""haha I remember when I fell off my dinosaur"" (dale). After dale said this to Brennan he must have been to much for him to handle so he started to become emotional and began to cry. We seem really stuck out to me on the comedy side because it's one of the first scenes in the movie and it really brings you into the comedy that you will be seeing in this film. Although this Film has nothing but positives reviews from me every film has negatives. What I can see That's a negative in this film is the immature that goes on, I mean the whole storyline is about 2 forty year old men who live with their parents at home. Another thing would be is this film is definitely not for children it's a film strictly for adults and kids under the age of fourteen should not watch this movie. In conclusion step brothers overdues funny it blows it out of the water and how funny it is. I'd consider this one of my top movies to watch with buddies or even by myself Director Adam McKay really out does himself on this one. But without will Ferrell and John Reilly would this film meets the standards it did? Who knows but overall this films in my books get s 92% rating.",Step Brothers

377,symphonyofdestruction,Seemingly Forgettable *a very slight chance of spoilers*,4,16 September 2008,"After viewing this film 5 or so hours ago, I left the cinema thinking this was an OK movie. As far as a ""leave your brain at the door"" kind of movie goes, it was actually pretty good. But after a few hours of letting the experience stew over in my mind, I find myself utterly unfulfilled. I say this, because the only moments in the film that I can recall are the entirely negative aspects. Awkwerdness is the word that springs to mind. The jokes seem laboured, for example, the drawn out fart joke. Even with the cameo of Seth Rogen lifting this moment up abit, its the kind of humour a 5 year old Nickelodeon viewer would enjoy. Fart jokes haven't worked since Blazing Saddles, and even there it was just a device used by Mel Brooks to see how much the censors would let him get away with. I think maybe its time to stop.Now to bring up what has to be the worst point in the film, and that has to be the relationship between Dale (John C. Reilly) and Alice (Kathryn Hahn). Everything about them felt so wrong. Just throwing out a ""vagina"" or a ""ball sack"" doesn't merit a laugh from me, and oh boy were the scenes awkward. I would liken them to watching the crassest of the crass Bill Hicks act with your Grandparents. Yep, really, and I was just in the cinema with a friend of mine.So all in all, I'd recommend for people to avoid this film. Unless you want to sit through a butt-load of average.
