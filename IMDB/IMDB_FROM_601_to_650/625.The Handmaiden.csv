0,Leofwine_draca,"Well-made, but I wanted something grittier",6,9 September 2017,"I admit to being a little disappointed when I found out that master film-maker Park Chan-wook's latest film would be THE HANDMAIDEN, a remake of a lesbian romantic drama filmed by the BBC as FINGERSMITH. This one relocates a tale of Victorian London to South Korea, where a murky plot involves mucho double-crossing as a con man decides to employ a maid to help him seduce a Japanese heiress due to inherit a fortune.Like the rest of Park Chan-wook's output, this is an expertly-made piece of drama, with sumptuous costumes and filmography, and fine performances from the cast. A pity, then, that it turns out to be merely a romantic drama with a few dark twists. The emphasis is on explicit sex throughout. Imagine if the director had instead put his talents to making another film like OLDBOY - now that would have been something special. This lengthy, languidly-paced film has some good storytelling methods and nice twists throughout, but otherwise it feels disappointingly shallow.",The Handmaiden
1,SnoopyStyle,a real art piece,7,22 July 2018,"In Japanese occupied Korea, Sook-hee is brought in as a maid to Count Fujiwara and as a handmaiden to Lady Hideko. Fujiwara is actually Korean. He intends to marry the Japanese heiress Hideko stealing her family fortune and turning himself into Japanese nobility. Sook-hee is an illiterate simpleton, illiterate both in Japanese and Korean. In reality, she comes from a 'family' of thieves hired by Fujiwara in a scheme to send Hideko into an asylum after marrying her.There is a shocking twist at the end of Part 1 which left me a little confused. One spends the rest of them movie trying to make sense of that turn of event. Honestly, I don't think it answers my questions fully to my satisfaction. I can't accept that it's the best escape plan for anybody. It's a scheme that can't be examined too deeply. It would be more definitive to fake her death. It leaves me feeling a little scammed especially since none of the characters can be believed at face value. They're all lying and I couldn't grab onto the truth. I'd rather they play it straight sending Hideko into the asylum and the Count double-crossing Sook-hee along with everybody else. She could return to rescue Hideko and fall in love. This one does feel a little constructed to shock. Honestly, my only reason to see this is that it's on the top 250 list. It's rare to have a pulpy twisty erotic thriller on the list. This one is beautiful and shot like an art piece. This is a real artistic endeavor from the nude erotica to the complex story construction. It is highly ambitious although I remain unconvinced by the twist.",The Handmaiden
2,claudio_carvalho,Classy South Korean Erotic Thriller Divided in Three Parts,8,1 January 2017,"In Korea, the pickpocket Sook-Hee (Tae-ri Kim) is hired by the Japanese heiress Lady Hideko (Min-hee Kim) to be her personal servant. Hideko is supported by her Uncle Kouzuki (Jin-woong Jo) and the gold-digger ""Count Fujiwara"" (Jung-woo Ha), who is indeed son of peasants, wants to marry her to steal her inheritance. Sook-Hee is a small-time thief of the ring of the conman ""Count Fujiwara"" and is sent to help him in the confidence game. But soon Hideko and Sook- Hee get close to each other and become lovers. But Sook-Hee is pressed by Fujiwara to betray her friend. When Fujiwara marries Hideko, they go with Sook-Hee to an asylum and the nurses hold Sook- Hee believing that she is Hideko. Why Hideko poses of servant and leaves Sook-Hee in the asylum to stay with Count Fujiwara?""Ah-ga-ssi"", a.k.a. ""The Handmaiden"", is a classy South Korean erotic thriller divided in three parts and directed by Chan-wook Park. The first part is slow paced and shows the development of the relationship among Sook-Hee, Lady Hideko and ""Count Fujiwara"". The second part shows the abusive relationship of Uncle Kouzuki and Hideko since her childhood. The third part has many twists and shows the fate of each leader character. The cinematography is very beautiful and the eroticism is elegant and stylish. The screenplay has surprising plot points. My vote is eight.Title (Brazl): ""A Criada"" (""The Maid"")",The Handmaiden
3,kosmasp,Handmaids tale,9,10 August 2020,"I watched the longer Directors Cut of the movie and it is something to behold. A very interesting story, that might have intrigued someone like M. Night Shyamalan too (I always have to think if I wrote that correctly - would be nice if imdb had a feature where it recognized names and helped one out). The story and its pace are fairly easy and slow to follow. There is nudity and adult situations (not sure if they are cut in the theatrical release), but that is not something that should be disturbing the viewer at all. If it does, maybe the movie is not something you should watch (or read up on if there is less nudity in the other cut).Having concenterated way too much on that aspect (it is what it is as someone recently said in a way worse context), the movie is well told and may reprise certain moments to give the viewer a fuller picture of what he experienced - which overall is a nice thing, but some may find redundant. Park Chan Wook is more than Old Boy, if you are still stuck on that (great movie no doubt), and he more than proves it here",The Handmaiden
4,classicsoncall,"""My job is to look after the Lady.""",7,30 March 2018,"Had this remained a revenge movie with a twist I would have appreciated it a lot better. But then it enters lesbian soft porn territory and the movie takes on an entirely different tone. I can just imagine what theater movie goers must have gone through when the love scenes between Lady Hideko (Min-hee Kim) and Sook-hee (Tae-ri Kim) took center stage. When you're not ready or prepared for it, the sex scenes can inadvertently turn a promising night out into a virtual catastrophe. The story could have been told without the explicit sex and perhaps might have been more enthralling if the affair between the Japanese heir and her Korean handmaiden been more nuanced and suggestive. I didn't particularly care for director Chan-wook Park's ""Oldboy"" either. He has a visually captivating style but his choice of subject matter ought to come with a viewer discretion warning.",The Handmaiden
5,lee_eisenberg,there are places that you can't truly understand,10,30 July 2017,"You may have heard Park Chan-wook's ""Ah-gah-si"" (""The Handmaiden"" in English) called an erotic psychological thriller. That's true, but the movie is more. It addresses relationships and abuse. Very well, I might add. I'm not sure how much of it I can describe without giving a lot away. I can just say that you have probably never seen anything like this. There's plenty of sex, but none of it gratuitous.The only other Park movie that I've seen is the bland ""Stoker"", so I'm impressed. I would definitely like to see the rest of his movies. Moreover, I would like to see more movies set in Korea under Japanese colonial rule (a part of history too often overlooked). Not a masterpiece, but one that I recommend.",The Handmaiden
6,jboothmillard,The Handmaiden,6,26 February 2018,"I was told about this South Korean film, that it was full a risqué material, and then it got some nominations during Awards Season, so I was looking forward to giving it a go, directed by Park Chan-wook (Oldboy, Stoker). Basically set in the 1930s, in Korea during the Japanese occupation, beautiful and fragile Japanese heiress Lady Hideko (Min-hee Kim), lives with her sadistic and despotic uncle Kouzuki (Jin-woong Jo). Uncle Kouzuki is an intellectual and an avid collector of rare erotic literature, he has raised Lady Hideko since the tender age of five, he plans to marry her for her riches. As a result, Lady Hideko has been confined in a large dreary and sun-deprived countryside estate, she is like a caged bird. She also seems to be an easy target for forger and outright con artist Count Fujiwara (Jung-woo Ha), who hires dexterous young pickpocket Sook-hee (Tae-ri Kim) to act as the new handmaiden, as part of the secret plot to defraud her. The Count needs Sook-hee to persuade the unaware noblewoman to marry him, and when the elaborate scam is successful, he will ruthlessly and without any remorse whatsoever, he will send her to an asylum. The con was proceeding according to plan, but Lady Hideko's unparalleled beauty with her long raven hair, luscious scarlet lips and velvety skin is no match for them. The scheme is doomed to fail when Lady Hideko and Sook-hee discover unexpected emotions and a romance develops, and in the end Count Fujiwara realises what's going on, he uses cigarettes laced with mercury to poison Kouzuki, the two women celebrate their freedom, making love. Also starring Hae-sook Kim as Miss Sasaki and So-ri Moon as Aunt of Lady Hideko. The leading actresses give good performances as the heiress and the young swindler who become believable lesbian lovers, and the actor playing the monstrous uncle is good, obviously having to read subtitles it was not easy to concentrate, but I got the general gist. The story was originally based on a book set in Victorian Britain, the new setting is put to good use, the costumes and scenery are marvellous to look at, the psychological thriller style and macabre stuff is interesting, and the love story and sexual scenes are beautifully done, all in all it is an intriguing and worthwhile erotic drama. It won the BAFTA for Best Film Not in the English Language. Good!",The Handmaiden
7,Quinoa1984,will need a 2nd viewing. I mean that as a compliment (mostly),8,20 November 2016,"The Handmaiden is a film that unfolds with a classic film stylist (in particular I felt like Chanwook Park was in a kind of Brian De Palma mode as far as making an erotic dramatic-thriller with a camera that luxuriates in long shots, elaborate camera movements, and cinematic grammar that emphasizes operatic intentions, though it's maybe not the first time he's done this anyway), and is LOADED with story. What appears to be the story of a handmaiden who is put in as part of a long con by a man who wants to steal this wealthy woman's money is actually a story about storytelling, about weaving a pack of lies and an entire personality and, in reality, how that can start to crack apart when it comes to seeing humanity in another person and their vulnerabilities.There's a lot going on in this movie, and there is a lot that is... sordid and over the top in its sexuality. That's intentional, I'm sure, and Park never coddles his audience with what he's showing as far as sexuality; the two main women of the film, the handmaiden and her master/mistress or what have you, end up having an emotional connection and this leads to a sexual one. This has the most graphic lesbian sexuality on screen since Blue is the Warmest Color, but here the rawness is matched by the elegance of Park's direction, and while you get to see much of it, only some of it (but there *is* some) that is gratuitous. Otherwise, this is a story of backstabbing and betrayal, but all of it leading up to being in the larger sense about how people fit in to the circumstances they are in, how they have to not simply play but BECOME the characters they're playing - and how these images flip based on perceptions and how we see the scenes.Here's where I may become less articulate in my criticism: the film is in three parts, and I forgot about there being 'parts' as I was so into the film during its first part. There is a major betrayal, but then the movie goes into a 'Part 2', and it turns into a different story... a VERY different kind of story, and it is one that left me confused at first, left adrift, and only Park's direction kept me afloat. As Part 2 went on I got into the movie more, though you have to be prepared for scenes from part 1 being repeated - and whether this becomes tedious will vary depending on the viewer. Nothing is ever not gorgeous to look at, and Park is inspired by paintings and art in the real world, and it's completely sumptuous (I'd be rooting for this to win all the costume/production design awards come February), but there comes a point where the filmmakers are showing the 'here's what happened this scene' moments a little too much. I won't reveal why this is done except to say that the characters take on other roles we didn't expect, and their decisions and how they hide parts of their personalities makes for fascinating viewing. Some times.And then it gets to part 3, and the movie goes into being sordid melodrama and not much more. By this time, the filmmakers have to wrap the story up, and show what this man who has been trying to machinate everything for his own ends is met with a nasty fate. Overall there's so much about The Handmaiden to admire, from the performances by Min-hee Kim as Lady Hideko (appearing in part 1 as varieties of cold and distant and then close and warm and terrified in the other parts), Tae-ri Kim (Sookie, who has much to learn about the art of performance, I mean her character not the actress, she's great), and Jung-woo Ha as the 'Count' who has to remain in control for the whole runtime, but gives in to his passions too. And yet I also wonder if a first viewing trying to explain everything how I felt doesn't do the film justice: it moves slower and more languidly than other Park films, so it took longer to get in to, and the themes of conning and performance may be done stronger in any given Quentin Tarantino film (though here done with more taste and intense sexuality - i.e. the scene with the thimball on the tooth).Another viewing may give more, or less. I can tell you now it's worth seeing if you love pure CINEMA, the likes of which get made by directors with a passion for the form and expressing stories of early 20th century sexual excess and emotional f***ed-up ness (it is early 20th century Korea with a major Japanese influence - in that way it'd make a solid double feature with Kim Jee-Woon's Age of Shadows). As for whether it's a great film, I'm not so sure.",The Handmaiden
8,Theo Robertson,Complex But Not Entirely Confident,7,9 June 2017,"In one of my intermittent conversations with IMDb legend Bob The Moo he recommended a 2016 South Korean film THE HANDMAIDEN. Having total faith in Bob I did make a mental note of getting round to seeing it when I had some spare time. As with any recommendation I also made a mental note of not looking up the recommendation for obvious reasons. After all I did look up a couple of early online reviews of THE MUMMY earlier today and let's just say they let the cat out of the bag. It's hardly a surprise when a film is ruined because surprise is given away. The only thing I knew in advance before seeing THE HANDMAIDEN was that the director was Park Chan-wook who made the overrated OLDBOY which reminded of something else - Bob also once recommended me THE FOUNTAIN , a film I thought was pretentious rubbish Park is something of an auteur. Revenge is a theme that intrigues him as a film maker but not in the way Hollywood would develop a revenge thriller where Bruce , Arnie , Sly or Chuck would wreak revenge on creeps via an arsenal of firearms and explosives and I'm not entirely sure if that's a compliment. By the same token it's not necessarily a complaint either but I did feel the narrative execution could have been developed better. There might be a problem in that the original source novel was set in Victorian Britain rather than 1930s Korea but I don't think it's that. What I found annoying was the constant need for characters explaining what is happening which is usually obvious and why it's happening when it's not obvious at the time but becomes obvious later on. It's certainly a complex film where objects that seem meaningless make reappearances as plot turns. Also as with OLDBOY there's a somewhat sleazy story which the audience will find divisive One thing that will never , ever shake my faith in Bob The Moo is that he knows a great looking film when he sees one. I might have hated the fractured storyline of THE FOUNTAIN but at least Aronofsky understands what cinematography is, even if he takes it to excess. With THE HANDMAIDEN director Park and cinematographer Chung Chung-hoon have made a stunning looking film which while I was sitting in front of a laptop in a smoky Edinburgh flat made me think I was either walking around rural Japan or stuck in a Japanese mansion with a bunch of deviants, Another good aspect is the editing which gives the film a pace that can't be faulted especially compared to the average Hollywood movie. There is one technical aspect I found irritating and that was the intrusive music but again this is very subjective It's certainly the visuals that impressed me with this movie , the story less so. Or should I say how the story is executed. As I said the story itself is rather complex but the constant need to spell things out shows a painful lack of confidence",The Handmaiden
9,grantss,Intriguing drama,7,15 July 2017,"Korea, 1930s. Sook-Hee, a young Korean woman, goes to work as a handmaiden for Lady Hideko, a young Japanese woman who the heiress to a fortune. Sook-Hee's motives are rather nefarious - she, in league with the charming but unscrupulous Count Fujiwara, a con man, intend to defraud Lady Hideko of her fortune. However, Sook-Hee soon develops a fondness for Lady Hideko and this could potentially jeopardise the plan.Intriguing drama, directed by Chan-wook Park of Oldboy, Lady Vengeance and Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance fame. First half is brilliant, with good scene-setting, plot development and an amazing twist.If the focus and momentum of the first half were kept up we were heading for masterpiece territory. However, the second half is less compelling and plausible, with a few plot developments that don't make sense and some twists that seem there for twists sake. Momentum is lost as we have a new round of backstory, and this seems overwrought and overly long, and much of it seems unnecessary. There are one or two surprises towards the end but the resolution of the main plot is pretty predictable from a point.Ultimately, an interesting and reasonably absorbing story but could have been brilliant.",The Handmaiden
10,evanston_dad,"An Excellent, Liberating Film",10,31 May 2017,"""The Handmaiden"" is a fiercely original bit of erotica that changes the setting of the novel on which it is based from England to 1930s Korea. In an example of narrative sleight of hand that would make Quentin Tarantino proud, director Chan-wook Park tells his story in three parts, each one upending the perspective of the one before and forcing his audience to re-process everything it has just seen.The first part tells the story of a young pickpocket, Sook-Hee, who is roped into a scheme concocted by a sleazy thief posing as a rich count to rob a rich heiress, lady Hideko, of her fortune. The second part tells things from the heiress's point of view, and we find out that she and the ""count"" are actually in cahoots and it's Sook-Hee who's the dupe. Then the third part details the efforts of the two women, who have fallen in love, to double cross everyone and escape to make a life together. ""The Handmaiden"" is largely about what happens when women tire of playing the role assigned to them by men and decide to write their own narrative. Storytelling is a running theme in the film, but the stories being told are all about women being sexually used by men at best but almost always suffering in some way, either physically or emotionally, at their hands. When Sook-Hee and Lady Hideko decide they don't like the parts written for them and take matters into their own hands, it's like watching a weary character in a book jump out of the pages and run away from the reader. The women are liberated, and the viewer likewise feels liberated watching them, enjoying the rare film where women are about more than what men do to them.Grade: A+",The Handmaiden
11,christopher-underwood,top notch film making,9,9 August 2017,"Another very impressive film from Chan-wook Park who manages to draw his audience in from the very start. The opening scenes seem very quick and it appears it may be too difficult to keep up for the fairly long running time but it turns out to be a breeze. The pace slows and we are rewarded for our early concentration as so much makes so much sense so soon. Not always so with Asian movies, for western audiences, it seems to me. Park has such a wonderful sense of framing and is not afraid to move his cameras in unconventional ways. The sumptuous interiors and exteriors may have the appearance of the equivalent of an English historic romance but here the cameras offer us views and movement more akin to a full on action movie. Split into three parts, I found myself slightly bewildered at the start of the second section but soon caught up with the audaciousness of Mr Park and his co-writer. Beautiful, explicit, daring and rewarding, this is top notch film making.",The Handmaiden
12,siderite,"Very Asian, very erotic, very interesting, British?!",9,18 March 2018,"The movie starts with a young Korean girl leaving her family to go to be a servant in a Japanese household. The visuals, the language, the mood, they are all so Asian. The eroticism is so pronounced even from the start, so different from the sanitized Anglo-Saxon media, too. So I was quite amazed to hear that this is an adaptation of a British Novel called Fingersmith. The adaptation is great, though. I can't say much about the story without spoiling it, but it is split into three parts, each from a different viewpoint, showing you that things are far from straightforward. It's basically a thriller noir, only set in 1930's Japanese occupied Korea. I liked the acting, the sets, the story, but what put them all into perspective was the way it was all presented. The non linear way of storytelling really made this a fresh and interesting film. Bottom line: a very beautiful Asian adaptation of a British novel that should be easily accessible to both Eastern and Western audiences.",The Handmaiden
13,JamesHitchcock,An intriguing and visually and intellectually literate film,8,5 June 2017,"South Korean films are not exactly flavour of the month in Britain, even among ""world cinema"" buffs; the most one can say is that they are at least more popular than North Korean films. ""The Handmaiden"", however, has recently had a long run in central London. Perhaps its popularity can be put down to the fact that it is based upon a novel by a Welsh author, ""Fingersmith"" by Sarah Waters, albeit with the setting changed to Korea under the Japanese occupation. Or perhaps to the fact that it features two beautiful young actresses in bed together.The plot is a complex one, too complex to set out here. It revolves around the plans of a conman posing as a Count to marry and elope with Lady Hideko, a Japanese heiress living in Korea with her authoritarian uncle. To further his scheme he hires a Korean girl named Sook-hee to obtain a position as a maid in the uncle's household. The film is divided into three parts, and Parts 1 and 2 essentially tell the story from two different viewpoints, giving us different perspectives on these events. At the end of Part 1, which is largely told from Sook-hee's viewpoint, it appears that Hideko and the supposed ""Count Fujiwara"" have conspired together and played a cruel trick on Sook-hee to enable them to elope together. In Part 2, which is largely told from Hideko's point of view, we realise that appearances can be deceptive and that it may in fact be Sook-hee and Hideko (who have become lesbian lovers) who are in league together.The film is not only based upon a British novel; director Park Chan-wook may also have been influenced by the visual style of the British ""heritage cinema"". It is notable that Hideko's uncle lives in an Edwardian-looking European-style mansion built for him by an English architect. The photography certainly has that rich, sumptuous look we have come to associate with British historical dramas, and, like some Western directors such as James Ivory and Martin Scorsese, Park is able to use this style of film-making to shed light on some weighty themes.The most important theme explored in this film is that of the mistreatment of women by men. (There is an implication, although perhaps no more than that, that Hodeko and Sook-hee have become lesbians because of the way men have treated them and that under other circumstances they might have been heterosexual). Hideko's uncle Kouzuki is a sex-obsessed bully, whose greatest passion is for his collection of antique erotica. Kouzuki is a widower, his wife having died in what was supposedly a suicide, and it is strongly implied either that she was driven to kill herself by her husband's mistreatment of her or that he in fact murdered her when she tried to leave him. During her lifetime Kouzuki distressed her by forcing her to read from his pornographic books to his guests, and after her death he subjected Hideko to the same treatment. Fujiwara may claim to love Hideko and poses as her liberator from her uncle's tyranny, but in fact he is just interested in her money. As for the working-class Korean Sook-hee, Fujiwara regards her as being both socially and racially inferior so has no compunction about the way he treats her.The film occasionally slips into Grand Guignol; the final scene involving Kouzuki and Fujiwara is particularly lurid and does not make a great deal of sense. Overall, however, this is an intriguing, visually and intellectually literate, film from a culture that does not feature very highly on the average British film buff's radar. 8/10",The Handmaiden
14,blanbrn,"A suspense thrill of twist and turns that questions trust, it's a double cross fueled by hot erotic passion and unexpected emotions.",8,7 March 2017,"I for one from time to time check out the Asian cinema mostly the Korean and Japanese works, however this was my first go around with director Park Chan-Wook. And I must say that with this work ""The Handmaiden"" it's an in depth work a drama that's split into chapters, and it's a film that takes twists and turns that you don't see coming. It proves that with lust, and hot unexpected erotic passion that leads to emotions that new life and love is possible for two ladies.Set in 1930's Korea a young woman Sook-Hee(Tae-Ri Kim)is hired to be a new handmaiden for Lady Hideko(Min-Hee Kim)who's a Japanese heiress who's lives on an estate by the country and the palace is a castle spread like with many books to read and much to learn like the arts which involve hand painting. However it's a secret plot that Sook-Hee has with a con man known as the count and that is to defraud Hideko of her large inheritance.Thru it all the film has visions of doubt, trust, and the elements of love and hot erotic passion is taken into new heights as the emotions brought out with Lady Hideko and Sook-Hee twist this plot and little cat and mouse game for a spin and turn that you and even the count didn't see coming.

15,lasttimeisaw,a none-too-novel plotting and scheming pulp sustained with an absolutely captivating momentum,8,30 April 2017,"Park Chan-wook's succulent period drama is a three-act intrigue set in a Japanese-occupied Korea, a close-knit cast includes a Japanese heiress Lady Hideko (Kim Min-hee), her newly hired handmaiden Sook-hee (Kim Tae-ri, in her blazing film debut), the professed Count Fujiwara (Ha Jung-woo), a Korean con artist who is wooing Hideko but schemes to wrest for the marriage's collateral financial gain, and Hideko's current guardian, her uncle Kouzuki (Jo Jin-woong), a Korean book collector who is spoiling for a Japanese identity, and has no qualm of marrying his niece as long as he could keep a tight rein on the latter's magnanimous inheritance. The narrative is succinctly coordinated among the central quartet and starts from Act I, we peer into the game plan from the angle of Sook-hee, she is not a dewy-eyed lamb as the first impression suggests, but an orphan pickpocket equipped with street smart and a yen for wealth (her con artist mother died during parturition), colluded with Fujiwara, she is arranged near Lady Hideko to sweet-talk her into the marriage, which Fujiwara plans to throw her into an asylum once it is consummated, so he can hog Hideko's assets, among which Sook-hee also demands a handsome paycheck. Things get complicated when Sook-hee is swooned by a doll-like Lady Hideko, whose delicacy and naivety, the aftermath of a reclusive lifestyle imposed by Kouzuki, is something she never expects to encounter and once her sexual awakening stands in the way of Fujiwara's plan, there is no telling who will come off as the winner. Act I ends with a bang in your face, a twist segues into Act II, now we get the perspective from Lady Hideko. Sheepish is not an apposite word to describe Hideko, she can be calculating and menacing (no one can indeed see the whole picture, that's the lure of its narrative game: offer us a chance to leafing through those often imperceptible), flashback of her childhood, with her now defunct aunt (Moon So-ri in a transfixing cameo as the fruitcake) emblazons the perversity of Kouzuki and his reading club, where her aunt (later herself) are trained to narrate (sometimes even perform, with a wooden puppet for instance) erotic and often kinky stories from the antique books in front of an all-male audience, those who are solvent enough to participate in the auction of these said salacious urtexts, that's where Fujiwara first lays his eyes on Lady Hideko. Another grand revelation finally sets straight its multi-buried subterfuge, in the Act III, where Park Chan-wook's unloosed endorsement of womanhood reaches its exuberant zenith, women are fêted by the abandon of sexual liberalization (under a vibrant pace) whereas men are doomed in their Freudian subservience (heightened by an overt self-referential appearance of a giant octopus, Park's trademark metaphor of pervert and ruination). Leading lady Kim Min-hee impeccably holds court here, conveying a tangy impression of Goddess finesse mingled with unpredictability, mystique, and empathy, her ageless countenance adorned by the gorgeous period costume and make-up, cogently embodies the most alluring quality of oriental feminism, paired with a ludic but emboldened Kim Tae-ri, their resultant eye-popping soft-core sex sequences dare to give BLUE IS THE WARMEST COLOR (2013) a run for its money. Ha Jung-woo, the superstar of South Korean cinema, dutifully deploys a broader touch to transmit a tinge of caricature and incredulity in a supporting job that elicits our sympathy even when on paper, his character shouldn't.Inveterately operatic, ravishingly sumptuous, THE HANDMAIDEN tops off a none-too-novel plotting and scheming pulp with an absolutely captivating momentum which leaves its rapt audience feel triumphant and thoroughly justified, all by dint of Park's upmarket artistry, aesthetic sensibility and gallant vision.",The Handmaiden
16,KineticSeoul,Park Chan-wook has really mastered his craft when it comes to shooting his films,7,30 September 2016,"What got me hyped to watch this movie was because it was directed by Park Chan-wook. He is basically the Quentin Tarantino of Korea, where he creates artistic movies that the mainstream audiences can enjoy. I personally thought it was lacking when it came to substance compared to his previous films. I thought that it would delve more into humanity and psychological elements. It does have those elements in this but it didn't intrigue me like it did compared to his previous work. I will say it's different from his previous work. This time around it tries to go in that old fashion film-making style. Now Park Chan-wook's signature brutality, gruesome violence but a bit of black humor is still intact. What drives this movie isn't the subconscious of the human mind and humanity. But it really does uses the cinematography to drive the story forward. The imagery is vivid, vibrant and very detailed. When it comes to Korean cinematography this film is topnotch in that department. It's one of the main factors that kept me focused throughout the whole thing. Park Chan-wook really did master his craft when it comes to shooting his films. Also this is one of the few films I have seen where the sexual innuendos actually moves the story forward. Instead of it just being used to arouse the audiences.7.9/10",The Handmaiden
17,Hellmant,A great female empowerment love story!,9,8 February 2017,"'THE HANDMAIDEN': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Another South Korean critically acclaimed erotic thriller, from filmmaker Park Chan-wook (who's also helmed such beloved South Korean hits as 'OLD BOY' and 'THIRST'). Chan-wook directed and co- wrote the movie, with Jeong Seo-kyeong (a frequent writing collaborator of his). The script is loosely based on the novel 'Fingersmith', by Sarah Waters, with the Victorian era setting changed to Japanese-occupied Korea. It tells the story of a conman that hires a pickpocket, to pose as a handmaiden for a depressed Japanese heiress, in order to rob her (through an elaborate plot). The movie stars Kim Min-hee, Kim Tae-ri and Ha Jung-woo. It's received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics, and it's also won, or been nominated for, several prestigious awards. I enjoyed it.The story is set in Korea, at the time it was under Japanese colonial rule. A conman, going by the name of Count Fujiwara (Jung- woo), hires a pickpocket, named Sook-hee (Tae-ri), to pose as a handmaiden for a severely depressed Japanese heiress, named Lady Hideko (Min-hee). Fujiwara plots to marry Hideko, and then have her committed to an insane asylum; in order to steal her fortune. He enlists Sook-hee to help him. Sook-hee agrees to the plan, but then she develops feelings for the heiress. Things only become more complicated from there!The film is a great female empowerment love story, it's also (once again) beautifully shot, and masterfully edited, by Chan-wook (I love his visual style). The screenplay is also brilliant; and although it starts out slow, it becomes really involving. It's also full of really passionate, and quite erotic, sex scenes. If that's your thing, it's full of them; but it is all part of the story (and rich character development). It's also one of the highest rated movies of 2016, by many critics, and I can see why.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/_SLO5GYrmps",The Handmaiden
18,thesar-2,What Tangled Webs We Weave,8,21 January 2018,"Three times a charm as that's how many times it took me to finish this film.It was my bad that I had to start/stop this film over four or so days. Initially, I thought this was supposed to be a horror movie and while it has horrific moments, it's certainly not horror. It's more suspense, mystery, lesbian drama.In fact, I haven't seen this much graphic lesbian sex in my life. I'm no prude, but girl-on-girl action isn't my forte, so it's not on my top ten porn searches. But, if you're into that, you might be pleased when it shows up several times in the film.The movie revolves around a rich heiress who's woo'd by a scheming Count and his Maid-to-Be to get her fortune. She's somehow set to marry her uncle, but the Count's got other plans for her cash. Only, his decoy, the film's title, has other plans.While I had to start/stop this several times, it's highly recommended as it's beautifully shot, wonderfully acted, scored excellently and the twists just keep on coming that makes the whole experience worth it. Yes, it's overlong and could've been severely cut, but it pays off and in the most satisfying way. Definitely check out this Handmaiden. ***Final thoughts: Helps I have a thing for Asians and this serves both my Japanese and Korean love. Granted only one real male is predominate, he is quite the catch throughout. Luckily, I can concentrate on him while they make me watch so many naked females make love.",The Handmaiden

Sticking with the theatrical cutBeastly movie, superb directing. Aesthetically beautiful. Great story, but told in away to make it a phenomenal story.

20,paul2001sw-1,Lavish but strangely juvenile,6,19 October 2019,"Sarah Walters's novel 'Fingersmith', a tale of power, perversion, pornography and passion in Victorian England, gets a lavish Korean makeover in Park Choon-Wok's movie 'The Handmaiden'. It's certainly visually and thematically rich and provocative as it slides between frequently explicit romance, comedy and horror: if in part it aims to shock, it certainly does so in style. However, I struggled to like any of the characters, all of whom seem as selfish and ruthless as each other, and felt no especial sympathy for the female leads simply because they happen to fall in love/list for each other. The film should perhaps be seen as a paean to desire, in all its oddness and intensity. But for all the artistry, I never quite escaped the feeling of a tale told by schoolchildren, snickering behind the bikesheds.",The Handmaiden
21,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Knocks it out of the (Chan-wook) Park.,8,31 August 2020,"A loose adaptation of 'Fingersmith' by Sarah Waters, Park Chan-wook's 'The Handmaiden (2016)' is a layered and subversive thriller that very much feels like a novel brought to life. It's a film that knows exactly how to handle its audience, revealing only what it needs to for the current status-quo to be compelling. Its twists and turns come at the exact right moments, leading to a satisfyingly unpredictable experience that only gets deeper with each new revelation. The subject matter is darker than you might initially imagine; it deals with themes of domestic imprisonment, abuse, grooming and pre-video-tape pornography. It's also, even at its core, a romance. The relationship that blossoms between the eponymous handmaiden and her originally eponymous lady (the Korean release is named after the latter) is what fuels the narrative. Much has been made of their graphic yet restrained (though still very 'movie') sex scenes, but it's their budding sensuality and genuine connection that makes the pair believable. They're good, somewhat understated characters that keep you invested in the picture. This adds a layer of emotional resonance to the otherwise plot-heavy affair. The flick just grips you and doesn't let go. It has a palpable texture to it and it takes you on an unexpected journey. It's one of Park's best efforts. 8/10",The Handmaiden
22,dromasca,"beautiful, bold, captivating",9,26 June 2020,"I have noticed on other occasions that many of the Korean films refuse easy categorizations. This is also the case of 'The Handmaiden', the film made in 2016 by Chan-wook Park. It is a mature film, a film that starts from an English horror-Gothic style novel, moves the action in Korea occupied by Japan in the 30s of the last century, and develops into a synthesis of psychological and erotic thrillers with family saga and social cinema with a strong feminist touch. The personal imprint is very visible, the director that 'Oldboy' made famous in the world manages once again to tell fluently and with a unique visual perfection a Tarantino style story that takes place in a Japanese Hitchcock setting. I think there will be viewers who are bothered by one or the other of the details and scenes in the film, but I don't think many can escape the magnetic charm of the story put on screen by this Korean master. Yes, master. I think that with this film, Chan-wook Park earned - at least for me - the title of master of the art of film.The film has four characters moving in a world that feels like a kind of historical pulp fiction, probably a retrospective satire of the Japanization of the Korean high and ascending classes that happened during the colonial period in the early 20th century. They all imitate Japanese behaviour, take Japanese names, aspire to become or at least look Japanese, which was probably the sign and appearance of the social rise of the period. Kouzuki (Jin-woong Cho), a rich old man, owner of a villa whose architecture mixes Victorian and Japanese styles and collector of an impressive library of precious books and lithographs, raises (severely, not to say cruelly) and educates Hideko (Min-hee Kim) the daughter of his late wife's sister who committed suicide years ago. Does he intent to marry her or does he just use her as a refined object of pleasure for the erotic readings served to his male friends? Hideko has a beautiful dowry, which he tries to get his hands on, same as do the young artist who introduces himself as Count Fujiwara (Jung-woo Ha) and the maid Sook-Hee (Tae-ri Kim), in fact a clever pickpocket who becomes the pivot of a chain of intrigues worthy of a saga of a fallen family, with many hundreds of pages devoured by readers. The plans will change several times, same as the viewer's perspective throughout the film, which is divided into three approximately equal in time parts, in which the story is told and repeated from different points of view.The narrative technique of alternative perspectives has already been used in the world cinema, including that of the Far East, by master Kurosawa for example. Here it seems to me that a new dimension is being added, because the two storytellers are the young Sook-Hee and Hideko whose connection is constantly evolving and oscillating between a master-maid relationship, solidarity facilitated by the shared destinies of traumatic childhoods marked by the deaths of the mothers, complicity , enmity, rivalry and love. It's one of the most beautiful stories of its kind I've seen on screens lately, and Chan-wook Park demonstrates his mastery of psychological characterization, as well as his ability to transform shocking details of violence and sex into functional elements of action. All four acting performances are perfect. Visually, the film is a delight, at no time is the camera neutral, the most interesting and unusual angles serve the story and each frame is studied and staged with the aesthetic refinement of the Japanese prints. Viewers who a priori reject movies that are too violent or which contain too explicit scenes will probably avoid this film anyway. For those who will see it, however, it will be difficult, I think, not to fall under the spell.",The Handmaiden
23,gbill-74877,Great film,9,26 January 2020,"Such a beautiful film, with lush visuals and a magnetic cast. Kim Tae-ri and Kim Min-hee are fantastic. The story told over three parts is great too, with intrigue, romance, and clever plot twists. Early on we see a wealthy man living in an opulent mansion who is corrupt in that he forges books to sell and wants to marry his niece for her inheritance, and a couple of grifters who want to swindle him in a cruel way that will leave the niece in a madhouse. There is some real darkness here, and this is just the start of it. The film is 145 minutes long but the production value is so high that the time seemed to fly by. It was almost ruined by director Park Chan-wook not exercising the slightest bit of restraint during the sex scenes; it goes from sweet seduction and lesbian empowerment to exploitative soft-core porn as he holds the camera/male gaze on the young actors for far longer than was necessary on more than one occasion. To me it was far steamier in the scenes of glances and small touches, though I know I sound hopelessly old-fashioned saying that. Still though, this was a damn good film.",The Handmaiden

This is a multi-layered story which involves - love, sex, cons, mystery and a little bit of violence. Before seeing this movie i kinda thought it would be slow paces story which will probably involve all above mentioned things, but boy oh boy surely i wasn't prepared for how this movie is great. If anything else, this movie isn't slow paced - at running time 2 h 15 min. it is a brilliantly crafted highly involving story. Directing, writing, cinematography were first rate as well as acting and set design. The story itself was very intriguing, but its the brilliant movie craftsmanship that made ""The Handmaiden"" into one of the best movies I've seen whole year (2016).Overall, ""The Handmaiden"" is definitely a movie that should be seen by everyone who enjoys great films (but not for the youngest ones as it shows some explicit sex scenes). It is a very beautifully filmed story, not predictable or boring for a second (!) and a highly involving one. Brilliant picture.",The Handmaiden
25,Reno-Rangan,"In the circle of romance, deceive and defraud.",8,4 August 2017,"Those who are into the world cinema, particularly the Korean, knows Park Chan-wook very well. But if you don't, then you must. His films are definitely for the grown ups. Like everybody else, my admiration for his work has started a decade ago with the film 'Oldboy'. He had tried his luck in Hollywood with 'Stoker'. Despite a good entertainer, it was criticised. I love Park Chan-wook doing hundred masterpieces like this in Korea than trying to do one in Hollywood. His ability to turn the good book into a great flick was phenomenal. Here it goes another one. This was based on the British novel 'Fingersmith' by Sarah Waters. The story of an orphan woman who assigned to be a maid for a young rich woman who is living under the shadow of her uncle since she has no parents.Yeah, I was expecting it, but I did not think it would be another masterpiece from the director. I even thought the ratings could be exaggerated, and the reviews from his die hard fans like Nolan's or QT's fans does. The timeline of the story was prior to Second World War Korea under the Japan rule. A perfect setting for such theme. The film opened like it is an average film. That's where all I got wrong. Or probably I judged it too soon. The storytelling was split into three parts and the first part was a bit mix of fun and like any film, introduction, the platform for the rest of the narration filled with surprises.The young orphan Sook-hee was recruited by a thief who is planning to trick a young woman named Lady Hideko with all the wealth left behind by her parents. The only obstacle for him is her uncle, a guardian. So Sook-hee becomes close to her. More than she had expected, but their plan is working. Now they have to wait for the perfect moment for a perfect strike. When it arrives, an unexpected twist takes the tale to go back to where the film originally had started. But even further earlier and this time, the perspective of the story was from the Lady Hdeko.❝So even if my love for you leads me to ruin, don't pity me.❞So, with that flashback, the second part begins. But literally it was a series of twist, that keep explaining us in another angle of the whole scenario I had witnessed in the previous part. Believe me, I have never seen such a long twist before. I was like unmoved for that entire segment. One of the best things I have ever in a film. The praise must go to the author, but the director and his actors as well did a fine job. There's a twist in every scene. So, for that one must pay close attention to the first part, despite slow moving story.But above all, what I'm surprised was I did not know it was a lesbian film. Moreover, I did not think it could have bold scenes for such theme. Everything seemed perfect. I mean the erotic parts are sensual, but very artistic than unnecessary disturbance. Mainly because of stronger hold of the story narration than anything else. Even the pace picks up, like a crazy speed. Everything about the film you would learn in this section. All the secrets of the past revealed and what might comes are still kept under mysterious for the third and final part.The most awaited, the conclusion part begins forth. For everything we saw so far, what might come after makes this film at its best. Just like the mid part, this is also full of twists. Because it will going to tell who ends where and what they get. Over two hours long film, and every frame are worth. The casting was best and so the setting of the 1930s Korea. Especially I must applaud the filmmaker's effort to turn the original setting from Europe to East Asia. It was great, but still now and then you can see the influence of the original source. I mean western culture, names, architect references which might have come from the book.Not just the lesbian or a love triangle story, but something like a circle of love with deceive and defraud. You can notice that in the film poster with four main characters. So when it has a multiple strings attached, you could expect surprises/twists from each angle and it gives that more the convincingly. Put this into your must see list. This is not the first screen adaptation, but surely the best so far. Now we can expect a European or a Hollywood project in a big scale soon. Believe me the Oscars would pour in, because it's that kind of story. Highly recommended!8/10",The Handmaiden
26,briancham1994,Suspenseful perfection,9,24 July 2021,"With this film, Park reaches the same impossibly high standard that he set with his earlier film Oldboy. The visual composition of The Handmaiden is relentlessly perfectionist, framing the characters within a beautiful yet complex Victorian labyrinth with hidden depths. The actors do a great job of portraying nuanced characters who are themselves hiding who they really are. The plot is full of twists and turns, showing that every event has more going on than what we really knew. The depravity of the scenarios, darkly reminiscent of Oldboy, imbued the characters with emotional pressure but also felt sensationalist at times.",The Handmaiden
27,Red-125,"Beautiful to watch, but very complex and confusing",7,15 December 2016,"The Japanese/Korean film Ah-ga-ssi was shown in the U.S. with the title The Handmaiden (2016). It was directed by Park Chan-wook.This movie has been described as an erotic thriller. This is accurate, but it doesn't convey the richness and complexity of the plot. The actor Min-hee Kim plays Lady Hideko, and Tae-ri Kim portrays Sook-Hee, her new servant (handmaiden). We learn at the beginning of the film that Sook-Hee is a petty thief. She has been hired by the deceitful Count Fujiwara (Jung-woo Ha), himself a fraud, to betray Lady Hideko and encourage her to marry the count. The film has many positive aspects--the two women actors are beautiful, the 1930's costumes are glorious, the settings and cinematography are superb. I had trouble with the plot, however. The movie is divided into three parts. Apparently, parts one and two convey the same story, but from different perspectives. Part three brings the plot to its conclusion. (I didn't understand this when I saw the movie--I learned it from reading what was written by other reviewers.)The movie would be rated R in the U.S. Lots of sexuality and flesh, but nothing that would earn it an X. Some reviewers found the sexual scenes gratuitous, but I thought that they were important, and well integrated into the film.As I write this review, The Handmaiden has an incredible 8.1 IMDb rating. I believe that the film is worth seeing, but I don't think it's quite at that level. We saw the movie at Rochester's wonderful Little Theatre. On one weekend in mid-December 2016, there were three films with IMDb ratings over 8 showing on The Little's five screens! If you live in Upstate New York, The Little is worth a special trip. For example, we saw The Handmaiden and Manchester by the Sea as a matinée double feature. It's an hour drive for us, but I would drive two hours if necessary to see such excellent movies at the same theater. Think about it.",The Handmaiden
28,TheMovieDiorama,"The Handmaiden is sumptuous, provocative and, I can say with confidence, a masterpiece.",10,27 February 2018,"I try not to use that word, it's rather overused for films that just aren't masterpieces. But when a film is so gorgeous that it imitates art, so multi-dimensional that it transcends the majority of narratives and so daring that it tests the limitations of film itself...I can't help but call it a masterpiece. A rich Japanese lady recruits a handmaiden who soon turns out to be a swindler, tasked with falsifying a wedding in order to steal her money. Twists and turns soon reveal many secrets that question the legitimacy of the new handmaiden's undercover task. Immediately I was hypnotised. Park Chan-Wook has such an eye for detail, every frame is lovingly crafted and resembles a jewel on a glistening necklace. Cinematography rarely looks this gorgeous, honestly. The visceral imagery conveys multiple themes of lust, greed, jealousy...in fact, nearly all the seven deadly sins are thematically interwoven in this complex narrative. Chan-Wook played me like a puppet. Manipulating my mind with every unexpected twist. It's a story of how powerful love is. An emotion so overwhelming that people are moulded by its presence. The lead characters all experience this, whether it be falsifying love or truly experiencing it for the first time. How motivations for money and power can be blurred by love. It's just a work of art. It truly is. Deceive me once? I applaud you. Deceive me twice? I'm jumping up and down the room like a lunatic. Tiny intricacies that are soon explained within the narrative's three parts, these revelations blew my mind. With an everlasting haunting undertone, it just made the story all the more resonating. Even the musical score was stunning, replicating orchestral symphonies with traditional Asian instruments. I will say it's an 18 for a reason, the sexual nature is extremely explicit yet it doesn't detract from the seamless story. Asian cinema has yet again proven that it's better than Hollywood.

The Handmaiden certainly has one of the best Twist for any thriller in the last decade but the film is hurt because the climax is revealed much before it opens the 2nd and 3rd subplots of the narrative. The primary plot is, A woman is hired as a handmaiden to a Japanese heiress, but secretly she is involved in a plot to defraud her. When the 2nd plot running along with it is opened we audience are totally shocked but then there is third plot which is even weaker than any ordinary single plot thriller to spoil the momentum. There are plenty of small small loopholes in the Twists but formally endurable because you are going to witness something amazing after that but then you meet one weak side of this narrative which doesn't do anything thrilling but just eat time and make it Overlong. Just imagine, if the third story in the film had pre-planned twist, The Handmaiden would have probably ended as the 'Best Erotic Thriller Ever made'. For now the opportunity is lost but anyways it still has 2 Great Twisty tales corners and 1 weak side in this triangular Thriller. People might not like the sexual explicit scenario but somehow it was used correctly according to the need of the script and thankfully it wasn't added deliberately just to please perverts. The Handmaiden is technically very powerful because the use of camera and background score makes this one look quite furtive. All the actors have done no compromises while being wild physically and verbally which is impressive. Director Chan-wook Park did a great job while crafting it but only if could have made it more pacy as pace is one of the most needed element in thriller genre. Overall it's a Great Erotic triangle of thrill in which two sides are strong and one is weak. Surely Watchable but not a Must see material.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",The Handmaiden

Some of it's chosen exterior locations are so captivating and mesmerizing, you almost feel you're there, or wish you were. The actresses are beautiful and perform nothing short of excellent, the young girl (The Handmaiden) especially, such a professionally acted job. You'd expect more so sex scenes, that kind of left me a little downtrodden. The major lesbian one, amidst only a couple of others, in this near two and half hour piece, is one of the hottest and most explicit, I've ever seen, this one again, beautifully shot. The story involves a young girl, a new handmaiden, forced to defraud the wife of the husband, only the young girl falls for the wife, where the story kind of manipulates you, as to where the girl's intentions will lead, where revenge is thrown in too, as we go back in time to an earlier period, involving our young girl, and the wife, where we find ourselves returning to some old scenes, but with added stuff- purpose here. This is one you'd have to watch a couple of times to get the complete picture. Didn't understand the change in color of the subtitles, my only qualm. Acting by all is top notch, and our handmaiden is definitely something to ogle at. A handmaiden who's beautifully made. We too have some violence, and some humorous moments. Hopefully this film will command more attention from moviegoers in Adelaide, as here's one faultless cinematic experience, you should experience, and by no accounts, miss, as it will be your loss.

It's not long before we understand that in fact Sook-hee is there by design, as part of a plot involving a (fake) Fujiwara. Sook-hee must convince Lady Hideko to like and marry Fujiwara. But are things really what they look to be? At this point we're not even 15 minutes into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from Korean director Park Chan-wook, who has previously brought us films like ""Oldboy"" and most recently ""Stoker"". Here he brings us a complex story (based on/transposed from British novelist Sarah Waters ""Fingersmith"") of deception and greed, set in a sexually charged environment. Like the book, the film consists of three parts. If you can count on one thing of director Park, it is that he brings is movies is a very stylish way, sometimes at the cost of substance (see: Stoker). But let me comfort you right away: while here also the movie is very stylish, it never does so at the expense of the substance. It took me quite a while to figure out who is who, and what exactly is happening, as we see a number of scenes more than once, but from different perspectives. Very helpful (and crucial to understanding the movie) is that at the beginning we are informed that yellow subtitles indicate Japanese is spoke, and white subtitles indicate Korean. BEWARE: there are a number of explicit sex scenes in the movie, reminiscent of ""Blue Is the Warmest Color"" (and causing the movie to be rated the equivalent of NC-17 in a number of countries). The two leading ladies, Kim Min-hee as Lady Hideko and Kim Tae-ri as Sook-hee, are nothing short of outstanding. At one point, when someone is relaying a particular story about Lady Hideko, someone interrupts and says: ""give more details! A story is all about the journey!"", and it is a perfect metaphor for this movie: yes, it is quite long (2 1/2 hrs.) but the journey is so worth it.""The Handmaiden"" premiered at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year, and finally opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati this weekend.

33,jtindahouse,Made with a lot of class,7,2 February 2017,"I have only seen one previous Chan-wook Park film ('Oldboy') and it just so happened it was one of the finest films I have ever seen. I've always planned to see more of his work, but sometimes find it hard to get motivated to watch foreign language films. However, when I saw he had released a film in 2016 which was getting a positive response I decided I had to check it out. 'The Handmaiden' is quite a different tale to 'Oldboy', yet it's told with equal measures of class. Park makes terrific looking films with amazing attention to detail and has an incredible ability to intrigue and fascinate an audience with the complex and intricate stories he tells.'The Handmaiden' is mostly a love story, partly a mystery and partly a violent thriller. The story is told in three parts. We are told a story, then asked to question everything we have seen, and then given an explanation of sorts. Throughout all of this we are being treated to some wonderful acting, direction and writing. It truly is a wonderfully put together film.In some ways this film may alienate a portion of its audience. People who like romances and love stories don't often tend to enjoy high levels of violence. Conversely, those who do enjoy high levels of violence and a mystery/thriller element to their films, don't often have the patience or desire to sit through what is at its heart a love story. This is the only problem I can see this film having. As long as you're able to get past that side of things, you're going to have a good time with this one.",The Handmaiden
34,Turfseer,Lugubrious pacing and drawn out erotic scenes compromise cleverly-plotted love triangle set in Japanese occupied Korea,5,8 January 2020,"The Handmaiden is Korean director Park Chan-wook's ""erotic psychological thriller"" according to Wikipedia. You would think that a film set in 1930s Japanese occupied Korea would provide some insights into that particular era, but think again. The political context is lacking and the film is simply a fractured love triangle featuring erotic elements.
The narrative is divided into three parts. In Part 1, we're introduced to a con man, Count Fujiwara (Ha Jung-woo) who seeks to con a Japanese heiress, Lady Hideko (Kim Min-hee) into marrying him; he conscripts a pickpocket, Sook-hee (Kim Tae-ri) to work as handmaiden to Hideko, with instructions to convince her mistress of the suitability of taking Fujiwara as her husband.
If The Handmaiden has any value at all, it's in its clever plotting: in Part 1, we see everything from Sook-hee's point of view. We're led to believe that Hideko is an innocent, under the tutelage of her uncle Kouziki (Cho Jin-woong), a Korean collaborator, who aided the Japanese in securing a foothold following the takeover of his native country. Kouziki sells expensive forged erotic novels at auction to rich Japanese. Sook-hee ends up having sexual encounters with Hideko on the pretext that this is what she can expect (and even more) from the Count.
Part 2 is narrated from Hideko's point of view. This is where we become privy to the previously alluded to ""big twist."" In a series of flashbacks, we see that Uncle Kouziki was abusive, driving his wife to suicide and abusing his adopted niece Hideko when she was both a child and adult (Hideko is often forced to narrate the uncle's erotic novels in front of a leering group of clients at the auctions).
Fujiwara's initial plan is to have Hideko committed to a mental institution after marrying her, and splitting the proceeds of her inheritance with Sook-hee. Fujiwara however soon learns that Hideko is no innocent and concludes conning her probably would not be successful. Instead, he modifies his plan to have Sook-hee committed and marry Hideko after falling in love with her.
Part 3 features a further plot reversal. Here Hideko decides to double cross the Count after to admitting to herself that she was in love with Sook-hee all along! You can possibly guess the rest of it: Hideko drugs the Count and has him brought back to her uncle, who initially attempts to torture him but ends up dead after the Count facilitates a convenient murder/suicide.
As for the two women, they end up scot free, making love to one another as the camera fades out. Note here that The Handmaiden features a good deal of erotic scenes (particularly between the two women) which doesn't add much to the drama and ends up slowing the proceedings down considerably. Despite the good acting and cinematography, The Handmaiden also suffers from characters without many redeeming characteristics, which prevents us from getting too absorbed in their slow-footed machinations.

But just because it's nice to look at, doesn't mean it's fun to watch.The story is told in three parts, each introduced by an on-screen title. The movie goes back and forth on the timeline a bit.It's so long-winded in parts that I stopped caring who everyone was and what they were doing. This is anathema in any movie, but more so for one that fills you in after the fact. I am generally loath to assume that the only reason someone says they like an adults only movie is because of the sex. Here, I have to make an exception. Yes, it does have some fairly graphic lesbian scenes - though not much compared to ""Blue is the Warmest Colour"". And yes, this lesbianism is between two pretty, young Korean actresses.Supposedly, at least most guys love to see women make out, and most of them also have a preference for Asian women. I realise I am an anomaly in not being that excited by either. And take the sex out of the movie, and what do you have?A photography book you'd enjoy flipping through, but not enough of a story to make you want to take it home.",The Handmaiden
36,kevin_robbins,This isn't Park Chan-Wook's best film but I recommend seeing it once.,7,29 August 2021,"The Handmaiden (2016) is a movie my wife and I watched on Prime one day. The storyline follows a heiress who is rich and just inherited a bunch of money. A handmaiden is hired to infiltrate her trust, develop a relation and help swindle money out of her. The handmaiden falls in love with the heiress and things get complicated. This movie is directed by Park Chan-Wook (Old Boy) and stars Kim Min-hee (The Day After), Ha Jung-woo (the Chaser) and Yong-nyeo Lee (The Wailing). The storyline for this is methodical and intricate. The characters are very dynamic and delivered well. The evolution and feelings of the main character are depicted well as they evolve over time. I loved the settings especially in the final scenes. There is a lot to appreciate about this film. The ending concludes perfectly and is rewarding. This isn't Park Chan-Wook's best film but I recommend seeing it once.

37,GiraffeDoor,So worth putting the time aside,8,11 November 2019,"It's rare that I can watch a movie this long in one go. Obligingly it divides itself into three distinct acts that serve as convenient check points so you really feel the progress being made.Does it justify its runtime? It really is an epic story, not in the sense that it spans any great amount of space or time but in how it shows with great ambition and attention to detail, explores a complex and enigmatic relationship, that is for both its participants a testing of the limits of gender, sexuality, ethnicity and economic class.A sensual and atmospheric evocation of a particular time and place where two cultures live uneasily side by side, there is plenty of the Korea/Japanophiles to jack off over except there is an irony to it presentation of ostentatious culture and refinement; showing the dark side to the beautiful and that deeper vision that lies beyond the patriarchal gaze. (I woke up this morning in a pretentious mood).The non-linear narrative structure presents us with mystery and intrigue regarding its central conflict, where less and less is exactly what it seems and we are treated to an impressive bout of story telling and misdirection in this tale of hidden identity and self discovery as well as characterisation and thoughtfulness.Very visually beautiful with a lyrical surface belying the bitter core, in which even the whether are not immune from this world of alienation and loneliness.A serious movie, but with a sense of humor when it needs it. A love story of sorts, but thankfully that kind in which the relationship is a tool to explore the characters rather than the other way around.My only real issue is that it is not exactly cogent what the plan is even when we're supposed to know.Not a movie to watch casually, but give this movie the commitment it requires and it will pay you back in spades.",The Handmaiden
38,kluseba,The art of eroticism,10,26 January 2017,"''The Handmaiden'' is a mesmerizing period drama that convinces with a twisted story, gloomy settings, an atmospheric score, precise cinematography, profound characters and incredible acting performances. It consists of three parts, the first two leading to clever twists and the last one to a satisfactory conclusion that leaves no questions unanswered if you watch carefully. The story is set in Japanese-occupied Korea and tells the story of a thief's daughter who is collaborating with a clever crook in order to steal the inheritance of a rich Japanese lady living in seclusion with her perverted uncle. Telling you anything more would take away from the movie's brilliant storytelling.The movie has a slow pace but develops a melancholic atmosphere right from the start with the very first scene until the final freeze frame. Despite a few necessary repetitions in the story due to a few shifts in perspective, the movie passed surprisingly quickly despite a running time of nearly two and a half hours.The story is clever and emotional with its twists and turns. Some twists are hard to predict while others are easier to figure out and others again aren't directly revealed throughout the movie but they are all told carefully, elegantly and profoundly. This movie doesn't only stimulate your genitals and your heart but also your brain.The film should only be watched by mature adults since it includes a lot of eroticism. The movie carefully contrasts cold sexual abuse and passionate romance in a balanced way. This isn't only done by performing credible sexual intercourse in front of the camera. This is also told through facial expressions, quotes from erotic novels and appropriate settings. While more conservative minds could be shocked, one should note that every single scene adds to the clever story and the depth of the characters. This movie doesn't include any sexual innuendo and no pornographic movie could even slightly achieve what this movie does. This is truly a lesson in eroticism performed by highly skilled actors and actresses and this combination makes this movie stand out.In the end, the combination of intense emotions, profound eroticism and an intelligent story in a movie involving outstanding actors and actresses and directed by one of the world's best directors makes this one of the very best period dramas ever made in the history of cinema. Not only genre fans will adore this movie but any adult with a genuine interest in cinema should watch this contemporary masterpiece.",The Handmaiden

The actors were convincing and the script had been well written. The characters were twisted, sneaky, self-serving and yet, I found myself liking them.
My only problem with this was that it was so erotic. I had no idea it was going to go all the places it did and that might just be bad on my part but, nonetheless, since I was so unprepared for it, I took off a star. It was a good, edge of your seat drama though.",The Handmaiden

Min-hee Kim stars as Lady Hikeko, a young Japanese woman of wealth and beauty living in an isolated estate with her sadistic uncle in Japanese-occupied Korea in the 1930s. A gaggle of Korean thieves and con artists dream up a scheme to separate Hikeko from her fortune. The idea is for one of them to pose as a Count Fujiwara, seduce Hikeko and then marry her. Aiding this scheme is a pretty little pickpocket named Sook-Hee (played with great skill and charm by Tae-ri Kim).That's all I can tell you about the plot. Rest assured it is fascinating with some very surprising twists and turns. This is also one of the sexiest movies I've ever seen. It is billed as a crime thriller but actually it is the story of a beautiful love affair.

But it thankfully didn't seem to work. It took on a vulgar tone at times as it went too over the top with the sex scenes with an underage looking girl looking right in the camera with her mouth covered in vaginal secretion. They got rid of the man and the uncle got him back and tortured him while he's smoking the poisonous cigarette in the basement where the uncle had also killed the aunt and set it up to make it look like a suicide by hanging. People kept talking about the twist at the end and I can assure you there's no twist whatsoever. Both women tricked each other with the man at first and when his lady wanted to hang herself in the cherry tree, the two united against the man. She got out of the asylum and met the girl who poisoned his drink and made her sleep at the hotel room. That was it.

He enlists the help of a pickpocket (Kim Tae-ri) to act as the heiress' handmaiden. Unbeknownst to him, the women fall for each other. Another barrier is the heiress' evil uncle (Cho Jin-woong) who has dominated her for many years. The film is based on the novel ""Fingersmith"" by Sarah Waters and updates the story from Victorian England to Japanese-occupied Korea in the early 20thcentury.There are various plot twists to keep this movie intriguing throughout. The first two (of three) parts are the same narrative while the second is more of a revision of the first with a different perspective. These are the best parts of the film.The third part wraps things up well enough but with some difficult violent scenes. Also, at the risk of giving away a spoiler, the story has too many resemblances to the superb American indie film / lesbian love story ""Bound"" (1996).In addition to ""Bound"", ""The Handmaiden"" takes cues from another more recent lesbian love story ""Blue is the Warmest Colour"" from France. Both films had sex scenes between two women that began as erotic but ended by being (or at least bordering on) pornographic.

51,tenshi_ippikiookami,Just amazing,10,5 August 2016,"""The Handmaiden"" is a crazily imaginative and beautiful movie by Chan-wook Park, who is at the top of his game in this story of a pickpocket that tries to steal the fortune of a naive, innocent rich woman that has been secluded in a mansion in the middle of nowhere. Of course, things will start to get complicated soon enough.Chan-wook Park has done a great job in adapting the original novel by Sarah Waters, and mixing it with the history of the Japanese invasion of Korea at the beginning of the twentieth century. The plot is a little bit silly sometimes, but Chan-wook Park makes it all tight and fast-paced, and even the most silly moment becomes a moment of beauty and fun. From the first moment, the viewer will be enthralled by the story of these two women and their relationship, and every plot development will just add fun to the whole.If the plot and the direction weren't amazing enough, the movie is as beautiful as they come. From the darkest moment, the most violent, to the most intimate, beauty transpires in every frame, and every scene comes to life and threatens to pop and break free from the screen. This is helped by the amazing work of all the cast, who does an incredible job in bringing this tale to life (it could be criticized, though, some of the heavily accented Japanese, for characters that are supposed to be able to pass as them).All in all, ""The Handmaiden"" is proof that a movie can have a plot, amazing direction, acting, scenery, craziness and the most beautiful package possible.

I've seen them all and been an avid follower for years, and this one doesn't disappoint. It's a complicated layered story of con artists and deviants, but there are many aspects to it all. There's humour, scares, romance, eroticism and suspense. Lots of twists add up to make a film that really you don't know what to expect next with. It's excellent. It's all shot brilliantly in Chan-Wook Park's philosophical style. Each shot is picturesque. It's wonderful to look at, the music is wonderful and the storyline is engrossing. The motley crue of characters have some great depth to them that you are just intrigued. I've just watched the extended version, so I'm reviewing that here. It's very graphic sexually so be careful on taking a date to this film. If you're liberally-minded, then you'll really enjoy this. It's erotic and sometimes crude, but never really offensive. It is actually also a criticism of certain forms of sexual abusive behaviour, and that's intriguing.

I can probably name 10 or 12 films after two years with an OLED TV. This film is one of themThis film really comes to life with its magnificente HDR capture. You can see ambient light brighten and dim as clouds out of camera view cover the sun. You can really see those minuet changes in ambient luminosity even in the indoor scenes lit by outdoors .The filming set is also beautifully done and the camera composition impeccable. Forgive me for being a photography geek, but I really do appreciate these small technical details in filmsI watched this film on Amazon Prime, but unfortunately Amazon added large subtitles baked into the picture.

57,bryank-04844,It doesn't get better than 'The Handmaiden'.,10,23 January 2017,"Park Chan-wook is already a legendary filmmaker in pretty much every circle and he's only 53 years old. With films like the original 'Oldboy', 'Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance', 'Thirst', and 'Stoker', it's easy to say that Park Chan-wook is a master of his domain and film. Fortunately for everyone who loves film, his new movie 'The Handmaiden', based off 'Fingersmith' by Sarah Waters is not just a film, but an experience in cinema and will be forever etched in you memory for all the right reasons.In 'The Handmaiden', Park Chan-wook has perfectly conjured up a mix of a 1930's drama, comedy, horror, suspense, and a bathtub full of sex and tentacles. Most filmmakers would have a very difficult time making a classy artsy film with these subjects, let alone, combining all of these aspects, but Park Chan-wook has done it effortlessly. Set in Korea in the 1930s, a suave crook named Count Fujiwara has hired a young woman named Sook-hee, and has trained her to be a pick-pocket and con- artist, in order to make the mysterious, strange, and very wealthy Lady Hideko fall in love, in order to taker all of her jewels and money.Sook-hee goes undercover as Hideko's new handmaiden in order to help her fall in love more with Count Fujiwara. Something unexpected happens when Hideko and Sook-hee end up falling for each other, much to the dismay to Hideko's sadistic black tongued uncle. There are so many layers to this film and each of its characters that during the 145 minute run-time, you get the story basically three times, told in different perspectives, with each new look, revealing a darker and more sexual side to each character and compelling clues to the ever going mystery of just what is taking place at this beautiful estate.Needless to say, it isn't all puppy dogs and beautiful flowers. With some of the darker images and actions that take place in 'The Handmaiden', Park Chan-wook uses his camera in a very elegant way and never in a harsh movement, making every bit of debauchery or lovemaking seem innocent. 'The Handmaiden' is one of the better films in a long time and there is absolutely no other film like it.MUST-SEE!",The Handmaiden

I honestly cannot wait to see his previous films because The Handmaiden was awesome.The Handmaiden shows a woman who is hired to be a handmaiden to a heiress but is secretly there to defraud her.Just the story alone is why I think people should check out The Handmaiden. The film's narrative goes back and forth a couple of times and the way Park Chan-wook uses this to his advantage is incredible. The film led me to believe one thing was happening but then it revealed something else happening at the same time and it's these twists and turns which made the film so fun to watch and everything was built up extremely well. The twists revealed a different side of each character, kept the film suspenseful and it didn't feel forced at any given moment. The entire story was so well thought out that I found it incredibly hard to find a flaw in it.Apart from the story, the technical craft is outstanding. The production design is terrific and the colours of the films are great. I really loved the score and overall music. The cinematography and direction were sublime and the pacing was really good. It's over 2 hours long but it never felt that way because of how interesting the story and characters were. The two lead actresses (Min-hee Kim and Tae-ri Kim) had to do a lot of demanding stuff but they both were fantastic. Jung-woo Ha and Jin-woong Cho also gave really great performances.Park Chan-wook's twisted, sexy and suspenseful story is must watch.

What do you get when the double-crossers are double-crossing each other? Triple-crossing? Then that's what it is.The film is set in Korea during the Japanese occupation. Two women and a man are engaged in complicated shenanigans, involving gender, sexual preference, social class, nationality and even language. Each character is pretending, in order to deceive the others.In each of the three parts, a new level of deceit is shown. Sometimes parts of the story are repeated from another angle, to show how things are slightly different from how you think they were. Confused? Don't bother to understand. It'll all become clear when you see the film.Visually, this movie is absolutely great. Each scene, even if it lasts for only a few seconds, is beautiful. The lighting, the camera angles, the costumes, the scenery, the make-up - everything is picture perfect.The flip side is that the visual perfection takes away much spontaneity. The film is extremely stylish, perhaps even a bit too much so. But the visual bravado is not empty. There's a lot going on at each moment, and the imagery is always in line with the story itself.

62,andrewroy-04316,"The Handmaiden is a sumptuous, layered masterclass in romance storytelling",8,27 July 2020,"The Handmaiden was different than I expected, but an extremely well told story. The first act seems a bit slow and straightforwards, but at the end comes the first twist, and from there the wonderful, intricate story unfolds. I am not usually a big fan of romance films because they force the relationship with no real understanding of their perspectives or reasons they care about the other person. In The Handmaiden, the layering of their perspectives by seeing events from one perspective in the first act and another in the second does a fantastic job of showing the way each opens up to this idea, despite their initial plans. The other thing that makes the romance work so well is because of the personal backstories we understand in how up to this point, they have been controlled and used (particularly sexually) by men in their lives. This is particularly poignant for Hideko, but also present for Sookhee in relation to the Count. It's a great story of two women who had turned cold and ruthless due to the way they have been treated by men in their lives, to find each other and regain some passion and joy. I love the way Park structures the story to present a simple set up and then add depth to it as the movie progresses, until by the end we see the full picture and can appreciate the wonderful journey the two women went on. The cinematography and score are excellent, but at its core this is a brilliantly crafted story of two women finding love and liberating themselves from the domineering men in their lives.",The Handmaiden

I can't recommend this to anyone. The extended graphic sex scenes don't serve the story at all and are just for ratings. How can anyone not see this is beyond me. The story is barely there and predictable after 30 minutes.I think that because there are Korean and Japanese languages spoken, rather well I'm told, that this movie gets a boost. Another boost for nudity and a bit of revenge. It's a 5 at best if you ignore these bonuses.

If you remove the unquestionably excessive scenes, it becomes a thrilling tale of deception and cunning, with dialogue and acting that deeply convinced me the actor's truly felt their characters' emotions. But the continuous bombardment of pornography makes it very clear that director Park had no intentions of making a respectable film. Perhaps his intention was to see if he could persuade critics that an overtly explicit work could somehow be considered art rather than pornography? Whatever his motives may be, I now firmly believe that he is a dirtier old man than the dirty old man in his story, and this movie that had so much potential only leaves me feeling dirty too.",The Handmaiden

The second part began to show more changes, darker, more evil, more erotic display, especially more verbal pornography, more lesbian tricks than ""Carol"". And, finally knowing how to use the bell.

68,markgorman,I had no idea this would be so outstandingly good,10,12 November 2019,"I'm late to the party on this one, so I'll keep it brief.My only previous experience of director Chan Wook-Park's work was 2003's ultra-violent Oldboy that was later remade for US audiences.This takes a reverse sweep by adapting a western tale for the east.It uses Sarah Watters' sublime Victorian lesbian bodice-ripper, Fingersmith, as its source material and translates it into Korean/Japanese culture.It's bloody brilliant.It's sumptuous in its design.The acting is universally excellent and the story is a guess a minute thriller that holds your attention for every second of its 155 subtitled minutes (yellow for Japanese dialogue, white for Korean).The story is all about jeopardy, class and the real meaning of love and it's sultry, sexy, beautiful and actually quite hilarious in parts.It's no wonder it's made it to IMDB's top 250 of all time.I rate it a straight ten. What a brilliant and unexpected way to spend a wet November Monday night.",The Handmaiden
69,coreyjdenford,She gives a five star performance,10,13 April 2017,"This review of The Handmaiden is spoiler free ***** (5/5)IT'S OFTEN DIFFICULT to imagine the thoughts of a big-name filmmaker such as Park Chan-wook. He's optimistic to say the least, and this has lead him to become a Korean cinema mastermind, just by a few films that have shocked audiences all over the world, he's been called a genius. It's given his films a particular high-standard, whether they're thrillers, Oldboy or whether it's a sexy vampire story, Thirst. He's good at thrilling his audience no matter the genre. His previous film, Stoker, his English-language debut and his first foray into Hollywood, went beyond all that; he added a new feature by going beyond the mark with sexual content. It had a scene where Mia Wasikowska's burgeoning villain, masturbated joyfully after the assassination of her attempted rapist. That was sex on a smaller scale; his latest The Handmaiden involves that scene on a much larger scale, think Blue Is The Warmest Colour, that's this film in a nutshell. Inspired by Sarah Waters' crime novel Fingersmith, this powerful Byzantine-esque tale is a picturesque journey of a lowly pickpocket who is employed by a powerful Seoul con-man to defraud a wealthy Japanese heiress out of her money, during the Japanese occupation of Korea in the 1930s. It's a voluptuously stunning tale of love, sex, violence, and vengeance, at 2 hours an 24 minutes it is a slightly episodic endeavour of vengeance but it's gorgeous every scene from inside the mansion or outside in the gardens is presented like the number one painting exhibit at The Louvre, even the luridly mesmerizing intimate times are like a painting, thanks to Chung Chung-hoo's cinematography. Told over three chapters, each set with a purpose, which most of the time ends up with somebody getting hurt it's an irresistible tale of wonder and joy. We open with Sook-hee (Kim Tae-ri) a young pickpocket who is employed by a con-man, Count Fujiwara (Ha Jung-woo) to work for a wealthy Japanese heiress, Lady Hideko (Kim Min-hee) as a handmaiden, while he tries to seduce her into marriage. But it later transpires that Count Fujiwara isn't the man who he says he is, he's self-indulgent in many ways and also he plans to put young Sook-hee in jail for thievery. She, however, has different plans she starts to fall in love with Hideko, and as their love gets stronger to a point she's then taken away.At which point she forms an elaborate plan for vengeance, it's a while before this plan comes to play and when it does Chan-wook isn't afraid to steer away from the material. He presents himself as a cinematic thesp by creating his characters around turmoil, pain, suffering and emotion. The film is fiery at this point getting faster as every minute is an irresistible moment, towards vengeance. Meanwhile, intercutting flashbacks of Hideko's life growing up with her narcissistic uncle and her insane auntie and how they taught her to read erotica with proper diction around an audience of perverted elderly men. Sure it's a perverse moment, but it's still equally mesmerizing there are plenty of those moments that evolve this film and each one is better than the last. In addition, it's frankly sexual, horrifically violent, and voluptuously stunning.When the final thrill comes to play it shows that Sook-hee has planned her moment of shine well, it's a non-bullsh*t thrill which involves a lot of pain, a giant octopus on the wall, pollution from smoking and ultimately a stunning shot of Sook-hee and Hideko tearing up a studio in the home. This is lifted with perfect execution, it's almost too hard to look away from beauty of love (which is the message this film gives). The Handmaiden is sybaritic yet luridly mesmerizing down to its final moments that are executed perfectly, it's a joy. It's Chan-wook's best film in years that will stand the test of time. VERDICT: A part Oldboy, a bit like Stoker with a part Blue Is The Warmest Colour makes this is a cinematic masterpiece of the ages.",The Handmaiden
70,eagandersongil,Sadly intimate and beautiful,9,25 March 2019,"The dramatic and sarcastically tense film of the beloved Korean director Park Chan-Wook. It is like a punch in the stomach with a cotton glove, as he plays with viewer and his point of view several times during the plot, we love and hate characters with a frequency of frightening changes and unlike similar scripts, here everyone has construction, everyone has senses, everyone works and everyone has their own narrative weight.With a script that tells the story of a man who seeks to win a rich woman to give him a blow and get his money, the film works in a trio, man, woman and his maid, seems simple at first glance, however its roterisk features, ramifications and development end up leaving the plot much wider, complex and beautifully functional.The trio created by Park Chan works very well, has all its plots and twists very well fitted, at certain times, we love and hate everyone, besides the good performances and motivations convincing with their development. In addition to talking about topics such as sexualization, ambition, greed, manipulation, ethnic strife, violence and psychological torture in a playful but raw.The highlight of the film in the first moment is its script, however, we have here a great soundtrack, optimistic and sad at the same time, which complements the void that each character has, plus a clear and beautiful photograph that contrasts with internal angles cold and colorless, causing caustrophobia. The photograph of the film speaks with its shooting angles, innocence and perversity intertwine with a macabre beauty, the sex scenes are extremely well filmed, intimate and irrational, that are at the same level of their scenes violent and cruel, psychologically and physically . With some planes sequences and angles open, its direction is beautiful.In addition, we have great costumes, composition of scenes, makeup and sound, ""The maid"" is a complete film.""The maid"" is not perfect, but flirts with perfection, aesthetics and technique, we have a great movie, full of feelings and symbologies. 9/10",The Handmaiden
71,The_late_Buddy_Ryan,Jade Is the Warmest Color?,9,25 May 2017,"We didn't much care for Park's Eng.-lang. debut, ""Stoker,"" a formula Gothic creeper with some showy cinematography, borderline overacting and a pretty lame script. He's on much firmer ground here with a Korean cast and setting—the latter shifted from the source novel's Victorian England to Japanese-ruled Korea, c. 1930. The crusher plot line was ""inspired by 'Fingersmith,'"" one of Sarah Waters's tales of the lesbian demimonde, and the film kicks off with some vintage romance-novel shtick —a scoundrel's plotting to elope with an heiress, Lady Hideko, and relieve her of her fortune. He installs an accomplice, a skilled female pickpocket (that's what a ""fingersmith"" is, apparently), as Hideko's lady's maid to help him win her over, and the intense relationship that develops between the lady and the lady's maid is what saves ""The Handmaiden"" from being just another forgettable genre film like ""Stoker."" There's some pervy Sadean stuff involving a hanging tree and forged pornographic MSS and such, but the two heroines' tale is so compelling and the plot ticks over so smoothly—despite an amazing WTF?! moment at the end of part one—that you'll barely notice. Great performances, fascinating background (esp. the Koreans' cultural cringe toward their depraved Japanese rulers); those who have problems with what a know-it-all Netflix reviewer called ""tribadic"" sex scenes—not even sure that's the right word—should probably look elsewhere, however",The Handmaiden
72,x_manicure_x,A film on its own,8,14 August 2021,"The same story can be told in countless ways, and ""The Handmaiden"" could have been yet one more erotic thriller if it wasn't directed by Park Chan-wook. The fascinatingly decadent mood, the quirky way he mixes opposite genres, the sharp black humor and sarcasm even in the worst situations, the visceral depiction of sex and sensuality, the way he keeps adding more and more to the plate and stop right before it overflows. Despite the demanding running time the pacing is consistently tight: there is always a lot going on on-screen both aesthetically and narratively, but never to the point it becomes overwhelming.The only thing that could have been better might be the ending, as the twists in the middle inevitably lead you to set even higher expectations for the finale. You get mindblown the first time, but everything starts to become quite predictable after you grasp the general tone.The film clearly plays with gender roles, but one more concept explored is Korea's identity during Japan's colonization. We see a lot of Koreans who try to imitate the Japanese lifestyle, but at the same time Japanese are under the strong influence of western countries. The mansion Hideko lives in is a hybrid of Japanese and British architecture, owned by a Korean who pretends to be a Japanese man of letters. Count Fujiwara is another example of Korean aspiring to be a Japanese gentleman dressed in British fashion. They both flaunt their Japanese language skills while Hideko, who is supposed to be an actual Japanese, doesn't like to speak her own language as it represents the readings imposed by her uncle.The use of two languages generates some interesting situations, even though sometimes the actors' Korean accent gets so thick that it was hard to understand some of the Japanese lines. It's understandable for Kouzuki and Fujiwaraas are supposed to be Korean in the story, but Hideko was not so believable as a Japanese.",The Handmaiden
73,themadmovieman,An absolutely psychotic but exhilarating film,9,22 July 2017,"This is quite an exceptional film. With two and a half hours of intense, rapid-fire betrayal, unpredictability and purely psychotic thrills, The Handmaiden is an intoxicating watch from start to finish. Directed stupendously by Park Chan-wook, and featuring three amazing central performances, it's a film that will grab you with its unbelievable levels of insanity and darkness, but will thrill you again and again with a sumptuous and confident execution of an enthralling story.Let's first establish what on earth this film really is, and why that makes it so brilliant. On the one hand, this works on its own as a period thriller, with the setting of Korea under Japanese colonial rule allowing for some insight into the time period of the 1920s-30s, as well as some beautiful costume and production design, all of which plays a big role in making the film as elegant as it is.On the other hand, the story is an incredibly intense affair featuring twists and turns the likes of which you've never seen. The film is directed by Park Chan-wook, who also made the legendarily messed-up thriller Oldboy, a fact that's even more disturbing when you realise that The Handmaiden is in more ways than one even more psychotic and terrifying than that movie.The story is one of deception, betrayal and love from start to finish, and in that, it's very reminiscent of two classic thrillers. The style of its story, featuring three acts based around three enormous but totally unpredictable twists, is much like how David Fincher's Gone Girl plays out, whilst the content of the story, involving two characters secretly working together to get one over on someone they have befriended is hugely reminiscent of Diabolique, a film so effective in its thrills that it actually influenced the success of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho.Anyway, it's a plot that's difficult to talk about without giving away any spoilers, but it is one that is utterly thrilling at every moment. Not just an unpredictable mystery, but a story so full of depth and emotional intrigue, allowing its characters to flourish in the most unorthodox of ways as the plot snowballs towards breaking point.However, the plot alone isn't what makes this film so amazing. Above all, Park Chan-wook's direction plays a huge role in that. As we know, Park is a director with the ability to not just weird you out, but chill you to the bone with some pretty demented stories.Here, he doesn't hold back even for a second when it comes to portraying the sheer brutality of the lead trio. The story that unfolds effectively takes the form of a love triangle, but Park makes sure to emphasise the darker side of that sort of conflict by filling the film with some incredibly frank and unbelievably graphic sex.Now, many films go too far on this front and become completely gratuitous, but that's not the case with The Handmaiden. Although there are two scenes that are almost unwatchable given their graphic nature, the sex scenes play an incredibly powerful and central role to the entire story, and without being portrayed in such a frank and carnal manner, the intensity of the story and the betrayals that come about as a result would never have been so strong.Another reason that the film is so intense is simply because it just doesn't stop. It may run for almost two and a half hours, but believe me, that time feels no more than ten minutes thanks to the unbelievable pace of the movie. Split up into three perfect parts whose structure messes with your perceptions of the story as much as anything else in this movie, the story moves along at an almost relentless pace, continuing to snowball as things get far darker, and far, far more disturbing, but it makes for an incredible viewing experience that leaves you completely intoxicated from the very first scene to the very last.Finally, we can't forget the performances, which are just as brilliant as everything else in the movie. The leading trio are exceptional to watch, and they work amazingly on screen with one another, with just enough chemistry to make their cordial relationships convincing, and yet enough alarm in their individual turns to keep everything on a knife edge.Kim Min-hee is amazing as the Japanese heiress, and is able to throw you way off scent when it comes to really figuring out what her character is all about. Then Kim Tae-ri is just as brilliant as the handmaiden herself, and shows an incredible level of intensity as what at first seems like the film's most orthodox character. And finally, Ha Jung-woo excels as the Korean man disguising himself as a Japanese count to win the heiress' affections (and fortune), with a strong, and often even frightening performance bringing total unpredictability to proceedings.On the whole, I was absolutely blown away by The Handmaiden. It's an intense and at times jaw-dropping piece of work that will have your eyes glued to the screen at almost every second. Directed beautifully by Park Chan-wook, it's an elegant period drama crossed with one of the most intense and demented thrillers you'll ever see, and its incredibly graphic sex will have you cowering away while being simultaneously stunned by the dramatic power on display. Its two and a half hours pass by in an instant, but its intensity and purely psychotic nature will stay with you long afterwards.",The Handmaiden
74,akash_sebastian,A Fiercely Anti-Patriarchal Period Romance Thriller,9,23 December 2016,"Subverting the trope of feminine subservience and the male gaze, Park Chan-Wook's latest thriller is fiercely anti-patriarchal. Inspired from Sarah Waters' contemporary romance novel set in Victorian-era Britain, Park transports his story to 1930's Japanese-occupied Korea. Parallels can be seen between subjugation of women by men and that of Korea by Japan; clash of culture, class and identity. It exposes and condemns the bare-faced misogyny brought upon by class and culture. Being a tale about deception, Park makes sure that we are one of its casualties as well (through its efficient narrative structure); nothing is as it seems. I repeat, 'Nothing'. Each of the four main characters are pursuing a vision of freedom that can be achieved only through a lie; the story explores the tension between the authentic self and the facade that individuals create, and that society imposes from without.The tradition of men eroticising the female body (and even lesbian sex) for their own personal fantasies has existed for ages now - whether it's books, films, paintings, manga, any kind of art - and pornography in general (shunga is referenced in the film); Park highlights this, then lets the female protagonists explore their sexuality for their own pleasure, not anyone else's. One wouldn't have expected Mr. Park, known for his exquisite revenge thrillers, would give us the best romance film of the year (not to say this isn't a revenge thriller as well). It's essentially the story of two women who are victims of their circumstances and finally find solace in each other. The female characters may appear duplicitous, but actually, they subvert the expectations of the people around who constantly underestimate their wit and sexuality.The gorgeous visuals, the compulsive attention to detail and crisp editing get you hooked from the very first scene. Loved the efficient and subtle use of humour at apt instances; absurdist humour underlines even the most tragic and violent moments. The casting couldn't have been better; both the actresses are stunning, and captivating in their performances. Their characters are so thoroughly developed, and the sex scenes are highly erotic and sensual. Park masterfully constructs his narrative, dividing the film into three segments, each with its own narrator, sub plot and con. Even when previous moments are visited, they are done from a different angle or vantage point, thus altering our perspective literally. I love how the film's climax literally ends with a climax, with the two women reveling in the silly freedom of acting out a pornographic cliché mentioned earlier in the film. Ultimately, the movie is about embracing one's true self, and the liberation of mind and body. It's Park's most uplifting film yet.",The Handmaiden

78,asifahsankhan,"Victorian England is traded for colonial Korea –a country writhing under Japanese oppression –The altering of the plot is done in such remarkable aspects, perfectly!",10,4 July 2017,"Consider the octopus. Moist and squirming, this extra-terrestrial creature stalks the ocean's calm depths before merging into the scenery. It spots an unsuspecting fish passing by. Before the prey can understand why this familiar patch of seabed now seems so unsettling, it feels a clammy tentacle coil around its torso.The octopus is an ingenious hunter and has long been a sexual symbol, a tradition which director Park Chan-Wook has followed to highlight suppressed and perverted desire. The mollusc performs this role in his most notorious work Oldboy, when Choi Min-Sik devours it alive after his release from captivity. It appears again in The Handmaiden, encapsulating the film's strange mixture of predication and passion.Based on Sarah Walter's book Fingersmith, Victorian England is traded for colonial Korea – a country writhing under Japanese oppression. The new masters have absorbed the superior and modern culture of the West, using it to carve out its own imperial hegemony in the East.Mimicry of the masters is essential to advance up their ladders of power. Some, such as Uncle Kouzuki (Jo Jin-Woong), have discarded their base Korean identities in the struggle to attain a Japanese one, even going so far as to adopt a new name.This Uncle Kouzuki, in aiding the Japanese in their subjugation of the peninsula, has acquired a literal gold mine. Using this wealth, he buys his way into the circles of Japanese nobility and builds a vast gated compound in the local woods.In this estate, he lives with his niece, the Lady Hideko (Kim Min- Hee) and their servants. His own wife, a Japanese noble, is dead and Kouzuki hopes to marry his niece to secure access to her vast inheritance and lineage.However, he is not the only man with his eye on Hideko's assets. A lowly Korean forger posing as Count Fujiwara (Ha Jung-woo) aims to seduce her, enlisting the help of Nam Sook-Hee (Kim Tae-Ri) posing as her handmaiden. Their plan is to defraud Lady Hideko by marrying her to Fujiwara, then sending her to an asylum.The story is co-written between Park and Chung Seo-Kyung who borrow elements from its novelised base. They break the narrative into three parts which are carefully stripped away, each section revealing more truth than the last.Flowing through the narrative's entirety are two main plots – one a tale of romance, the other of revenge. These address the film's main themes of the struggle to reclaim love and beauty in the face of separation and predication.The film contains excellent dialogue delivered superbly by strong performances from the main cast. Each actor has been carefully selected for their role, from the horrifically impassive face of Kim Hae-Sook as butler-madame Sasaki to Kim Min-Hee's doll like features, fragile and unnerving. Their physical attributes match exactly with the personalities of their characters.The main issue some may have with this film is that it perhaps places the female leads on something of a pedestal. Their relationship is one of abiding faith and harmony. The perversion is all on the part of the males. Instead, their idolised moments of lovemaking are depicted with an attention some might find excessive.Whatever your opinions in this regard, The Handmaiden undoubtedly reinforces Park's strong reputation as a director. His direction allows for a stunning range of emotions to be weaved into this story, with an exquisite set design that would make the BBC blush. It makes for a deceptive charm many will find difficult to escape.",The Handmaiden

83,ctowyi,Masterclass Cinema,10,7 July 2016,"This is hands down the most perfect film I have seen so far this year. I gave a score of 5/5 to movies like The Revenant, Spotlight and The Songs We Sang. But even with these excellent films I can always find a spot that doesn't quite sit right with me. With The Handmaiden, it is perfect; every frame handcrafted to perfection. Even with 4min of explicit sex taken away by my country's dumb censors, this is still perfect every way I see it.Auteur Park Chan-Wook's The Handmaiden is a superb exercise in form, structure and tone. With the latter, Park (Oldboy & Joint Security Area) has achieved something extraordinary. If any scene were to linger a few seconds longer or he had decided to focus on a certain issue, the film would have veered off to a different territory. As it is, and with all the major characters' kooky off-kilter portrayals, I can't pinpoint whether I was watching something real or abstract. I was also kept in awe by the intricate and resplendent set- design which suggests something dark and Gothic is working the undercurrents. There are of course some serious girl on girl action but that never encroaches into the spine of the story.Adapting Sarah Waters' Fingersmith, a Victorian tale awash with all manner of Dickensian motifs, Park spins an engrossing tale that ebbs and flows with a Hitchcockian suspense; it withholds as much as it discloses; it is an erotic tale that beats with raw fervour. It is at once a love story but also a menagerie showcasing human beings in their vilest forms. Park's finger hovers over all the buttons, teasing us gleefully but it is with the ultimate restraint that he never descends down to the usual tropes. The story is divided into three chapters; each told from a different character's perspective. The structure is Rashomon-esque but Park puts his own stamp on it. The film may be nearly 2.5 hours but I hardly moved in my seat; my senses kept spellbound as each twist hits me hard. When it ended I couldn't believe 2.5 hours have whizzed by. The plot is pulsating and it never lets up. There is even an octopus in it! This is definitely the most perfect film I have seen this year.

Director/ Writer Chan-wook Park ""Mr. Vengeance"" (known for his ""Vengeance Trilogy""), along with writer Seo-Kyung Chung provide a sexy, seductive, cat and mouse drama that peeks into the Japanese culture where shy pickpocketer turned Handmaiden Sook-Hee (Kim Tae-ri) is placed with the strictly watched Lady Hideki (Min-hee Kim), at the request of swindler Count Fujiwara (Jung-woo Ha), one of many men who participate in her Uncle Kouzuk (Jin-woong Jo) ""readings. Under Chan-wook Park's captivating direction, and very crazy imagination, the acting is outstanding and what you see may not necessarily be what you think. While the film clocks in at just under 2 1/2 hours, requiring the viewer to almost watch the film twice (you'll understand when you see the film), and more than a handful of audience members walked out, those who stick with the presentation will surly be glad they did. Japanese films are almost always a ""hit or miss"" experience. With ""The Handmaiden,"" the cultural adventure is a hit.",The Handmaiden
85,hunter-friesen,A masterwork of cinema that is both sexually manipulative and ruthlessly violent,10,21 March 2018,"Park Chan-wook is a master of blending multiple themes in his films. His newest film, The Handmaiden, further proves his mastery of balancing and wrapping every element together in an enjoyable way. The Handmaiden is many things at once; sexual, thrilling, violent, and dramatic. Brilliant directing along with excellent performances make this one of the best films in recent memory. The film is set in Japanese occupied Korea during the 1930s. Sook-He is a poor Korean nursing girl that must use her skills as a pickpocket to get by. Her con artist skills get her involved in a plot by Count Fujiwara (a fake persona used by a fellow poor Korean con artist) to steal the fortune from a rich Japanese book collector by marrying his naive niece. Sook-He is sent to the book collector's vast estate as a handmaiden for the niece, Lady Hideko, who is also the inheritor of the fortune. At first, Sook-He and the Hideko don't get along, but after some time they begin to get closer and more intimate. A romance and alliance forms, one that changes Sook-He's original plan. The Count soon arrives and immediately tries to win over Hideko. From this point, the film becomes a twisted game of cat and mouse between the four main characters. You never know who's on what side and who's conning who.Chan-wook presents the film in three equal chapters. Each part focuses on a central character from their point of view. The first follows Sook-He and Lady Hideko and how they initially act around each other. The second goes back in time to reveal Hideko's childhood and how it was devilishly mangled by her uncle. The third follows the Count and Hideko as they play a game of cat and mouse with each other.Each chapter intersects with another, creating a timeline where the sequence of events is presented out of order. Actions at the beginning of the film are revisited later at different angles and from different points of view, which reveal new information that is key to the structuring of the plot. This technique beautifully creates characters and events that complex and memorable. Layers upon layers of storytelling are given to us through different mediums. It keeps thing fresh as we are constantly piecing the timeline in our heads. One could knock Chan-wook for his overuse of gratuitous sex in a few scenes. The romance between Sook-He and Hideko results in intercourse, which ultimately lasts close to ten minutes and ends up feeling like softcore porn. However, the actual sequence is integral to the main story and is done with such care that it barely hinders the overall quality.Chan-wook is known for his outlandish films that are filled with deep storytelling and rich visuals. Here he has outdone himself as the plot gets more interesting as time passes and the grandiose visuals are candy to the eyes. He uses the Korean and Japanese languages as an element of his story as each brings its own symbolism and meaning. Characters flip between languages constantly and each shift is for a specific purpose. As we are the watching the film, we get a sense that the main theme revolves around female empowerment. At the start of the film, both Sook-He and Hideko are servants under powerful men. Their similar circumstances lead them to form their own destiny together, one that is without a master.The cinematography is gorgeous as we are treated to some of the most elaborate and pleasing shots in recent memory. Chung Chung-hoon uses his full arsenal to create a brilliant sense of atmosphere inside the convoluted mansion. Zoom, pan, and crane shots are used with a clear purpose. They frame the scenes perfectly, giving each actor the right amount of space for their performance. The acting, like the rest of the film, is wonderfully done. The standout performance comes from Kim Min-Hie as Lady Hideko. Her ability to immediately switch from a naive schoolgirl to a vengeful enchantress creates an aura of mystery around her. Kim Tae-Ri as the young Sook-He is amazing as well. She brings a sense of youth and acts as our guide for most of the film. We see most things through her eyes and her reactions and facial expressions are tied to ours as well. Finally, Ha Jung-woo as the Count and Cho Jin-woong as the uncle are a creepy pair of power-hungry men. Their methods may differ, but their results are the same. Jung-woo is confident and cool while Jin-woong is cold and menacing. Both share some great scenes with the lead women and have great chemistry.The Handmaiden is a film that carries multiple themes and things it's trying to do. It exceeds in every area possible, keeping right on track as Chan-wook delivers a story that is both challenging and pleasing. The Handmaiden is n feat in cinema that should be seen by all who want to witness a master at his best.",The Handmaiden
86,Orhan_Akdeniz,It's the best film of the year 2017.,8,28 February 2018,I think this is the best film of 2017. The three-part movie narration is beautiful. The women's story is beautiful.,The Handmaiden
87,Semisonic,A sick and bizarre hymn of womanly love,7,11 March 2017,"A con story gone wild, that's another way to summarize what The Handmaiden is about. In between these two short formulas, there's a story no description would be able to do proper justice. It would defy your expectations and keep you puzzled about what's actually going on and what's to happen next. This ability to surprise is The Handmaiden's most undeniable quality, and that alone makes this film worth watching.There's, however, a certain ""anime"" flavor to this story. No, not in the sense that the characters have disproportionately big eyes or hyperbolized emotions. The characters' emotions here are pretty well-explained, but the events that cause them are often contrived beyond any rational explanation. Especially when it comes to people's greed, violence and perversion. As if the film tries to take us aback by flummoxing and mesmerizing us with its explicit and graphic nature, so that we obediently submit ourselves to its cinematographic will.But while the entourage of this story, taking place in Korea during the Japanese occupation, is indeed captivating and colorful, there's a certain ""modern replica"" feeling about it. And not just because it is inspired by a book released in 2002 but whose events take place in Victorian Era England. It's the whole concept of womanly love that can be vicious and cruel to conquer all, something that our society found a taste for only recently. This concept has everything in it to haunt our minds and become a true icon of our generation, but with The Handmaiden it felt neither entirely fresh nor entirely genuine. The world already has Blue is the Warmest Color and Gone Girl. If not for them, The Handmaiden might have been groundbreaking. But now, it feels too much like those two stories intermixed, with an octopus added for a graphic effect. To a stimulated bidder, this book could still be sold high. But it still doesn't make up for a difference between an original and an artfully crafted fake.",The Handmaiden
88,mohit_sinsniwal,Masterclass Cinema,7,26 May 2019,"This is hands down the most perfect film I have seen so far this year. I gave a score of 5/5 to movies like The Revenant, Spotlight and The Songs We Sang. But even with these excellent films I can always find a spot that doesn't quite sit right with me. With The Handmaiden, it is perfect; every frame handcrafted to perfection. Even with 4min of explicit sex taken away by my country's dumb censors, this is still perfect every way I see it.Auteur Park Chan-Wook's The Handmaiden is a superb exercise in form, structure and tone. With the latter, Park (Oldboy & Joint Security Area) has achieved something extraordinary. If any scene were to linger a few seconds longer or he had decided to focus on a certain issue, the film would have veered off to a different territory. As it is, and with all the major characters' kooky off-kilter portrayals, I can't pinpoint whether I was watching something real or abstract. I was also kept in awe by the intricate and resplendent set- design which suggests something dark and Gothic is working the undercurrents. There are of course some serious girl on girl action but that never encroaches into the spine of the story.Adapting Sarah Waters' Fingersmith, a Victorian tale awash with all manner of Dickensian motifs, Park spins an engrossing tale that ebbs and flows with a Hitchcockian suspense; it withholds as much as it discloses; it is an erotic tale that beats with raw fervour. It is at once a love story but also a menagerie showcasing human beings in their vilest forms. Park's finger hovers over all the buttons, teasing us gleefully but it is with the ultimate restraint that he never descends down to the usual tropes. The story is divided into three chapters; each told from a different character's perspective. The structure is Rashomon-esque but Park puts his own stamp on it. The film may be nearly 2.5 hours but I hardly moved in my seat; my senses kept spellbound as each twist hits me hard. When it ended I couldn't believe 2.5 hours have whizzed by. The plot is pulsating and it never lets up. There is even an octopus in it! This is definitely the most perfect film I have seen this year. You may not agree with me but for me this is cinema of the masterclass level.It's sexy time!",The Handmaiden
89,spencergrande6,"Look on my works, ye Mighty and despair...for you don't get to touch",9,14 December 2016,"Breathtakingly gorgeous; every composition, from the settings, designs, costumes, to the music and the actors -- the entirety of the mise en scène -- is absolute perfection.A film of twists and turns that are earned because the plot works so well from scene to scene. You don't spend the entire film trying to outguess it but instead are so enraptured by it that it can take you by surprise.It's also a provocation, one that rides the line between exploitation and art quite daringly. You can justify good chunks of what happens in here, but maybe not all of it (or the extent of it). But taken as a cathartic release from the tyranny of a patriarchal society (and also the Japanese occupation of Korea, which is a subtext I won't pretend to completely understand) it is fitting and has its own brazen clarity.

91,quinimdb,The Handmaiden,9,16 December 2016,"This film is pretty insane. First it is a subversion of the characters' social classes. The maid is wise and supportive, and the handsome gentleman frees the naive and beautiful queen from her boring and superficial life. In its first part the film subverts this formula, then the second part of the film reveals a new layer of the first part, and each characters' motivations begin to unfold into a complex and involving romantic thriller with thematic depth.Visually, the film is incredible. Every shot feels meticulously controlled by Park Chan-wook. The color palette consistently matches the tone of the scene and the camera flows through each scene perfectly. There is a lot of sex in this film, but it's done tastefully and the cinematography in these scenes accurately depicts the passion of the characters.The music enhances every scene. The music in this film is amazing and gives the film the feel of an epic. The film builds slowly to start, but once it picks up it doesn't let up. The film is tightly written and involves several complex and intriguing characters participating in complex interpersonal relationships. The performances are fantastic across the board, and although I've only seen the film once I can tell it may be even better on repeat viewings.",The Handmaiden

For the rest, I found the film far too long with all these flashbacks, there is a time when I got lost in the story, so what bothered me the most and without being a prude, It was all these scenes more than erotic and quasi pornographic that irritated me, there was way to make a film simply erotic without being saturated by all these scenes far too daring that for me have spoiled the film, i am sure many have enjoyed these lesbian scenes, if i had wanted to see a porn, i would have tapped a believe me and i saw with the years, so the choice is not that the scenes shocked me in As such, was that they did not have to be so daring, in short, as their opinions are said to each one.

98,TheNabOwnzz,Disgusting bunch of irrelevant feminism propaganda,4,24 May 2018,"Chan-wook Park used to be such a great director, being the man behind the success of the fantastic 'Revenge trilogy' and most notably Oldboy (2003) as his ultimate masterpiece. Unfortunately The Handmaiden is not a masterpiece, just a bunch of blatant in your face social commentary.The problem lies not in the cinematography, which is top notch the entire film. It is visually beautiful, with great use of color and indoor cultural Asian scenery, and some fantastic costume design. The music is also a very good emotional piece as is usual in a Park film. However, the best parts end here. You could say that the complex multi layered non linear storyline is well structured narrative, but i disagree. It basically shows the same events two times from different angles and with a couple of scenes added to it that would otherwise have been a spoiler. The story is constantly twisting because of things that we couldn't see but there is not an ounce of refinement in it. ( That person wants to sell that one out for their own gain, now another person wants to sell that one out for their own gain, now two persons pair against another to sell that one out for their own gain ). This entire immoral construct never ends as there is little to none character development.All our four main characters are rotten to the core and this never changes throughout the film, yet somehow Park decides the two women are the good ones and the two guys are the bad ones? Such an incredibly lazy political message which is something that i would never have suspected from an artist such as Park, but it happened. The 'Count' ends up being the fall guy, for being dumb enough to not realize he is being deceived, which is hardly a surprise since men do not seem to realize anything at all in this film. The uncle is just a disgusting sadistic psychopath who also sees his downfall because of his own plain stupidity. The two women are not very likeable either, albeit in a more subtle way since their unlikeable nature is due to the fact that they only seem to care about money but all the while not showing their sadistic sides. The way the final events unfold is not a very subtle way of creating a kind of feministic statement that they cannot be pushed around by men.The erotic part of this film is absolutely utterly useless. There are numerous graphic sex scenes between the two women which do not enhance anything in this pretentious story but only seem to serve as a bunch of pornographic material good enough to get into the minds of those feeble minded and blind enough to like this film. Disgusting sexually oriented pictures and disgusting dialogue are constantly thrown at the viewer in order to gain the thumbs up only because of this pathetic form of pornographic flattery. It is a motion picture, which is supposed to be an artform, yet this is a mere disguise for the mindless pornographic nature of this film. I am fortunate enough to have a brain smart enough to not take the bait.It sure is pretty to look at, and might entertain those who want to see female nudity and simulated sex scenes between females, but for those smarter among us, this really is a poor excuse for a motion picture that is supposed to open our minds or make us better understand the human condition.",The Handmaiden

100,JimD73,The Handmaiden is extremely artful pulp,8,7 December 2016,"Non-English movie trailers will sometimes go very far out of their way to hide the fact that their film isn't in English. The trailer for Park Chan-wook's latest film, The Handmaiden, follows this tradition, and is incomprehensible as a result. It is, however, one of the most striking trailers of the year, and promises a pretty visually distinct piece of film. I'm happy to say that, while The Handmaiden is not what I expected based on the trailer alone, it lives up to that promise, marrying arresting film-making with a twisty narrative.Park Chan-wook's films, in a way, feel like a distant cousin of Quentin Tarantino's (who championed his breakout, Oldboy). The Handmaiden at it's best contains similar stylistic touches, such as denoted act breaks and nonlinear narratives, and it's plot certainly has a lot in common with Western con movies. Effectively, the movie concerns itself with the relationship between three characters in 1930s Japan- occupied Korea: wealthy isolated heiress Hideko, grifter posing-as-noble Fujiwara, and petty thief turned handmaid Sook-hee. Fujiwara enlists Sook-hee to be his eyes and ears as he tries to marry Hideko from under her abusive uncle's nose, but Sook-hee and Hideko soon find themselves drawn more towards each other. It's fun to watch it all unfold, although those expecting a mind-blowing twist in the vein of Oldboy may be let down; while the movie is quite far from traditional, its plot machinations are fairly traditional (although very engaging).What pushes the film up quite a bit is Park's style. Most of the film takes place in Hideko's mansion, which crosses English and Japanese architecture much like Park wears his English and Asian filmmaking influences on his sleeve. The movie threatens to be a haunted house flick briefly, and many times evokes Park's early Gothic drama Stoker. But Park and production designer Ryu Seong-hee give the film a vibe of its own, selling the oppressive opulence of Hideko's life. Moments of pitch-black humour help to cut the tension effectively, including the best noose gag ever filmed. Where Park's instincts falter a bit is when it seemingly exploits the Sook- hee/Hideko relationship for pure titillation value. To its credit, even the exploitation isn't without thematic relevance; a subset of characters in the movie are connoisseurs of artful smut, and the closing moments cement the idea that Park set out to make exactly that. But the narration and interaction sells the attraction between the two well enough, which leaves the explicit scenes feeling a bit superfluous.Even if a bit exploitative, The Handmaiden is a sharp, stylistic, and engaging piece of liar's fiction. It successfully creates a universe of its own and fills it with memorable images, characters, and moments. It has plenty of bite, but also an underlying sweetness that's a bit surprising from Park. I can't wait to watch it again.",The Handmaiden

Perhaps it is the fact that the story continues to surprise you and keep you on the edge with ever-new twists?

It's extremely engaging and shocking both narratively and visually. The acting, pacing, and visuals of the film were all fantastic. Each character was well defined and explored.This movie isn't perfect but it's pretty close to it. There are two things that come to mind which I think might fix it in my opinion. The first is a minor problem. At some point in the second half in the film, the camera freezes on each of the characters and fades to the next scene. It's the only scene where this happens, and I don't know why. It's jarring and unnecessary as far as I'm concerned.The second is in the structure. For the first half of the movie we're lead to believe that Sook-Hee is conning Lady Hideko at the behest of Count Fujiwara. We then realize that Fujiwara and Hideko had conned Sook-Hee. This definitely caught me off guard, especially since I had grown to expect Sook-Hee to help Hideko because she had fallen in love with her. The problem arises soon after this, when we learn that Hideko was actually conning Sook-Hee with Fujiwara. This isn't a major problem, I only think that this realization should've been saved for the end of the film.Anyways, I'd absolutely recommend this movie. It's one of the best thrillers I've seen come out in quite a long time.",The Handmaiden

Park Chan-yu may not want to discuss the depravity of human nature, but just wants to show his life and have the right to pursue happiness. In essence, this is not a feminist movie nor a LGBT topic. It is purely cross-class love, but it happens to be the same sex. The whole film is in a tight rhythm.

115,Pramitheus,The chime of the bells,8,9 November 2016,"To be honest I have seen only film of Park chan wook and that is the masterpiece, Oldboy. This movie is set in a different era and beautifully captured. Full of sexuality and mystery, The Handmaiden is how a erotic thriller should be made. The Hindi film industry, especially should take notes. So let's go into details.STORY - The story is of a family of con-men and forgers who are planning to con a very wealthy family for a huge sum of money. Lady Hideko, who is the heir to all the wealth is set to marry her uncle, because, well he is the only person she knows and he is greedy. This con-man poses as a Count in an attempt to woo her, make her fall in love and then elope. Fearing that he can't do it alone, he brings in one of his accomplices to be her handmaiden so that she could keep coaxing Hideko to fall in love with the Count. An unexpected turn of events, sets the plans of each of the characters onto a different trajectory. I don't want to blurt out the plot because that will just ruin the twist. The characters are well built and I as an audience had a love-hate relationship with each of them because none of them were exactly white and black. Everyone had shades of grey, and it was fun to watch how these characters used their wit to outsmart each other. Sook-hee and Hideko, both come for dark pasts but still, it wasn't easy to root for them. The uncle, Kouzuki was just plain evil. I mean he hits a kid with metal balls. Come on.DIRECTION - Park chan wook took a huge risk to keep an erotic thriller at a run-time of over 2 hours. It was risky, but it paid off. He took his time building the characters, not rushing in any one the three chapters, so that when the final twist came, you wouldn't feel like it was a cop-out of some sort. Even though the ending can be expected after the first twist, but the length of the movie that is left after the first twist did produce a sense of doubt. The best performance is of course by the title character, Sook-hee. She portrays the funny, innocent yet deceiving person that she is. I felt that the actress for Hideko, was a bit bland. I would have loved to see her portray some more expressions when the camera was pointed just at her. As I said, Jin Woong-jo who played Kouzuki didn't have much space to do anything other than playing the usual tropes of a villain. I absolutely loved the arc of Count Fujiwara. The thing that I loved most, was the little shots in between which showed a sudden burst of emotion. Almost like a darker version of Edgar Wright's method of shooting such scenes.CINEMATOGRAPHY - The whole movie felt like a beautiful painting. The colours were rich. Not a single scene had a wrong choice of colour. Many movies show very brutal scenes under sunlight and that kind of decreases the intensity. Here the feel was captured so beautifully. Even when the same scene was shown at different points of the movie, you could notice the difference. When the same story was being shown from the POV of different characters, the exact same scene had a different feel. It was a delight for the eyes. Chung-hoo Chung struck a beautiful balance between outdoor and indoor shots. It was very important because one wrong palette and the whole mystery would have vanished.FINAL VERDICTS - Well, to be honest I was expecting a bizarre ending like Oldboy but I wasn't disappointed because what I saw was a masterpiece. Even though the two twists, for me, felt not so realistic. Certainly worth a watch. I advise you to not go expecting loads of sex because even though there is a lot of it, the setting of those scenes can make you feel really uncomfortable.",The Handmaiden
116,Dibyayan_Chakravorty,One of the Biggest Snub at the Oscars,8,27 March 2020,Watched the Extended Cut. The cinematography and production design is quite charming. Great performance by the leading actress duo. Definitely a big snub at the Oscars that year.,The Handmaiden
117,rblenheim,A visually beautiful erotic masterpiece from South Korea's brilliant Park Chan-wook,10,5 March 2017,"South Korea has produced some of the world's most creative and exciting works of cinema since the century began, and Park Chan-wook (of ""Oldboy"" and ""Thirst"" fame) is one of its most acclaimed filmmakers. Still, knowing that, nothing prepared me for ""The Handmaiden"", unquestionably Park's masterpiece to date, and even perhaps the finest film to ever come out of that country.Born and raised in Seoul, Park was determined to be an art critic until his first viewing of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" which dictated the rest of his life. In 2013, Park actually made a twisted, stylized loose remake of Hitchcock's ""Shadow of a Doubt' (called ""Stoker"" with Nicole Kidman, his only English language film) but whereas that movie was somewhat inconsistent albeit visually lush, ""The Handmaiden"" is perfectly realized, the framing of every shot and the rhythm of its pacing fully controlled in structure and tone, and executed with such an exquisite sense of visual beauty in its production design, costumes and cinematography (as well as the aesthetic beauty of its cast) that virtually every frame of this film could be hung on the wall of an art museum.Adapted from Fingersmith, a Welsh novel by Sarah Waters, the film is set in the Japan-occupied South Korea of the 1930s as if its characters and setting had been lifted out of Henry James' Victorian England. Divided into a three-part structure, it tells of a handmaiden hired to a young Japanese heiress who lives a secluded life on a large Dickensian estate with her dominating Uncle -- but the intricate plot that develops has more twists than a Philadelphia pretzel, with scheming and swindling, double-crossings and betrayal, as well as explicit lesbian sex (and a small dose of shocking violence). What makes it all so engrossing is the three-part construct which allows its events to double back on themselves (a la Quentin Tarantino), keeping viewers constantly off balance as new twists become slowly revealed like layers falling off in the peeling of an onion. All of this is in the service of a high class, richly poetic work of cinematic art, one that is as intelligent and sophisticated as it is intense and erotic, a film displaying no less than the most gorgeous images of the year in cinema. Not to be missed.(One added note: I was lucky enough to view a special extended director's cut of this film in an art cinema which ran 167 minutes, adding 23 minutes to the theatrical 144-minute version. Although much of the additional footage was of totally explicit sexual activity, these scenes were shot with such taste and poetic beauty that it was never exploitative or offensive, to this viewer anyway. Both cuts are equally recommended -- the regular theatrical version more of a thriller; the longer one more of a romance.)",The Handmaiden
118,aboiement,2018-12-23,8,21 January 2019,This is a movie without flying plots and you don't feel bored at all for the entire movie. Many layers of deceptions from different views. Worth watching for not only one time. There are tons of forums talking about this and mentioned that this is based on a TV series of BBC. Now I'm curious about that TV series.,The Handmaiden
119,artmania90,An overlooked masterpiece.,10,16 January 2017,"THE HANDMAIDEN is a great film. It seems to glow with creativity and beauty with each new scene, and during the entirety of its over 2 hour run time I found myself entranced by a slow-churning mystery that left me once again excited by the craft a good movie can make appear so easy.The film is a South Korean production helmed by director Chan-wook Park, known mostly in America as the director of 'Oldboy.' People often say that foreign films demonstrate a higher quality in comparison to the stuff of Hollywood; that stories are daring and the craft is not as pressured by executives who would rather turn a profit than make something truly substantial. Did they ever get it right.The movie is a period piece that is lush in costumes and sets. Each new shot paints a picture on the screen that simply pulls one into the world of South Korea in the 1930's. The cinematography, a lush landscape of vibrant hues and meticulous staging, keeps us engaged as though by hypnotism. The story follows three people, each scheming in their own right, telling the audience information that might only be a passing thought in their mind. In the simplest form, the story is of a conman who hopes to rob a wealthy woman (Lady Hideko) of her inheritance by feigning love with her and posing as a Count. Once married, he will find her mentally unsound and throw her in a mental institution, leaving him to bask in a newfound fortune. In order to make the most of his plan, he sends a maid (another con artist named Sook-Hee) to infiltrate the Lady's home and gain information and insight into the mind of the woman.The film opens with a scene of forgers and thieves who meet to hear the ""Count's"" plan. He runs a business of sorts, forging money, legal papers, and jewelry. He promises them a cut of the fortune assuming they can help pass himself off as a man of means. Sook- Hee, for her troubles, is promised $50,000 and a new wardrobe once Hideko is institutionalized. She is a simple girl, illiterate, but the prospects are insatiable.In the night, she takes a car ride down the coastline to the estate of Lady Hideko, a grand estate built in two parts: one half designed as though an English mansion, and another half in traditional Japanese style. It's truly East meets West, and the blatant metaphor of clashing cultures and ideas only becomes more potent as the story progresses.Lady Hideko lives on the estate with her elderly uncle, a man who uses an ink pen so fervently that his tongue is stained black. He is a collector of antique literature and texts which are entirely erotic in nature, and uses Hideko to recite the texts to potential buyers who frequent the mansion in hopes of bidding on what is essentially pornography. We learn about her past, raised by her Uncle in a disciplinarian manner, losing her aunt to a suicide as a child, and an eternal fear of ever leaving the confines of the estate. For Sook- Hee, the innocent maid come to spy on her, it might already seem like a mental institute is not too far off.As these two women begin to know each other, they become friendly, with Hideko using Sook-Yee to model her clothes and confine dark secrets in the privacy of her room. Sook- Yee, who sees the potential wealth she will soon inherit, seems hypnotized by the beauty of her boss, and in some of the most beautiful moments of glances and gestures, we can see a dark romance forming between the two women.The story is broken up into three parts, and to venture in even discussing the array of twists and turns would do no favors to the structure of the story, so expertly-written and brilliant that at any one time we may have flashbacks within flashbacks told simply to act as footnote to a line of dialogue or interpret the actions of a character. Never are we lost or in over our heads; this is a masterpiece of story and style. In fact, Part 2 nearly replays the entire first act of the film but through the perspective of an entirely different character. Scenes are repeated in their entirety and yet the insight we gain only leads towards understanding of the next moment, and the next...The movie is based on an English crime novel called ""Fingersmith,"" and we can see how this story could easily be (at first glance) a serial crime novel with a predictable plot. The story is tense at times and deeply erotic at others, showing these two women in moments of ultimate vulnerability and strength, sometimes in the same instance. I would expect many audience members to be offput by the graphic nature of several scenes, and yet I can do nothing but praise the artistic endeavors to use sex on film as a means to tell an emotional story.The Academy Awards have created a shortlist of potential nominees for Best Foreign Film, a list that does not include 'The Handmaiden' (South Korea instead nominated a film called 'The Age of Shadows'). It's a shame that a movie as wonderful as this could be looked over, even if by technicality that a country needs to pick one film only to represent it. The soundtrack is haunting, the story compelling, the look is heavenly. I know I will see many more films as the Fall rolls along, and yet I know that when I come to make a list of my favorite films of the year, this is now the one to beat.",The Handmaiden
120,BlissQuest,Lavish but lackluster,7,15 October 2016,"About halfway through watching this this film, I kept thinking of ""Blue in the Warmest Color"" (2013) and that's not a good sign, in my opinion. A good film is supposed to keep its audience engaged, not have the audience thinking about something else, let alone another film. And I guess that's one of the reasons I was reluctant to give it a higher score. I also found myself struggling to enjoy the film within the first 30 minutes. Actually, I was dozing off, yet another not-so-good indicator. The acting of both female leads (or co-leads)was top notch. I couldn't say the same for the 2 male characters, Jung-woo Ha and Jin-woong Jo. I've seen both of them in other films, where they gave much better performances, so I guess it was a question of chemistry or miscasting. Or maybe I was just subconsciously biased because of the intense female sexuality in the plot. Either way, I wasn't convinced by the male characters. On a positive note, the production was impeccable (almost too perfect) and the twist in the story definitely resuscitated my attention halfway through. All in all, based on my rating, this is not a bad film, but I guess I would tell anyone who wanted to see this to make sure they lower their expectations; that way, they'll definitely enjoy it more than I did!",The Handmaiden

But mystery combined with feminism gives a really interesting movie to enjoy. I really have not seen much similar stories in present movies.Main Actress,Tomako has done a great work with her acting .She has allowed emotions to be flowed from her facial gestures and viewers will be at very ease when watching her actions. Because they are so expressive and vocal. Hodeko , the second lead actress does a poor job. She is keeping some part of emotions in her self without wholeheartedly spilling it out. Its a fundamental issue she should avoid. Lead Actor ,Mr.Count should have done a better role and he is depending the acting of two actresses for his brilliance. That way is not the correct way.Nudity is used with care in the film with a purpose.Nudity is not inserted to attract people because of its nude content.It should be praised.Locations are really attractive but too much details.

123,johnny-89987,poor film,1,29 July 2021,"I saw this movie because of the old boy movie directed by the same director. But after watching this movie, what I expected did not come true at all. This film only has beautiful images thanks to good filming, but in terms of narration and content, a lot is trivial and low level. Especially for people who have seen a lot of movies. I easily guessed the end of the movie and I'm sure many other people did the same, and this shows how weak and clichéd the script is, and this is not a good script at all. I also feel that the director deliberately put his hand on this lesbian story inspired by the hottest blue movie so that he can win the Palme d'Or like that movie, but in practice he has not succeeded. In general, he was not at the level of an old boy at all. So do not expect a masterpiece from this movie.",The Handmaiden

127,clg238,Pornography and an Over-the-top Plot,4,30 October 2016,"It's pornography (including sadism) interwoven with an intricate, silly plot--if this intrigues you, fine! I had trouble with the absurd set-up to the film, which is (and feels) way too long because the graphic sex scenes are virtually endless. There are three points-of-view, and the film invariably slips out of POV from time to time. That said, the settings, costumes and cinematography. are absolutely gorgeous, as are the female actors. Except for a twist or two, the film goes nowhere and is about nothing. The Korean and Japanese dialogue (as translated) often sounds like a cross between what one would find in a romance novel and hard-core pornography--breathless, over-the-top, no pretense of being remotely realistic. Nevertheless, the reviews have been extremely positive and the people in the audience when I attended seemed really to like this film--I am hard-pressed to understand why. While the characters in the movie are lusting for each other, and making an all-out effort to titillate viewers, I hunger for a story that has character development and a journey worth traveling.",The Handmaiden

Sex scenes are very weird and not sexy in any way.",The Handmaiden
129,reid-hawk,Graphically Beautiful,9,25 December 2016,"Chan Woo Park's ""The Handmaiden"" is a fantastic film that borders on being a masterpiece. From a film making perspective alone, both its cinematography and editing are incredible (and I don't use that word lightly). As of this moment this is the best shot film of the year. The shots are gorgeous and the camera work is fantastic; the camera always seems to move to the perfect angle at the perfect time to maximize the quality of each and every scene. Lots of times the movie jumps out of chronological order rapidly between scenes. These scenes never feel hard to follow and they always transition into each other beautifully. By showing moments of the film out of order (as well as some scenes multiple times from different viewpoints), the movie allows the viewer to glean new information about the characters and the story. And yes, the story is also very good and filled with deep characters and twists at every turn. ""The Handmaiden"" is definitely not a good first rated-R movie to show your kids, however. In fact, maybe only ""The Wolf of Wallstreet"" rivals this movie when it comes to the sheer graphicness of nudity and sex scenes (besides NC-17 films of course and much of Lars Von Triers work). What I love about the sex scenes besides the fact that they're, you know, hot sex scenes, is that they aren't there just help somebody feel the blood flow down low. They actually serve a purpose; both to the story and to the development of the film's major characters (They do have some nasty and loud a** licking sounds going on in them that I can't say I'm a fan of however). The other graphic aspect of this movie is its violence. This movie isn't overly violent, and in fact there are only a handful (this is a pretty good pun if you've seen the movie) of scenes with any brutality in them whatsoever, but trust me when I say those scenes aren't for the faint of heart. The movie's blackly comical nature helps negate lots of the more disturbing aspects of these moments as well. Park has made his best movie to date in my opinion, and it goes without saying that I love ""The Handmaiden"".",The Handmaiden

134,dokrauss,Bells Are Ringing,10,25 November 2016,"The Handmaiden is a Korean movie based on the English novel Fingersmith. I've always understood a fingersmith to be a Dickensian pickpocket or someone else similarly light-fingered, but, apparently, the term is also a popular one with the LGBTQ community. You could use your imagination to figure out why but the movie saves you the trouble.This is a double cross of a double cross, with the 'fingersmiths' of the title attempting to pull a con on the young, naïve, and fabulously rich Lady Hideko (played by Min-Hee Kim who is oh-my-God beautiful), whose uncle wants to marry her. What? Yes, the oh-my-God horrid Uncle Kouzuki (played by  Jin-woong Jo) intends to wed the Lady, his niece, in order to inherit her fortune, which he needs in order to pursue rare 14th Century Japanese pornography texts. What? Yes, 14th Century Japanese pornography. Quite rare. Quite explicit, and quite priceless to a small but very degenerate group of Japanese businessmen in occupied Korea during the early 20th Century.The fingersmiths, local Koreans, hatch a plot for a fake member of Japanese nobility named Count Fujiwara (played by Jung-woo Ha) to sweep in and offer the Lady a chance to escape by eloping with the good Count to Japan, taking her fortune with her, naturally. After about a week of marriage, commit her to a nuthouse, make off with the cash, life is goodso how's a Korean going to pull off Japanese nobility? Eh. Not at issue, because the uncle is a Korean, too, who is turning Japanese oh yes he's turning Japanese I really think so. It's a thing.So, in order to pull this improbable plot off, the Count gets a member of his fingersmith gang to pose as the Lady's handmaiden of the title and urge the Lady to accept the Count's suit. But the handmaiden, Sook-Hee (played by Tae-Ri Kim. No relation. I think) is not only a fingersmith of the Dickensian connotation but also of the LGBTQ one (figured it out yet?) and falls head over heels with the Lady, which I can understand because she is oh-my-God beautiful and so innocent and pure and naïve andNo she ain't.And this is where the double cross of the double cross comes in, which I don't want to say very much more on because it is dee- lightful. In more ways than one, especially when bells are ringing.What?Go see for yourself.And be prepared. Because, hoo boy, you'll be treated to some excellent exhibitions of 14th Century Japanese pornographic techniques not once, not twice, but at least five times. In detail. And bordering just this side of an X-rating. You'll wish the director, Chan-wook Park of Old Boy fame, had added six or seven more examples. But I guess you'll just have to watch the movie again.

136,ryandannar,"A strange, twisted, beautiful ride, from the director of ""Oldboy.""",7,20 November 2016,"Up front, you should know that ""The Handmaiden"" is a crazy film, the work of an immensely talented -- and seriously depraved -- artist. That artist would be Park Chan-wook, the Korean director of the already- classic ""Oldboy,"" as well as the recent English-language ""Stoker.""Park Chan-wook seems to enjoy peeling back the layers of normal people and recognizable situations until, layer by layer, things turn darker, kinkier, and infinitely more surreal than we could have imagined at the film's outset. He's very good at this. His films are tense but often funny affairs, with the pacing of thrillers. His camera lingers on beautiful images but also on acts of graphic violence, as if to juxtapose the two. He lures us in with stories which feature a simple, seductive setup -- and then reveals that nothing is what it seems.I'm not the guy's biggest fan, but I've grown to admire his films over the years. He is quite a visual artist, and his movies are often so singular -- at once immeasurably accomplished and completely inexplicable -- that their very uniqueness justifies their existence.""The Handmaiden"" is a Gothic-romance and an erotic thriller, set in 1930s Japan-occupied Korea. A beautiful young pickpocket, Sooki, is hired by a fake Count, Fujiwara, to become the handmaiden of his rich benefactor's niece, Hideko. The rich benefactor, who is Hideko's uncle by marriage, expects to marry her soon, in order to claim her inheritance as his own -- after which, he plans to send her away to a madhouse. Fujiwara enlists Sooki to help him win Hideko's affections, so that he can essentially do the same. Nobody is who they seem to be, everybody has a hidden agenda, and when Sooki and Hideko actually seem to be falling in love, we have to wonder whether it's true, or whether they're both acting for the other's benefit?The film is neatly divided into 3 parts. Part 1 has us thinking we've figured things out, until Part 2 revisits the same story from a different perspective, and has us questioning everything we learned in Part 1. Part 3 resolves the film.It's a strange, twisted, beautiful ride. I honestly feel like I need to watch it a second time, in order to better understand everything that happened. It's so densely-plotted that I fear I only understand the basic outline. I'm guessing that a second time through would increase my appreciation of the film's artistry, as it did for ""Oldboy."" Certainly worthwhile, especially for fans of Park Chan-wook's other films, and for fans of Korean cinema in general.

His idea: The lady shall fall in love with him, and after the marriage he will put her in an asylum. The pickpocket Sook-hee, disguised as a handmaiden, is meant to influence Hideko. Fujiwara, Hideko and Sook-hee entangle themselves in a web of liaisons and intrigues ...""The Handmaiden"" by Park Chan-wook is the riveting tale of a love triangle, where nothing is as it seems. It's disturbing, humorous, erotic, suspenseful and cryptic - a treat for everyone enjoying weird and original cinema. Park Chan-wook is well known for his movies dealing with themes such as violence, perversion and insanity. ""The Handmaiden"" might be his most excellent effort to date, even surpassing the powerful revenge thriller ""Oldboy"" (2003), which is a bit too erratic and over the top. This movie however has a clear vision and a much more subtle approach, masterfully playing with the expectations of its audience and twisting the story several times.This movie is about men forcing their sexual fantasies on women: Hideko is forced to read grubby texts to a male audience and to perform strange BDSM aerobatics. The only way she can escape this perverted world is through lesbian love, which culminates in one of the most awe-inspiring sex scenes I've ever seen. Park's depiction of sexuality is subversive, as there seems to be no escape from male fantasies no matter what. (And not just because Park is a male director.) There's some really interesting subtext going on here, but that doesn't mean that ""The Handmaiden"" is just pretentious gibberish. No, it tells an entertaining and engaging story as well, all while looking gorgeous. The humour is pretty great, too: There are many laugh out loud scenes. (Yeah, there might be some penis jokes in this.)With ""The Handmaiden"", Park Chan-wook proves that he's still one of the most exciting directors in contemporary cinema. His vision is artistic and daring, light-footed and sexy, captivating and beautiful. It's a brutal thriller, a sentimental drama and an erotic romance all at once. A truly original movie.

It takes the best aspects of your favorite films and directors and puts it into a deliciously show stopping package. It is the sharp societal commentary of Parasite. The creativity and absurdity of Oldboy. The fun of Tarantino. The shock of a Fincher film.The film is shot gorgeously. The cinematographer had an absolute field day putting the shots together for this. The set design is immaculate. The writing is witty but easy to follow for someone reading subtitles. The colors of the film are a little uninspired but particular scenes looked absolutely fantastical.Without spoiling the plot of the film, I will say that the plot is mostly classical, although the execution is masterpiece level creative. It is an absolute joy to watch even when the next 10 minutes are spelled out for you.The pacing is fantastic, although the film slows down significantly just after the halfway point. This isn't necessarily a problem, as this lowered momentum is used as set up time for the closing act.If nothing else, this film has some ICON scenes that took me straight to my core. These are scenes like ""luke, I am your father"" or the end of the usual suspects which make us love cinema.Park has shown that he is one of the greatest in the world at his craft.",The Handmaiden
142,kastenmeier-andreas,More accessible than Oldboy,9,27 July 2017,"After the success of Oldboy, Park Chan-Wook made fine but not as great movies in his stylish way of filmmaking; i always described as Tarantino if he was Asian and would understand their culture and weirdness. Don't get me wrong i really like 'Lady Vengeance', 'Thirst' and 'Stoker' but in comparison they felt flat. Now Chan-Wook slightly changed his style and made a more accessible movie for the general audience, but at the same time a great movie.'The Handmaiden' is clever, well constructed, full of great characters and in a strange but understandable way erotic. Especially, the two female characters showed a great range of emotions and acting skill in this movie. I most admit after the first big turn in the story of the movie, i expected the way the story would play out in the end. But this didn't stop the stylish and nice way the story was told.Even if you are not familiar wit Oldboy or Asian cinema, go watch this movie you will at least like it.",The Handmaiden

It's paced to perfection - As the secrets are gradually revealed; the viewer is brought back to key moments with a new point of view. The film is sensual, but never gratuitous. The two lead actresses give brave yet delicate performances. It doesn't quite reach the unique heights of 'Oldboy' - but still another supreme achievement for director Park Chan-wook.",The Handmaiden

It covered the whole spectrum of human emotion: Lust, love, hate, vicious moral decay, and all matters of perversion. And all presented in such a raw and passionate intensity, always keeping you on your toes. And I haven't even stared gushing about the cinematography - simply breathtaking, from start to finish. I quite liked Stoker, but not as much as Oldboy, which was fantastic. But Handmaiden has been my favorite work from visionary director Park Chank-Wook so far. Cannot wait to see what he will baffle us with next.",The Handmaiden

151,BrendanMichaels,Blue is the Warmest Color + Oldboy = The Handmaiden,10,10 August 2016,"Not the craziest film content wise, that award goes to The Neon Demon, but definitely the craziest film storytelling wise. Park Chan-Wook's The Handmaiden is almost as good as the film that put him on the map, Oldboy, and brings such ferocity and energy that it will be one of the most unforgettable films of 2016. Think of The Handmaiden as The Duke of Burgundy F'd Up Edition. This film is pretty twisted in the most unexpected ways from the cinematography that is very reminiscent of Possession in that it always keeps moving, eroticism that is reminiscent of Blue is the Warmest Color, performances as spellbinding as Carol, and the insanity of Park Chan- Wook as expected. The cinematography is some of the most entrancing of the year. Shots that look like they came out of The Master. It's shots like these that make me wonder how was this even possible? It looks so damn cool!The performances are perfect in sucking you into this world of erotica, selfishness, and trickery. Both female leads were fantastic. Min-hee Kim and Kim Tae-ri are amazing with sharing their sexual tension with the audience watching. It's films like these that are the most memorable. Making you feel how ther characters are feeling. Jung-woo Ha and Jin- woong Jo were great as these sexually and financially repressed men who do the most screwed up things to feel the pleasure they so desire. Nothing wrong with the cast at all. Of course Park Chank-Wook hits it out of the part with directing. How else would this immaculate vision be done without him niche for detail. He always knows exactly what to do to get an emotion out of his audience and I applaud him for that. The only negative is that during the middle briefly the pacing slows down a lot and it became really unbearable because I wanted to know exactly what was going to happen next. Thankfully it doesn't last that long and it's really minor that probably won't affect others viewings. If you have any interest in The Handmaiden or you've just heard about it for the first time I strongly suggest checking this out as soon as it comes out. I'll definitely re watch it when it releases in theaters. Easily one of the best films of the year and one I hope to re watch soon.",The Handmaiden
152,sese19,Visually Stunning,9,9 May 2021,"The scenery in this movie is beyond beautiful. I admired its every second, it's a visual feast. Cinematography is amazing. Apart from these, I loved how this very long movie was divided into three parts thanks to which the viewers can see each character's aspect. This makes the movie quite engaging, I didn't get bored for a second during over 2.5 hours. Acting is good, directing is phenomenal (Park Chan Wook!) and the story is so creative and different. An elegant and classy masterpiece.",The Handmaiden
153,soph_ia,Not just a period drama about lesbians,9,24 October 2016,"My impression of this film prior to watching it was 'Lesbian Period Drama'. I was pleased to see that 'The Handmaiden' is not just that.'The Handmaiden' is a movie about con men and it unwraps itself as one. The viewer feels conned as layers of the story are further removed. We are given just the right amount of information not to be confused, without revealing the plot. The thing people anticipated the most about this film were the sex scenes and, given the very nature and story of the film, they couldn't be missing. They were nicely done; just the right amount of erotic without making it a porno. In fact, although the movie includes one (I guess two?) pretty graphic sex scenes, the camera strays from the characters' pubic area. The only genitals shown in the movie are pictures or props. As a period drama lover, I was delighted by the film's aesthetics. It creates a nice mixture between the east and the west of that time. Most importantly, it looked authentic.",The Handmaiden
154,nikhilmanahs,In love with the Handmaiden,10,26 March 2017,"It's expected that your mind will be blown when you are watching a Park Chan Wook. But boy did this movie blew me away. Am I still in awe of it. With lots of twists sometimes movies become boring and feels that the writer is trying too hard but no not this one. Everything falls in it's place perfectly. The style of story telling with non-linear narrative lends it a fitting way to convey the story. All the actors are stupendous, couldn't have played their part any better. Specially the Handmaiden, for me it was love at the first sight. Her innocence, beauty and smile took my heart away. Similarly the Lady Hideko played her part with utmost perfection . The Villains also come out and deliver a perfect performance. Talking about cinematography ; it is picture perfect, the color combination sometimes remind one of Wes Anderson . The Music too is crafted in a suitable manner and makes it more emotionally charged and gives it a strong feel. I usually don't just praise a movie but point out what I thought was missing but sorry this time there is nothing I think about. If you want to see a sensual, dramatic, unpredictable movie this is perfect treat for you. They don't make it like this anymore.",The Handmaiden

158,jeffrymiranda-25858,A very refined and directed movie,8,12 January 2018,"This is all about greediness and its betrayal. During the first part of this movie, it kind of doesn't make any sense; however, during the second part is when things start to get way better. I have to though that even though some of the translations in English are sometimes grammatically incoherent, one, as a viewer can still infer or grasp the message. The softness of language in this movie, draws you more into the setting, atmosphere and characters. On the other hand, the acting skills shown by all of their actors and actresses are simply flawless and amazing. I don't what is it about these asian actors that they don't overplay nor fall into too much screaming or cheesy acting. This is something else!I highly recommend this movie to understand better the depths of our most innate human emotions and nature.",The Handmaiden
159,Regerreellle,Well worth a watch,9,22 May 2020,"The Handmaiden contains multitudes: It's a sumptuous romantic period piece, as well as a sexy spy thriller, replete with secret identities and triple-crosses. It's an extended commentary on Japan's occupation of Korea in the 1930s, and it's an intense piece of psychological horror from one of the masters of the genre, Park Chan-wook. But more than anything, The Handmaiden is just pure cinema, a dizzying, disturbing fable of love and betrayal that piles on luxurious imagery, while never losing track of its story's human core. For Park, the Korean director of crossover genre hits like Old Boy and Thirst, the movie feels like an evolutionary leap forward in an already brilliant career.",The Handmaiden
160,yusufkaanatanur,A Sharp Picture,7,5 April 2021,"A very sharp picture. Loved the way it conveyed and made us notice tension where it wasn't the ""in your face"" kind. Using smaller side plots, twists and emotions that act as release valves throughout the film rather than a final release of tension is something this film does. While this looks all too nice at first, it puts the pace of the story in an awkward position when there is no final kick to end it all. The visuals were good but at most scenes they weren't that special. Really liked how the director told us the story in a way that it moved on our reactions. While this is good for the first couple of twists and turns, it hinders the story when the audience gets tired on the long run. The whole film felt more like an American Classic, like the Great Gatsby, in its Storytelling rather than a Japanese drama at first but it slowly turned sour as the story commenced. The whole love and death theme was also well-done. The most highly noticeable thing that I don't like is probably the timing of the themes. In this matter, some are underdone and raw while others are overdone and burnt. This is caused by the far too many turns arcs in the story. Good watch overall.",The Handmaiden
161,afredlee,Okay but so much overated comment. This does not deserve an 8,5,25 September 2018,The plot is quite interesting with a bit of twist. It tells the story from 2 perspective.

162,s_nico7,Park Chan-wook always delivers,9,26 March 2017,"As an unconditional Park Chan-wook fan i was very eager to see the Handmaiden and i was not disappointed. It tells a story of a maid who agrees (alongside a con artist) to work for a young woman who is about to inherit a substancional amount of money and at the same time brainwash her to marry the con artist so he can put the young woman in a mental facility and get the fortune for himself, and a small portion of money for the maid of course. But the plan goes sour when the maid starts to develop feelings for the young woman and regrets what she's doing to her. It's a wonderful movie, but when the second part of the story starts its when things really begin to heat up and then you can clearly see that this is truly a Park Chan-Wook film that it's not far from he's master piece ""vengeance trilogy"". Without spoil ling to anyone the ending myth surprise some of the die-hard fans of Park's early work because it's a different end from the rest of he's movies, but don't get me wrong it's a perfect end it's just a 180º from what i was expecting.

The two actresses did a fabulous performance from the very beginning to the end. No unnatural behavior. I was completely convinced by their acting. The pace, the tense, the emotion and the atmosphere are all perfect en every chapter. From the story to screen play, everything make sense at the end. All details are part of the big puzzle. Also, the film has a spirit of the Korean and Japanese culture. The clash between the two. A story about man and woman, business and love, rational and emotional, oppress and resist.

166,sossevarvo,Sublime cinema - like Hithcock with the extremity of Oldboy and the sexual candour of Blue is the Warmest Colour.,10,22 July 2016,"I consider Park Chan-Wook to be among the greats of cinema, alongside Scorsese, Tarantino, Fellini, Truffaut, Coppola, Tarkovsky and Nolan. So I had huge expectations going in, and boy, they were met.TheHandmaiden is a masterpiece in pretty much every sense. It is visually exquisite, Costumes, production design, cinematography, music, all combine to create a lush vision of Japan-occupied Korea in the 1930s. Park Chan-Wook is a visually meticulous filmmaker and no film so far of his has showcased his knack for visual storytelling better than the Handmaiden. I went into this film totally blind, which I honestly recommend all people doing, because the plot itself unfolds in such a beautifully engineered fashion.My best description of the film is a Rebecca-like Hitchcockian thriller with the extremity and depravity of films like Oldboy and Battle Royale, and the humanistic sexuality of Blue is the Warmest Colour. All actors are stunning in this film. The two women share an honest, tender romance that is both passionate and moving, with a refreshing candour about the nature of sexuality that is almost never seen in Hollywood productions. The Count is an incredibly charismatic performer who remains appealing despite his many despicable acts.But as always with a Park Chan-Wook film, the real star is the director himself. The way in which this story is crafted is nothing short of engrossing. The outrageous, depraved, sexy, fascinating plot is crafted through multiple perspectives, dashing across back and forth in time, to masterfully reveal key plot points across a never less than spellbinding two hour run time. Some would say the film is slow, but I felt as though the extended running time worked in the film's favour, in order to build character to the extent that the finale for the film feels momentously epic, a real feat considering the movie showcases only four key characters.I was utterly engrossed by this beautifully made film.",The Handmaiden
167,mannacio,Sex Still Sells,4,7 November 2016,"It it preposterous that, at the time of this review, The Handmaiden had an 8.1 rating on IMDb which would make it the equal of such films as: The Wizard of Oz, The Grapes of Wrath, the Best Years of our Lives and Annie Hall. And that would rank it higher than Shane, The African Queen, The Searchers, and Sophie's Choice. All of the aforementioned films are among the top 100 films of all time, according to the AFI. Nor was this movie overrated by one demographic group.This movie did not have an MPAA rating but would certainly have deserved an X rating with the number of explicit sexual scenes. None of this would matter if the sexuality needed to be so explicit to advance the plot. It didn't.There are movies which are fundamentally about a sexual relationship, and are honest about it, such as The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover or the Last Tango in Paris. One should expect THESE films to be quite explicit. The Handmaiden is NOT such a film. There IS a story being told and EVEN THOUGH the father is quite depraved it is not necessary to exploit this in telling the story. In fact, it is a diversion from the telling of the main story line.So why was the story told in this way? The answer is clear: sex sells. It even sold a substantial number of those who reviewed the film at IMDb. Amazon appears to have mastered the use of the sensational. Now it is true that there is some excellent cinematography, but that cannot redeem this film.Clearly, a film goer cannot depend on IMDb or even on the combined ratings of the critics to find worthy entertainment. More caution is required.",The Handmaiden

At its core, a movie not entirely about revenge but about catharsis, with great attention to both detail and symbolism, The Handmaiden, to me, is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever watched. Park Chan Wook hardly disappoints, but this underrated gem is truly a piece of art. The chemistry and dedication between the two main characters, Hideko and Sook-hee, is incredible.""My savior who came to ruin my life"" is something I will never forget.

172,udongexmyon,Another masterpiece of Korean cinema,9,14 July 2021,"In 2003, Park Chan Wook took the world of cinema by storm with his masterpiece Oldboy. Thirteen years later, he shows how much he's improved.In structure, The Handmaiden is a perfect film, not wasting a single second of its runtime. The director is in full control, only showing the audience exactly what he intends to show.Films, and all media by extension are an endless conversation between the medium and the audience. The role of the one presenting said medium is to manipulate the fourth wall so that the messages become muddled. The audience is left questioning the director's intentions, the things unsaid, the missing information. This precisely describes the experience of watching The Handmaiden, a film that carefully weaves together its various plot threads to one of the most satisfying sequences in recent cinema.The only major issue with the film - and none due to any fault in the film's part - is its use of language as an integral plot device. Audiences who are not fluent in Korean will not be able to have quite the same experience with the film.Though unfortunate circumstances around the film has prevented it from reaching similar acclaim to Parasite, this is another masterpiece of Korean cinema that should not be overlooked.",The Handmaiden

I was really interested right from the start and the movie was moving into right directions, but then it started to fall apart. A lot was happening and the story was becoming less and less believable. That's the risk you take by deciding to go with so many plot twists. It lasted about 40 minutes too long and, in my opinion, could've ended on a high note if it had stopped there.",The Handmaiden
174,Wheepuppy,Simply genius.,10,11 July 2018,"The Handmaiden was born as an adaptation of Sarah Water's 2002 novel Fingersmith, a Victorian crime novel Park Chang-wook took the inspiration from, taking as a reference its investigation in repression and the limits of female empowerment. Despite of this, he was able to convert the story, the characters and the costumes and scenarios into the dynamics of the Japanese occupation of South Korea during the war. Thus, the film tackles themes as love, betrayal, conflicts on personal interests and liberation. With only four characters, the movie offers a magnificent story with several plots and twists, thanks to a successful choice of narrative style and form.
The Handmaiden is an amazing movie that evidences the perfected style of a recognized director who surpasses himself with every movie he releases, that shows majestic combinations of quality cinematography, editing, sound and the perfect use of scenarios, a very well written and complex characters, along with an even more well developed story throughout the plot, thanks to the correct decisions made on form and style of the film. All of this brings together an amazing experience that makes this movie an outstanding work in the 7th art history.",The Handmaiden

Part 2 is the same extremely boring stuff from the mistress's point of view. The director then spices the whole thing with some lesbian sex scenes (he obviously saw ""Blue is the Warmest Colour"" and tried to copy that movie for the sex), which are the most boring thing in the movie. There is a little bit of sadism but for that see ""Audition"" instead which is a great film. And Part 3 has some twists, lots of plot holes and is completely forgettable.

185,Kmark1293,I would like to thank the film gods for giving us Park Chan-Wook.,9,5 November 2016,"The latest effort from this acclaimed South Korean filmmaker takes place during 1930's Japan where a woman is hired to be the handmaiden to a rich heiress in an effort to con her out of her high fortunes. And in typical Park Chan-Wook fashion, a lot of twists, turns, and revelations come to fruition and ends up creating one of the most mesmerizing cinematic experiences I've had in 2016. Seriously, this man knows his craft and manages to mix intricate plot with some of his stylish filmmaking techniques in order to flesh out every scene in awe-sparring fashion.Its a near perfect blend of style and substance that lends itself in giving you a fascinating story along with beautifully crafted shots, angles, and transitions to boost it's already well-made plot. The acting from everyone is simply phenomenal. From the main to the supporting cast, there is not a single weak performance in this film. Plus, it contains a gorgeous score that complements every scene taking place and its one of the best I've heard all year. As for the sexy, erotic elements that the film had to offer, well, all I can say is that they don't hold back anything and Chan-Wook is very direct and to the point with the subject matter at hand.In the end, ""The Handmaiden"" is hands down of the best movies I've seen in 2016. Just leave it to one of the greatest South Korean directors to show us the true artistry that cinema has to offer.

189,kraytdragon-sean,An Excellent Lesbian Drama,9,30 December 2016,"Park Chan-wook is one of the most versatile directors around. Sure, Park seems fixated on tales of vengeance but never does the worn theme feel like a detractor in his films. Oldboy and Snowpiercer add intricate layers which transform the initial quest for revenge into other issues entirely. The Handmaiden is a movie that keeps the best traits of the South Korean director. Sure revenge underlines the narrative and yet the film is not entirely about revenge. Likewise, the Handmaiden is an erotic thriller and isn't an erotic thriller. A lesser director would hone in on the pornographic but the film never undercuts one of the meta-messages found within the film. Without spoiling Handmaiden, a Clockwork Orange is a film with a similar meta-commentary directed at the audience. Instead, the erotic scenes give the intended effect without going full throttle. The result is a lesbian love story which accentuates emotion over physicality. Male directors have a tendency to get a little excited with lesbian love stories and turn an otherwise amazing movie into pornography. Blue is the Warmest Color is a recent example of a film which could have utilized a little restraint required of its subject matter. The central ""love triangle"" in the Handmaiden is given an air of realism due to the level of restraint. Most characters are never who they appear to be throughout the film. In fact, the three chapter structure of the film allows for the rare successful attempt at having more than one plot twist. Film veterans are likely the only group of people who can put the puzzle pieces together early on. The twists never come across as cheap gimmicks thanks to the cinematography. The gorgeous mise en scene is spellbinding with the amount of variation found in limited locations. In spite of the lavish designs, the camera never hides character ticks one can begin to hone in on. The Handmaiden contains a lot of the admirable traits one might in a Stanley Kubrick film (the Clockwork Orange reference is not entirely pulled out of a hat). However, the middle-aged Korean director is able to separate and maybe transcend Kubrick in his use of overt dark humor. Manchester by the Sea is another serious film which also successfully utilizes humor to create a humanistic story. Kubrick usually utilizes dark comedy for an entirely different effect. The Handmaiden is an absolutely must-see for those who appreciate cinematic greatness.",The Handmaiden

191,milk-carton-reviews,a stunning piece of art,8,29 June 2017,"I don't even know where to start with this movie. For starters, it ranks up high in my favorite movies of 2016, and it's for a reason. The first thing I would like to point out is the stunning cinematography, which stays consistently good throughout the movie. The performances were amazing, especially from the two female leads, Min-hee Kim and Kim Tae-ri. They have amazing chemistry together and leave the audience rooting for them the entire run time. The story was compelling and beautifully composed so that the viewer never really knows what's going on until the very end - not for a second did I get bored. I absolutely loved seeing the events of the film depicted from different character's perspectives. This is the type of movie that requires multiple viewings to get the full experience. Park Chan-Wook nails it with the direction, as was expected of him at this point. He doesn't shy away from explicit content and the entire movie has this erotic aura surrounding it. At the same time it manages to be one of the most empowering movies for women I've seen in a long time and the movie that the LGBT community has been waiting for, which I believe is extremely important for Hollywood at this time. Let's just hope that other movies follow ""The Handmaiden's"" lead. A truly refreshing representation of homosexuality in film. In conclusion, this is a masterfully crafted movie that I would recommend to everybody, definitely one of the highlights of 2016. I can't wait to see what Park Chan-Wook has in store for us next and am excited to keep following his work.",The Handmaiden
192,nottaproblemuk,A Modern Classic.,10,17 August 2020,"Wow. Just, wow. This is undoubtedly one of the best films of the decade. Every aspect of the film: the plot, the cast, the cinematography, direction, artwork and set design (I believe Wes Anderson was a big influence in all these areas). Everything is sensational - and not in a 'pretentious arty' kind of way either. It truly is a cinematic masterpiece.How this film did not sweep up at the Academy Awards that year is simply beyond me. Forget 'Best Foreign Language Film' - this should've been nominated in virtually every category. Don't get me wrong, I adored 'Parasite' and was as pleased as anyone to see that film get the recognition it deserved at the last ceremony - but 'The Handmaiden' is even better in my opinion.The main trailer itself doesn't seem to tell you too much about the characters or the plot, and after watching the movie last night I totally understand why. This is a film best watched without much prior knowledge. The film grabs you from the first minute, and then takes you on an awe-inspiring, sensual journey of feelings and emotions as a result of its distinct unpredictability. You will be thrilled, shocked, touched and totally captivated as the story unfolds - not to mention spellbound, by the sensational visual work at play throughout. Something the director and crew clearly invested so much time and imagination into.All in all, I give this film a 10/10 rating as I simply can not find a single fault. Bravo!",The Handmaiden

194,thehumanwritesproject,"A Feminist, empowering, sexy love story, told in a most creative and thrilling way.",9,31 October 2016,"""The Handmaiden"" by Park Chan-wook is a very feminist film (though it may not identify as such) that unearths a morbose, and sado-misogynistic world of literary pornography, as well as a culture of women subjugated to read these books out loud to gatherings of wealthy older men. It is a story of trickery, scamming, and conning. It is a story of power, dominance, and control. It is a story of ritual, customs and twisted desires. But, above all things, this movie is a beautiful and empowering love-story.Much like Kurosawa's ""Rashomon"" Chan-Wook's film creates powerful suspense and tension through its multiple perspective story-telling; allowing the viewer to slowly piece together a narrative puzzle (as each character recounts their experience), revealing bits of information that unravel the truth about the chain of events that occur. Divided into 3 Parts (not to be confused with Acts), the different Points of Views serve as a witty story-telling trope that plays out beautifully and seamlessly in ""The Handmaiden.""While it has the unapologetic perversion of Pasolini's ""Salo:120 Days of Sodom"" Chan- Wook has a sense of (dark) humor throughout his film. Telling a compelling, somewhat-stylized, and dark story but without taking itself too seriously; provoking moments of laughter despite the discomfort, the beauty, the perversion, the seduction. We are not only seduced by what is unveiled, but Chan-Wook also seduces us with lavish sets, luxurious costumes, and beautiful scenery, as well as meticulous directing, and gorgeous cinematography. The love-story and the tension that the Director is able to build between the two leading female characters is reminiscent of the forbidden love between Mrs Chan and Chow Mo-wan in Won Kar Wai's ""In the Mood for Love;"" generating tension and density in the air by controlling and denying us (the viewer) of our desires and expectations. By not allowing love to consummate when we most wish it to. And, although I have not actually seen ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" (and nor is it on my ""Must Watch"" Movie list), I imagine ""The Handmaiden"" also shares similar thematic elements with the E.L. James franchise.Much like the 2013 Cannes favorite, Abdellatif Kechiche's ""Blue is the Warmest Color,"" Chan-Wook's film also shows graphic sexual encounters between two beautiful women (and runs about 3 hours long), but unlike Kechiche's film which indulges in woman-on-woman sex through a very accentuated self-centered, male-gaze, ""The Handmaiden"" on the contrary, is a very empowering story about two bad-ass women who--despite the sedimented patriarchal world they inhabit-- are able to break away, find love, express themselves sexually (in a very tasteful, romantic, at times humorous, and tender ways); and outsmart the ego-centric, sex-obsessed, wealth- obsessed men.Chan-Wook is very smart in the way he shows us grossly perverse ""acts"" performed for the amusement of men, and under the control of men; and the same act later reclaimed by the leading females and turned into an act of pleasure for themselves, and for each other. A very beautiful, current, and empowering love-story told in a most creative and thrilling way.""The Handmaiden"" is now added to my list of feminist films directed by progressive male filmmakers. Sure, Chan-Wook is a male Director, and by default, it's impossible for the story not to have ""a bit"" of a male gaze, since it is a man literally standing behind the lens and looking through it; however the film is quite feminist. Like Rivettes' revolutionary ""Julie and Celine go Boating"" and Eric Rohmer's ""La Collectionneuse"" and ""Claire's Knee"" as well as Truffaut's ""Jules et Jim"" really progressive feminist films made by male filmmakers. Much like the aforementioned auteurs, Park Chan-Wook has managed to deal with sexuality, misogyny, and power from a very feminist perspective. Unapologetically and refreshingly empowering.",The Handmaiden

Very well done.Also the landscape, it makes you dream of going to Korea and Japan if you haven't been there yet. Then the plot, it changes so many times that in the end, you don't even know, what is the actual story, who are the good and the bad guys. Sex, Sado, it is a provocative movie, but not ordinary.

198,andrewcl-31356,"One of several interwoven tales includes a Korean handmaiden, 145 min",7,6 October 2021,"The sttings are splendid, set in a Korea being occupied by Japan, and mostly in a mansion that is half-english and half-japanese. There is much going on about social status and nationality and the productionis careful about what languages the character is using even though it is all subtitled.A rich book-loving older man has arranged to raise and marry a niece with a fortune. The other main male is pure con-man who has contrived a way to get the same fortune. The niece's handmaiden was brought aboard to help steer the target. This is all set up early; a spoiler would be still a long time away, as who is conspiring against who changes. The word ""underestimated"" is used a lot, meaning advantage to whoever is the most deceiving, strategic, and cold. A love is found---unless it's a trap. The deceptions are not so horrible since there is a clash of cultures anyway.There is sex and guessing is encouraged, but no comedy or horror. It is long, divided into three parts with a different perspective... The first protagonist is the handmaiden Soon with aliases (Kim Tae-ri), but others get their reveals. It just feels wrong to call this movie asian, when it is deeply Oriental and set a hundred or so years ago.

203,wcoleparks,Park Chan-wook crafts another masterpiece!,9,21 June 2016,"When going into a movie by one of your favorite directors, it is easy to set high expectations. Rarely does the film fully meet those expectations, but when it does it is something special. Such is the case with Park Chan-wook's The Handmaiden (Mademoiselle). He has crafted an intricately woven tale of love and betrayal that highlights everything he can do so well from heightened sexual tension to gorgeous imagery. The film, which is an adaptation of the novel The Fingersmith, revolves around a woman who is hired as a handmaiden to a Japanese heiress. This is the very basic summary to a film that has a lot of depth underneath the surface and requires the audience's attention throughout the film. And as the plot goes on we discover the newly hired handmaiden may have some ulterior motives along with many of the other characters. Nothing is revealed too quickly and the film is split into a three-part structure that slowly pieces things together through flashbacks. It also uses a storytelling device that is typically owned by Tarantino where the same scene is shown from multiple perspectives and each adds a new layer to the story. All of these devices are used to full effect and create surprising twists on par with Park Chan-wook's Oldboy.What is immediately apparent from the start of the film is how well Park Chan-wook's aesthetic fits into the time period. His eye for gorgeous shots and camera angles makes the house in the film look like a work of art. The grounds around the house are also highlighted so well. Wide shots and lingering camera movements let you appreciate every little detail on screen and marvel at the beauty of it all. The score also fits in perfectly with the time period. It is never bombastic and always subtle, and perfectly captures the mood and feeling of each scene. Whether an intimate moment between the two women or a heated exchange between characters it's hard to realize how great the score is because of how organic it feels. Framing is also a very important addition to the story. Through the use of mirrors and reflections, Park Chan-wook suggests the double-sided nature of the characters. Also, he often obstructs part of the frame with an object and hides characters behind walls or glass to suggest we may not really see everything that is going on before us. This aspect of the film in particular I feel will only get better with subsequent viewing when you can understand all of characters motivations and desires. One thing that Park Chan-wook did so well with Stoker was creating a palpable feeling of sexual tension without using nudity or anything overtly sexual. In this film he succeeds with that throughout the entire film. Every look and every glance the two woman share conveys a longing and desire that permeates the whole film. In this film however, he continues that passion past suggestion into full on sex. There are multiple scenes with extended nudity but they are all filmed so artfully and sympathetically it always feels warranted. The scenes never feel awkward or exploitative and always are tasteful and almost poetic. Somehow despite what I was watching I still found myself admiring the camera-work and beautiful cinematography. One thing that surprised me in the film and I have not seen in Park Chan-wook's other work is the humor. It was never slapstick and usually more circumstantial, but the whole audience laughed out loud on numerous occasions. He showed a surprisingly great understanding of timing and every joke landed. One scene in particular dealt with suicide and could have come across as insensitive or callous. Due to the perfect timing, it was hilarious and even further developed the relationship between the characters. During the last act of the film, it does get unusually violent. There is a torture scene that seems out of place with the rest of the film. Though effective in its own right and thoroughly thrilling, it didn't sit right with me due to how subtle the rest of the film had been. This is a film that really stays with you and will take multiple viewing to really appreciate the complex story. The first film I have seen in a long time where I continued to think about it throughout the day and had multiple conversations about all aspects of the film. With The Handmaiden, Park Chan-wook has crafted a film that fully displays the craft and technical prowess he can show and it includes a story that that only gets better the more you think about it.The Handmaiden (2016) Directed by: Park Chan-wook Screenplay by: Seo-Kyung Chung, Park Chan-wook Starring: Jung-woo Ha, Min-hee Kim, Jin-woong Jo, Tae Ri Kim Run Time: 2 hour 25 minutes",The Handmaiden

The director takes his time to unfold the story; making it appealing and bloody interesting.
The twists are all so cleverly written; it's witty, funny and romantically naive at times.
This movie is a present; a gift; and needs time to be appreciated.

213,paul_a_salt,A beautiful erotic crime thriller,9,31 October 2016,"Park Chan Wook's adaptation of Sarah Water's historical crime novel is beautiful. This is no surprise as all of Park Chan Wook's films are beautiful. Chung Chung-hoon (Park's cinematographer since Oldboy) has once again delivered one of the more visually stunning films of the year. Vivid colours are used provocatively to invoke a fanciful vision of occupied Korea. What is a relief is that the film contains the compelling characters and deep insight that Park's last film, Stoker, unfortunately lacked. Park has returned to the theme of female sexuality that he previously explored in Stoker and Thirst, this time focusing on a burgeoning relationship between a young heiress and her handmaiden. However as you'd expect from a work adapted from a crime story, there are a great many twists in the story. What sets this apart from other erotic crime fiction (aside from the technical prowess) is our emotional engagement with the story. This can be attributed to the excellent performances, especially Kim Tae-ri as Sook-Hee who is at times subtly hilarious and deeply heart-breaking. Ha Jung-woo is wonderful as the conman who attempts to manipulate both women. There is the same potential problem with this film as Blue is the Warmest Colour, namely that this is a film about female sexuality as written and directed by a man (admittedly in both cases adapted from works by female authors). Just as with that film I feel there is more going on here. The film concerns itself with the excitement of new love and its ability to liberate us from seemingly inescapable circumstances. However with this film, I believe that Park may have anticipated this issue. One of the more interesting themes of the film is sexual exploration. At the screening of the film I attended Park Chan-wook mentioned that his fans in Tokyo have nicknamed him the ""intellectual pervert"". As we explore the household of The Handmaiden we realise that some very niche sexual practices are being explored, tantalisingly hinted at by a pair of brass balls found in a drawer early in the film. Around the midpoint of the film we are presented with a room full of men watching a woman tell an erotic story. We see her tell multiple stories involving tentacle beasts, asphyxiation and object sexuality. The men are entranced by this erotic display, whilst the film presents it as a lurid and rather cold affair. The woman is being exploited.This is contrasted by the incredibly warm and intimate filming of the love scene between Sook-Hee and Hideko. The scene is actually visited twice during the film from different perspectives. The scene is very erotic and exciting, not least because we know these characters and understand what this experience means to them. I believe we are to contrast these scenes. One is titillation derived from imagined scenarios, the other is the genuine eroticism of seeing two characters we care about connect physically. Yet perhaps we can allow this opportunity to contemplate our voyeurism. Even though we understand their situation better, are the character still being exploited for our benefit? Relocating the film from Victorian Britain to 1930s Japan has an interesting effect on the story. Whereas the recent film ""When Marnie Was There"" (a studio Ghibli production of an Irish novel) moves the action to Japan with only some aesthetic nods to its original setting, Park uses this as an opportunity to comment on the period and place. The film is set during the Japanese occupation of Korea. Early in the film it is mentioned that Kouzuki, the man who built the house, combined eastern and western traditions. This contrast of designs is evident throughout and creates a dynamic impression of a country transforming. Ultimately this is Park Chan-Wook's most engaging and entertaining film since Thirst. His trademark dark humour, startling violence and kinky eroticism are all in full effect. If some of those elements put off certain people, then that's just all the more reason to cherish the film. I look forward to seeing it again when the film is generally released next year, as I'm sure there is much more to see.",The Handmaiden

217,bea37,"Closer to Almodóvar and Tarantino, not Hitchcock",7,9 September 2018,"Because of Oldboy, I had very high expectations... So maybe that explains why the experience fell a little flat. I think it is to do with the fact that I was expecting a suspense full of tension. First of all, I would classify it as a dramedy of sorts. Why people relate this to any Hitchcock is beyond me. I didn't find it even remotely tense -- we can easily predict what is going to happen in each of the three parts, and there is no element of fear. All along we know that everything is going to turn out fine. The character of the uncle, for instance: I kept waiting for him to show his true colours in a much worse way. The conman is stupid and goofy. And the female characters are beautiful and fun to watch, but superficial and silly as well. I did find it funny at times and even laughed out loud with one or two scenes. The characters and the plot are kind of childish, and perhaps would have benefited from being a little sharper, thus turning the experience into a more Almodóvar-like one. But overall it is quite entertaining. Scenery and costumes are kitsch enough, and the fast pace and kookiness remind us of Tarantino.",The Handmaiden
218,kiosilveira,An exciting mystery,10,21 June 2017,"Park goes back to the origins, with its cinema full of mystery, brutal but mostly exuberant.

Being divided into 3 parts of lies and betrayals, the film has a huge camera work, abusing well-designed plans and space, both indoors and out, traveling through a mixture of English and Japanese architecture, the film is a breeze in the eyes of so beautiful, from the very accurate track, immersion in the beauty of Japanese erotic literature, the film explores well-developed characters, and of course, returns plot twist on plot twist, as the director knows well how to do, no doubt one of the best films of the year.",The Handmaiden

One part might show a particular scene one way, and the next may show it through a different angle/tone, adding or excluding dialogue. It creates an atmosphere where the characters true intentions are not clear. This contributes to the film's unpredictability. The set for much the movie is an incredible estate, built with an extreme contrast in English and Japan architecture. A maze lending itself to voyeurism and eavesdropping. The sex scene (shown twice with different contexts) is as intense and provoking as it gets for the big screen. Much homage is payed to artistic vision in this movie: The shots of the many scrolls and paintings/drawings themselves, the closeups of spying eyes, the visual reenactment of the erotic novels, and scenes with the estates Japanese gardens as the backdrop.

A very special moment to me.I would advise anyone new to Park Chan-Wook's filmography to first explore his vampire flick 'Thirst' which has a similar style. 'Oldboy' is a cult classic, but more of an opium-filled, octopus eating thrill-ride, which this film is NOT, so be advised. I also think having SOME knowledge of Japanese rule in Korea is essential for understanding this film, or it will be above your head. Do some surface-level research on Japanese annexation of Korea and specifically the infamous 'comfort women'.Completed that? OK now you're ready for this journey.Now let's focus on the best part.

Because it is one of the best films I've seen...ever.I was absolutely (and continue to be, as I've watched it two more times since) stunned by this movie. The story is so engrossing and TIGHTLY written. The twists and turns, I can't imagine the amount of work that went into the script itself. The characters are all beautifully layered, which is only enhanced by the great actors that portray them (and it must've been some WORK to play these characters who wear masks on top of masks throughout the film). The visuals and camera work are amazing as well. I particularly loved the colors and palette, which is so vivid and bright throughout.

I liked the way the film is divided into three chapters, with the storyline suddenly being seen from a different point of view. I wasn't, however, convinced by the portrayal of the relationship between the two women, who seem to be falling in lust rather than love.

The visuals are outstanding and the general look of the film is close to perfection. That is cinematography at its best. The music of the film is fitting and contributes to the great atmosphere. The only weakness of this movie are its overacted and sometimes silly male characters. But the main focus lies on the two female protagonists, who are convincing.

I normally don't have a problem with sex scenes in a movie but in this, i felt as if they did not have any real purpose other than to ""please"" the audience (they defenitly weren't left in for storytelling purpose).

It tackles a lot of important issues such as the male gaze but this movie, which is supposed to show a very raw emotion between 2 women, has it's own problem of the male gaze and you can feel it through out the film. It is specially visible during the sex scenes, even though the 2 actors had a lot of chemistry and their emotions were mostly shown without them having to say a word those scenes made no sense at all and it was painfully obvious that they were directed by a straight man who has no idea about a relationship like this (have in mind that I'm NOT talking about the writers but the director). I did not feel the femininity I should have which I don't think is an acting or writing problem but a directing one. Overall the camera work and the story line were amazing, the movie is long but you don't feel bored at all and the acting was spot on but in my personal opinion this movie was not able to deliver the message it wanted to.",The Handmaiden

I can definitely recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a film that deviates from the classic norm.",The Handmaiden
243,Stijak91,Tour De Force!,10,19 September 2016,"The controversial film from Korean master Chan-wook Park evokes the sexiness of Abdellatif Kechiche's ""Blue is the Warmest Colour"" and Park's own signature violence and thrills. Set in the 1930s Japanese occupied Korea, it's a story of a young female pickpocket (Kim Tae-ri) who becomes a handmaiden to a beautiful Japanese heiress (Min-hee Kim). However, she must manage to convince the heiress to marry a conman (Jung-woo Ha) who poses as a count, for which she will get a chance for a better life. She gets into a moral dilemma when she starts developing feelings for the heiress.The Handmaiden is a triumph on every level. The film is divided into three chapters, all giving different perspective. This way, the story is perfectly structured to give more and more insight as the film progresses, but at the same time, keep the viewers guessing. It offers a few surprises along the way as well. Visually, it's a feast for the eyes. The term ""every frame a painting"" gets overused, but it really fits here. I'm not only talking about cinematography, which offered plenty of memorable shots and beautiful scenery, but the costume and set design. The three leads all gave terrific performances. Musical score by Yeong-wook evokes, or better said, amplifies the emotions and the suspenseful tone. Despite the run time of 2 hours and 24 minutes, it never gets dull, it's very evenly paced throughout. I couldn't look away for a second.One thing needs to be addressed, the film is quite explicit. That being said, it never gets vulgar, the sex scenes are done in perfect taste, they never feel out of place and they're not there just for the sake of it. The relationship between the characters and the physical presentation of it are integral to the film. It's a film about passion, abuse, jealousy, betrayal and deception, but most of all, it's an atypical love story, which will make one love and hate the protagonists at the same time. It's original and daring work of art that will stick with viewers long after it's finished.Whenever Chan-wook Park makes a film, it must undoubtedly be compared to his masterpiece, ""Oldboy"". I don't think that ""The Handmaiden"" surpasses it, but it comes very close. With this film, he proved himself to be one of the greatest working directors today. It's the best film I've seen this year, one that I can't wait to revisit. It's not to be missed.",The Handmaiden

245,dormantbae,Don't miss this lavish exhilarating thriller.,9,27 October 2016,"You can tell from the beginning that ""The Handmaiden"" is not what it seems. But, you can never figure out what it actually is. The very existence of Park Chan-Wook's ""The Handmaiden"" is inexplicable. It features a lesbian love triangle set during the Japanese colonial rule of Korea. It is based on Sarah Waters' Victorian era novel ""Fingersmith"", but almost a third of the movie varies from its source. It keeps the best stuff about a great novel and reaches new heights.The movie tells of a female pickpocket (Kim Tae-ri) who conspires with a male con artist (Ha Jung-woo) to pose as a maid to a rich young heiress (Kim Min-hee) in an attempt to seize her wealth. But the story gets complicated when the maid and the heiress fall in love. The movie is filled with twists and turns. Every character has a hidden agenda. Trying to keep pace with the plot was the some of the most fun I've had while watching a movie.The blossoming affair between the two women is observed not only through startlingly blunt and lavish sex scenes, but also through tender scenes like where one woman rushes to the other's defence. The romantic relationship between the two women opens up all sorts of emotions in the story than a more traditional film. When the two female lead characters fall in love, movie also becomes about love showing them how the men in their lives use and abuse them. In ""The Handmaiden"", love doesn't just make you feel great — it also completely reorients your perspective.The film's narration is intriguingly constructed. It reminded me of Christopher Nolan's work. During the second half of the film, the director rewinds the scenes and plays them again from fresh vantage points, thus altering their meaning or revealing previously unknown facts.The casting of the movie is perfect. The melodramatic performances are perfect. The cinematography, the production design and the score are perfect. The direction is perfect. Every frame, every movement of the camera, every performance feels perfectly calibrated for maximum effect.""The Handmaiden"" is sensuously sumptuous, frankly sexual, occasionally perverse and ghastly violent.

Both?,8,27 November 2016,"""The Handmaiden"" is the story of a love affair between a noblewoman and her handmaiden, both prisoners on the estate of the noblewoman's uncle, a wealthy purveyor of antique sadoerotica. I found it darkly beautiful; my wife dismissed it as needlessly explicit lesboerotica.Who's right?It boils down to whether the love between the handmaiden and her mistress burns fiercely enough to purge them of the painstakingly calculated treacheries each had planned for the other, and incandescently enough to overcome the inky night of sexual torture that perpetually engulfs the estate.For the director to almost exclusively express that love via intense carnality is a big gamble: succeed, and you have a story of triumph and redemption; fail, and all you have is medium-core lesbian porn.

(it is very brief and important to the story so you can just hide your eyes as I did if these things disturb you) Most of all this is a story about love. The two scenes that stood out for me had nothing to do with sex or violence. One is a simple scene that happens on a road where you see two souls connect. Another happens in a library where you see one character express and liberate another character from so much pain and degradation.

What's not clear from the beginning is how the folding layers of the story will wrap you up, pull you tight, and flip you upside down as the movie reaches its final act. By the time the credits rolled I felt it was a very erotic and romantic movie about liberation.

253,Humpfrey,"Too long, too predictable, too much.",4,23 June 2019,"The Handmaiden is widely regarded as a critically acclaimed film, but lacks the substance to justify its significant praise. At a running time of nearly 3 hours, the film is in desperate need of editing to reduce its excesses - of which there are many. The plot is dragged on for far too long, and the voids are filled with unnecessary, protracted, over-the-top sex scenes to force sexuality into a story that it does little to benefit. While the central premise of the film (a revenge tale) is promising, it is squandered by the film's length and lack of originality. After the first twist of the film is revealed, the plot becomes increasingly predictable and offers little payoff for the viewer's time.The acting and cinematography were well done, but wasted on a movie that offered far less than it was promised to be.

The web of trust & backstabbing which underlies the plot is beautifully displayed through splitting the movie into 3 parts/perspectives.Some of the more nuanced plot points are rushed, like the exposition in part 1, or Sook-hee's escape from the asylum, which left me confused & distracted. Maybe the director expected the audience to already be familiar with the Fingersmith which this is based on?The worst of it was the gratuitous sex scenes which were framed in a cold, voyeuristic way that made me feel like I was supposed to identify more with one of the Uncle's ""book club"" members than with Hideko or Sook-hee themselves. It's made worse by placing their successful escape alongside a weirdly sympathetic scene of ""Count"" Fujiwara in part 3.Overall, certainly better than a lot of mainstream portrayal of lesbians, but clearly still a film by a straight male director for a straight male audience, which is pretty disappointing",The Handmaiden

263,kleinsanchez,A masterpiece.,10,5 March 2021,"Ask me to name a perfect movie, and I'll say The Handmaiden, directed by Park Chan-wook. I watched this last year during the first few months of the pandemic and it took me on a rollercoaster. It's a 2016 film, and the fact that I hadn't known about it sooner was pain. But to be fair, I was definitely not of age to watch this in 2016 as it does have quite graphic sensual scenes.Everything about this movie is breathtaking. The design, costume, score, characterization, and the cinematography are, not to sound too fancy or pretentious but immaculate.Just like Parasite by Bong Joon-ho, this movie has its own twists and turns. The craftsmanship involved in making this movie makes it extremely effortless for the audience to enjoy the plot. One element that I enjoyed the most was the movie's pacing; Chan-wook's direction for the movie was a genius move. The movie is divided into three acts; the transitions from one style to the next was well thought of, everything was smooth.With that being said, It's not a movie for everyone. It's an erotic thriller with a dark humor sprinkled on top but Chan-wook balances those so well that it prevents the audience from being too distracted. Even when using the words erotica and thriller to describe the movie, it is in no doubt that this was crafted and executed so well that it is such an aesthetically pleasing movie to me. Some parts of the movie might be a little too much for some people but for myself, I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen for two and a half hours.",The Handmaiden

Does it contain a main story? I'm not sure because the main focus was the sex scenes.. I haven't checked the parents guide before watching the movie. This was a clear mistake because I did not want my 20 year old daughter to see some scenes that is very explicit.Parents guide is necessary not only for our kids is also an important guideline when choosing a movie to watch. Finally, it was a waste of time for me.Even the existence of Jung Woo Ha whom I like very much has not been enough for me to give a higher rating for this movie. If you do not have conservative concerns and just want to have some leisure time; watching nice lesbian girl characters their foreplay scenes could be entertaining for you.",The Handmaiden
266,Moviepham,Worth seeking out,7,24 June 2016,"Watching The Handmaiden is an interesting, evocative experience similar to the director's other work, even though it does not reach the heights of Oldboy (2003), it is highly entertaining. The story is really captivating, leading you on until it is ready to reveal what is actually underneath the film's skirt. As with most films that are separated into parts, there is a slightly weaker one in the middle, as the movie slows down and back tracks for you to catch up. However, overall this was a really interesting script that suited the new setting (Korea under Japanese colonial rule) well.Similar with Park Chan-Wook's other films that I have seen, Oldboy (2003) and Stoker (2013), this is a gorgeous movie. Beautifully shot sets that look incredible, and the estate on which most of the film takes place is an incredible location. The beautiful costumes replicating the early 20th century time period make this film quite visually stunning. The performances by the three main stars Kim Min- hee, Ha Jung-woo and Kim Tae-ri were all exceptional. One of the film's strengths is its ability to seamlessly incorporate comedic elements into what could have been quite a serious movie. In a movie that involves themes such as suicide and fraud, it is hard to believe how many times it made the audience laugh out loud. Although the tone does get darker at times, the lighter moments make it just a really fun movie as well. Although the music wasn't as amazing as the song used in the international trailer, it does serve its purpose effectively. There are also minor details like the use of color in the subtitles to distinguish between Korean and Japanese which I really appreciated. The film also involves a high level of debauchery that leads to it being very sexually graphic in many parts of the film. Although the director has done similar things in the past, I felt like in those earlier films it served more of a purpose whereas in this film, while there are some moments that do develop characters and the story, there is an abundance of gratuitous sex scenes that elongate the movie a little too much. I found The Handmaiden to be a really enjoyable film that didn't disappoint my expectations of the director. It was a really intriguing story that is complimented by the great craftsmanship of all those involved. The film does show some unjustified sex scenes that may be off putting to some viewers but some may also enjoy it.",The Handmaiden
267,maddyindahouse,Fetishization detracts from plot,6,19 December 2016,"This movie disappointed me. I knew that coming out of a relatively homophobic country, it probably wouldn't be groundbreaking in that sense, but I still hoped that it would set a good standard for lgbtq movies. The plot itself is great. It follows the plot of 'fingersmith' rather closely, except it is set in 1930's Korea. It has many plot twists and strange characters that keep you on your toes. The cinematography is also, of course, beautiful. The costumes and sets are magnificent and appealing. It has a great soundtrack and also good acting. So why do I give it a 6/10? It mostly has to do with the fetishization of lesbians. The sex scene is ridiculous. They scissor, for chrissakes. No one does that in real life. It is dramatized and obviously panders to a male audience. It does nothing to further the plot. I was incredibly disappointed in this scene. It was a complete waste of 10 minutes (yes, 10 minutes). It watches like porn, the kind made specifically for men. To make matters worse, the two female characters are not very fleshed out. They meet, they have sex, now they're in love. There is barely any conversation between the two. The two lead actresses do a superb job of portraying sexual tension, but it is thrown in your face early on. Being gay was not exactly the norm in the 1930's. It's unlikely that two women would act so, well, gay around each other so soon after meeting. That adds to the idea that their relationship is being used for the sex appeal and not for the plot. Yes, this movie is worth watching. But don't go into it expecting an empowering message for lgbtq viewers. They could have done a lot more with the relationship movie, but instead they decided to play it safe, throwing away an accurate representation of a gay relationship. I suppose the world is not ready for a real lesbian movie.",The Handmaiden
268,pavia13,"Great, great film",9,15 April 2017,I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I can't remember the last time i was riveted by a film in this way. I have to watch 'Old Boy' again to figure out which one was better.I love films set in the 20s-30s and and all the actors did a fine job.I hope we get to see more of those actresses.,The Handmaiden
269,ankhbayarts,Wonderful new film by Korean auteur Park Chan-wook,10,7 March 2017,"Like many North American films fans, I discovered Park Chan-Wook's work through his 2003 breakout Oldboy. He has continued to make great films like Thirst, I'm A Cyborg (But That's OK), and his American film debut Stoker, but I have felt that known of his films have packed the same punch as JSA and the Vengeance Trilogy until 2016's the Handmaiden.The Handmaiden is adapted from the novel the Fingersmith by Sarah Waters, and tells the story of a woman named Sook-hee, who takes up an offer from her employer Count Fujiwara to become the titular handmaiden for the very rich Lady Hideko, so that the Count can get into Hideko's good graces, and eventually marry Hideko in place of her uncle usurp her fortune, and have her committed. What he does not anticipate is that the two ladies will fall in love, and eventually plot against him.The film has what could be a simple period set story told in a deeply complex way. The story is split into 3 acts told from each of the 3 main characters perspectives so that certain segments are repeated from the perspective of each character, so they are understood in different ways. Chan-wook has created a lush, gorgeous atmosphere to set his story in, and even in the film's slower moments (in the late 2nd act for example), the film is stunning to behold. The performances from the main cast, are always deep from the written to the physical.This brings me to the sex scenes which like Blue is the Warmest Color have taken on a note of notoriety for their explicit nature. They certainly are explicit for a film that could qualify for a sort of mainstream film, but they do feel central to the plot, as both characters come from positions where they have been dominated by men their entire existence, and are using these moments not just as sexual expression, but as moments where they are able to take control of their own existence.",The Handmaiden

271,jason-a-pareja,A Japanese hentai cartoon - what's the big deal?,5,20 April 2017,"An erotic Japanese hentai cartoon come to life. It was fun, and sexy, and beautifully shot, but it is a cartoon pure and simple. The over the top praise this film is getting as a masterpiece of creativity and elegant story telling makes me wonder what these reviews usually watch. I am writing this last line because I have to for a minimum length to submit a review, but it really does not deserve it.",The Handmaiden

273,jakabombac-37998,"Smart, enthralling and theatre-like; but a bit too dense",8,16 November 2016,"I watched this a few days ago at the Ljubljana film festival. I wasn't sure whether I wanted to watch it or not, but a string of events led me to a spontaneous viewing. Why wasn't I sure? Because I expected some similarities with Oldboy, the only Chan-Wook Park film I've seen, and even though I loved Oldboy, I knew it's a specific type of cinema that gets you in a certain mood and reverberates days after.More than the dark tone of Oldboy, I remembered the overall density of it. I felt like it didn't give me any time to breath. Despite the unquestionable quality of the film, I felt like the scenes in it were competing against one another in three main categories: wit, shock value and contrast in comparison to the previous scene. It seemed a bit technical, a bit too thought-out.In Ah-ga-ssi I definitely spotted some similarities with Oldboy - again, not so much in the tone of the film than in the shooting techniques, editing style, theater-like squarry perspective of the shots and the incredible density and intensity of events, shown through wide angles as well as details, that pull you into a world of incredibly well painted subconscious human tendencies, into a nightmarish world where events follow a certain twisted logic and where humour appears in its most darkly form. In another review I read that one has to understand korean history in order to better comprehend the film. I definitely agree, but I felt like Ah-ga-ssi is clear enough to let even the most unknowing spectator know what's going on. It is #intuitive enough to be able to translate the micro-meaning (site-specific, historical) onto a universal human level: even though it depicts a certain era of Korean history, it also depicts very basic human tendencies, which one can apply to several historical, as well as personal events. I feel like this is one of the most important quality of good cinema, and one of Ah-ga-ssi's main strengths.What I also loved was the twists - varying from micro ones to big ones. All of the twists are so well drawn-out and built-up earlier in the film that the suspense is crazy. The twists are well presented and very coherent with the story. I felt a bit of Kurosawa's Rashomon in here - the three part structure, the objective/subjective truth theme and even a few visual references to Rashomon. Ah-ga-ssi is immersive and rich with flavour, but is it a bit too rich? Can a movie be too rich?I felt like everything in this film reflected the theme of illusion - the camera movements, the tricks, the costumes, the characters and the actors. I felt like the team wanted to slightly expose the illusory nature of film as a medium - we know that we're watching something fictional but we still tend to emotionally involve in it. Why is that so? Anyway, I felt like the theater ""set-up"" component could be a bit more visible, it would definitely add a nice self- irony layer upon the smartly built, but a tad stiff cinema puzzle that is Ah-ga-ssi. I love the korean name of this film by the way, much more than Handmaiden. Also, a few moments of rest would be nice for the brain, especially because the tone is so dark. If the film would've been a bit more genre-versatile, I'd love the density, but since the genre definition is pretty clean-cut, because the overall tone of the film is rather dark, and because the story demands a lot of processing, I feel like this film could use a few moments of silence or completely unimportant subplots, just so that the spectator has more time to fill in the gaps with his own ideas.The positive definitely outweighs the negative. From the first moment on, I was hooked. I sat there, looking at the actors, thinking about how incredibly good they were. I loved the nakedness & I loved the poetic intertangling of the bodies. I loved the photography in general. I remember very well how the first few minutes produced a tiny drop of uneasiness in me - a tiny drop that grew bigger and bigger as my understanding of the story was becoming better and better. And when I finally grasped all the crazy twists, the meaning behind the unusual behaviour of the characters - pop. It was like fiction immediately turning into dust, the facades shattered, the film-time becoming what it is in the first place - a remnant that can be revisited in order to be viewed again, from a different point of view.This was definitely a crazy and cathartic experience. Maybe it would never be as cathartic if it wouldn't be so dense with information on so many different levels. Maybe it was the movie's goal - to pile up as many pieces of information one upon the other, stack the spectators mind with various opposing narratives only to be able to prove the spectator that nowadays, no narrative is the right one - we live in a make-believe world, in a constant state of cold war. We can trust nobody, we have no truth, just multidunous realities that we have to constantly update and make sense of... if we don't want to be fooled.",The Handmaiden

275,etismyname-09318,"Not Old Boy, but that's OK",9,16 July 2016,"Sex. One of the most overused element in cinema and often mis-used and unnecessary. I was concerned when this movie is announced, a mis-used sex scene could make the movie feels cheap. This movie did manage to get it quite right.There were scenes of sexual attractions in many parts of the movie but it did not take away all other elements that were done well in the movie.Thematically beautiful, the mansion itself is split half between a western and Japanese. The costume design and cinematography are perfect. The west : grand and luxury; The Japanese : Clean, simple elegant design.The story can be summed up as a hero saving a princess and is split into 3 parts. I loved the first two parts, the third part was the only disappointing part where the plot was predictable and not as interesting and it being the last part makes the movie fell short.The music is perfect. Just like Old Boy, music is more crucial than other movies. Old Boy is a movie that would make you think of a modernized hero revenge movie that is both realistic and unbelievable. The music have strong presence to help build up that world. Same goes with this movie as it is also a very realistic setting (you know the period of time it is based upon, the characters motives are clear and their actions are) yet with some very unbelievable events when you add everything together.It isn't a perfect movie, I saw some editing that could be improved here and there. The last part was also a small disappointment for myself. But it is a damn unique movie that you have to watch.",The Handmaiden
276,satnamsinghwork,The complete film,10,4 December 2016,"Not seen many of films from Chan-wook Park in fact this is the first. I have to say the story is told in such a great way, withholding pieces of information from its audience in many ways than one and a great use of chapters. Very good story, cinematography was excellent and the sound perfect. The best film I have seen to date and I have seen many films. There were some very random explicit scenes which the director stated were necessary but I didn't think so coming straight out from watching the film but once he stated the fact that it would like watching a war film without the battles. This is true as without these explicit scenes there wouldn't be much of a connection between the characters and payoff by the end.",The Handmaiden

It covered the whole spectrum of human emotion: Lust, love, hate, vicious moral decay, and all matters of perversion. And all presented in such a raw and passionate intensity, always keeping you on your toes. And I haven't even stared gushing about the cinematography - simply breathtaking, from start to finish. I quite liked Stoker, but not as much as Oldboy, which was fantastic. But Handmaiden has been my favorite work from visionary director Park Chank-Wook so far.

281,hackrish-32663,besttttt,10,13 October 2017,"The Handmaiden contains multitudes: It's a sumptuous romantic period piece, as well as a sexy spy thriller, replete with secret identities and triple-crosses. It's an extended commentary on Japan's occupation of Korea in the 1930s, and it's an intense piece of psychological horror from one of the masters of the genre, Park Chan-wook. But more than anything, The Handmaiden is just pure cinema, a dizzying, disturbing fable of love and betrayal that piles on luxurious imagery, while never losing track of its story's human core. For Park, the Korean director of crossover genre hits like Old Boy and Thirst, the movie feels like an evolutionary leap forward in an already brilliant career.",The Handmaiden
