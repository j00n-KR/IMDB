0,SnoopyStyle,shocking unforgettable,9,19 May 2015,A group kids in NYC run wild in a world without adult supervision. Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick) loves to deflower virgins. One of the girls he deflowered in the past is Jennie (Chloë Sevigny). She and her friend Ruby (Rosario Dawson) go to do a STD check. Ruby is clean but Jennie tests positive for HIV despite having had sex with only Telly.I remember this was edgy at the time. It still is seeing this after 20 years. It has the documentary feel and mostly unknown amateur actors which only adds to its realism. Both Leo Fitzpatrick and Chloë Sevigny are amazing. I do forget that this is also Rosario Dawson's debut. Some of the other kids also put out raw performances. Harmony Korine's script has a real authenticity to it.,Kids
1,kosmasp,Uncompprmising,7,20 March 2014,"It might seem dated when watched almost 20 years after it came out, but it was showing a side of Kids that many movies were ignoring. There is the problem with identification (even more if you're not in the target group) and of course religious people or people with a threshold when it comes to sexuality and teenagers will have more than a few issues too (smoking and other drugs included).But it is very well played, no matter what your opinion on the matter is. The end might either be exactly what you expected and somewhat rounds a very open story up pretty tightly. It may be hailed as one of the first roles of Rosario Dawson, but don't just watch it because of that, it's the others who shine in this. Kids these/those days ...",Kids
2,lee_eisenberg,What will our country's future be?,9,27 March 2019,"If you thought that ""A Clockwork Orange"" offered a bleak look at the future, try ""Kids"". It depicts a collection of teenagers with no parental guidance, resulting in dangerous hedonism. This is almost certainly one of the most disturbing movies that you'll ever see. It might make you think twice about having children.",Kids
3,jboothmillard,Kids,1,5 October 2006,"I don't remember much of this film, apart from that I found it one of the most awful and boring films ever. Also, I do not know any of the actors, apart from Jon Abrahams as Steven; and I do remember a character called Casper, because they called him the ""friendly ghost"". I did have to watch it in College class once, and I remembered the moment of the mother breast feeding. The moment I didn't remember though was probably the only interesting, funny and watchable of the whole film I remember, one of the kids dips a tampon in his drink, and he sucks the liquid out of it, as it isn't dripping. Anyway, I still have not changed my opinion of it, even after the brief viewing in College, and only the critics think it is good, I didn't. The director Larry Clark was nominated the Golden Palm at the Cannes Film Festival. Poor!",Kids
4,rmax304823,Urban tragedy,6,12 October 2006,"Send these kids to camp -- fast! Or do SOMETHING. Wow, what a life. Basically this is a picture of the life kids who occupy a certain social space lead during their summer vacations. It jumps from episode to episode with a few continuing characters, including Chloe Sevigny and Rosario Dawson.To the extent that there is a story at all, it is this. The movie opens with the teen aged Leo Fitzpatrick successfully seducing the teen aged Chloe Sevigny, who is a virgin. Shortly afterward Sevigny is told she tested positive for HIV, meaning that Fitzpatrick is an asymptomatic carrier. Sevigny spends the rest of the movie looking for Fitzpatrick to tell him about it and prevent him from infecting anyone else. She is waylaid by encounters with strange teenagers, although to be sure they are all strange, and when she finally locates Fitzpatrick at a raucous party he is already putting the blocks to yet another virgin. Sevigny closes the door and staggers away to crash on the couch. Later that night, another creepy teenager wakes up, wanders about, notices the unconscious Sevigny, and does her in what appears to be two different ways. So much for AIDS.That's the thread the movie hangs on, but it serves not as a point in itself but as an illustration of the absence of any point. The kids do everything that ordinary people would consider revolting. They begin using dope the minute they wake up. They shoplift clumsily. They pee on walls in public places. They get drunk. They vomit. They fornicate at will. They don't work. They litter freely. They swear constantly. They ogle each other's mother's breasts. They get into fist fights on the slightest of pretexts. They recognize no checks on their appetites. We hardly see any adults and the ones we do see aren't necessarily much better -- an overweight and ill-groomed mother smoking while she nurses an infant.It's all distasteful but you can't really disengage yourself from what's happening on the screen. It would be like looking away from a gory traffic accident.Maybe that's a problem, too, because the film is so impregnated with debauchery that after a while it becomes frankly unbelievable. One DAY of this kind of life would stun an elephant. More than that, it's too much of a bad thing. Not a single kid we see has any redeeming qualities whatever, except for two virgins who yield readily enough to Fitzpatrick's snake oil. And for all the vulgarity and all the violence done to our ideas of good taste, I'm not sure that the film makers have really gotten it all down accurately.I'll just give two examples in which a viewer might become conscious of the effort it takes to suspend disbelief. (1) In a drug dealer's apartment (where kids who look about nine years old are doing dope) the music from the boombox is what sounds like John Coltrane and Sonny Rollins. I don't think so. I hate to buy into stereotypes too easily, but what I expect to hear is not demanding, classical jazz but hip hop. (2) In Central Park during a drug score, an exojuvenile intrudes on the gang and takes offense at some remark about a skateboard. The alien is a black guy. The gang of dopers who are buddies are racially mixed. They all gang up on the stranger and beat hell out of him, ending it with a possibly lethal whack full in the face with the skateboard. It doesn't jibe with experience. I have a feeling that the fist fight would gradually divide the group along racial lines.This is a heck of a movie. Man, the kids should bottle that energy. They'd be on the Big Board in no time. It could be found in cans in Quick-Stop reefers. ADENORUSH -- for that ""scootch"" feeling. But it's too spelled out. There isn't a moment's rest. I'm not talking about sitting down to ponder Marcus Aurelius. I mean just shutting up for a few minutes. The final shot may be symptomatic. Dawn is crashing around the sleeping, benumbed and benighted bodies the morning after a party. During the night the place has been thoroughly trashed and two girls have probably now caught HIV from our index case. One body, still holding a bottle, stirs a little and comes to life. Its eyes open. It stares blearily into the camera lens and wonders aloud, ""What happened?"" In ""The 400 Blows,"" 45 years earlier, Truffaut made the same point simply by ending on a freeze frame of the delinquent kid caught on the run, staring fixedly and silently at the camera. ""Kids"" suggests that at the end the director doesn't trust us enough to have gotten the point, although we've been hit over the head with it for an hour and a half.",Kids
5,BA_Harrison,Far from kids' stuff.,7,4 November 2013,"Shocking, raw, scary, intense, tragic: all words that I would have used to describe Kids when I first viewed it in the 90s, but which seem even more applicable now that I'm the father of two children fast approaching their teens. Director Larry Clark's uncompromising tale of a group of reckless New York youngsters spending their days drinking, fighting, smoking weed and screwing is enough to give any parent severe palpitations.By employing a cast of real NY teens with little or no acting experience, Clark achieves a remarkable sense of realism—although his voyeuristic style makes certain scenes seem just a little TOO real for comfort: as the adolescents make out, strip off, and get it on, Clark's camera lingers on their entwined pubescent bodies more than is really necessary, making this viewer—and quite a few others, judging by the posts on his IMDb message board—question the director's motives for his film-making.",Kids
6,Quinoa1984,One of the Most Powerful and True Films,10,12 February 2000,"Larry Clark has created a true masterpiece of its time.  Kids is an insightful, poignant and harrowing depiction of the life of angst ridden teens in New York City.  There's Tully, the smooth talking, de-flowering (and HIV positive) teen, Casper, the cool, hyped up and not all there teen, and Jennie, the girl who is full of depression and anger for the de-flower man.  The film doesn't have much of a direct screenplay (mostly dialogue you would hear while around friends) which is good for the type of movie being made here.  The film gains much controversy by stating whether its true to life, or just a mindless depiction of what could happen in the city.  You could decide that for yourself, but for me, I think this film has more truth, heart and drama (including great dramatic acting and scenes) that most films I've ever seen.",Kids
7,tavm,Kids would be provocative viewing for the age group depicted here,10,17 June 2007,"When I watched the beginning of this movie with Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick) deflowering a young girl who we found out later is one of many virgins he has used since they are ""clean"", I can now understand why many parents who were members of the MPAA at the time would want to rate this NC-17. Not that I'd actually support their stance since I would still want any adult with teenagers to have the option of taking them to or renting for their viewing this disturbing depiction of city kids having sex and male and female teens talking about it openly segregated by gender, but it's understandable for any adult who doesn't want his or her kid exposed to such depravity among the young. During the 24 or so hours that the film takes place, another girl Telly had sex with the year before, Jennie (Chloe Sevigny), tries to find him to tell him she is HIV positive. Meanwhile, Telly and Casper (Justin Pierce) steal Telly's mom's money, help some friends beat an angry black teen, buy and smoke some weed, and go to a party at a friends' house where Telly brings his next conquest. During this time, Jennie rides a taxi whose driver tells her to ""stay happy since life's too short"" bringing an ironic point that lasts throughout the picture. Also appearing is Rosario Dawson who plays Jennie's friend Ruby who tested negative at the same clinic building as her friend. Many parents may not want their growing children to be exposed to such a provocative view of teen life, but if teens do watch Kids, they may think before doing many of the things depicted here...",Kids
8,wes-connors,Inside a Kid's Bed,9,9 June 2010,"Smooth-kissing Leo Fitzpatrick (as Telly) opens young virgin Sarah Henderson to the pain and pleasure of sexual intercourse. A promiscuous teenager, Mr. Fitzpatrick enjoys deflowering ""babies"" most of all in life - because virgins are pure and disease-free. After knocking his dirty socks in the sack, Fitzgerald meets rough alcoholic pal Justin Pierce (as Casper ""The Friendly Ghost""). They cop some booze and snacks from a corner store and visit one of those New York City apartments to hang and smoke - one of those places, usually 70-something street, where acquaintances give you a free buzz.Meanwhile, one of Fitzpatrick's old conquests, sweet sixteen-year-old blonde Chloe Sevigny (as Jennie), talks about sex with her girlfriends. Unusual in her group, Ms. Sevigny has only had intercourse once - with Fitzpatrick. She was bummed when he provided no follow-up attention, and sometimes sends wassups through friends. Sevigny's best friend Rosario Dawson (as Ruby) is much more sexually active, and fears she might have contracted AIDS. The girls go to the clinic; and, although Sevigny primarily goes to keep Ms. Dawson company, she learns she tested positive for the HIV virus.From there, Sevigny goes on a quest to find Fitzpatrick, who must also be HIV-positive. At the same time, Fitzpatrick is on a mission to deflower nubile young Yakira Peguero (as Darcy) ""Kids"" is an incredibly rich drama from virgin (i.e. first time) director Larry Clark.Handling this kind of material well isn't easy, and usually results in a stupid, offensive movie - though, probably, many still found it offensive. Mr. Clark gets excellent help from writer Harmony Korine and director of photography Eric Edwards. Catching a cast before they ""learn"" to act results in great characterizations. Leading players Fitzpatrick, Pierce, and Sevigny are incredibly etched in your mind. Dawson and dozens of others are also memorable - like the ""I have no legs"" man in his ""Kiss Me I'm Polish"" tee-shirt, wistful cabbie Leon Hascal, and even writer Korine, who puts Sammy Davis Jr. and Leo Gorcey in Heaven. ...umm...

9,Theo Robertson,More Controversy For Controversy's Sake,3,25 May 2005,"Larry Clark might think he's made a movie that will get people all over the world talking . It got me talking . It made me say "" More controversy for the sake of it "" YAAAAWWWNNN . But to be fair to Clark there's no such thing as bad publicity so any movie that sickens an audience with AIDS , rape , drug taking and violence all involving characters in their early teens can only be a good thing . Right Larry ? Clark might also think he's making a naturalistic movie by using a cast of total unknowns many of whom have no acting experience but the performances aren't natural - They're simply awful . Look at Leo Fitzpatrick who plays Telly , have you ever seen a more irritating performance ? Fitzpatrick does deserve some faint praise since he's the most outstanding non actor in a movie overwhelmed by outstanding non actors I have tried to appreciate Clark's later works like TEENAGE CAVEMAN but this director always goes out of his way to shock his audience usually with 15 years old saying "" I want to f*ck you so much baby "" and then getting down to the dirty deed while taking drugs . This very quickly becomes puerile and unworthy of discussion . How about making a movie with a plot and no sex Larry ? Or is that beyond your talents ?",Kids
10,preppy-3,Why all the controversy?,1,5 May 2005,"Movie (purportedly based on real events) about a bunch of amoral teens hanging out in NYC. It seems one of the guys is HIV+, doesn't know it and is spreading it around to every girl he sleeps with. His best friend is on drugs, swears constantly and sees nothing wrong with beating up people.There's more but you get the idea. I saw the NC-17 version (which really deserves an R rating--it's not THAT bad) and I'm wondering--what's the fuss? Teenagers drink, swear, attack people, have sex, take drugs, are HIV+. Does this really surprise anyone? I knew this before I saw the movie--this one shows nothing new. I'm really surprised that people find this shocking.Content aside, the film is badly directed with lousy sound and has virtually no plot--just a bunch of teens wandering around getting high, drinking etc etc. Also the rating (as I said before) is ridiculous. With that rating it means half the cast of the film can't even see it! Also I read a newspaper article when this came out. A bunch of teenagers saw this with their parents and found large portions of the film unbelievable. Also remember--this deals with kids in NYC, a very tough area. They do not represent all the teens in America.Dull, exploitive and pointless. I give this a 1.",Kids
11,Boba_Fett1138,Good as a realistic view on the mid- '90's life of kids.,8,30 December 2005,"The movie has a realistic, almost documentary like feeling, thanks to the way the movie is shot and acted. It provides a good and realistic view of the life of mid- '90's New York young teenagers. However the movie falls flat when it comes to shocking the audience. Some of all the things that are happening in this movie most probably happened to everyone once in their lifetime when they were a teenager, so everyone should be able to relate to some of the characters and events that are occurring in this movie, rather than be shocked by it. But the makers obviously tried to create more than just a realistic view on teenage life, it tried to shock the audience with its 'controversity' but due to the documentary style of movie making and the story that is almost non-present, it just falls flat as a 'shocker'.I would had preferred a movie with more story and consistency in it. It would had made the movie more interesting to watch and perhaps because of that it would had also worked better in terms of shocking the audience. Now the makers only try to be controversial without just having a real story. That simply didn't worked for me.Would this movie stop teenagers from having unprotected-sex, drinking alcohol and taking drugs? I don't think so...The movie doesn't make a powerful enough impression and the ending is too abrupt and leaves an unsatisfying impression. It would had so much more interesting to see what actually truly happened to all those character after the party at the ending. The ending only leaves us guessing. Sure we mostly know what possibly happens afterward but why not show it in the movie? Those could had been some really powerful and confronting scene's but it sadly now remains nothing more than a missed opportunity.Of course all of that doesn't automatically mean that this movie is a bad one. It still is good as a raw, honest and truthful portrayal of teenage-life. What makes ""Kids"" mostly a realistic movie is not only the documentary style of movie making, it's not only the 'acting', it are not only the events occurring in this movie but it is mostly the dialog that does this.This movie marks the debut for actresses Chloë Sevigny and Rosario Dawson who both were really excellent and believable in their roles. Both impressed me. The main character to be honest didn't exactly impressed me and to me it seemed an odd choice to cast Leo Fitzpatrick. He hasn't got the right look and talent for his role, so his character doesn't quite work and is not believable enough.In short, it works well as a view on the life of teenagers but when it comes to being powerful, controversial, making a statement and leaving a message it isn't good enough. I 'enjoyed' watching this movie and thought it was really good but it simply failed at what it really tried to achieve. It didn't really mattered to me though and I could still recommend this movie to everyone. It's not a movie that makes you start thinking but it is a movie that you'll remember.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Kids
12,Mr-Fusion,What a waste,3,22 June 2016,"I was fourteen years old when ""Kids"" came out, so there was no chance of my seeing this at the height of its notoriety. Why did it take me twenty years? Couldn't tell you, but I can say it's more than a little disappointing. It's not the shocking movie I was led to believe, but more like sloppy and confused.The whole point of this is to watch a select group of children engage in drink, drugs, and reckless sex as a lifestyle. Just to show how impersonal these characters are, we come away knowing the names of three: Telly, the serial spoiler of virgins, Casper, his protégé, and Jenny, who's just been diagnosed with HIV (*from* Telly). That's really all you need to know; any other character is just a passing face.My frustration throughout the movie was this: What the hell is the takeaway from all of this? There's no characterization, so I have no reason to care about what happens to these people. The movie's name implies that all kids are (deep down) messed up; but they're not, it's just this subset. If we're supposed to feel bad for the lives of this small group of people, why are they so faceless and ill-defined? Why is the one sympathetic character raped in the final moments, only to have the rapist wake up in the morning and ask, ""Jesus, what happened?"". Is Larry Clark trying to say that he's not repugnant, and it was just the substance abuse talking? So it's an anti-drinking movie? What the hell is your message? I wasn't outraged like I'd expected, and maybe that's due to the passage of twenty years' time. And I can't say how ""real"" this was - goodness knows I didn't grow up around these people. I'm certainly not going to claim any moral majority righteousness here. But there's only exploitation and shock value in place of actual real-life characters that demand my attention.Moronic, not horrifying.3/10",Kids
13,StevePulaski,"Not entertaining, but enlightening",10,12 June 2012,"So many scenes in Larry Clark's Kids are immoral and reprehensible that naming them all would eventually birth a list. The film, itself, is a remarkable piece, but the dialog in it is harsh, degrading, yet such a common standard today that it sadly seems like the norm. Filmed and released in 1995, it was certainly ahead of its time, and it's safe to say that things haven't gotten any better for society.Consistent readers will know that I love films with sharp, inviting social commentary on our world. I recently awarded three and a half stars to Bobcat Goldthwait's remarkably sharp film God Bless America, about a man and a young girl taking a loaded gun to things they have a disdain for in the world, such as empty-headed celebrities and hate-spreading political commentators. I awarded the same amount of stars to Falling Down, with Michael Douglas, another brilliantly crafted exercise providing a stern lecture on the arrogance of our world. And now, here is Kids, which comes straight out of left field for me. It is a poignantly made picture chronicling the lives of societal degenerates as they hopelessly wander the streets of New York City, unaccompanied and unprotected from the grittiness that lies ahead.Our ""protagonist"" is sixteen year old Telly (Fitzpatrick). The film opens with him kissing a twelve year old girl, and it eventually leads to sex after Telly forces the reluctant youth. He gives her the ""I care about you"" spiel, as he desperately wants to be the one to take her virginity. The inevitable happens, and afterwards, he meets his pal Casper (Justin Pierce) outside where he heartlessly discusses, in explicit detail, sex with the youth. Words fly to the viewer like bullets in a shootout, and we see the two casually walk up the city block, where they talk loud, shout obscenities, maybe shoplift a bottle of malt liquor, etc. Casper tells Telly that if he were to die tomorrow, he'd be remembered by the girls whose virginity he took for fifty plus years.Kids follows their footsteps in a ""day in the life"" kind of fashion. The two go to a drug-dealer's house, have a few hits off a joint, go to a party, get drunk, force each other to answer uncomfortable questions, etc, all in a parent-less, soulless environment. The subplot involves a group of girls, where the film decides to focus on two of them. One of them is HIV negative Ruby (Rosario Dawson in a stunningly offbeat role), who has had sex eight times. The other is HIV positive Jenny (Chloë Sevigny); she had sex once, with Telly. Jenny is sickened with anger and sadness, and drearily plods her way through the day at nightclubs and contemplates what will come of her future with this mishap.The film paints a tragic portrait of American youth. What's worse is the ignorance from parents. Telly stops quickly at his decrepit apartment to steal cash from his mother, kick his cat, and continue to take advantage of his life in a relentless fashion. What spawned such shocking behavior? Most likely years of careless parenting and neglect. His parents, we only see his mother, are hopelessly ignorant towards the fact their son is the degenerate from hell, having sex with young girls for temporary gratification. They ask no questions, possibly because they fear such answers. A shallow, yet common, example of parenting.What a remarkably sad picture this is. What an extremely well written one it is as well. Coming from someone still in school, a lot of it has been heard from me, yet thankfully not endured. It was penned by Harmony Korine, who also made a film I vow to never see. If the film proves anything, it proves that kids need to be taught to formulate an understanding of vital things such as art, philosophy, politics, and film itself. They need to be shown such mediums in order for sustainable growth to occur. My grandmother brought up a point about the vastly growing unemployment rate in America recently, and I think it's one that fits perfectly with this film; ""how do you expect to have a thriving country when you have louses inhabiting it?"" Starring: Leo Fitzpatrick, Justin Pierce, Chloë Sevigny, and Rosario Dawson. Directed by: Larry Clark.",Kids
14,Smells_Like_Cheese,An alarm clock for parents,6,27 September 2006,"I just watched ""Kids"", one of my friends, who is a huge independent film lover, recommended it. I've seen pretty much on what there is to see with the ""Teens on Drugs"" films, or even the sex type of films. While I think this was a poorly made movie and almost made me hate it, I don't think we should shy away from it, especially when there are a growing number of kids out there who are acting just as badly as these kids depicted in the movie. It's incredibly depressing how ignorant we are when we are kids, thinking we're invincible and trying to act all grown up.I think this movie shows what the youth of today is like, in some ways I was glad that it wasn't too dated, because it's kind of an important film. This behavior is the reason actually why I yell at my little cousins about rap music, not to get all holier than thou, I just feel that today's society is just horribly scarred with disrespectful hatred towards race and the opposite sex, it's really just scary to know that my future kids will be surrounded by this crap. But the reason I say this is an alarm clock for parents is that, they need to keep a better eye on their kids, and we can only hope for a better future and hope our kids don't turn out like these kids in the film.6/10",Kids
15,MovieAddict2016,Better than I thought it would be,7,26 May 2005,"I approached this expecting an explicit, controversial film for controversy's sake -- something disturbing and, let's face it, fabricated. I was surprised to find that yes, its aim is to make parents lock their children in their bedrooms for the next fifty years but also to truthfully examine modern-day childhood the way it really is.I knew kids like this, who talked like this, who listened to the Beastie Boys and who bragged about anything sexual they could think of. This movie follows the adventures and sexual pursuits of Telly, an AIDS-infected young teen who goes around taking advantages of virgins.We're led to believe Telly isn't aware of his disease but I think perhaps he does and gets off on possibly spreading it to others. One of his ex-girlfriends (Chloe Sevigny) becomes infected and spends the entire movie looking for Telly to warn him before he has sex with a young virgin.The end of the movie is pretty tragic and quite sad really. Yes, it is wrapped a bit too nicely in the sense that all this stuff happens to one group of kids within a period of a day or so, but by compacting many events into one scenario director Larry Clark makes quite a compelling little film/semi-documentary.One thing I should also mention is the dialogue, which I found to be the most realistic in any kid-starring film I've ever seen. He didn't just choose talented actors, he got the expressions, mannerisms and jargon perfected -- as a result it does come across as a very authentic, genuine film and even if you hate it, there's no denying it's pretty sickening. Whether you find that a good or bad thing is entirely up to you.",Kids
16,paul2001sw-1,The kids are (probably) all right,6,16 March 2005,"Larry Clark's 'Kids', an uncompromising look at the lives of a group of contemporary New York teenagers, attracted a certain amount of criticism on release for its supposed prurience. Viewed ten years later, it's a bit hard to see what all the fuss was about. Like most of the films criticised most virulently by the moralist right, it is in fact a deeply moral film itself, exposing but condemning, rather than celebrating, the hedonistic lifestyles it depicts. The portrait it paints is also very believable; yet the film is slightly less interesting than the controversy suggests. Kids behave badly: it's hardly news, and unlike Ken Loach, Clark never attempts to put his portrayal into a wider social context. Without this, it takes a storyline centred on HIV infection (a relatively rare phenomenon among heterosexuals) to provide some sense of urgency into proceedings. Also, it's noticeable that one aspect of teenage life is missing from the film, namely the tendency of teenagers to exaggerate, particularly when talking about sex: these kids actually have sex as often as they talk about it, which is I suspect atypical. If you meet some kids in the street talking filth and acting boorishly, you may well decide the best thing to do is ignore them and wait for them to grow out of it. If you really want to experience more of such behaviour, then watch this film, which to me seemed anything but prurient; but not a little dull.",Kids
17,secondtake,"The Shock of the Young, Worn Thin",5,26 July 2009,"Kids (1995)The Shock of the Young, Worn ThinIn a color, AIDS-era cinema verite approach, director Larry Clark made a big impression with Kids partly because of its frankness. Having sex is like eating candy and these teenagers know it might be bad for you but so what? And so it is a culture, in your face, of adolescent ignorance and need, with music and camaraderie and drugs filtering through the movie start to finish.On the one hand, it's disturbing to see these young people so callous and so ignorant, and yet so willing to go down or be consumed, through best friend pressure and peer pressure. And desire. On the other hand, it's not really a great movie experience. The pace is weirdly slow, even with all the pulsing music and cruising from room to room at parties or down streets from house to house, day and night. And the dialog, beyond the initial gasp you might have (depending on your age and experience, I think) is a little obvious and unexceptional. If this reflects ordinary life for some unordinary times, it only touches the surface of things. Friendships are forced, diversity is enforced, nastiness is too often sugar coated (not a contradiction), and the plot is what it is, without particular force.These qualities are defensible as part of a documentary-style approach--the actors, most of them amateurs, are made to do things as if they were real. There are a lot of movies that do the same, but here it seems significant because of their ages and the subject itself--the raw world of parties, sex, and disease in the 1990s. So to glam it up or dumb it down (either) would be to make it less harsh and less important as a window on that world. The strength of the film is its unflattering view on what is too often glitzed up on t.v. and in film, and here it is, supposedly nasty.Except it's not. There is a side to this that is simply familiar to kids that age. People I know say, yeah, I've been there. Without the HIV, as far as I know. And once you grasp the fact that this is just a reveling in the party sex scene, and in a way just an entry for those who want to see it without being there, the movie become just a movie, an entertainment. It's supposed social value is thin and thinner, and once you look at it for the fictional drama that it really is, there isn't a lot going on. Some cool lighting at the parties, some good acting given the thin script to work with, and a nice mise-en-scene. For psychological insight, social significance, or a great fictional experience, it's disappointing.",Kids

Leo Fitzpatrick is fantastic as Telly, he is extremely convincing, as his character is a liar, he tells all virgins that he loves and cares about them, yet all he wants is sex, as i found his character completely disgusting and vile, but that's what he was supposed to be doing, and he did fantastic at that, he deserves a lot of recognition, for his fantastic performance here. Justin Pierce is just as good as Casper, and his character is also just as disgusting, however he was extremely convincing, as he obviously has some problems, he drinks 2 or 3 big bottles Scotch every morning, and does drugs and party's all day and night, as he delivered a very good message at the end (geezez Christ what happened). Chloë Sevigny is very good at Jennie, she was likable, and i really felt sorry for her character, she did great. Rosario Dawson is hot, and did what she had to do well as Jennie's best friend, i liked her. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall its a must required viewing for everyone sooner or later. ***** out of 5",Kids
19,Bored_Dragon,"""What if you can't make yourself happy?""",7,24 April 2019,"A low-budget independent film that shows us one day in the life of a group of New York teenagers, a life that comes down to skate, parties, alcohol, drugs and ultimately sex. I grew up in the nineties and I recognized a lot from my own puberty and surroundings, but however crazy we were, this is really extremely extreme. And yet, as much as this seems exaggerated to most of us, even to those who have really gone through all sorts of things in life, for some children this is a harsh reality. It's not a masterpiece of cinema, but it's a film that should be seen for a better understanding of the world we live in.7/10",Kids

The main character is a kid who is HIV-positive but continues to have sex with as many girls as he can because it's all about himself. Director Clark is obviously fascinated by the New York City youth scene but it's tough going for anyone not into this lifestyle. There are some truly repulsive scenes, such as the one where a guy is battered senseless by a group of skateboarders. It is not clear what the point of this movie is.

21,Dr_Coulardeau,The dregs of society disguised as the youth of a nation,6,23 June 2015,"This is not a great film. Pictures, lighting, costumes and plot are in no way astounding. Probably not a very big budget film. Yet in 1995 some started calling it a masterpiece. It was not and it is not and it will not be. It is at best a manifesto and a testimony. Even Andy Warhol was better in his Flesh series of films.An underage kid, out of school and out of work and still taken care of by his parents is explaining us his philosophy reduced to a three letter word that he dares call love. He has no love for anything and anyone. He only has lust for the three letter word he calls love. It starts with one girl and it ends with another girl while the first girl is being taken advantage of by another boy while she is out of it due to some drugs. But in between, since this chap only takes virgins, the first virgin has been discovered and tested as HIV positive and the second who was tested negative will be tested positive afterwards, and since another boy takes advantage of the first girl he will be tested positive too later on. The lusty and lubricious boy is also an HIV spreader.And that chap dares say he only has that three letter word he calls love and if it were taken away from him he would have nothing at all. And make sure you hear me properly. He only takes and fancies virgins, and of course only girls. He is deeply anti-gay naturally, since he is a natural cock though closer to a chicken than to an adult rooster. But I guess he can cackle all the same. This vision of these young men and women all of them underage and all of them cheating one or two or more years, evolving and indulging in endless promiscuity, in never ending alcoholic binges and in perpetual drug taking, this vision is sickening but it is true to the marrow and the bone for a rather important minority of young people who are not able to find any stability in their own families. So they steal, even from their mothers, so they brutalize and eventually kill – who cares – those who stand in their way though the film only shows Chinese and blacks in such situation of the victims of these hooligans' thieving and mugging and brutalizing. These are the dregs of society and to show them without any kind of depth or humanity is more or less targeting the good society to show them how bad it could be if these were to be authorized up even only one rung on the social ladder. They deserve to be at the bottom and to stay there. Luckily for good society at the time, and still today, these dregs do not want to go up and they are satisfied with soaking in their own sweat and other bodily juices.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",Kids
22,insomniac_rod,Honest display of a teenager's life.,6,20 July 2006,"This is more of a documentary than a movie for teens. In fact, it was a clever idea to show the ""real"" lives of kids in this manner rather than making a movie based on clichès. I consider this to be a honest movie because the situations displayed in the movie are very common among teens.The acting is honest, real. Sevigny delivers the best performance of all the cast. I dug the direction and editing in the movie. As I said, it's like a documentary with the obvious Hollywood referenced script but still it's a movie to watch. It's like the younger version of ""Trainspotting"". A younger and more naive version.Some of the situations could be considered as over the top but overall, this is a must see if you are a teen who likes to think and does not scares that easily.

23,Anonymous_Maxine,"Kids has a healthy message, but the method of delivery is extremely uncomfortable.",5,1 September 2000,"The inner city is one of the worst places in the country to spend your formative years, and the makers of Kids add a bit of crime and self-destructive behavior to that in order to show some of the dangers of this type of lifestyle. Yes, the film has strong messages about drugs, AIDS, violence, and crime, among others, but it is so negatively overdone that the positive side of the film is almost cancelled out. There is so much that you have to look past before you can derive anything good from this movie that it is almost not worth watching. The acting, however, was strikingly convincing, but probably because not much actual acting is called for for a movie like this. I realize that violence is a part of life, especially in downtown New York City, but the violence as well as the excessive partying scenes and the gruesome sex was drawn out much more than necessary, and this took a lot away from the film. It's almost as though the movie resorts to this kind of thing to keep the audiences attention, when in fact it did the opposite. While not a completely worthless film, Kids just has so few redeeming values that it is hardly worth the time to watch it. I've always thought that the closer films are to reality, the better they are, but the thing that really ruined Kids was that it focused so hard on the drugs and the sex and the violent elements of reality, while virtually ignoring every other part of these kids' lives. A message like that does not need to be so hard to swallow in order to be effective.",Kids
24,videorama-759-859391,"An almost real reality happening before you, capsuled in a movie",8,1 May 2014,"Kids is shocking in your face stuff from the first frame. The magic of the film is that it has a documentary feel, not enough to make it documentary, where the other side of it is movie, but with a reality staring you in the face. Director Clark, has made the right choice too, using non thespians, where Chloe Sevingy as the aids infected Jenny, I must say, was an acting revelation. I know a lot of dudes who are exactly like Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick, another discovered talent) who don't respect any thing. All Telly loves is creating an impressive tally of deflorations of virgins, as seen in the first shock scene, having him, making it with a gullible girl. What disgusted me is when he left her apartment, before going to brag to his best friend, Casper, who down stairs, waiting for him. He produces a gob of spit and lets it drop from his lips, falling through the gap of stairway, proud with another victory. Kids is a pull no punches film, with a lot of expletive language and quite a bit of sex, but this is the generation we live in. The main plot, basically consists of Jenny finding out she's HIV positive, where she's only done it with guy: Telly. This day her whole world has come to an end, before her, which really had me imagining, what It'd be like if I was in her predicament. That taxi driver scene I really liked, with the cheery taxi driver, trying to be helpful but really doesn't know the extent of Jenny's sadness, where one foolish mistake can't cost your life. Now driven to find Telly, who's about to deflower another girl, much less gullible (the public pool scene I liked, almost semi erotic) it's a race to find him where they're about to do it on that same night, where a big party is happening, yo. I'll be honest, the film doesn't have the best script in the world, where it's chosen to go for reality instead. Clark's debut film, really works, rough, raw, and always compelling. If you want escapist fare, see other movies, but if you really hard edged reality, with strong themes and want to be shocked or challenged, this is one of the movies for you, with a script by Spring Breaker's Harmony Korine.",Kids

He is successful in his mission and tells his friend Casper about the deflowering. They then shoplift booze from a local store, go home, smoke some pot, and inhale nitrous oxide from balloons. They meet more young girls and engage in graphic sexual conversations. One of the promiscuous lolitas has tested positive for HIV aids but continues to have unprotected sexual relations.

26,freemantle_uk,Bleck Controversial Film,7,10 January 2009,"When a film starts out with a seventeen-year-old bloke seducing a twelve-year-old girl just because she's a virgin it clear that this film isn't going to be a light-hearted story.Kids focuses on two friends, Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick) and Casper (Justin Pierce), two seventeen-year-old skaters who seem unfocused in life. They take a lot of drugs, drink, steal and have sex with young girls. Telly only sleeps with virgins because he believes wouldn't get STD and just a lot better then someone who ready had sex. He deliberately seeks out young girls just so he can take their virginity, which shows he is a uncaring bastard and slightly pedophilic. The film focuses on one day in their lives in New York City. One of Telly's victims, 16-year-old Jennie (Chloe Sevigny) finds out she cause the HIV virus off Telly, the only bloke she had sex with. She searching the city to tell Telly that he has got the virus.This film tackles a lot of dark films from urban youth culture, sex, drugs, date rape, HIV and STDs. It shows how ruthless some blokes are to have sex. This film doesn't pull any punches. But at the same time the film seems aimless, just like its characters. As well the film two leads are completely unsympathetic, making you are not care or just wanting them to suffer. I think the film may have had a better impact focusing on Jennie who was a just girl who life is thrown into chaos or one of Telly's victims or a member of their crew who was having doubts about their activities. But then that's the way I would tackle it. The film takes a grim, realist approach, similar to British film-making which works for the storytelling. As well the young actors do well with a tough picture.If you look like this film I recommend watching Thriteen, Kidulthood and best of all A Clockwork Orange.I personally give Kids a 3 out 5.",Kids
27,Polaris_DiB,Blunt and unapologetic social reality,10,27 August 2010,"Okay, first thing's first. I've met these people.Now that statement is of absolute importance, because the thing is, this movie takes as its subject vacuous and unintelligent people, but the subject matter is far from. It takes a real ear for dialog and a real eye for character for Korine to write what he did and Clark to shoot what he did, and it speaks to their experiences as artists that they collaborated to provide such a real social statement. Larry Clark had already garnered critical attention from his photography of youth destroyed by drugs in suburban, WASP environments instead of the assumed urban black culture that most mainstream media was focusing on, and Korine sort of came out of nowhere with what is straight up a vicious and powerful send-up of those annoying made for TV movies about adolescence and AIDS you typically see in freshman puberty classes. The two of them collaborate here to provoke the audience not by creating a warning about a cause, but showcasing the effect.Going back to my initial statement. When I was in college I lived in a dorm suite instead of a dorm room, that housed six. One of my five roommates invited his friends over all the time, and they not only acted like, but engaged in the same discussions, activities, sexual and drug exploration, and nearly irrepressible search for stimulation that the kids featured in this movie do. I recognized them in every scene, in every word of dialog, in how the actors walked and how they talked, and for those who simply do not relate to this movie on that level, you simply have not met those people. The thing is, reel life here matched real life then, because that constant and profligate search for stimulation eventually crashed down on all of them. Most were kicked out of school. Some were hospitalized. Only a couple really survived and went on to reclaim their lives.The story arch, as I said, is familiar from pastel made-for-TV warning movies, the ones that show a kid hurt by the awful knowledge of HIV but who eventually turns that black mark into a positive statement by getting support from family and friends and telling the world, or whatever sappy idiocy involves an 18 year old trying to look much younger and sentimental music flowing through every scene. This is not that movie. Sevigny's character's search for Telly takes her through the lifestyles of a huge proportion of people who don't pay attention to such messages because they're too busy becoming overstimulated and holding off the crash as long as possible. It slows her down and stops her momentum as she cannot keep up with the irrepressible need these people have to push forward to the next excitement, the next sexual encounter, the next drug, the next party.The cross-cutting between the guys' conversation and the girls' conversation is what happens. I've been at those parties. I've heard these things, and said some of them myself. Korine's eye looks towards all of the messages and all of the people, and shows a poor, lower class neighborhood that nurtures this sort of behavior because there's no ability for it to go unchecked (where are the fathers? Where are the mothers? Where is the money? These questions are all answered). Korine's fascination with the derelict, disabled, and diseased is used for much richer significance here than Gummo, as the encounter on the bus with the legless man and the boys' empathy for him foreshadows their future in his position, and the montage of homeless, insane, and derelict people at the end provides an argument for where they came from (the very neighborhoods they inhabit). This is an America people don't want to see because it doesn't have any moralistic answers for how to prevent what happens, kind of like Gummo, but Gummo's problem is that Korine was too interested in expanding the provocateur cinema of this attempt into blank symbols like a boy in pink rabbit ears dancing through various scenes to let the social realism stand on its own merit.It also showcases a point in time where assumptions have changed. There are in groups and out groups here, but they are not so divided along ethnic lines; on the split side, the kids maliciously attack a stranger and harass a homosexual couple. Furthermore, these tykes are YOUNG. Anyone not impressed with the performances of the actors, or even wants to get upset about how young they actually are, again are probably ignorant of the fact of the reality behind what is being presented, with no attempt or desire on the part of the filmmakers to hide or turn their camera away from the content that needs to be seen.A lot that was established here has continued. Korine has involved himself fully in provocateur cinema from Dogme 95 to Trash Humpers, while Clark has continued to focus on subcultures and self-destruction. Chloe Sevigny has almost a subcareer in acting by choosing many roles in independent and foreign films where women become the victims of impulses beyond their control, either from the obsessiveness of men (Brown Bunny) to corporately supported snuff (Demonlover). Kids, luckily, stands out in all three of their careers as one of the more accessible and well-known, and it's a good thing that it continues to be seen and shock people, as it's pretty much one of the most concise and unapologetic statements made by these filmmakers.--PolarisDiB",Kids
28,dee.reid,"""You guys are sick, you know that?""  A character in the film says to a group of young boys who just beat the crap out of a guy in the park.",10,14 July 2004,"The first real thing anyone can do when watching an expose on certain aspects of American culture is to ask yourself a very hard question, ""Is this real?""I had to do that with this film.Watching Larry Clark's 1995 film ""Kids,"" an authentic and frightening expose of some particularly callous and reckless teenagers in New York City, one cannot wonder if the film is a brilliant commentary on the state of America's youth or is a cleverly exploitive portrait of a corrupted culture.I believe the latter. It depicts, with stunning authenticity, the chilling underside to a culture that abides by its own standards while tossing away the teachings and hard-learned lessons of an elder generation.First of all, I wouldn't believe anyone who says that this movie is hogwash or offers nothing close to a solution. Well, the first question that people should ask themselves is, do they know anyone like the kids in the movie? I do. I recently graduated from high school and I knew several people who were quite like the kids in this film. This film set out to do one thing: to show American parents, ""Hey, these are your kids. Do you know what they do when you're not around?""Thoughtful people will ask themselves that. This is a film that deserves a thoughtful audience as a thoughtful crew made it and took the risks associated with bringing such harsh subject matter to the screen.Like last year's ""Thirteen,"" ""Kids"" shows youth on the edge. These ""kids"" are perfectly amoral and addicted. These kids aren't all right; they're extremely dangerous.There isn't a whole lot to the story, other than it chronicles an eventful day in the life of Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick), his friend Casper (Justin Pierce) and their inner-circle of similar-minded, sex/drug-crazed associates. Telly has made it a duty to ""deflower"" as many girls as possible and later brag to his friends about his latest conquest; but by day's end, guaranteed, he would've done it again (a record for him to do two girls in one day). The main conflict of the story surfaces about 30 minutes in, when Jennie (Chloe Sevigny) discovers that she had contracted HIV from Telly during their first sexual encounter, and it becomes her mission to track him down before another young girl shares her fate.This is one powerful and dangerous film that is not for the faint of heart, as it is authentically bleak. There is no hope for the characters in the end; that is just how realistic this film is. The film is also filled with shockingly real images, and a wall of furious sound to drive home its key points. These are the kids of yesteryear, the forgotten generation; these kids are America's worst nightmare because they are young, dumb and just do not care; the fact that they do not care makes them especially dangerous.As I stated before, the imagery is extreme and frightening. If there ever was an honest thing these kids ever did, it would have to be willfully giving change to the less fortunate (a man with no legs who rides a skateboard on the subway). We also get images of younger children, swearing, drinking, smoking, talking like adults; trying to fit in with their peers who are not much older than they are. I was actually quite frightened by some baby pictures of our main character and then I see what's on screen.Then-newcomer Leo Fitzpatrick puts a face on a sleeping monster in America: the doomed generation of young people that disregard older generations completely and follow their own set of corrupted values. Telly is reckless and stupid; it is impossible to really sympathize with his character, even though we probably are. But it is difficult to do so, mainly because of his preference for deflowering girls younger than him (the first girl we see him with is only 12; he's about 15 or 16) and that could open up discussion for Telly possibly being a borderline pedophile.Where are the parents? One could very easily ask that question. Strangely enough, Telly lives with his mother and baby brother. She is the only parent in the film and she seems as every bit as irresponsible as her misguided son.Watching ""Kids,"" I couldn't believe how real it is, how it sucks the viewer into its dark, dangerous, and seductive world; it's easy to see how a weak person could believe that what goes on in this movie is cool. It begs the most fundamental question any responsible person could ever ask, ""Do you know where your children are?""It is a question that every good parent should ask when their teenage son or daughter steps out that front door and into the ""real"" world.""Kids""  10/10",Kids
29,fertilecelluloid,"Disorganized, sloppy ""study"" of wayward youth",2,18 February 2006,"A better title might have been ""Obnoxious"" or ""Bores"". Resembling an extended Calvin Klein commercial, Larry Clark's disorganized cinematic snapshot of a specific teen scene can barely maintain interest. One obnoxious jerk after another jumps into bed with a naive bimbo and treats her like crap when he's done. The jerks compare bedtime stories, smoke dope, swear, screw new bimbos, swap them like baseball cards, and mouth pseudo-cynical philosophy. I didn't find it shocking or explosive or dramatically interesting. I found it boring. Clark, who has made one great film, ""Bully"", and another interesting film, ""Ken Park"", drops the drama ball completely in this nihilistic mess that tries like hell to feel like a Greg Araki movie.

Harmony Korine, who wrote the screenplay at 19, is less a prodigy than an irritating show-off, jumping up and down to try and draw attention to his supposedly ""taboo"" scenarios and characters; Larry Clark's direction (his debut) shows only glimpses of the grit and texture that would more fully manifest themselves in his future efforts (especially ""Bully""). The film does hit on some aspects of youth culture with a proficient accuracy (the 'rave' sequence, for instance), and the film does contain a great standout performance from Chloe Sevigny as a girl whose single sexual encounter resulted in contracting the HIV virus. Yet other than the shock value of having a character, infected with AIDS, who lives to deflower virgins, much of ""Kids"" comes across as shallow and tedious.",Kids
31,p-stepien,Portrayal of expectations,5,13 September 2012,"In cinema verite style ""Kids"" invites us into the lives of sex-driven teenagers crazed on scoring, addicted to cussing and verging on self-destructive practises. Bound to big controversy when first released due to its explicit nature, which involves sexual promiscuity, including date rape, and drinking / drug binges of minors, some barely out of puberty, the movie still packs a punch out of the blue, suggesting how break-through the movie still is.Verging on a exploitational, not withstanding the young age of the scriptwriter, through its naturalistic quasi-documentary storytelling ""Kids"" attempts to convey a sense of teenage frustration and reality as verging on nihilistic and devoid of wider purpose. Through the extrapolated portrayals many viewed the movie as a wake-up call for American parents, whereas it seems more like preaching to the choir, the repetitive belief, that this generation is more depraved then 'back in the days'. The amoral behaviour of kid characters is suggested to be representative of the wider population, but essentially shows a certain fragment of it, maybe not marginal, but certainly dysfunctional and a minority. Sacrificing reality with shock factor and sensatonalism, dimishes the overall worth, also misleading the audience as to the real state of the youth, subverting certain reviewers to gasp in baseless shock as to modern-day teenagers.Backed with then unknown actors Larry Clark however manages to introduce a sense of dramatic realism, which despite not playing as a moral compass, points out to issues rarely portrayed / touched in contemporary cinema, but one so basic as the hormonal storms of adolescence, coupled with the relatively recent change in perceptions of adulthood. Since the XIX century concepts of age of sexual initiation dramatically changed increasing the age of consensual intercourse, naturally without altering natural sexual tendencies at age 14-17. After a period of hypocritical chastity enforced by parents on youth, for years now we have entered a phase of individualistic self-realisation among kids, but devoid of the moral compass of parents often too detached to understand the necessities of constructive parenthood. Despite its many flaws ""Kids"" still remains poignant, despite no soliloquy on morality to point a direction, just as a warning sign to parents as to societal risks in peer groups and the tough educational input needed to help guide through this emotionally rampant phase of growing up.",Kids

33,lambiepie-2,The idea got to me more than the film.,8,16 January 2004,"No matter how you cut this film up, it's disturbing. In 1995, my generation had children -- young teen aged children for they had their kids when they were young teens. And through those eyes is how I watched this film, and that is why it disturbs me and why its a must watch at least once for those who think everything is fine and dandy among teens -- even today.Possible Spoilers ahead --On the outside, the teens in this movie seemed to be living the life of any teen: partying, sleeping, not-caring about the next day, and sex. But for these teens, they had to face one more thing in their element, and that was STD's. Not just any STD, the big one: HIV and AIDS. These teens seem reckless because they KNOW of this STD but still continue their behavior.One teen, of whom we follow in this film, has quite the reasoning for ""avoiding"" the disease of HIV and AIDS and still has sexual relations with as many teen girls as he can. Being a teen, he still hadn't grasped the reality of lies, of being careful, of maturity and restraint. Notches in his belt and bragging rights are his priority.What we get to experience in this film is a segment of teens who don't seem to have much parental direction. Many times I have heard: ""Where are the parents"" when folks have seen this film. The parents are where they always are: Working..thinking they ARE parenting...to teens who may or may not hear the messages.  There is no Hollywood ending, the film is as low as low can get and ends even lower. Many parents who saw this film remarked: ""Not my child. I'll talk to them."" But that is the point of the film.
This absolutely can be your child. And it absolutely can be the child your child is hanging around.For all of us who were teens once, we know all too well how this can happen.If you're looking for a film with a moral..this isn't it. It is a film that will be interpreted differently by many who see it. Some may see it as kiddie porn, some may see it as schlock, some may see it as unbelievable without proper parenting - and think throwing in a religion as a teaching would help. Maybe..obviously maybe not.I see it as disturbing, horrific and time to get into serious actions for the benefit of our teens to live and grown into responsible adults regardless of their economic background, 2 or single parent household, and sexual education.",Kids
34,TheUnknown837-1,Clark's brilliant and hauntingly accurate portrait of the bad side of humanity in our younger generation grips you by the throat and never lets go.,9,6 November 2010,"There are two highly, and deservedly, controversial movies dealing with the issues of drug and alcohol abuse, underage sex, lack of control, and the preteen and teenage minority of urban America. One of them is ""Kids"" and the other is ""Bully."" The former is a haunting work of art; the latter is a clunk of garbage. Both were directed by the same man, Larry Clark. I saw ""Bully"" first about a year ago and I was blown out of my mind by how offensive and atrociously cruel that movie was and how it redeemed itself in no way. I initially condemned Mr. Clark as a director and vowed never to see another movie of his again.Then I happened to see the Siskel & Ebert review for his first movie ""Kids"" and after much deliberation, decided to give this controversial filmmaker a second chance. I am so glad that I did.In many respects, ""Kids"" and ""Bully"" are much the same movie. They're both frighteningly brutal, appalling in their explicit content and vulgar dialogue, and they expose the nasty undercurrents in the younger generations of today, especially in urban cities where parental control (or control of any kind) seems all but present. So why is ""Kids"" a great movie and ""Bully"" an awful one? Because while ""Bully"" only pretended to have a purpose, ""Kids"" *has* a purpose and it never once dumbs down on that. It's a sick and disgusting picture, but it's also somewhat of a wake-up call. And I can fairly say now that as a reviewer and film-goer, I can forgive Mr. Clark.""Kids"" is set in the drug-riddled streets of New York. We see very little of parents, or adults for that matter, and focus on a group of rambunctious, vulgarity-spitting, lecherous teenagers who are devoted to getting drunk, abusing drugs, and giving away their virginity. The most sickening of them is Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick). Not because he can charm young girls enough to seduce them into deflowering them, but because he's simultaneously signing their death warrants with the HIV virus. One of his victims (Chloe Sevigny) discovers she has AIDS because of her one-night stand with him and as she slowly suffers, searches the city to confront him. Meanwhile, Telly is trying to seduce his next victim while he and a group of other nasty individuals roam unsupervised through a place as horrific as any drug underworld. More shocking is that this is just a day in the life for them.Even more shocking is the daunting realization that this is one hundred percent accurate and we must commend Mr. Clark and screenwriter Harmony Korine, the latter in particular. His screenplay is the core of why this picture is so powerful. He writes his dialogue without any apparent flow or structure, as if the behavior of his characters are not even up to him. The actions of the characters are unpredictable, as they would be. I also really commend him for his choice to not close up with an obligating-style ending, but to choose a really haunting, crusher of one instead. And Mr. Clark shoots his film in a strong, visual-focused documentary approach with long takes from his camera swinging back and forth between the gossiping teenagers. He also pays good attention to their surroundings, showing the conditions and lack of concern from their peers and elders that resulted in their being this way. Because he has a screenplay that is focused and sharp (""Bully"" did not) his movie has a purpose and even his seemingly pornographic shots have a purpose as well.The content is oftentimes appalling, but it also has a purpose. This time I must appreciate Mr. Clark's boldness and reluctance to be contrived. Whereas I got the sense he was indulging the drug use and sex in ""Bully,"" here he clearly defines his intentions of turning our stomachs. These particular kids are scum and they are a product of their scummy environment. He wants to show us that. So the scenes of underage sex are jaw-dropping. They do not turn on the audience; they appall. Furthermore, he does not flood the screen with images of naked teenage bodies and relies on our imagination at crucial moments to exploit the real horror. He balances the explicit and implicit with professional craftsmanship.""Kids"" is a very tough movie to watch and tough to enjoy, but I must confess that it is, to my mind, a truly great film. As I sat there watching it, I was appalled and disgusting and flabbergasted, but at the same time, I was drawn in. Mr. Clark's brilliant portrait of the bad side of humanity in our younger generation grips you by the throat and he never lets go. Not once. He's also got some very strong performances from his cast which include Leo Fitzpatrick, a very young Rosario Dawson, Chloe Sevingy, and the late Justin Pierce whose brilliant performance reminds me so much of the scumbags that I had the displeasure to know in my adolescent years. I personally managed to avoid their paths of life and now looking at ""Kids,"" I am even more thankful that I did.",Kids
35,film-critic,The Youth of our Nation.,9,7 November 2004,"Larry Clark has broken the boundaries with this film. Not only is it one of the realist depictions of our nation's youth, but it also brings the fear of the AIDS virus closer to home. This is not a piece of fictitious work, this is brutal honesty in its rawest form. While many will knock this film because of the pornographic nature, I saw past that and witnessed the birth of the next plague. Writer Harmony Korine has taken the world of our children and transferred it to the big screen. I never once saw this as a shock film or disgusting, I saw honesty and truth behind every scene. This is really what is happening in our backyards. Kids are not as young as they used to be, and are growing up in a world with more possibilities and distractions than ever before. This is the modern world, and these are the newest leaders. While this is not what happens with all of our youth, it does paint a beautiful picture of just a handful. This is not just a story about NYC, it is a message for every city. This is happening all over this country. In the wealthy, poor, and everything in-between, our children are experimenting without any form of education or realization of their actions. This is not a film that will leave a very good taste in your mouth, but then again it isn't supposed to. This is better and more honest than any reality program out there and it will scare the daylights out of you. This is our world, we must change it.Grade: ***** out of *****",Kids
36,Stampsfightclub,Shocking and controversial drama,8,6 September 2008,"Kids follows teenagers Telly and Casper around New York, two guys who have sex with virgins, rob stores and do drugs, unaware that one of Telly's former flings is coming to tell him she is positive with HIV.In one of the most controversial films of the 90's, Kids depicts lives of teenagers in a shocking and realistic film with hard gritty ideologies of illegal activities encoded for dramatic and realistic effect.The main ideology which will get you thinking is sex. Telly, a teenage stereotype, epitomises what a teenager is believed to be like in current society, with his mind on sex, drugs and booze, and is justified through a very shocking opening scene as he lies in bed with a virgin, seducing her. His talk with best friend Casper after is shockingly horrible and very unforgiving, but will instantly get you immersed into his life.As epitomized in films such as Kidulthood, teenagers have this view on sex and think its OK without protection, and Kids shows the dramatic consequences through Jennie, who has only had sex once but catches HIV.This dramatic ideology is essentially realistic to hit out at teenagers, to warn them of the dangers out there, and picks up on such a valid point that the film is watching for this preaching factor alone.The film takes place during one whole day, following Casper and Telly around New York as they get involved in robbery, drugs and parties. Despite the heaviness of the issues, the plot moves at a steady pace, with frequent dramatic moments.Chloe Sevigny (Broken Flowers) gives an excellent performance as Jennie, who you will be in tears with during the course of the film, and Jennie gives a balance of equality by being the strong minded realistic female in the plot, against the fantastical sex loving boys.The ending is unbelievably open and opens the plot into even more controversy, but will take another watch to get a true grip of some ideologies. Kids lacks in a few places but the strong realistic issues regarding teenage life will have you open mouthed come the shocking ending.",Kids

Having said that this film is engrosing and fascinating to watch , sometimes disturbing but mostly annoying. These are the most immature kids i have ever seen on the big screen yet they asked to do to each other only what adults are capable of.

Filmed in low-budget documentary style we the viewers are lead to believe that what we are seeing is the real low-down skinny on urban teens. Maybe so, although I hope not. The movie almost works, but the moviemakers desire to shock drives them a tad over the top, and the documentary style doesn't allow a story to develop.

No one said anything, and then another guy on the couch said ""I saw part of it in rehab..."" ""Oh hell yeah dude, put that on!"" was the consensus after that. And holy god this movie is so relentless and violent, not saying it wasn't true to the lifestyles of those it was trying to portray, but goddamn, i don't know anyone that talks like the one dude that goes around infecting everyone with the hivvy.

There is a legendary line from one of the male characters: Once in your life you get out and then the whole life you try to get back inside. He obviously thought of female lower organ, of which whole heterosexual males are so fond of. Let us not forget lesbians and trans. The young actors acted well, script was interesting and I was pleasantly surprised on how NYC life is well portrayed in that film. It is the Big Apple and it can be so confusing and dumbfounding for teens growing in it. NYC changed a lot since those times, including 9/11 events.

Give me minute to recover from this earth shattering news. oh, wait, they have always been doing that. We just ignored it. I remember now. Well, it is a good thing Larry Clark told those seven people in Oklohoma who didn't know. If there is one thing that really disturbed me about this movie, it was the rape scene at the end. It was filmed in such a quiet, restrained fashion that it was almost erotic. There was no fighting or screaming. It was not like the earlier scenes of rough consensual sex either, which were also disturbing. What disturbed me was I wasn't sure if the scene was intentionally disturbing. Did Clark simply make the scene erotic to make it more powerfully sickening? I think so. The sad thing is whenever I hear people I know talking about this movie, they talk about how hot this scene is. Maybe, I need better acquaintances. I found the movie boring mostly as it featured another typical Leo Fitzpatrick performance. It is important for the above mentioned scene's power and for a good performance by Chloe Sevigny. I don't see how parents, role models, can not be partially blamed for the actions of kids. Even though those ""talk to your children"" ads are manipulative, the message is still a good one. I hope that is what Larry Clark intended with this movie. So, parents talk to your kids.",Kids
42,PIST-OFF,A day in the lives of teens in NYC in the 90's,9,22 April 1999,"Kids is a brutally honest movie. It is funny, scary, violent, sad, and sexy movie, but brutally honest above all. It follows through the course of a day of some city kids. It shows with unflinching reality, how they hang out, do drugs, talk, walk, act, have sex, buy drugs, fight, live, and die. The director does squeeze a bit much into a single day but that's so the viewer gets the idea. The cast of amateurs adds to the  documentary feel of this. An excellent soundtrack is good but somewhat off center of the movie's brutality. I love the scene of the kid being beaten to death with skateboards. No movie can ever accurately capture teens. For two reasons. One, most young directors are in their late twenties and early thirties therefore they have no knowledge on what modern teenagerhood is like. Two, teenagers are very very diverse. They all go to extreme ends of social groups and so there is no average teenager. Plus different areas produce different groups. City kids are completely different then near suburban kids, who in turn are even more different then high class suburban kids, and I don't even know what rural kids are like. However despite the fact that it is impossible to make an accurate movie about teens, this one comes close. It has fine writing that doesn't even seem like it was written. And good urban area cinematography.",Kids

Although i could relate to most of stuff, there were some moments that didn't work out for me. For example, watching girls discussing oral sex wasn't convincing. On the other hand, it might mean i simply wasn't the target group of the movie.What Kids does well is showing growing up without much parents' involvement in an urban environment. In fact, after watching Kids you might even ask yourself whether you'd want to have children in such a merciless world. In the case that this is the real world, that is.",Kids

This movie was given a ""R"" rating by the MPAA, while I usually agree with the MPAA, I feel that this movie deserves a stronger rating.

I was kind of HORRIFIED to be honest and had to think for a bit whether to let them watch it. I decided, yes, they should watch it as a cautionary tale, because lets be honest, you can't stop your kids from having sex unless you plan to chain them to your house. Better to educate them and while, I would not have chosen to get this movie for her as my own idea. The fact that she asked for it and that she would probably find another way to get it if I said no did affect my decision.I also called her pals mom first to ask her permission, as this movie is very graphic especially back in 1997 before internet blew up. And porn became as regular as video games in a teens life. :(
I did talk to both of them after they viewed it. That's about the best thing I could think to do.Scares me all these years later having a 15 year old grandson who has grown up in this internet world with kids and teens getting just TOO Much exposure to sex, and really violent sex, and so many predators everywhere and on the internet and their NOT discussing it with a parent.

The hype.  The naughty NC-17 rating.  The big artsy controversy. Yes, it must be the movie KIDS!  The story is simply REFER MADNESS except its about sex.  The movie is some out-of-touch parent's worst nightmare put on film.  Completely unreal.  Did you SEE sex taking place in the movie KIDS?  Did you even see any nudity (outside of the baby breast feeding)? Where was the nudity?  Where?  There was none.  Zip.Take a look at the last part of the movie: The last 13 y/o virgin, the one who did not drink alcohol or take drugs, the one who had to ask her mother's permission before she could go swimming, and one of the few people in the movie who seemed mentally normal... this is the same attractive, clear headed, young virgin female who:1) was attracted to a smelly, speech-impaired guy 2) had sex with the smelly, speech-impaired guy 3) was seduced by the smelly, speech-impaired guy after only a few hours of courting 4) spent, without a second thought, a whole night away from home 5) spent, without her mothers permission, the night away from home 6) slept deeply, in a strange bed, under unusual conditions, and just after a major change in her sexuality, into the late morning.

How many young teen females, who are at the most awkward stage of their sexual lives, have no sense of modesty? Remember the beginning of the park scene when the speech-impaired guy spends about 8 minutes shaking everyone's hand?

48,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,7,11 March 2005,"Larry Clark's debut is a bleak and unrelentingly honest look at how city teen life can be, which stirred much controversy upon its release, and is still powerful today. Drugs, sex, violence and no remorse for one's actions all make this daring film-making, and almost essential viewing.It is Telly's mission in life to have sex. Preferably with under aged girls, if they are virgins-all the better. The film opens with his seduction of one such girl; he spouts all the sincerity and caring words he can muster and she gives in. As soon as it is over he is out the door, mission accomplished, and telling his friend Casper everything that happened. We follow the two around their city, stealing, talking about sex, fighting, getting drunk and stoned. They are part of a young gang which seems to have spread throughout the whole city. Morals are non-existent, except their belief that homosexuality is evil, or at least a joke. Also a joke is AIDS, and all other STDs, as none of them have ever heard of anyone who has had any. We see the juxtaposition of guys and girls talking about their experiences, and planning ahead for the night. Jennie has only been with one guy, Telly, and because one of her friends has been with 9 guys, she decides to go to the sex clinic as support. Her friend comes out clean, but Jennie tests positive for HIV. Jennie begins a very slow race to find Telly, perhaps before he can destroy another girl's life. Telly is once again on the prowl.Each performance here is outstanding, particularly Leo Fitzpatrick and the late Justin Pierce as Casper. None of the characters repent what they have done, it may be all they have, and they enjoy it. Even Jennie appears to be passive, talking drugs when she should be finding Telly. None of the sex scenes are particularly explicit, but it is the fact of their age, of course, which caused such an uproar. However, this behaviour obviously does go on, you only have to hang around most city streets at night to witness it. The violence is also cleverly edited, but like the sex and drugs, we only need a glimpse to set our imagination and horror off. There are no happy endings or answers here, perhaps giving evidence to those who say this is just exploitation. Clark is simply exposing what does happen in places, maybe in the hope that we can do something about it. The fact is though that teens have, and probably always will continue to do these things, but maybe not with such a lack of remorse.7.5 out of 10",Kids
49,Coffee_in_the_Clink,Teenage Wasteland,9,3 November 2021,"When Jenny is brought into the office at the clinic to find out the results of her STD test - the result that will tell her she is HIV positive - the office door slams behind her like a coffin lid. She then sets off on an odyssey across Manhattan to locate Telly, the only boy she has had sex with, to tell him he also has the virus and to stop him passing it on to his next conquest. This is one of the most chilling, yet subtle, scenes in an otherwise shocking film that holds back no punches it its brutal authenticity. One of the most controversial films ever made, ""Kids"" is still as relevant today for its portrayal of wayward youth without morals. A culture of disenfranchised teenagers who can't see beyond the night ahead, or the gloom of the next morning. Leo Fitzpatrick and Chloe Sevigny are superb.

Truly an excellent piece by Larry Clarke, finally someone who is not afraid to do what he wants and does what he pleases. Gritty and raw, there is no escaping the grasp of Kids.

52,D_Burke,Heavy Film with a Self-Evident Undercurrent of Sadness,9,5 November 2009,"""Kids"" is a film you really have to be in the right mindset for when you see it. It is not a film to watch with your friends on a Saturday night when you're looking for entertainment. The truth is that this film is very emotionally frustrating without coming out and telling you why you should feel conflicting emotions for these characters. It's a heavy film indeed, but it's also one everyone should see as a cautionary tale.In a lot of ways, ""Kids"" is full of interesting contradictions. It's called ""Kids"", yet it's not a movie that kids should watch unsupervised. The kids in the film are living life to the fullest, yet they are doing damages to themselves and their futures that they don't realize on this given day, but eventually will in the days that follow. The viewer knows, or can presume, what will become of these teens, and that is what is saddest about this film.If you come to the end of this film and find yourself having an intense hatred for Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick), that's a good sign. Telly is the primary main character in this film, and the more he's on screen, the more he epitomizes the word ""scumbag"". I'm 27 years old and have no daughters or sisters, but this character makes me fear for my unborn daughters. He's a nihilistic, predatory, narrow-minded individual who takes advantage of 12 to 13 year old girls for immediate gratification at their expense.Telly's method of seducing his women are interesting, because I could tell he was being completely insincere. Can't women see through that? Plus, he's not a particularly good looking guy, but that's not to say he wouldn't be able to get away with his objective.It's the introduction of Jennie (Chloe Sevigny, who thankfully went on to bigger and better roles) where you realize how despicable Telly really is. Jennie claims to only have had sex with Telly, who deflowered her about a year earlier (and yes, Telly actually uses the word ""deflower""). When she leaves a testing center finding out that she is HIV-positive, that's when the story really begins, not to mention the grim reality check.I've read other reviews (negative ones) where people were shocked by the amount of drug use, alcohol consumption, promiscuity, and violence there was in the film. Except for the scene where Casper (Justin Pierce) gets into a fight with another skater for merely bumping into him, I wasn't as shocked with the other elements. By nature, teens are full of raging hormones and are eager to experiment. However, I'd like to think most are not willing to do so mindlessly at other people's expense.These teens appear to be completely without adult supervision, which is how I wondered how they got that empty apartment they had at the end of the film. The point is, though, that despite the fact that the MPAA almost rated this film NC-17, teens need to watch this film with parents to know what not to do. Of course, teens shouldn't be supervised 24/7, nor should they be. The problem with the teens in this movie was not their lack of supervision, but their sheer ignorance. These kids are idiots, period.More than that, though, I hope and pray to God that there are no teens like Telly, or that there are as few as possible. My heart broke for characters in the film like Jennie and Darcy (Telly's latest interest). Regardless, the film was well shot given its budget, the dialogue was so real it was scary, and the film didn't try to conform or please Hollywood standards. I respect it for those reasons, but it's a movie I probably won't see again for a long time.On a final note, I read somewhere that Leo Fitzpatrick was working in a skateboarding shop after the film had premiered, and several teens expressed their hatred toward him because of this film. I'm sure Mr. Fitzpatrick is a good guy in reality, but that anecdote gave me hope in today's teens.",Kids

The abominable direction pretends to awake social conscience with a wagging finger, but revels in pictures of child nudity and aggression. A real understanding of and empathy for the protagonists is nowhere in sight, neither is the director capable of an unbiased clinical character study. What we really get is a tasteless exploitation of issues like rape and AIDS to generate cheap suspense.These kids are treated like freaks in a traveling show, not human beings.To see how this kind of pic is done the right way, watch any Michael Haneke movie instead.1 out of 10 points is even too much for this filth",Kids

They skateboard. None of these behaviors are particularly shocking, and to show them doing only these things and not having any other interests or things to do seems boring at best and prurient at worst. I guess director Larry Clark wanted to show what kids do, but I think that this depiction of young people is particularly helpful. It is a shallow, superficial, extremely circumscribed view of kids. I think there is enough misinformation about kids without depicting one aspect of their lives and not depicting another. It's a very limited and ultimately, useless depiction of a group which is often misrepresented on film. Rosario Dawson made her debut in this film and Chloe Sevigny also got her first exposure in it. The script by Harmony Korine is bland and unimaginative and it's not nearly as entertaining as his trainwreck appearance on David Letterman.

It was one that delivered strongly on its promise of being a disturbingly realistic depiction of urban teen life. The film was very effective in its delivery, but it was so gratuitously graphic in dialogue and nihilism that it literally felt like a chore to watch. 
Sure, the film was realistic I suppose but what was it really trying to achieve besides making me super uncomfortable and scaring me into wearing a condom? 
In summary, Kids isn't necessarily a bad film but it's just so vulgar and non-judgemental about it's disturbing sexual content involving teens that it's hard to see where the filmmakers stood with the overall message. The film never really comes up with a solution for the problem, which is refreshing in some aspects but overall meaningless when covering a subject like that.",Kids
59,Afracious,A depressing & dull look at NYC youth,6,20 May 2001,"This is a controversial look at teenage life in New York City by Larry Clark. Written by Harmony Korine (director of Gummo), it focuses on two skateboarders, Telly and Casper. Telly boasts about how he likes to have sex with virgins. ""There's nothing better than deflowering young women"", he tells us. Casper doesn't say as much, he'd much rather steal beer from liquor stores and savagely beat up a man in a park for getting in his way. Most of the characters take drugs and talk about sex. The other main character is Jennie (Chloe Sevigny of Boys Don't Cry, Gummo & American Psycho). She has a blood test and finds she is HIV positive - but she has only slept with one guy, Telly.

You'll first reaction might be 'Well this is only a movie. There aren't kids around like that. I wasn't like that.' That's what is truly sad. It's some cold honest truth. The world can be a dark place. There ARE kids like this who are set on self-destruction. If you look around you can see them. It's becoming all too common.Aptly the filmmakers chose the title for the film to be ""Kids"". It seems wrong and yet so right. The characters in this movie aren't age-wise, but at the same time they're kids because they haven't grown up, haven't matured, haven't learnt from their mistakes... and as in this tale, some don't ever learn much less have a chance to learn. What am I talking about? AIDS.Now I believe Kids is more than just a pro-safe sex movie, but what you take away from it is up to you. Everyone has an opinion on why kids grow up like this, so I won't subject you to my opinion. As for it being exploitative, I'm kind of torn. On one hand, it deals with very dark, harsh moral subject matter. The filmmakers have tried and for the most part succeeded in telling a tale of growing up on the wrong side of the tracks, so to speak. At the same time though, they could have dealt with the proceedings a little more sensitively. For instance, it would have been even more shocking if the filmmakers hadn't resorted to long drawn out scenes of simulated sex that were supposed to be horrifying but ultimately weren't.At the end of the day, Kids showcases a nasty glimpse into a generation that is already messed up and concerned with growing up the fastest way possible. As a film, it needs some serious work in areas, but it's up front and harsh message remains clear to the end.",Kids

65,Det_McNulty,A Full-Blown Disaster Of Vanity,8,12 February 2008,"Before becoming a somewhat prominent figure in modern cinema's art-house scene, Larry Clark was a successful photographer. Clark was well into his '50s when his directional debut Kids hit cinemas in 1995. Controversial on release and still the same today, this tale of immoral, NYC teenagers garnered mixed acclaim and caused widespread uproar, with its taboo-breaking material and questionable intent. Some critics claimed the film was a product of the time, citing it as an accurate illustration of today's youth, while others sensed that the film's content was close to paedophilic. This is a topic open to debate, but one thing is for certain, I have now seen the film twice and am assured that it speaks nothing but irrelevant generalisations of today's ""troubled youth."" Revolving around a group of sexually promiscuous teenagers, Kids mostly centres itself around the intrepid lifestyle of HIV-infected skater, Telly. His aphorism is that along as he only has sex with virgins he will not become victim to sexual infection. Unfortunately, this fairytale is not the case and one of his former playmates soon learns she has the HIV virus, thus she attempts to track down Telly (the only person she has had sex with) in the hope that she can stop him having sex with any other virgins before it is too late. I am being sincere when I say that this is about as far as the narrative goes, with the exception of additional, o-so-shocking scenes of teenagers taking drugs, fighting, stealing and causing general mischief. The film simply spans the course of an ever-spreading and endless cycle.There is a distinct and unfeasible curiosity found in Clark's appetite to convey as much young flesh as is legally possible. I find it quite unnerving as to how the performers seemed so care-free in their willingness to lay bare, to such an extent and at such a young age, for a 50-year-old man with a movie camera. Yet is there any worth to such a monotonous and self-indulgent work? It makes one ask if there is really any objective to viewing a film which so actively seeks attention, and what have I actually learnt from this supposedly educational drama? Kids is not an insightful work for those reasons alone, but also because we have long before acknowledged what is being shown. Clark seems to wallow in the notion that most people have never heard of sexually-infected teenagers or encountered teenage drug-abusers, and that he is the all-knowing eye as an adult who is ""down"" with the street kids- to all teenage escapades.According to a documentary I once saw, Larry Clark spent a lot of time with inner-city, teenage skaters; this was an attempt to research the lifestyle he wanted to show the world via the silver-screen. Many of the teenagers he met while doing this were cast in the film, therefore subjecting these people he supposedly respected to stereotypical showcase. In my opinion, this makes Clark's ""message"" lose all purpose, as informed as he might be and ultimately defines exploitation in the name of ""art."" Some of acting might be vaguely commendable (from the likes of Leo Fitzpatrick's chilling performance), but Harmony Korine's swear-and-spit screenplay makes a bunch of teenagers seem like wannabes. It does not define a norm of the period, but instead enables characters to spew ridiculously repugnant dialogue formed of ""errs"" and ""ahs."" His aimless, teenage caricatures are nothing more than a depiction of a selected individuals and it is the film's sweeping generalisations which infuriate me to no-end. How can characters that seem to have no concern of any consequences be convincing? For me, this leads to a detachment and eventual helplessness to lose complete care in the consequences these faceless drones are tackling. The fact that there is not even a glimmer of hope penetrating the coagulated surface muffles all honesty. With only one character (the girl who is infected by Telly) seeming even so much as remotely mature, everyone is made out to be the bad guy and even this female character becomes stilted because of some peculiar drug she ""reluctantly"" swallows.Throughout the film the viewer is bombarded with an array of apocalyptic assumptions. If that is not all, it seems that Clark indulges himself in the lives of these degenerates, glossing over as many touchy and ""pity them"" topics as is humanely possible in a ninety-minute project. The message behind Kids is an overcooked and simplistic one; today's youth are evil and need to be tamed. You see, as a director Clark films, but fails to speak; denouncing nothing of society and culture, let alone of kids. Larry Clark truly is a born educator on the utmost degree of nihilistic incapability, and has obtained a longing knack for gross-out reactions.",Kids

67,dgordon-1,Mid-'90s Trash!,2,18 February 2002,"I had never heard of this movie being in the theatres.  I caught it on TMN in 1996, about a year after it's initial release.  I must say it was a depressing portrayal of mid-90s youth.  It's the type of movie that keeps you watching, but that's just to see how much worse it can get. However, after you watch it, you feel that you just wasted your time, and subjected yourself to kiddie porn.  Watching a documentary about rat infestation in New York would have been more entertaining. I found the movie was not an accurate portrayal of youth. I heard from a friend that teachers and guidance councillors were advocating teens to see this movie, and I thought what cheap drugs were they on?!  Sure, we have all known people like this, regardless if you were a teen in the '90s, '80s, '70s, or '60s.  Anyone with any brains would steer clear of these losers, regardless whether you're a kid or not.  The movie tended to glorify these ""kids"", and paint a picture that all teens are like this.  What I saw were a bunch of over indulged brats with nothing better to do than inflict themselves on one another, and society. There was no character development, it just seemed to be a bunch of moron-clones drinking, fighting and getting laid. It makes the viewer not really care what happens to these ""kids"". Along with this, the gritty atmosphere and ""porno style music"" just made this a movie that should be thrown in the discontinued bin.  To make matters worse, it's available on DVD! In conclusion, if you don't have anything better to watch, don't even waste your time with this movie.",Kids
68,daveisit,Shame,8,15 December 2000,"I found this movie to be very interesting and also very saddening. The insight on the lives that New York kids may be taking on explains where Jerry Springer and Ricki Lake are getting all their guests from.
On the sad and more serious side, if this is an accurate depiction, there may be very little parents can do. One mistake is all it takes from a naive adolescent to ruin or even end their life.

69,alexcomputerkid,An interesting movie that depicts the dangers of our world and is a wake-up call to parents,6,12 August 2013,"You can look at the film Kids in a lot of different ways. Maybe it's a film for teenagers. Maybe it's a film for adults. Maybe both. A film that came out in 1995 and never really never got a chance. A difficult film with an uncomfortable subject but that is why it works.Directed by controversial director Larry Clark, Kids from 1995 was originally given an NC-17 rating but was then released unrated. The plot tells the controversial story of a group of poor teens who's life consists of mostly drugs, alcohol, sex and AIDS.The movie has a thin plot and even thinner character development. Even with these flaws, Clark is trying to depict a teen world that we don't usually see where these kids get away with a lot. I could relate a bit being with familiar with classmates who have similar problems. Some scenes are quite realistic and very hard to watch but many of the actions have very real consequences. This is a film that could only be made by a director with an attitude and a lot of confidence and Clark has that.I found the New York City setting to be very real and effective. This is a setting we've seen quite a bit but here New York City is not glamorous but is gritty, run down with a dangerous feel to it. Not the New York City we usually see in movies. The setting is very effective and helps makes the story.Kids is an interesting movie that depicts the dangers of our world and is a wake-up call to parents. It is probably one of the most controversial films of it's time and for an audience of the right age, it is a must-see.",Kids

On Bully's box cover it says ""from the director of Kids."" Jeezs, this must be good. Thank God I rented this and did not buy it. It is the most boring movie I think I have ever watched. The ""plot"" is about some ugly scrawny runt of a kid that-- ha!! god forbid, is having sex with as many virgins as he can. I am not trying to knock the poor young actor, but if you see this tyke, you will will agree with me and that is-- I think not!! Anyhow, two girls go down to the department of health office (one of them being Chloe), one does not have any STD's (although she had had anal sex 3 times) and the other one does (Chole). That one kid did that to her. That is basically the ""plot"".Most of the movie plays like a documentary. It simply shows a bunch of teenagers bulls***ing about a bunch of nothing. Who cares? Their is no acting here or really even a plot. Most of what the kids say could have been improvised. Please trust me, anybody could have written this. So what else does that leave?--- maybe teenage nudity and sex? something Larry Clark is so known for. Well--I am one hour and ten minutes into the film and so far-- neither. Just a lot of mother F this and F that. If this is the best that Harmony Korine can come up with, then I can't imagine anything else by him being any good. I will give Chloe Sevigny credit, that girl has more bulls than a lot of these prissy little chicks in Hollywood. I think she was doing the best she could do based on what was given to her. If you have to see a Larry Clark film, make it Bully. It has more nudity,sex and gosh forbid--- an actual plot to boot with a better cast!! (with the exception if Chloe). I think Larry Clark got lucky on that one(Bully), he was given a decent script. I have often read that this is a true to life film.

I knew who Harold Hunter was and thought it was going to be a movie about skating, only hitch is that it's NC-17. When this came out i wanted to see it so badly i didn't care what lengths that meant going to. So i asked my mom if she would take me! What a colossal mistake, i couldn't think of a more uncomfortable movie to see with a parent or authority figure. The first ten minute make-out to sex scene was gutt wrenching. My mom wanted to leave right away, she leaned over and said ""let's go"" but i was unable to move, this was around the time in my life when i was so defiant i would sit in a crowded movie theater with my mom while basically a cheap porno was playing, and still refuse to leave. So the entire movie revolves around one kid with AIDS who has a fetish for young virgins, and his miscellaneous crew including a young Rosario Dawson as they navigate mid-nineties New York. Partying, pool hopping, robbery, rape, drugs, beat-downs, it's just another day in the big apple! The movie plays out in almost documentary fashion while the audience is subjected to the unfortunate saga of a young man with a raging disease who basically rapes one girl after another. It's magnified reality to my poor mother who i dragged to the movie then refused to leave. It was way to much, she accosted me in the parking lot ""why did you take me to that movie"" i told her ""i thought it was about skateboarding!?"" she replies ""the only skateboarding i saw was when they beat that man to death!"".

73,IamtheRegalTreatment,"Can't put this movie into words, but I'll try...",4,6 January 2003,"Kids is a great movie with a point with what some of the teenagers in the world are doing these days, although almost all of it isn't that true, and if it is, then that's not good. I understand how they use an extensive amount of profanity, as do I, but having sex with almost every girl that you can isn't something I go out and do.I remember one scene where the a kid does a 360 Flip (skateboard trick) and hits a 'black' man (I hate using that term, I'm white, but I'm not racist) and then he starts to talk 'trash' about the kid who hit him. Not knowing what is going on, the black kid gets hit in the back of the head with a skateboard from another kid and a big fight breaks out against the black kid. It's approx. 30 kids hitting this black kid, and he is down on the ground bleeding from his head and chest. One kid holds him up, and another smacks him in the face with the 'trunks' (wheels with metal bars) of the skateboard, and then spits on him claiming that this is his turf.I had it by then, cause I couldn't believe that kids are doing that during their daily time. Drug use is normal amongst teens, and I know they wanted to state that in this movie, but also slipping a girl with a drug that knocks her out for awile just to have sex with her isn't really that true. This movie is extremely informing, but is also informing us of some wrong material. Maybe that is normal behavior in Brooklyn or Harlem, but not in my city.I rate this movie 4/10 stars, cause it is mostly about lame things that only 'sick' people like my friend Lawrence would watch, he wanted me to watch it, so I did, and I pretty much hated it. He enjoys this kind of crap, and also just bought a movie called ""Salo"" which is also very demented, so I hope he doesn't ruin his life and end up making even more twisted films.Kids aren't doing most of these things, trust me, and if they do, then there's nothing that we can do, they're going to disobey you (adults) anyway. This is some world that we are living in today, and I don't want to be a part of it if this movie is completely based on real life.

TELLY is a teenage sex fiend who likes to deflower virgins and has his eyes on a certain girl. JENNIE must find him to stop him from doing this to another person.

80,MovieFanGuyy,Kids is definitely one of the most horrific portrayals of teen life in the 1990s.,9,31 July 2007,"Larry Clark's highly controversial Kids, released in the spring of 1995, remains to this day one of the most controversial films ever released in history, and there's a good reason why.Never before in the history of Hollywood was such graphic and realistic portrayals of kids gone wrong had ever been attempted in Hollywood, and it's doubtful that another film anytime soon will impact it's generation as Kids did in the mid 1990s.Kids concerns a group of young teenagers living in New York City in the middle of summertime. Instead of going to school, and doing things like normal kids do, these kids are completely out of control, they have unprotected sex, they steal, they nearly kill a skateboarder, you name it, there are no boundaries to the limits that Larry Clark pulls in his landmark and controversial film.The film's premise is where Telly, (played by Leo Fitzpatrick, who was also terrific in Clark's shocking 2001 film Bully), is the main character of the film, loves to have sex, and he loves to have sex with virgins, who are pure in his mind, and require no condoms. In his opening scene, Telly convinces a young 12 year old to have sex with him, and after a lot of convincing she agrees. Telly loves to brag to his friends about his sexual conquests with the neighborhood girls. Eventually this becomes a contest between him and his best friend Telly.Then the shocking occurs, one of Telly's past sexual encounters, Jenny, played by Chole Sevigny of the HBO show, Big Love, discovers she is HIV positive, even though she's convinced that Telly was a virgin at the time. The film becomes a race against time to stop Telly before he infects more people.The films ending, involves one of the most shocking scenes in film history a large orgy of teenagers having unprotected sex with each other, and with an obviously drugged out, Jennie having unprotected sex with Casper, there the film ends.A lot of critics unfairly criticized this film for showing unprotected juvenile sex and activities, but my theory is that the public needs to see films like this as a wake up call.No one said this film is pleasant, far from it, but to hide some of society's ills from our children is downright censorship in my opinion.1995's Kids remains a wake up call to teenagers out of control in a very big city.

81,alexart-1,"Boring, Uninspired, and Stereotypical Realism",4,1 April 2010,"Realism has become increasingly popular over the years. Kids is definitely part of the reason why this has happened. This movie, which was filmed for about $1.5 million, ended up being bought at the Sundance Film Festival for twice the budget, and grossed even more in theaters. To say that Kids is not an important piece of film history would be wrong, but then again, importance is not everything. Kids is not artistic in the slightest and incredibly boring. Larry Clark, the director of the movie, wants the movie to be so disturbing, that it just ends up failing because the viewer can see that he's trying too hard. The film's script, written by (at the time) eighteen year old Harmony Kormine, is a real treat, however there's not much else great about the movie other than that.Kids follows three teenagers in New York City during one average day over the summer. Telly, played by Leo Fitzpatrick, and his buddy Casper, played by Justin Pierce, travel around the city as Telly looks for virgins to have sex with. In Telly's alcohol soaked and drug addled mind, having sex with virgins is the way to prevent HIV. The irony of all this is that Telly already has HIV, but does not know it yet. Jennie, played by Chloe Sevigny (who is now famous for performing a fellatio on Vincent Gallo in The Brown Bunny) in a debut performance, attempts to find Telly to tell him that she has become HIV positive as a result of having sex with him. All three characters' lives intersect over the course of one regular day as a result of their unfortunate situations. Rosario Dawson also can be seen in her first acting role as one of Jennie's friends.Kormine's script is the one thing that saves Kids from being totally bad. The script is well written that the dialogue often becomes confused with improvisation. It sounds unlikely, but there was no improvisation done for this movie. The script rolls out of the actors' mouths as if it was an everyday conversation between two long term friends. Though the dialogue can become a bit hard to decipher with so many uses of the f-word and thick accents, the script is the only thing that appears to be real in this movie. Some of the authenticity of the script can be attributed to the actors' skill, but most of it can be derived from Kormine's wonderful writing.Kids suffers primarily for the fact that it does not come even close to being realistic. Although there are probably many people who fall into situations close to Telly and Jenny's, most do not. Many people are raised in whitebread suburban America where there is nothing like this, yet there are still never ending amounts of teenage corruption. The teens (or should I say kids?) in Kids are ruthless and amoral which thus forces no emotions out of a viewer. Suburban teens have everything they could possibly want yet work themselves into terrible situations involving drugs and alcohol. This creates hatred, rather than sympathy, something Kids should have tried to harder to instill in the viewer. Larry Clark's direction also feels a bit boring. Drab hand held camera movements do not make for a gritty storyline. The acting is mediocre from the male performances, however it is not really all that hard to see why Chloe Sevigny and Rosario Dawson became famous for this movie.Recent realist films have definitely borrowed a lot from Kids. Requiem for a Dream and Thirteen use similar themes and styles to make their points. But it is a good thing that directors have moved past the boredom that Kids creates. There are very few scripts as good as Karmine's from this movie, but many other films about similar topics have made many improvements. Directors have now learned that it is, in fact, a good thing to create a sense of hatred towards a movie's characters rather than begging for sympathy. Primarily held up by a strong script, Kids never manages to make a connection with its viewer and therefore suffers.",Kids

The cast gives amazing performances in situations and events that seem to be filmed live for a reality TV show.

But I believe the point of the film was to give a harsh and uncensored look at what is happening to kids out there so that the viewer might think, ""what's wrong with this picture?!""

If you've seen ""Bully"", then come back to ""Kids"" and you'll see where his career started.  He just doing films that are probably based on his experiences and what he's heard and seen.THE PLOTPowerful and passionate, colorful and compelling, Larry Clark's ""Kids"" is 24 frenetic hours in the life of a group of teenagers, and like most teenagers, they think their invincible.This is a great film, I give it ****(out of 4 stars).",Kids
85,Mephisto-24,Utterly convincing and incredibly depressing.,8,21 September 2000,"KIDS is brilliantly made and entirely believable, which puts it near the top of my list of movies I never want to see again. I can't think of any movie villain I've more desperately wanted to see fail (or better still, die horribly) than the teenage boys in this film.

86,sissypower,Another Day In Puberty,10,30 August 1999,"Anxious I was to experience KIDS again, not having seen it since a first-run engagement four years ago. Now, after Larry Clark's second feature ANOTHER DAY IN PARADISE (both titles given pleasing transfers to dvd) and a keen fondness for Chloë Sevigny's seemingly effortless moments of truth in THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO (moins de GUMMO & PALMETTO), I have to say, it wears well. Less about shock, more about knowing, Clark was on to it then. We had turned away and forgotten the sheer thrill of teenage anarchy, the bliss of parental absenteeism. Clark had to get up in our faces with it, make it sting, burn a little. And he got noticed. This time it's just beautiful.",Kids

I'm working on my PhD in clinical psychology and the professor had some crazy notion that watching this stupid movie would be an insightful way to learn about kids. Wrong.This movie's sole purpose is to freak out every parent in the country. Yes, these things happen, and yes, some kids are that messed up, but to parade every negative thing a kid could possibly do in a 24-hour period of time is just stupid and unrealistic.

It's a clear, transparent attempt to show what ""life in the big city"" is like for a couple of loser teenagers. Unfortunately, what you end up with is a bunch of teen stereotypes walking around uttering some horrid dialogue.There are apparently some people who believe this is what life is like. Don't think so. For starters, the characters are paper-thin. They have no depth to them whatsoever. Think about it, for a moment, and you'll realize that Telly is totally evil. Also, that any girl who had the slightest clue who he was would never get anywhere near him. Furthermore - forty kids don't just beat the stuffing out of some guy and a park and attract no attention.Aside from the complete and utter lack of morality in any of the characters, the script is just awful. Someone needs to give these people scriptwriting lessons, or else tell them to stop writing dialogue under the influence of heavy narcotics. I can't remember for then for or five sentences that consisted of multiple ploy-syllabic words. Kinda scary when you think about.This movie is clearly an attempt to accurately portray teen life in the big city. It didn't ring true with me - a couple scenes made me laugh at the the pure ridiculousness of it, but most of the time, I just felt like turning away.

Seeing it again made me remember how bad I thought it was the first time I saw it.  It tries to be shocking, and I suspect that it would shock middle aged suburbanites, but it had little effect on me.  The basic flaw with this movie is that a character driven drama like ""Kids"" should cause the viewer to have some empathy with the characters, but this movie only creates a mood of apathy.  The plot of ""Kids"" is such that you need to care about the characters if this movie is to be successful on any level.  As I watched the movie, I realized I didn't care what happened to the characters.  With no emotional interest invested in this story, the ending seemed anti-climactic and pointless.

Now, believe me, this film really scarred me to death back in 1995, and the shock value hasn't died out one bit. I recently rented this low budget indie flick a couple of weeks ago, and guess what, it was a terrific movie. 
Not only did Larry Clark accurately portray the 90's teens in a shocking way, but, it also shows audiences how members of generation y out of control. 
This film is for any parent who has an out of control child, see it before your child gets the consequences of inner city life.

But in the end, it doesn't matter where you're from to realise that what comes in disguised as a pseudo-documentary is in fact the most lurid voyeurism. Contrary to what the PR guys wanted us to believe, this movie is not the social study it wanted to be. It was designed merely to make us gasp in horror as we continue to hear ever more shocking things coming out of youthful mouths. With the exception of Jennie's fate, perhaps, it conveys zero empathy with the characters on screen - characters, by the way, which are never developed beyond their initial tag line. Bottom line: This is one of my Top Five Worst Movies Ever. I still regret having spent money on it.

97,fineanimal,It doesn't get much worse than this,1,24 September 2004,"Just when I think I've seen the worst movie ever made, along comes a new contender called KidsKids makes Reefer Madness look like a Ken Burns documentary, except that Reefer Madness was watchable. And funny. And entertaining. Hell, compared to Kids, Reefer Madness even seems educational and enlightening.The Public Relations department portrays Kids as some kind of stylish, biting commentary on the reckless feeling of invincibility among contemporary urban youth. But that's the beauty of advertising. Once you give the DVD store your hard-earned money and open the package, you can't return it no matter how bad the film is. I can only imagine the magnitude of buyer's regret worldwide that has been caused by this one film alone.The formula for creating a movie like Kids is embarrassingly simple (and simple-minded): Don't bother to hire a screenwriter, gather a huge cast of the most foul, unattractive young people you can find, tell them to do and say the most shocking, degenerate things their warped imaginations can come up with, film their actions while drunk with no steadycam anywhere to be found, and insert some credits at the beginning and end. Oh, and throw in a bunch of children smoking pot and having sex to appeal to the niche market that really, really enjoys watching five year old girls prance around in beauty contests.Then create a doosie of a PR campaign that would make any performance artist proud--one that convinces even the critics that the film is so profound, if you don't like it, that's only because you're just not clever enough to ""get"" it.The sad thing is, I'm not trying to be funny. That is literally what this movie is. If that appeals to you, by all means, flip hamburgers for four hours to pay for the privilege of wasting 91 minutes of your life on this rubbish. After all, Siskel and Ebert gave it two thumbs up, and Siskel and Ebert are honorable men.As for me, I'm going to keep looking for a real filmmaker, one who bothers to film real kids who are experiencing real troubled lives, so that we might really learn something, even if it means no one makes a great deal of money or manufactures a career out of stale, rancid, thin air.",Kids

Now, everyone has known violent, abusive brats like these, but thankfully they are a tiny and insignificant minority who, one imagines, typically end up dead or in jail after messing with the wrong people.  So what is the contribution of making a fictional movie about these little monsters?  Zero, except that it (1) brings the chattering classes out of the woodwork so we can see just how stupid and out of touch they really are, and (2) helps the career of Chloe Sevigny, a terrific actress who then goes on to star in much more worthwhile productions.

After all the reviews I've read for ""Kids"", saying it is powerful and disturbing...well, it's all just a crock. About the NC-17 rating the movie almost received. What was that? No, tell me. The only nudity I saw was in the last 2 minutes. I mean, they cover the bodies with their arms, they go ""skinny dipping"" in underwear(?). What I thought was really dumb was that you were so scared after this was only in one day. What was only in one day? Drinking and smoking? You call that disturbing? I call that a pretty boring day. Why didn't Harmony explore a year of these kids lives? You probably would have cried if it was the way it should have been.And I really hate that you call that ""un-realistic dialouge"".

It may have been released in '95 but from what I've seen in my 17 years of life, it is very relevant. Basically, it takes a look at the lives of several New York City teens and the real drama of the film begins when one of them is infected with HIV. In this film we see the beginning of the careers of young actresses like Rosario Dawson and Chloe Sevigny. What I also liked about the movie is that it showed the experimental sex and drug use that is practiced among teens in such a graphic and accurate way. It never sugar coated anything.

And to be honest, I bet it is still tame compared to some of the things teens are doing today. Still, I think this film is an accurate representation of the ""idiot"" culture that is thriving in America. These kids have no morals, no innocence, and no conscience. They make stupid decisions, manipulate anyone they can, and lash out when they feel there is no other option. It was the darkest and most creepy film I ever saw until ""Happiness"" came out. Two real quick points in response to previous posters. There are kids out there like this, and not just in the big city. I think anywhere that parents have passed the buck, this behavior can happen. Finally, someone wrote they couldn't believe Leo Fitzpatrick as the Romeo getting all the girls.

106,m-vinteuil,Sexploitation,3,6 November 2008,"I championed this film for many years. It was the first real document of the '90s teen skateboard set, and I was taken in by the subject matter. However, scrutiny and a broader understanding of film have more than marred its effect. The gritty 'realism' which supposedly elevated this film from exploitation to art, simply does not withstand any serious prodding. The crux of the story, an HIV infected teenager intending to deflower two thirteen-year-old virgins in the space of one day, is rendered difficult to believe by the casting of Leo Fitzpatrick. Bellow average in the looks department, and with an inarticulate lisp, it's hard to fathom that Leo could bed anyone, let alone two virgins and the tally he boasts of. Furthermore, the aimless youth chic which Larry Clark pioneered is ultimately hollow. Consider that his subsequent films are very hard to defend artistically, and you will struggle to derive real depth from KIDS.Other less charitable critics have called him ""pedophilic"" in his sustained exploitation of good looking youth. Whilst not entirely fair, there is something of a dirty old man about him. A shot lingering on a pretty girl's crotch in his latter travesty, Bully, more than deflates the notion of Clark as profound auteur.The redemptive aspects of KIDS are oddly the most exploitative. The scenes in which a gaggle of unnamed youth huff N02 from balloons, and openly smoke pot from a hollowed out cigar, will ring true to those who experienced adolescence in the last two decades. And the emotional punch at the conclusion still remains, unscathed. It is just an incredibly bitter pill to sallow to concede that Clark was proved right. This generation is wretched.",Kids
107,moviedude-72,"Astonishing; An honest, powerful piece of film-making",7,16 April 2006,"PLOT: An amoral young skater (Telly played by Leo Fitzpatrick) sets out to deflower as many virgins as possible, but things go badly when one (Jennie, played by Chloe Sevigny) gets tested for HIV. The HIV positive Jennie finally tracks down Telly, but discovers him having sex with young Darcy, potentially infecting her with HIV. Later, while Jennie is passed out on a couch surronded by drunk, half naked teens, from the drug she took earlier, Casper, a friend of Telly's, rapes her, unknowingly potentially infecting himself with HIV.Larry Clarkes ""Kids"" is certainly a powerful, raw and eye-opening piece of film-making and brakes every boundary in the movie industry, one of the most compelling, honest films I've ever seen, at some points a little trashy, vulgar and maybe a little tough to swallow for the light-hearted but very provocative, it's one of those films that must to be talked about after viewing. The film suggests no solution for this situation, and there certainly won't be one any time soon, as almost everything portrayed in this film, is still happening (and getting even worse now), it merely shows what happens when predatory people are loosed upon society, and when kids leave their childhood in adolescence, and loose their innocence. A lot of the film is about the danger of AIDS/HIV from unprotected sexual acts also, apart from alcahol and drug use amongst youths. Evidently Telly has the HIV virus and is spreading it around with gusto. Although it did give the story some poignancy, one would miss the point of the film entirely if all one got out of it was a message about so-called safe sex. The film also makes no argument that this particular group of kids is in any way typical of their generation, although some people who have viewed this film have leaped to that conclusion. It is a work of fiction, after all, not a documentary, despite the fact that due to the camera angles and the way the film is produced, people have believed that it was all in fact a documentary.You'll watch Kids repeating ""is this real?"" and soon even though it's not an exploration film, the events and the people exist and happen and not just among the segment of the younger population portrayed in this film, it happens with everyone, in fact everyone does it. And, unlike most people I never found anything totally pornographic, I saw a raw and honest depiction of youth, definitely disgusting, as well. It happens everywhere, not just in New York Citybut everywhere. It's a good film, not a great film but it's certainly one you'll never forget, and I recommend (to the strong stomach peoples out there)! And I must say it has left many raw, frightening and harsh imagary in my mind, and not many films can do such a thing to me, so I must praise this film and the director for having the ability to do such.

There was not a single scene that had something gross or weird about it. It's completely Neolithic and it shows you how it's actually to grow up in certain settings.

However, because they are children, suddenly its the most shocking film ever made(sarcasm)! And they are not completely innocent 5-year olds who know nothing about sex and AIDS, they are all teenagers who are well informed about sex.This film did not really shock me at all, because I am looking at this from a teenage point of view. These are just normal people to me having (OK, unprotected) sex and it does not really offend me. The people who are really offended are the parents who hate to conceive the idea that their children might have sexual intercourse with another person. And yet the film is rated 18 in the United Kingdom and NC-17 in America. And yes, I know that it shows them having sex without condoms, but it also shows that this is not a good thing and that they will suffer the consequences.If this film was meant to show people how shallow they are when they think about teenage sex, then I would say that this is great film. However, if it is meant to show teenage sex as being wrong and to make parents more paranoid than they already are, then I would say that this film has a terrible moral standpoint.Watch it and decide for yourself.",Kids

Unfortunately, The tag line does not paint a realistic picture of the story either.

I only moved to Manhattan after graduating college, well into my adult life, and nothing about my life was remotely like the events in this film.Watching Kids was at once overwhelming and saddening. While I found it incredibly rich in entertainment value, I also felt deep pangs of terror for what might be happening to a pocket of American teenage society. With the advent of HIV+AIDS circulating the modern world, the lack of responsible parenting or other forms of positive role modeling, and youth's ignorance to safe sex practices due to an abundance of abstinence-only health programs or a lack of funding that would allow schools to provide free access to forms of birth control--everything has coalesced into the microcosm portrayed in this film. I don't think I know of any place in America, rural,suburban or urban, where parents are so dramatically unaware of the whereabouts and behavior of their children as they are in this film. It is just plain shocking. Also shocking was the opening scene, in which a, what, 13-year old, sleeps with a, what, 12-year-old? I mean I felt like i was watching kiddie porn, and even if it made sense in the context of the film, and was relevant to later scenes, that didn't stop it from being awkward and uncomfortable.All of this established, however, I do think Kids is a very stylistically successful film. The shots and acting are spot-on, so much so that one could not imagine these young actors and actresses having any alternate, real-life personas outside of their characters. Ten-year-olds getting high in a parentless apartment, talking about the quality of the weed they're smoking as though they were in their college years or late high school years--what does one even say to a scene like that? Newly acknowledged HIV-positivity of Chloe Sevigny's character--her subsequent getting high and showing up at a party and being more or less raped and unable to speak up and say a simple ""no"", not to mention divulging her health condition to prevent the disease's spread. This communication never happens during the course of the film, and it is this lack of conclusiveness that rounds out an overall very dark depiction of teen recklessness and the spread of disease due to irresponsibility.Fun times!",Kids

118,wayofthecass,Bankrupt culture.,5,13 January 2008,"'Kids' is an okay film. Sometimes people think that because it has a pretty controversial topic and unorthodox style of representation that this in some way makes it original and therefore great. But I have to point out that the; direction is average ( raw one moment / standard Hollywood the next and neither done in any particularly eye catching form): there doesn't seem to be any kind of story here, apart from the AIDS message and focus is often lost on that.The subplot (to the non-existent main plot) has something powerful to say. But it is not maintained by much outside of the Taxi driver's decent speech on life and Sevigny's character occasionally asking ""Has anyone seen Telly?"".Harmony Korine has in many ways got away with murder in getting this film funded/ directed by an experienced photographer in Clark and distributed by Mira-Max (operating under an independent name so as not to incur the wrath of they're pay masters Disney) in the screenplays current form. I mean it could have done with about 3 or 4 rewrites in order to hone it's focus and clarify it's message.I've also got to criticise some of the performances. Sevigny looks out of her depth in this. Kind of numb and uninteresting throughout the whole film. Its very difficult to distinguish between her sober and stoned. And its almost impossible to feel sympathy for her such is the unconvincing level of her performance when she is upset. Leo Fitzgerald also seems inadequate as Telly. There is some good non-dialogue scenes from him but when he opens his mouth he just sounds plain stupid. I found it hard to believe that an uneducated ignoramus with the appearance of a junkie could be Manhattan's under 16s ladies man.However a lot of the younger kids at the party scene near the end are very impressive. They're dialogue is very well scripted and executed. And Justin Pearce looked like a star in the making. I thought he was brilliant and towered above the other lead roles of Sevigny and Fitzpatrick who were just plain poor. Sad to hear that at the age of only 25 , Justin Pearce took his own life. He definitely could have gone on to bigger things.Anyway 'Kids' did have it's heart in the right place but it's execution was disappointing and it looked like a rushed job to me. Some better casting, direction and scripting/story development could've made this a powerful picture. But I guess thats the case with most average to bad films.I think its interesting how America was so disgusted by this kind of gritty, harsh realism. I also think its slightly amusing how some of the American commentators think that gives it some kind of shocking originality. Believe me there are many European films ie- 'Prisoner of the Mountain' (Russia), 'La Hain'( France), 'Small Faces', 'Trainspotting', 'A Sense of Freedom'(Scotland), 'Made in Britain', 'The War Zone', 'Scum' and'The Firm'(England) which are all at the very least equal if not way ahead in portraying depressing and graphic realities. If you really liked 'Kids' I'd encourage you to check out British actor Gary Oldman's film 'Nil By Mouth'(2000) which makes this look like a tea party.",Kids
119,Overjoyed,Not very good.,3,9 December 1999,"Maybe I just don't get it. Without a real plot it gets boring fast, and is it just me or do movies like this get made only for the shock value? Instead of trying to tell a good story it shows the lives of a group of kids living in New York City who find nothing better to do but have sex, get stoned and beat people up. One of the quotes on the box from a movie critic (almost every movie critic liked this film, Go figure) says ""A wake up call to America!"" Well don't believe the hype. Things were just as bad in the 50s 60s 70s and 80s, it is just that no one ever made films like this for the youths of those  generations.

As a kid today, I found it grossly inaccurate. Kids of today do exactly what kids of yesterday did. I watched this with a group of friends, and it just made us laugh. The character of Telly, for example, talks with an affected (I hope) speech impediment that makes him sound like he's got a mouthful of saliva at all times and is in danger of drooling all over over the place (yet the virginal girls still find him attractive...). We spent most of the movie sarcastically yelping, ""This is SO like our lives!"" You want to know what real teenagers do? Observe them sometime. They're incredibly boring.The rest of the characters are one-dimensional and completely unbelievable, talking about nothing but drugs and/or sex, and it was clear the writers wished only to showcase their stupidity. There is actually a scene in which a girl talks about sperm getting caught between her teeth. Really. There was also, it seemed to me, a disturbing sort of pleasure taken by the makers of this film in seeing these pretty young things partake in various sordid activities, and a sense that this film was meant to expose the dark truth about today's youth and their degeneracy compared to generations past--but come on, the generations before us grew up in the sixties, seventies and eighties.

I though the scenes of the boys and girls discussing sex was well done the cutting back and forth between the two discussions. I also thought the park scene was done well as well, especially the use of music in the fight scene. The cast was good. It was made up of mostly non actors or unknown actors. There was wonderful performances by the four main actors Leo Fitzpatrick, Justin Pierce, Chloe Sevigny, and Rosario Dawson. Kids is not a movie for everyone it is dark and at times uncomfortable to watch especially the opening scene and the last scene.

It represents a shocking reality, which not many of us will, hopefully, ever encounter. Fair enough, it does not represent a sizeable part of any population, but the subjects covered do happen. I am a teenager myself and from personal experience you can only be naive in believing this doesn't happen. It is unbelievable due to its complete and utter excessive depiction in every sociopath youth cliche this pseudo-documentary tries to deal with, from the perverse deflowerment of sub-teens to dealing with HIV.
What am I to think of a film, which makes me hate the two main stars from the word go, two perverse freaks - Telly and Casper? Jennie, portrayed by Chloe Sevigny, was the only character I could possibly feel for, who also had the most noticeable performance. The style of the film was the only thing going for it. I found the script was funny in a ""I'm laughing at you bunch of no-hopers, not with you"" way. At some points, a mate and I even thought there was an element ad-lib. Either that or there some talent there. The film is not ""positively"" entertaining. Whether or not you take this film seriously reflects your apathy to society because this is horribly realistic. But there are only a few films not worth a viewing and this is film that should be viewed purely for its controversial subject matters.

This is like the wildest movie about sex, drugs and rock'nroll - only it is about kids doing all that in way most of us never imagined. The effect is wonderfully perverse.

130,norton833,"Heart Of Darkness, Jr.",8,9 February 2008,"Decadent photographer Larry Clark and Harmony Korine (future director of such edgy films as Gummo) teamed up for this intense and honest portrayal of a certain kind of predatory male teenager. As controversial as it was, it's not particularly hysterical; it is, actually, pretty matter-of-fact about its subject matter, which is refreshing.The story is incredibly simple. We meet a kid named Telly, who calls himself ""The Virgin Surgeon"", in the act of deflowering yet another adolescent virgin. We soon meet one of his recent conquests, Jennie, who soon finds out she has the AIDS virus, which she could only have gotten from Telly. She then sets out on a quest to find Telly so as to inform him of his infection (and save any other girls who might become infected). At the same time we follow Telly, his obnoxious friend Casper, and their friends and hangers-on as they carouse their way through NYC on their way to a party.This allows Clark and Korine to give us a glimpse into some dark places without getting our hands too dirty. It also allows them to illustrate the film's central theme, which is played out several times: that one wrong choice can lead to disaster.All this is nicely filmed in a grainy style endemic of the 1990's, with vivid, hallucinatory colors. The soundtrack, the work of Lou Barlow, is alternately ugly, gorgeous and dynamic, as need demands.Clark's depiction of decadent youth is often startlingly believable, and generally not gratuitous. There are, however, a few unnecessary, vaguely homoerotic scenes involving groups of shirtless boys practically laying atop each other, which are a little too reminiscent of those Calvin Klein ads from about the same period, and a little bit damaging to the film's credibility.",Kids

Conveniently, ""Youtube"" has the entire unedited film in its entirety for free to view. On first note, I must identify the superb acting of Justin Pierce as Casper and may his tragic suicide in 2000 be noted and perhaps this role had a daunting effect on him. Kids today are curious, and this film exploits the innocence of adolescence to a the underground world of drugs and unprotected sex. This highly critical portrait of 90s youth is a phenomenal commentary on the ignorance of adult society as parents need to be aware of what their children are up to. This film presents a message through a highly disturbing and engaging 90 minutes of drugs and teenage fornication. For a shaky independent film, ""Kids"" will leave a lasting feeling on those who view it and hopefully will provide a critical point of view to parents who let their children out past midnight. I recommend this film to everyone as it shows us the life of uneducated and rebellious children who don't know anything about reality.

This was the granddaddy of the genre and remains one of the darkest and grittiest of them all, in both subject and style. Perhaps in part because the subjects were an urban group of kids, rather than the angsty suburban set we've grown accustomed to seeing, there is a rare and truthful ferocity to the characterizations. The emotive mechanism isn't their redemption as mere children, but their total fallibility as young adults. Though obviously this represents a small sample of teenagers in the united states, it will make you think twice about how much earlier we seem to lose our childhood these days. Great ensemble cast with very believable performances. Its attempt to approximate the reality of a documentary is a unique success. In addition to stong dialogue and direction, credit should be given to the cast for that; obviously, chloe sevigny was a standout here.

We also follow Jenny, a young and naive girl who has only ever slept with Telly. When she learns that she is HIV positive, she sets out to track Telly down before he can spread it further. That's the only part of the story that I will give away, though there is much, much more.The portrayal of these kids is disturbingly realistic and makes you feel physically gross.

142,Chelman666,"Not a masterpiece movie, yet a very important social message",8,4 January 1999,"I'm not conservative by any means. Yet even I must admit that I was slightly shocked by this film. What shocked me however was not the picture but the realization that such events happen, and happen regularly in real life. Granted, the movie does show extreme examples which are not always true in real life, yet I know from own experience that these things happen, both on the scale shown in the movie and also somewhat 'milder'. Another reason why I believe that the portrayal is so extreme is because it tries to educate both parents and children that sex, alcohol and drugs must not be abused (as opposed to used). Therefore it sends a strong message showing what happens when these are abused.One of the many complaints about this film is that the characters are bland and undeveloped. Partly true. Yet is it not true that many teenagers, especially in the USA (excuse the America bashing, but I've experienced it) are in fact bland undeveloped characters with little substance to their lives. Loss/Absence of values both moral and on an even larger scale cultural is the norm rather than exception.Despite its many flaws I think this movie carries an important social message. It's an eye opener. In my opinion all parents who believe that they shield their children from sex, alcohol and drugs are very naive to believe that they are 100% successful. More importantly shielding through ignoring the subject, not talking about it and flat out forbidding is contra-productive. I hope that more parents will actually talk openly to their children about these topics and educate them rather than keep them in the 'dark ages'.",Kids
143,Route 66,Weak.,5,5 May 2004,"Despite everybody's comments that this is an intense, gritty documentary that shows what teenagers are really like, I have to disagree. I think that this is hype, and crass stupidity, that scares people into thinking that this is how all teenagers are. I have a few points to pick out about the film.A) The title implies that the film is a tell all informative look at the world of /all/ teenagers, which it is not. It is simply a look at the lives of inner city teenagers whose parents have not raised them to find the subtle shades of grey between good and bad. Instead of being the rule, these kids are the exception to the rule, and the film leads parents to believe that all their kids are out there getting high, drunk and having unprotected sex, wildly and without reason.B) The so called /gritty/ filmmaking style doesn't work. There is something in the editing style that makes the film seem like a total fake, weak representation of what could be out there. The attempt at gritty realism falls flat on its face as the film proceeds, and becomes a gummy, stuffy, convoluted mass of worthless scum.C) Parents: If your kids are doing this kind of stuff, it needs to be stopped, but the best way to find out, and put a stop to this is to find information on the internet on how to deal with kids who are out of control. This movie is not going to help in any way except to scare you.D) Everyone here is saying that this comes very close to kiddy porn. Kiddy porn is quite possibly one of the most vile, disgusting things that humans have ever created, but this is not kiddy porn. This is a weak attempt to show the (contrived) sex lives of teenagers.E) I cannot imagine what kind of idiot girl would submit to Telly's Don Juan tactics. Telly is not an attractive person (in my eyes at least, but I'm a guy), and he is incredibly stupid, and talks like it as well. What kind of girl would want to lose her virginity to a guy she had known for two hours? I am at a complete loss as to why these girls are so incredibly dumb. I think that this is simply a sexist portrayal of women in general, showing them as being stupid and incredibly submissive sex objects. This film angered me, because it was such a poor portrayal of teenage life.If you want to see a gritty, wrenching, painfully abusive film that sticks with you for a long time, watch Requiem for a Dream.

The thing that really made it controversial was HIV being spread by teenagers at a very young age,this was the most important aspect of the film because many found it hard to watch well too bad for that crowd because the truth hurts. That sort of thing is happening kids are having unprotected sex, kids are catching STI's.People found this very hard to except because the film shows how fast the aids virus can spread and it only takes one arrogant, reckless sexually active teenager to do it.This is a very sad film that takes place in 24hours an shows teenager with 1 mission to take the virginity of every girl unprotected little does he no is that he has caught the aids virus and his ex girlfriend also positive sets out to find him before he infects another girl.

It was painful to watch him and to listen to him. It made the movie almost unbearable to watch. Even Chloe who I normally like, didn't do a very good job. It's not very believable for a teenage girl to react the way she did to finding out she's got a possibly deadly disease. She didn't seem at all upset, sad or shocked. Unlike what the taxi driver stated, she seemed very calm and cool about it. The story in itself is good but I don't like what they did with it.

I find this ridiculously unfair to a movie that was trying to depict teenagers in what was the the modern era. It goes at a group of troubled teenagers and notice how I put that. A GROUP, NOT ALL KIDS. Most everyone saying this an exploitation or shock film are making mostly one point. ""All this movie is saying is that all kids are bad"" No it's not. It's saying this group of kids are bad and you would have to be insane to think people like this don't exist. If anything, teenagers who can see there selves in these characters can find splice in knowing that they're not alone and need to slow down before they can seriously ruin their lives.

147,jimqt,The sex and lusts of kids in the USA. A world of emptiness drugs and random encounters.,7,20 March 2006,Modern day existentialism? I don't know. The nihilistic drug and sex filled world of todays teens and preteens seems to be betrayed here in this voyeur trip into there world.Maybe it is true there is nothing but sex and emptiness. People drift and float around without any purpose except copulation and drugs. A film without real plot about from the HIV infection of a young virgin from her first sexual encounter.The rape scene of the same girl when she was unconscious from drugs was quite shocking but at the same time it seemed to fit into story somehow. Not a film to give one hope in humanity. But still a unique film and worth seeing.,Kids
148,Paul-201,Kids is Kiddie Porn,1,17 February 1999,"This is the most vile and pathetic movie I have ever seen. First of all, the movie is child exploitation, if not pornography.  I didn't need to see a 13 year old having sex.  I didn't need to see a guy going to the bathroom.  I didn't need to see a girl who is passed out be raped.  Second, all the characters were the same.  Each character spoke the same dialogue.  Usually, characters are different.  In this worthless movie, Tully spoke and acted exactly the same as Casper or any of the other losers in this movie.  Third, the acting was horrible. Of course, the actors had nothing to work with but still did nothing that resembled acting.  Fourth, the dialogue was idiotic. Who wrote this movie, a 7th grader?  Who talks or acts like these idiots?? I never knew anybody like these people.  Yes, we talked a lot about sex but a whole day of it?  No. Even after Tully has sex, the next thing on his mind is which girl he is he going to bang that night.  Most guys usually don't obsess with sex immediately after they've had it. I don't know anyone who was as mean-spirited as the whole group of characters in this waste of film. All of the characters were one dimensional.  Even the meanest people I knew had some redeeming qualities.  Fifth, who in their right mind would have sex with such a goofball as Tully?   Where I grew up, guys like Tully got beaten up and spent many a lonely night watching the tube.  While I have bashed this movie, I do appreciate other opinions. One person's trash is another person's art.",Kids

I can assure you that anything they force you to watch in sex education was much better than this crap. I walked out somewhere in the middle, trying to decipher why this movie was made. Okay, so teens think they own the world and do whatever they want. Point made, but if I copied the behavior done by those extremely ruthless boys, I would most likely be in the slammer for life.Which brings me to the characters. Nobody can relate to any of them because they're unlikeable. They're more profane and stereotypical than an episode of South Park, minus the humor. Yes, I know everything that goes on in this movie happens in real life, but the plot didn't seem believable in any way.Bottom Line: Stay away from this movie.",Kids

So i got it and it really opened my eyes to the real world of film and since then i haven't looked back.The refreshingly real storyline and camera angles make you feel as you are on the street with these kids, you feel their pain and hardships through the 24 hour journey. Seeing different sides of arguments and quite likely a different lifestyle to your own. Not the film for you if you like things to be glossy, made up and fun. For anyone who believes in life and living this naturalistic script will no doubt remind you of people and situations you have known.

It seemed as though the writer had sat down and thought, 'hmmm what can I do to make this film in/famous? I know, make a whole load of people do screwed up things.. no wait: even better: make kids to horrible things, even more shocking!' They take drugs, speak like sailors and are generally candid about subjects you would expect from people 10 years older. It's fairly unrealistic- I know kids can be shit*y but this bad; please.

I honestly thought I'd met him in real life, thats how this stuck to my memory. I never socialised with kids like these, but they exist all around us. I remember a girl in my school who was 13 and having sex with lots of people and drove one of my neighbours to suicide cause she dumped him for another kid. He was 14. she and a friend were later expelled from school for urinating in the class. One of my cousins used to hang out with skateboarders and one of his friends died of overdose age 21. they pretty much looked like the group in this movie language and clothes wise. I also met a guy in my hall in Uni who was basically getting laid with every girl he could get his hands on, really disgusting. But what is really shocking about this movie is the reality of aids. and the darkness of the last scene where immorality and irresponsibility turn into creepy stuff like disease, crime and homelessness.

155,Cineman187,A stark warning of society's downfalls,7,17 March 2005,"This is a clearly daunting film, where we as the viewer can follow a group of troubled youths as they engage in smoking drinking and fighting. Larry Clarke, has, in my opinion dwelled too much on the sexual content of the film, and thus releasing this excellent movie of it's shocking material. Realistically the film explains its intention immediately and although issues bar underage sex and HIV occur I still feel that the film just places too much emphasis on the troubles of the youth. Yes this film raises eyebrows, for much of the film deals with very delicate topics that are constantly growing as the years pass. But despite this I feel that the film depicts the worst of the worst. It does not single out a more mundane set of characters to make the film seem more realistic, but instead it focuses on an extremely naive teenagers and in my opinion dampens the brutal effect. Gus Van Sant helped to make this film and he is clearly a controversial film maker. One of his later films 'Elephant' explores the delicate issue of gun crime. It would do you good to see this film, but I recommend that you see another film too, that in my opinion delivers the ultimate insight into troubled youth and social class; La Haine, which was released around the same time as Kids is far superior in its message and although it would do you good to see Kids, La Haine is essential viewing.",Kids

I guess if you didn't grow up in these kind of urban environments,it could be. Me growing up in NYC can't agree. A lot of things in the movie were very familiar to me. I was 17 when the movie came out,and 27 now. Besides the situations and dialogue portrayed, even some of the places were familiar to me. Washington square Park for one, and the club Area(a.k.a.Vinyl) was a regular afterhours hangout for me until it closed last April.The club they used in the movie was actually the Tunnel,cause Area wouldn't let cameras in.I even still see the black kid Harold from time to time,still chillin'. Bottom line is I was in some ways like this,I know people that were or still like that, and this movie is straight up reality.The people that said the movie was disgusting are probably the same people that used to frown or stare when me and my friends used to have these conversations.

KIDS shows you a uncensored bite of reality and sends you straight into its universe of brutal, naive and manipulative adolescence. In my opinion, it's Larry Clarks best movie yet... But then again, debut movies do have a special flavor. The young actors all did an amazing job on this one, especially outstanding is Leo Fitzpatrick as the scary and cynical Telly and Jason Pierce as his weird and somewhat eccentric ""sidekick"". Also one of Chloë Sevignys best performances, with both fear and beauty she portraits the sudden destiny and destruction of a young life. Incredible movie.

Not a statement on America's youth as a whole, but rather a group of NYC pre-teen/teenaged kids who hang out, get high, and screw.  What did most of us do when we were teenagers?  Clark is going to an extreme here, but we can not say that there aren't kids that live like this in the world. As far as crictism of the dialogue; most teenagers really DO talk like that when you're not listening. On crictism of one-sided characters; Casper is the ""dopest ghost you know,"" who also gives what little cash he has to the man with no legs, or his stolen peach to a lonely little girl.

I liked it. I think a lot of it is totally real. Having read most of the reviews for KIDS, I can tell you that half the people will say that this movie is totally ridiculous, and that teenagers aren't like this, and that life isn't like this, and the other half will say that KIDS is brilliant and that teenagers are like this, and that life is like this. People have different experiences as teenagers and with teenagers, so it is safe to say that some people will encounter kids just like these & some won't. But, the fact is that they do exist. I know many of them, and once upon a time was one. The only shocking thing about the movie was that people were so shocked by it. Especially the last scene, where Jennie is raped. It is unbelievable how common this is. The sad fact is that most of the teenagers I know wouldn't even consider that to be rape at all. But I digress - I think it is definitely a movie worth watching, but face it, it is just a movie. It is not something to gauge your moral compass by or to lose sleep over. It's a movie - get over it. P.S.- Don't blame Telly. Yes, he's a sweet talker, almost to the point of coercion, but in the end the girls have to take responsibility for themselves, and the fact that they are losing their virginity to a virtual stranger without a condom.

Its shot in a documentary style and this does give it a realistic feel. However the film does lack a story and there is only one sympathetic character in the film which is Jenny, who has contracted HIV from Telly(who only sleeps with virgins). Underage sex, drugs and in one scene mindless violence all play are part in these young people lives. The film works as a wake up call and offers an insight into a world which parents fear there children will tred. Perhaps the most shocking is these kids have no regrets and no conscience about what they are doing. The film might of worked if it were a genuine documentary but as a film it lacks heart, energy and real substance despite some good performances.

The way the movie tells its story also has problems.  The lead female character catches HIV from the lead male character, a guy who deflowers young virgins.  The catch, she has only had sex once ever.This has got to be the ultimate stupid flick.  Go to the CDC web site, less than 15% of people in the US with AIDs are women.  Less than 1% of all AIDs cases happens with teenagers.  This has got to be the statistical anomaly.

Nothing is sugar coated to protect parental feeling, you have to know that what we did as teenagers (and I'm 37 now,) most kids are introduced to at a much younger age. Sex is in every music video.

Unfortunately, these teenagers don't know that when everything is possible, everything becomes dangerous if you are not careful. The movie is powerful. Filmed in a dynamic way, in a way that brings you closer to the characters, it sends a very important message about AIDS. The problem depicted in the movie is that most of the teenagers think they are invincible, immortal, and they don't care about the things they do as long as they are happy. The picture shows what a poor education can mean, what a family with only one parent can do to a child who thinks he's above everybody.

Kids is the story of a group of reckless young adults who get into trouble and pass aids around. It has a lot of shocking moments, and the subject matter in general is pretty heavy. Some of the parts almost seem like child pornography because the cast seems so young. The part with the man on the skate board that has no legs is a little sad. I like the circularness of the film ;I think it makes it powerful and sends a good message. It is almost like a very intense cautionary tale. This movie is very graphic, but I think it is shot well.

Humans tend to have a bit of depth, some sort of duality, something inside. I don't want spend time with one-dimensional psychos. Most teens aren't psychos, and even those that are, however crazy they may be, are human. Whats the point in showing the sex and violence and nothing else? ""shock value"". What does its say? ""These people have sex and act violent"" answers Mr Clark. Then its pointless. And this film is. And its amazing how many morons fell for the laughably tacked on HIV ""plot"".

178,rsg2033,Kids is Little More Than PSA on AIDS,6,1 October 2008,"I don't think I've ever been more grossed out by an opening scene in a movie. The main character is tongue kissing what appears to be a thirteen year old girl over and over. The noise that it was making was particularly disgusting. Telly is only seventeen years old, but he is already a real dirt bag. He steals money from his parents and tries to deflower as many girls as he can, typically preying on girls that have just finished going through puberty. It is here that the main conflict of the movie is introduced. One of Telly's former conquests contracts HIV from him and tires to stop him from spreading his disease to his unsuspecting victims. Over the course of the movie at least three people are given the HIV virus from Telly: the first virgin that he deflowers at the beginning of the film, the second girl at the end of the film and the guy that they beat up in the park. But what I found troubling was that the girl who knew she got AIDS from him decided to just take some ecstasy and forget all about the fact that she was trying to stop him. She herself even becomes an instrument to spread AIDS by the end of the movie due to her irresponsible behavior. This is where the movie kind of just became an ambiguous story about how teenagers behave and forgot all about its own plot.Overall this movie mostly just felt like a public service announcement about the dangers of unsafe sex. I'm sure that back in the 90's when AIDS was an automatic death warrant this movie was very shocking and even more terrifying, but in the twenty first century where AIDS has lost most of its potency due to modern medicine this film is little more than a friendly reminder that condoms can save you from a lot of problems. Kids is still a good movie and it's worth watching just don't expect to get any life changing message from it. Much of the point that it was trying to make back in '95 is just common knowledge nowadays, but I would say that it is still worth a watch.",Kids
179,alphabetgreen1996,"""Gritty"" is not the word.",8,24 April 2010,"As an English man born in the 1960s (when mods and rockers were fighting on Brighton beach, I have to ask myself if this film shocks me. It doesn't (although the amount of early teenage nudity was too much. An equally strong message could have been put across with far more subtlety in that area) because thinking back to when I was a 16-17 year old art student, apart from kicking 7 tonnes of sh*t out of an innocent bystander and deflowering pre-pubescent virgins (virgins yes, but 16-18 year old ones in my case), there wasn't a lot of that film that I didn't do myself. Soft drugs, under-age drinking, even shoplifting will figure in the lives of most young people. It certainly did in mine (not so much the shoplifting, I have to say) until I caught myself on and joined the Air Force. So when you consider that this film is about kids growing up in one of the most notoriously violent cities in the world, after an hour of watching it, I was shocked (although far from disappointed) that I hadn't seen one single firearm being pulled.However, the documentary-style filming of these ""fallen"" characters does lend a certain grittiness to one's viewing experience, in that the style of acting and nature of dialogue is far more candid in its realism than your average film. I even had some sympathy for the ""Casper"" character after he gave the little girl some fruit and donated some money to a paraplegic beggar on the train. That was of course until he instigated a vicious multi-assault on a member of the general public. I sort of lost him at that point.It seems ridiculous that many reviewers have accused the film-makers here, of being exploitative. To whom, may I ask? Certainly not the actors. I believe that this film was a major platform for one Chloe Sevigny (now, a highly successful actor, model and fashion designer) and kick started her career, as it did for one or two of the other kids.I've yet to see the last half hour of this movie, but I will shortly. So far, I've been very impressed by all concerned, especially the young actors. And I would quite happily have given it 10 if they would have eased up on the child nudity a bit.",Kids
180,kenna2,"great film, spoilers, but kept to a minimum",8,7 July 2006,"Just watched this movie, it has to be said this is a real eye-opener.Kids tells the story of a group of teenagers from New York who love nothing else but to get high, drunk and have sex. However there is one thing that they do not know too much about, nor do they think that it will ever happen to them, this one thing being disease and more specifically HIV. From a viewers perception we see how it is all fun to start with, with small thoughts on the whole debacle, but how easy it is for someones life to be conflicted from one passionate moment.Straight from the first scene, the director lets you know exactly what to expect from this movie, i won't spoil it for you but basically it involves under age sex which is realistic in the way that the scene is shot. Showing the worries of sex from a virgins point of view. This scene also displays how one can tell the other not to worry and how simplistic but yet effective it all is to change a young persons mind.From then on we get a good feel of the teenage lifestyle in New York at that time, were people don't care about the possibility of STD's but just care about getting what they want which in this case is sex.The way the film shows the discussion of boys talking about sex and girls talking about sex is brilliant as each opinion conflicts with the opposite sex shown by switching between scenes after each discussion is made. But also shows the fickle mind between both in the sense that they both love sex and don't care too much about it being unprotected.From then on, there is so many jaw-dropping scenes that in effect there is too many to mention, but all in all this is a must see movie which i also believe would be an eye opener for teens even now. Kids makes you think, it makes you laugh, it also makes you sad and in the times were people think only about one thing, it really does change a person and make you think twice. 8/10",Kids

Or better yet if these kids just got their asses whooped like they probably would in reality.You know those arty stupid films that don't know how to wrap up a plot so they just suddenly END? That's how this one goes. Any hint of plot you might pick up ends up just being an illusion.There's a lot of buildup for the female main character that goes NOWHERE. Instead she goes to sleep, gets another pile of bricks dumped on her and the movie ends.So basically if you feel like going back to junior high and listening to a bunch of posers talk about getting laid and busting caps for 2 hours, watch this.",Kids
182,JDaigle2004,Kids in Summary,8,14 December 2006,"Kids is the first realistic tale of how teenagers act by writer and director Larry Clark. It tells the story of Telly and Casper, two friends growing up in a low-income, urban environment complete with drugs and sex. The entire films takes you through a 24-hour period of a group of just post-puberty teenagers as they test the notion that they are invincible.Clark, by the current year (2006), has a repetition in the film making industry for being cutting-edge and controversial. Though this is one of the most accurate portrayal of a group of people that very few filmmakers dare to talk about, it pushes a lot of boundaries.Many people are quick to label this movie as ""child porn"" for it's many adult themes. Therefore it is fair to warn anyone thinking of watching this film that it is intended for MATURE AUDIENCES ONLY, as it says explicitly on the cover. The movie portrays vivid pictures of violence, sex, language, and drug abuse all by under-age minors. With that being said, this is one of the best films to date. Clark should be honored for his gutsy portrayal of the real lives of these kids. This is not a family movie and this is not the movie you want your kids to see. For that reason, I'm giving the Larry Clark's ""Kids"" a 8 out of 10.",Kids

The film is almost like a documentary of a group of kids in NYC. It probably isn't completely realistic but its believable. It is a frightening wake up call to America.If you want to be moved watch this film. The acting is great for a group of rag-tag kids, they make the story really believable and passionate.

There are no eye opening facts or something that gets our imagination going. Moreover i don't like the fact that they just talk and talk despite of showing anything relevant. Its more like a documentary or a talk show really. All in all its a boring movie. Not a good end. Nothing that keeps you in your seat through the movie. They tried to make it more exclusive but they forgot the basics of making a good movie. It was a waste of time for me. Guess that sums it up. Hope that helps and warns potential viewers.

This is fairly true, and although the dialog and action can be described as 'realistic' there are probably many examples of behavior and language that's a lot worse than what goes on in this film. The most striking is that there is a 'comeuppance' at the end whereas most of this kind of behavior exists and thrives without any immediate and apparent consequences. But the point is that this is bad behavior and will have a bad ending. Whether all that is true or not is one for the social philosophers, but it's a great movie to bring up that subject and execute it fairly well.",Kids

Also, the documentary feel just doesn't work.

The film makers did a fine job portraying the lives of morally-defunct NYC teens over the course of one day.  The acting was good and there were some really original scenes that made you think.  But I just couldn't relate to the characters.  I couldn't sympathize with them. I just got angry with them. The character of Telly is one of the most grating people ever to ""grace"" the silver screen.  I was hoping and praying that someone would just do the world a favor and push him out a window.I'm not one to normally shy away from intense, or real topics in film. But, this one just had no appeal to me at all.  I judge if movies are good or not if they affect people, in a manner either positive or negative.  This movie didn't affect me in anyway; it didn't cause me to re-evaluate my life, or have a new appreciation of kids in NYC.  it just evoked feelings of rage, which were empty and useless.

I generally liked the film but I was expecting more, though I'm not sure what. I wasn't expecting this film to have a plot since Gummo doesn't, and I think the predictability of the plot was what missed the marks for me. It reminded me too much of the films they show you at school that scare you into safe sex. I think for a film this blunt, funny and strange, there could have done with something more disturbing as it was a bit too tame for my liking.I'm surprised this has such a high rating, though I think it may be because the film has a plot.

I understand the director wanted to be realistic but to me that was just an excuse to get away with child exploitation, There was no need to show the amount of girls bodies that was shown. As usual, it's all for the pleasure of the male: tits, two girls kissing, rape. In the swimming pool scene where the black kid is shaking his dick they don't show it, you hear the sound and you see their friends laughing, but when it comes to girls you see their nipples and their butts. It bothers me a lot how directors get away with inappropriate things in the name of art, like it somehow justifies whatever they do. There is no story, no point to prove apart from the fact that the blonde girl gets HIV after having one sexual encounter without protection. You see her crying and being miserable but nobody does anything to help her or tells her what to do, not even the people who tested her. It's a really upsetting movie to watch and I bet that was the director's intention, to disturb and provoke people. Well he did it but that doesn't change the fact that, to me, he's a pedo.",Kids

And my lifestyle wasn't that way because I was a bad kid, or grew up in an unstable impoverished home (quite the opposite in fact) I think it was mostly about wanting to FEEL like an adult.I'm sure if my own parents were to see this movie, they too would think it was over melodramatic and dark. Unfortunately that IS NOT the case. Harmony Korine is my age now, and lived in NY and I'm afraid to say that his portrayal is so accurate that we probably had some mutual friends. And in NYC, it doesn't matter what income level you're at, or how much you try to shelter your children.To be honest the only scene that was innacurate was the fight scene in Washington Square park...because there are usually police and undercover cops all around.

Well, in a way, that is what ""Kids"" is. I finally rented the film a few weeks ago and watched it. Let me just say, with a single viewing, I had mixed feelings. I didn't expect what I saw. I am not a prude person by any means, but all the graphic sex talk between the teenagers was a bit much. It was so descriptive and realistic to the point that it was almost too realistic to be real, if that makes any sense at all. However, after some thinking, I realized this movie is depicting the way some kids really live. There are kids who talk about sex all day, come from really screwed up families, and sleep with everyone in sight. The sad truth is that this is one of the most realistic films you can find out there today. This may sound like a stretch, but I feel like it should almost be shown in schools (with permission slips, of course) because if you want a movie that can really scare the crap out of teenagers into using protection and not sleeping around, I feel like this movie can do it.

211,Bwheels,Shocking Cinema *Spoilers*,7,27 February 2007,"Harmony Korine, at the age of only 18, wrote a screenplay that not only dealt with the problems of a specific group of teenagers but also acted as a social comment of the youth of America at the time. The Larry Clarke film ""Kids"", released in 1995 by Shining Excalibur Pictures (a division of Miramax, created solely to distribute this film) follows a group of teenagers living in the poverty of New York, never growing up but simply finding more dangerous and violent ways to satisfy themselves. The story focuses on Telly, a 17 year old skateboarder whose only goal in life is to ""de-flower"" as many virgins as he can, all the while drinking, taking drugs and partying with his like-minded group of friends. However the life of his last ""conquest"" has just become far more complicated when she discovers she is HIV positive after her all to brief relationship with Telly and now she must find him before he can ruin another virgin. This film has all the markers of shocking cinema, strict 18 certificate, problems with distribution, picketing outside of cinemas, denouncement by the government and persistent rumours surrounding the making of the film concerning scenes said to feature ""real drug use and sex between the actors"". However even to an audience unaware of all this trouble the film itself deals with issues that will shock the majority, it is not just the use of drugs and representation of sex presented, but the openness with which it is dealt. The audience would have to struggle to find any redeeming qualities in any of the main characters aside from Chloë Sevigne, who plays Jennie, the girl trying to track down the sexually indiscriminate Telly whist trying to come to terms with her own predicament. This blatant portrayal of the corrupt lifestyles of inner city teenagers is cruelly underlined by Casper, Telly's friend. He finds Jennie barley conscious at a party and has sex with the inebriated girl, unaware the she is HIV positive, this is a chilling reminder of the risks associated with their choice of actions.""Kids"" is constantly shocking, from the scenes of unprovoked violence, unprotected sex and criminal acts, through to children as young as 10 imitating the older group and partaking in drink and drugs, an ominous suggestion towards the cyclical nature of the life in the city.

This film makes some wonderfully awful visuals about teen-males, and what exactly they think about. What questions and conversations did this film mean to convey. It just showed crazy scenes of total extreme behavior....OK so Telly has a thing for virgins... thats believable and somehow with his goofy, screwed up face and semi-challenged speech pattern he sleeps with multiple girls....OK I'll let that slide. The character of Casper was one that I think a lot of kids can somewhat relate to, until the totally out-of-character rape scene, which made no sense at all. The character did not exhibit that type of behavior all film but then in the last two minutes his character is ruined. Until that scene he had shown good attributes like giving that peach to the girl or giving money to the legless man but then the director made sure that he killed every ounce of goodness left in every character by the end of the film- maybe that was his message, every teenager is untrustworthy and criminal, or at least the ones living in New York.How can this film be about normal kids? I guess the director just assumes that all urban New York kids have no code of ethics, no sense of responsibility and care about no one. Jenny is a prime example of this, how can she not contact Telly all day, I guess she took a break from searching because the film goes from mid-afternoon to late at night and how can she just stand there or not rush in trying to save the other girl from contracting a potentially lethal virus. Once again the director portrays even the girls as being complete garbage. There was no overall message to this film. I guess the only thing that you could somehow derive would be lock kids up at night, not let them out because they are all barbaric, selfish,and idiotic by nature. I watched this over a streaming connection on the internet and I still have to say I spent too much to watch this.If you want to see decent films on social commentary see American History X, Clockwork Orange, Equilibrium, Fahrenheit 451, Natural Born Killers, Crash or Syriana, Juice, Hoop Dreams, or Requiem for a Dream, Transpotting. Anything is better than this.",Kids
217,Badfish,Amazing. Best dialogue in a movie,10,2 August 1998,"Kids is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's funny, horrific, but realistic. Despite the cast having no previous acting experience, the performances are all wonderful, especially Justin Pierce's (as Casper). The realistic story line, the classic dialogue, and the horrific finale are the film's best features.What bothers me is that many people discredit the film. Saying that the movie is exploitation, or something even more ridiculous. I think that people are unable to except the fact that Kids is accurate. Not all teenagers behave like Telly or Casper, but you'd be lying if you said that teenagers don't talk like that. Kids is not exploitation, but rather a brutally honest piece of social commentary. Kids is a deterrent for high risk sexual behavior. The film is also a wake up call for insensitive parents who take no responsibility for their children. Therefore, Kids is a truthful portrayal of urban life.  it is not exploitation.",Kids
218,Josh-63,It was a true pictorial of the life of a lot of KIDS.,9,30 December 1998,"I believe that this movie is a true picture of a lot of teens life in this modern day.

219,mamba-2,"Decent representation, not totally accurate",7,26 January 1999,"Kids is a horrific film. Watching it, I can't help but become almost physically sick. What's so disgusting about it? Events/occurrences depicted in this film actually happen.Many teens today use drugs, and most teenagers experiment with sex at a young age. Kids shows this, and acts as a wake up call to parents who don't realize it. Kids gives a decent portrayal of the lives of many teenagers today.But it falls short in the sense that all it shows is how bad kids can be. It doesn't show that there are many kids today that are staying away from drugs and not being promiscuous. I'm 17 years old, have never used drugs or alcohol, and do not ""sleep around."" Kids gives a bad name to my generation and lays a stereotype on many teenagers - one that I, and many people I know, do not fit in.I gave Kids a 7 out of 10. Watch this movie to see what is happening/can happen to many kids out there - but not all of them.",Kids
220,buttman632,Kids is pretentious explotation at its worst. It's propaganda garbage!,1,2 January 2000,"One of my friends in school told me to see this movie. She told me that it was ""artful, realistic, and poignant"". When I saw the movie, I took out by Blacklist and put the director and writer on the top. ""Kids"" has got to be one of the most exploitational pieces of cinematic garbage ever to be filmed.""Kids"" is basically unnerving pornography disguised as an art flick and a social commentary. The message of ""Kids"" is this: Kids suck! Kids are scum! Kids have turned America into a raging hellhole!Just about everyone in this movie does drugs, has sex, and beats up people. All the kids talk about is sex, or how their ""last experience"" was (quite graphically, I might add). The movie later goes on to state that most of America's teenagers act like this! ""Kids"" is propaganda. ""Kids"" gives in to stereotypes, especially the stereotype that adults commonly have of teenagers today: that they are drug-using, Satan-worshipping, unprotected-sex-having degenerates (which for the most part is entirely untrue!). ""Kids"" is to teenagers what Nazi propaganda was to the Jews.I do know that drugs and sex are a problem for some teenagers living in America, but certainly not to the extent that the movie portrays them. I would say that less than 1% of America's teenage population actually acts like the kids in ""Kids"".Keep in mind that it is not just the message, but how the message was expressed. Like I said before, sex is all they talk about.The movie starts out with this slack-jawed idiot teenager named Telly trying to persuade this teenage girl into having sexual intercourse. The girl says ""yes"" and pretty soon they are going at it. He walks outside to meet his scumbag friend, and tells him how he only likes virgins, even referring to himself as the ""virgin surgeon"". The movie then cuts to two girls who have had sex with this neanderthalic bastard as they are talking about their experience with him. They then go to a health clinic where one of the girls is tested positive with AIDS. The AIDS girl then tries to stop this self-proclaimed ""f*ck monster"" from infecting other innocent teenage girls. In the process she stumbles upon all sorts of questionable activity. She sees a vicious fight, drug parties, rampant and graphically ridiculous sex (including three girls on one guy), and contempt for humanity. All of those activities involved teenagers. She eventually makes it to a party where Telly is picking up his next victim, where she tried to save her but she is too stoned to do anything. She is then raped by one of the partygoers, who takes advantage of her ""stoned"" state. That last scene has got to be one of the most graphic and unnecessary scenes ever filmed. The camera shows everything, and never goes away.The scenery is appalling too. You see grungy, apocalyptic, run-down apartments where little boys are smoking marajuana and having sex, where filth and contempt are so rampant that you want to throw up. This, my friends, is the true definition of propaganda. There is one big thing that this movie is lacking: TRUTH!Don't get me wrong, the film was well-made. They did ever so great a job at conveying how scummy us teenagers are. The movie was original, well-acted, and brilliantly directed. If only that skill was used to make a truthful movie.I consider the Harmony Korine (the writer, who was only 19 at the time) to be a sellout to all the teenagers out there. He made us look bad, and in doing so he attracted the attention of a media who is ever so eager to spread controversy. He took advantage of gullible adult minds, and from all of these atrocities he became a somewhat succesful filmmaker. He pulled a fast one on America. He now has parents and liberal critics saying that ""everyone should see this"". It is proclaimed as a ""masterpiece"" and a ""wake-up call to the world"". Sorry, Mr. Korine, your film is just propaganda filth. You add fuel to the anti-teenage campaign that has been a serious problem in the last ten years, already being fueled by uptight soccer moms, the Christian Coalition, and the Media itself. These are the people who say that ""kids nowadays are evil and out of control"" and that ""today's young generation has gone down the gutter"".To all readers out there, I suggest that you see ""Kids"". Don't see it to take it seriously, see it to get an idea of how art can be used to twist the truth. See ""Kids"" to get an idea of how Adult America sees us.We teenagers are decent people, that is the bottom line.",Kids
221,dajaniel-2,"Very powerful, disturbing, but very good overall",8,1 July 2000,"The filming, which is akin to the sort employed in docu-dramas that we have been seeing a lot of recently, transcends the movie-denoted style and brings the main themes straight in front of your face. You feel sometimes confronted by the seediness from the outset, leaving an uncomfortable feeling. Yet the source of this uncomfort is really rooted in the realism of the work. The themes underpinning the move - particularly of the dangers of permiscuity - are somewhat preachy, but raises a point in such a dramatic way that it is hard not to be effected and not to take notice.",Kids

223,psiroka-2,shock film -- but message says nothing,5,21 November 2000,"Reflecting on this film:1.  It's a shock film.  Does it represent the lives of 'most teenagers' who grow up in New York / America?  Of course not, and the comments/generalizations on this website that portray this film as ""an accurate depiction of teenage life..."" really disturb me.2.  Is the film's message powerful?  I'm not sure if the film maker is really trying to generalize his message of ""what's going on in the world"" to everything in life, but there's no doubt that there are people (kids) who live their life in this fashion.  Some things in the movie are unrealistic, and the plot didn't make sense to me at all times, but this really has nothing to do with the ""powerful"" message that the film delivers.  In fact, I'd say the film delivers a message that the media has already portrayed about America's youth, and even though Kids disturbingly presents this message, it really doesn't say too much that carries any weight.3.  Would I recommend it?  Eh.  It's worth seeing just to explore the director/writer's vision of this ""sick world"" that we live in.  Again, the subculture depicted certainly exists, but not necessarily in the way that Kids depicts it, and it's not necessarily as powerful or true as a generalization.To sum it up:  Shocking and disturbing stuff, but it doesn't live up to the claims of those who speak of it as ""brilliant"" and ""a masterpiece"" -- more like a shock flick whose message is not one of exploring the subculture, but rather a theme that is portrayed by mainstream culture, depicting the ""kids"" of today in a very mainstream and immoral way.",Kids
224,indiansfanatic,I'll never forget this film's experience!,7,29 January 2007,"I'll never forget the night that I saw this film for the first time. It was my sophomore year in High School, and I was at a friend's house for his birthday party. For some reason, I guess lack of knowledge, his parents rented this movie for us to watch at the birthday boy's request.I myself had just moved to Florida a few years prior, and had lived in an unsavory neighborhood in southern Ohio, where the day to day actions of the ""Kids"" in this film were nothing but the norm. While I can't say that seeing the film didn't affect me (it most certainly did) I wasn't as horrified at the end of the film as much as my new found friends were. One I remember (I won't mention her name) just burst out into tears and went into sort of a shock induced tantrum because she just couldn't believe all the horrible images she had just witnessed in the last 91 minutes.It was noticed that I wasn't as affected as all the others, and I admitted to the group that this is really want happens in the ""inner city"" and in the slums. I've been there, I've lived that life, I've been those kids. While at first, some were horrified by my statement, most were intrigued and asked a few questions.Needless to say after the round of questions, the festivities were brought to end for the evening and everyone went on their separate ways, no one ever mentioning the film again.For someone to watch this film and simply make the comment that this isn't what happens in the ""Real World"" that this is just some over-dramatic art film that exploits children; I advise you to take a closer look into your children's lives and see what they might be up to when your backs are turned.",Kids

When I watched it the first time in 95 or 96 I was so impressed with the cast, the script and dialog and the way the plot developed. I knew Rosario Dawson would be ""discovered"" after ""KIDS"" since her sensuous looks would captivate most men, any age. I was happy when I noticed that she'd been cast in Men in Black 2 because I knew she was on her way to a long big screen career. Harmony is such a great role model for independent film makers and producers and his attention to day to day reality and how most people really talk deserves to be applauded.",Kids
229,Krugen,"Bad dialogue, Poor acting, Uninteresting characters, Lack of plot",1,11 April 2001,"All I heard about in my sophomore year at high school was Harmony Karin's movie ""Kids"".  I kept hearing that it was ""realistic"" ""disturbing"" and many other adjectives often used to describe good independent films.  Finally, as a college senior, I had a chance to watch it.  The urge to shut it off as soon as it began was overwhelming.  I watched it through though, in the same fascination that one watches a nine car pileup.  Just when you think it can't get worse, it does.The only reason Kids was thought of as Disturbing was because adults do not like admitting that their children have sex.  There is nothing enlightening and no important message told in this movie. The characters are unlikable. They have no traits that are sympathetic or that would allow a viewer to associate with them.Dialogue, which I had been told is realistic, is just teenagers sitting around saying ""f**k"" at the end of every other sentence.  Add in the fact that the lines are poorly delivered and you have the sensation of watching a sixth grade play on acid.As for the plot... well... there is none.  It can be argued that this was supposed to be an ethnographic piece showing the lives of kids.  However, in my opinion, there is a clear attempt at a standard narrative plot.  It's put together as a series of random scenes that have nothing to do with each other.  Making this horrible ride of a movie bumpy. In the end Kids can be summed up with one word. ""Bad""",Kids

As a girl your afraid a lot, about get diseases, if it hurts, and most of all, GETTING PREGNANT.

234,lucas-guard,a brilliant movie about your children,10,4 December 2006,"this movie isn't about kids on the 'wrong side of the tracks' at all. the brilliance of the film is that these young people do in fact exist and they comport themselves in precisely this fashion. their parents aren't necessarily poor, apathetic, bad parents, what have you. the lack of air-conditioning in tele's apartment is the only real indication of any kind of poverty. steven's apt., by contrast, is near-oppulent. the kids aren't outcasts and they aren't simply other people's children. the reason a number of parents made a point of seeing the film and found it so poignant was because the kids, particularly the girls, aren't so outwardly different from their own children. if you found this movie 'dramatized' or confined to a narrow subset of American youth then you probably belong to a generation older than my own and are, frankly, a bit out of touch. if you pigeonhole these kids, as some of the other reviewers have, then you've really missed the point. all this having been said, i would like to endorse KIDS generally, it is an absolute MUST SEE and is, in my opinion, the best of Harmony Korine's work. it's an experience: buy a forty-oz., steele yourself, and get into it.",Kids

The acting is lacking at times, however being a complete cast of ""no names"" its pulled off very nice, helped of course by the story.The main problem people will have with this movie is explicit sexual content, nudity, language, and drug use throughout the movie.

They aren't old enough to have learned from their mistakes yet, and some of them will, and others wont. Granted that these kids are the extreme of the stereotypical teenager, Larry Clark must realize that in our jaded community you have to show the extreme to get your point across.But this isn't even the most extreme things anymore, even I can relate to many of the things in this movie, and have friends in rehab for things much worse then the kids did.

241,mixignisis,Relatively accurate platform with decent plot,7,21 June 2008,"This review is mainly a critique of the movie's style - the plot was fine, but I think one of the main purposes of this film was to accurately portray the behavior of 1990s teens...I was a teen 8 years later in a very diverse (77% minority) economically depressed post-industrial city near New York. In many ways, the kids in this movie remind me of several of my peers and several of the scenes(particularly in the less eventful beginning of the movie) are mirror images of things that have happened in my life... I'd say the basic platform for this movie is accurate. The story, as with most movies, is more dramatic and bizarre than what might actually happen to someone in a similar environment. My only complaint about the movie's platform is the scene where the skaters almost kill someone for no reason...While I remember similar things happening in my life, it was never to half the extent in this film - the lack of cops resulting from that scene, particularly in a city like New York, is just too hard to believe. Because this movie is most cited for its accuracy, I think its important to note that in this scene...Even if kids WERE this bad, there would definitely be cops, even in the crime heavy early 1990s... Other than that, I'd say every scene, and the totality of scenes closely resembled life in a similar (-the density) environment.",Kids
242,Darkelf280,"Scary, without having to be a horror flick",10,29 December 2002,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Warning Some SpoliersThis movie is a scary one. It is not a horror flick, but it shows how life in the city is for an adolescent growing up. The main character ""Telly"" Tries to deflower virgins in order to prevent getting aids. He always talks to his friend Casper about how ""sweet"" it was with his latest. The movie is very depressing. There is a twist of Irony in this movie as well. One of the girls who goes to get tested for HIV, has slept with 10+ guys (I lost count after ten, sorry) and does not contract the horrid disease, however Jennie (the girl Telly slept with) has contracted it, and Telly was the only person she slept with. The movie spans in 24 hours. In which Telly searches for his new 24 hour girlfriend, and Jennie must warn him before he can give another the deadly disease. Another frightening thing is that with all the kids in the movie you only see Telly's mom, but there is one thing that angered me. When you see her, she has a baby in her arms. She gives no indication about what Telly does, she just merely says be back by tomorrow. That infuriated me. What gives her the right to bring in another life if she does not care about the one she has already brought. When I saw this movie I told my mom about. Latter I bought it so now she can see the eye opener. The ending is really depressing because Jennie(The girl with HIV, given to her by Telly) fails, just as she gets to where he is, he is deflowering a virgin. It is a highly depressing film, I belive all teens she see this movie, because it shows you never know who else your girlfriend or boyfriend slept with, you never know what they got from before.

244,tristaradobe,A brief comment on Kids,7,1 January 2010,"This movie could be degrading women and promoting alcohol or unprotected sex. Good we can agree on that much. But it is so, because the purpose for it is, to fight fire with fire. The movie is an advocate against any acts the antihero's, in this film, participate in. I was a teenager when I first saw the film. I had no longing, whatsoever, to do any of the things they had just done. This movie brings criticisms of drugs and alcohol, unprotected sex and violence to another level. Everyone who saw it with me, would agree. And another thing they would agree on is that this movie did not, in any way, make them want to taste alcohol or take drugs or have unprotected sex or engage in violence of any sort for some time. This hullabaloo of violence and drugs does not seem to the audience as a fascinating world. And if it does not do that I must admit that I cannot see why it is such a harmful movie as people tend to say it is.This tactic is called reverse psychology and everyone who do not seem to realize it tend to get very angry because of the message they think it is spreading. My advice is: try learn something about psychology, sociology and philosophy before you comment in any haste. And you will get my meaning. It are movies like this that criticize, all those things mentioned above, in a more sever manner than those lenient 'do not take drugs' advertisements. But all in all, this movie sums up a close-up view of teenagers in a very disgusting way, and if it is not as real as some may tend to think it is, mainly because they themselves have not experienced such childhood or, on the more ironical side, have a child they think they know up-close, then it is still a movie to enjoy.Thank you for reading...",Kids

247,candiholicfreak5,"Awkward looking paedophile obtains ecstasy by having sex with dumb, young girls",5,29 May 2010,"Before I viewed this film, I read some reviews on IMDb saying ""it was a masterpiece!"" or ""greatest film ever."" Backed up with great reviews but somewhat tipsy rating, I still hoped for the best. I ended up being very disappointed. I know the director was trying to be ""realistic"" and truthful as much as possible, but seriously this wasn't even a movie- barely even watchable. Throughout the film I was disgusted by the main character; I hated his face for some reason. It was the way he talked all ghetto yet looked like a mentally challenged geek that actually killed the film for me. I'm sorry but his character is so- unrealistic; even his history on how he had ""deflowered"" girls was so unbelievable. Even more fake was how the girls just ate all that cute talk like some dumb, naive- hey, even if they're only 14 or 13, they should have known better. Why? Because I'm 15 and this was really just unbelievable.You know what really just destroyed the whole movie? I really had hopes that the red headed girl would find Telly and confront him that he has HIV and totally kick his ass. But instead, she saw telly and the other girl having sex and left. Yup, that's how the movie ended. No resolution, no conclusion, just her getting raped by Casper, telly's friend. This is one of the worst films I have ever seen, but I'm giving it a 5 because it tried to be an HIV awareness advocate.Seriously, I don't care for the red-headed chick; she let another girl get HIV. I don't care for telly; he's a jackass and the rest of the characters were mostly high or having an orgy or beating up some dude. Man, this is so unrealistic, white kids beating up a black guy...Wow... I'm sorry but I can't rate this a good movie because all the characters sucked. None of them deserves any sympathy whatsoever. I really wish I didn't watch this movie. If I were you, I'd watch city of god. WAAYYY better movie.",Kids
248,dylantallguy,"One of the greatest works of the 90's, raw and real",10,25 June 2003,"I remember when I saw Gummo (directed by the writer of Kids, Harmony Korine) I thought it was a work I would never forget, when I saw it again I began to wonder if the film was more than just provocaturism, and that maybe this filmmaker was really a genius.  When I saw Kids (his earlier work) it became clear to me that Harmony Korine who wrote Kids at the age of eighteen was indeed onto something big.  The Film Kids deals with a day in the life of several New York teens who get their kicks by deflowering virgins and doing drugs bought on their parents tab. This film totally engrossed me because it presented life in a real almost documentary style, the veiwer is forced to spend the day with these reckless teens, but left impotent to intervene in their actions.  Throghout the film we are left as a spectator, the film rarley comments on these kids actions but rather presents them as they are, without ""over-editing"" or manipulation, the result in in my opinion the most powerfull film of the decade.",Kids
249,tobypetterson-1,Realistic but vilifying,7,3 September 2004,"I have two things to say about this film: First: It is a portrayal of an EXCEPTION rather than a rule, in many ways.Second: It portrayed this exception VERY well.To the main details, the main character in this movie, as we find out a little bit of the way through, is HIV positive (yet presumably doesn't know it). He likes to have sex with virgin females, as he does so in various scenes in the movie. A little way through the film, one of the females he'd had sex with before finds out she is HIV positive. We also hear the females he has sex with in various scenes, moan - perhaps in visible (or audible) discomfort (quote: ""oh argh - that hurts - oh oh"") and I found it easy to be perceived that he is probably (to an largely immoral length) ""good at"" seducing girls into sexual activities. All horrendously graphic and realistic, except for one thing, and these words were ringing through my head much time after I had seen the whole film-length in the hope (in my humble opinion) that everyone who has seen it would also understand - that while this is a realistic portrayal of SOME sexual events in our world today (and this should be taken seriously), perhaps we also need to consider:""IT'S NOT ALWAYS LIKE THIS!!""What we have in this movie is a display of not only youth in their most immoral ""wrong side of the tracks"" character, but also all the things they do coming along with it! Most of us should be at least aware that sex is potentially a glorious and pleasurable experience in itself, and yet this movie showed only the ""ugly"" side of sex while not disclaiming that it is doing so, I believe. For example, if they had made it more clear to us that these instances involving careless HIV transmission, emotional seduction (etc...) are the EXCEPTION and not the RULE (so to say...) when it comes to sex...then I would have felt more comforted when viewing this movie.Don't get me wrong for one SECOND - I have friends who have lived with the HIV virus for the bulk of their lifetime and it really does horrify me. Speaking of AIDS awareness promotion, this movie was also very well done IMO. It is an issue to EVERYONE however, and we should not vilify kids more than adults because EVERYONE is at risk of contracting this horrendous virus in this world today.Lets remember that while this movie was in many areas well done, we must not let it vilify our intrinsic, OVERALL ideas of (1) Sex and (2) Youth ......in society today.7/10",Kids
250,mightytx33000,an Underground Classic,10,7 October 2003,The Film Kids is a great underground classic. This film apeals to so many people I know and be because we can relate to the life. We know people like all the characters in the film even telly. Thousands of kids in the US as least should be able to relate in some way to these kids and their Hormonal lusts and the desire to get messed up.

I didn't get that wrong?If you are a real-life version of one of these kids, I understand how you might like the movie, but I doubt it's going to change your lifestyle. Ditto for the absentee parents of the kids.For the rest of us....what's the point? What does this movie do? I will say that it kept my interest while I was watching it. I wanted to find out how it would end, and then it does end, darkly. Doesn't have any re-watch value for me.The intention was clearly to provoke. Point a camera at this stuff and say, ""Here, look at this. What do you think about that? Don't like it, do you? Doesn't sit right, does it? That's right, it doesn't. And what are you going to do about it? Nothing. You can't do anything about it. Hah! We don't have to explain it either, because it's art, so it just is what it is.""The trailer quotes a critic calling the movie a ""Wake up call.""  If this movie had actually caused a decline in any of the problems it depicts, you could say that, but it didn't. If this movie didn't solve anything, but was really funny like a Michael Moore film (sorry, Michael, but it's true) it would be worth it, but it isn't.I don't think this movie is a dark comedy, or an exploitation film, or porno as people suggest, because I think they were trying to make a serious movie.

This is especially true of cosmopolitan cities like NYC where they can easily get lost in the crowd. The acting is great, even though they are amateurs essentially picked up off the street - that's what gives it's sense of believability; of a documentary.I must disagree with others here saying that all parents ought to watch this movie. While there are definitely kids in similarly bad circumstances virtually everywhere, most other, less-tainted, kids can get through childhood and adolescence without ever knowing that world, and so can their parents. You can't force a movie like this upon anyone, especially if they are not open to the idea of exposing themselves to it. This film needs to be watched by the open-minded.",Kids

To me when I watch this movie, it's like watching my life when I was 17, without the HIV part of course. I love this movie and I think it's one of the most accurate, best ever made on the subject of youth. This and Thirteen as well. Both are very realistic. We don't like to admit that kids are doing these things like drugs, being promiscuous and skipping school to get high. But it's how it is happening in many cities not just New York.

My point is this, they now how life is for some people. That is why he chooses to make his movies like this. The faux-documentary is the best way to profile the two characters of Telly and Casper as they travel through the day. This film is not as explicit as his other ""Bully"" or ""Ken Park"" but at points it can seem more real, just because of the camera work and colouring.

While the opening scene may titillate an audience which is too young to see the movie in a theater, by the time the closing and yet better framed scene arrives all sexual interest has been stripped from the viewer. The effect of this movie is depressing and, if you have a child, equally terrifying. It points to the moral abyss that yawns open to accept those who have rejected the puriance of their elders but have not yet found their own way.

At the same time, I will not call these youth amoral, at risk, or problem children. They are living their lives the only way they know how so who are we to judge their actions? Better to judge the institutions that failed them. The school system that does not take an interest in them or teach them the importance of safer sex in a way that they will understand, the capitalistic system that forces their parents to never be able to see their children because they must work so much to just barely survive, or the criminal justice system that unjustly targets youth of color, especially men.

The acting might have been interesting enough if there was some semblance of a story to act; unfortunately, the writer/director chose the standard shock route to express his ideas. The dialogue is stilted and pedestrian, and the shots are typically grainy, which I suppose is meant to be a metaphor for life or something oh so deep.

I never hung out with people that acted like that, and i've never publicly exploited myself like many of those girls did. It was really sad for me to realize how accurate the movie was though. It makes the movie ""Thirteen"" look like a Disney movie. The movie makes me want to lock any future kids I end up having in a box, and not let them out until they are 30. It's definitely a movie parents should see. I've had way too many friends who's parents live this life of ignorance. They turn their backs and deny that their children could be doing anything wrong.

263,pinkprincess8283,Could have done without it.,2,9 February 2005,"After watching this film for the first time, I have to admit that it might be scarier than any horror film I have seen. First of all, I am a 21 year old girl from a suburb of large city. All of my friends in junior high all talked about this movie like it was great. I was expecting it to be great as well. When I was 14 all I wanted to do was rent this movie, but I was never allowed. Fortunately, it was a good choice not to rent the movie at 14. My life was nothing like the kids that were portrayed in the movie. I've never even encountered anyone who has lived a life similar to the kids in the movie. Yes, I am naive and have lived a sheltered life. It probably would not of had that big of an effect of my life because I wasn't having sex, drinking or doing drugs anyways.Furthermore, I don't think the kids/parents who this movie was calling out to would really think twice about the actions they were doing. It cannot be a wakeup call for America, if the intended audience just doesn't care. Do you think if the kids in the movie saw a film similar to this would they change their actions? No, they will continue to think they were invisible to HIV, STDS and PREGNANCY.I will give the movie credit for not glamorizing sex, drugs and alcohol. Unlike other movies, the kids in the movie don't look cool when they are engaging in these acts because they aren't attractive. The more they engage in these actions the worse they look, which is true to life. When I first saw some of the actors I didn't realize why they weren't the typical beautiful people you encounter in films. Instead, they look like normal people. Which makes it even scarier to watch.After watching Telly and Casper talk after he just ""devirginized"" a 12 year old almost made me vomit. I was tempted to turn off the movie, but decided to continue watching to see if it got better. It really did not.My major problem with the film was how the females in the film were portrayed as desperate, sluts, or victims. All of them. Even Telly's mother seemed to be on the end of desperate. Why wasn't there a female character to stand up to these boys or say no? When Jennie is looking for Telly in the park, the one girl said she didn't agree with the boys almost killing that kid - yet she did nothing about it. Perhaps they would have beat her up too? But she had a choice she didn't have to stay and watch. It was just disgusting to see these female characters get walked all over in the film. As a young female viewer, I was appalled most at this. In addition, the scene in which the females are talking about their sex lives is really disturbing and not realistic. My friends and I do talk about sex, but not like that. Also, why is female oral sex never mentioned in this film? If it is going to be realistic it should be mentioned too- especially by the girls doing the talking in this scene, but it is forgotten I guess because it is a male dominated film.Overall, I was disgusted with the film. I would not recommend this film to anyone who does not want to see a 12/13 year old having sex with a teenage boy who has HIV.",Kids

It tries to be real and does a pretty good job of it. It is so real that it will probably be offensive to some people but the point the movie tries to make is that the real lives of a lot of teenagers are full of some shocking experiences. This movie hits you immediately with the very first scene being the 16 year old guy who is the main character making out, then having sex with a 12 year old girl. And no there is no underage nudity, don't get excited. But there are scenes of sex, not much nudity, of the other teens and there is a rape scene of the girl who has passed out at a party. The movie tries to depict a typical day in the life of some screwed up teens but there is no real point other than to maybe make you angry or concerned.

267,dharma2011,This film is degrading to young women & depicts sexual violence,1,16 December 2008,"This film depicts 13 year old girls being raped. It also depicts them as passive, dis-empowered and unable to engage in intelligent decisions. I found myself really frustrated watching young girls get raped while screaming ""It hurts, it hurts"". I find no value in this film in terms of education about sex or drugs. It is so extreme in terms of sex, violence, theft and other amoral acts that it does NOT depict the typical teenager--then or now. It also shows a girl drugged and then her legs being lifted up to her ears as she is raped. I was aghast at this and other scenes. It leaves women feeling like victims--because during the entire movie the girls are victims. The film did show some pubic hair and was very explicit without getting into nudity. One scene where a stranger is beaten is highly disturbing as well. If they were going for shock value, then OK I was shocked that a film could use a roll to depict young men treating each other and others so poorly. They also discuss the girls very graphically--offering their hand so that one could smell the scent of the girl he had just conquered's vagina. This was a sad little movie, which depicts the extremes of past and present. I am a former faculty member at an Arizona university and feel qualified to say that this film has little if any educational value. It is more disturbing than educational or entertaining. A word of caution: this depicts graphic discussions of sex and simulation of the act, along with over 150 swears. Combine this with a gang beating the heck out of a stranger for no reason and you have a film that should not be watched by most of us that don't need negativity and have respect for young girls.",Kids

The movie so clearly points how that they are at risk for heartache, pain and their very lives by their naiveté and lack of boundaries for fast line seductions such as Telly's. In fact the movie could be incorporated into public school sex education programs for girls. Although the movie's comments on current modernity of adolescence are 21st century, its message is universal and timeless. This primitive social behavior has been going down for eons. Also tragic is the widespread saturation of drug use. This supports the intellectual theory of Darwins natural selection. Some will die young.

272,cademartin,Unrealistic,2,27 November 2015,"As a 17 year old myself, I'm one of the first to tell people that teenagers are not as socially undeveloped as people think we are. And by that, I include all teenagers, not just 17 year olds or older.This movie though, is so extreme, that its not even remotely close to the reality of what its like to be a teenager. First of all, the movie portrays everyone from the ages of thirteen to eighteen as living lifestyles that are pretty much the same. The truth, however, is that people change tremendously throughout their teenage years. I know quite a few people who told me they wouldn't be promiscuous, drink, or party when they got to High School as thirteen or fourteen year olds and then did all that when they got a little bit older.The parties in the movie were truly bizarre as well. There were scenes where preteen kids were smoking joints at a High School party. That makes absolutely no sense, in all my years in High School, I can tell you that nobody invites twelve or eleven year olds to a High School party. Some people don't even want to invite freshmen much less someone who just started Middle School.The screenwriter also seems to be under the impression that any random person can just walk in on a high school party. Real High School parties are very secretive, people don't want their parents, neighbors, or the cops to find out so they go to great lengths to make sure that it looks like nothing is happening. People park their cars in different streets and walk, the doors are locked, windows are shut, sometimes even the music will be turned down if you think someone is coming. In the movie though, a thirteen year old girl is able to simply walk into random orgies happening all over the city. Not only this but is also able to walk around the streets at night, no problem, just another day in these crazy teenagers' lives where no curfew, police, or parents exist.Despite what I've said though, wild stuff still happens. High Schoolers do party, sometimes the parties are unsupervised and when they are, there is often alcohol, there is often grinding, making out, and sex happening, sometimes there are even drugs. There's a lot of stuff my mom doesn't know about that I've done or participated in. As far as the language goes, teenagers do curse a tremendous amount and conversations or jokes about sex are very frequent and graphic. Even Middle School teenagers can surprise you, I saw people do some pretty sexual stuff when I was in 8th grade.So while I do want to point out that you shouldn't have unrealistic expectations of what what we're like and use that to impose restrictions that don't make sense... This movie, is fantasy. Even the parts that are somewhat true, are portrayed incredibly unrealistically and I can't think of one person who acts like the characters in this film. I can't speak for the 1995 teens since youth violence was supposed to be much higher then but as far as physical aggression goes, most High Schoolers rarely if ever fight people, and rape is considered abominable.",Kids
273,2bassnet,best film around,10,27 September 2005,"i love kids it is a fantastic story that i can personal relate to the drugs violence and sex is all to common in the world i come from it shows are American counterparts and should be shown to all city or town kids of the ages 13-16 at school i found something to relate to in this film and you probably will as well.the characters are interesting and we get in to the mind set if you will of the main characters Casper, Telly and Jennie but also into the mind of the average kid skater like myself i find it hard to believe that there are many kids that haven't actual seen this film and seen an element of themselves and friends this is a controversial master piece and should be bought",Kids
274,godhatesrednecks,Shock,2,30 November 2005,"As a shock/brutalist film student, I am expected to self censor and respect the safety of the film environment. People have Personal Limits. For some, its Alien. For others, its Clockwork Orange. I found my Limits.Larry Clark's 'Kids' is viscerally, emotionally and intellectually disgusting. I've watched the first 25 minutes of Telly and his exploits of 'Virgin Surgery' and I sit here now, having walked out of my 'A Level' Film Studies Class because I refused to watch something so sick and depraved that its reality has been forced upon me.Whilst it does indeed deal with a problem so common among todays adolescents (And I should know - my mom works in a Sexual Health Clinic), this film is done with such distaste I have not had a full nights sleep since Last Sunday night (It being Wednesday today) when I saw the first 20 Minutes. Is this film supposed to be about awareness? Clark films this so lax, the scenes of a more sexual nature being continued way after having made their point, I begin to wonder - just who is the audience for this film? I think Mr Clark my have the problem of an over enjoyment of voyeurism, and not quite knowing when to turn the camera off.I recommend this film to anyone wishing to lose sleep, or those who need to run up psychiatric bills fast.",Kids
275,bronxwide26,CRAZY AND UNRESTRICTED! THE 10TH Anniversary,10,19 October 2005,"This movie is very good. It's basically about teen sex in the mid 90's and the dangers of HIV among sexually active people. this movie takes place in nyc in 1995, at the time i was 16. It was so real to me , just watching it i felt like a teenager back in the 90'5. the characters were raw and unrestricted . The situations were so real . it's almost like it was a documentary. casper is my favorite characters. so wild and unleashed. he reminded me of a lot of young guys like that in nyc. R.I.P to justin pierce (the actor who played casper). it's a good movie to watch with your peoples. good , crazy ,wild and funny movie. GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Kids
276,akosters001,This movie seems to attack effects rather than causes,1,28 February 2006,"Let me start by saying this is probably the worst movie I've ever seen, besides that parasite eve movie that i watched because i thought it would be cool like the video game was. Anyway...If you look on the surface and not much deeper, you will see the ""youth of our nation"" (the extremity of a statistic) being corrupted and destroyed by drugs and sex blah blah blah. It had a lot of potential but that was washed down the drain with scenes that were way drawn out and some pretty poor directing.Let me ask you a question. Did you see ANY parents in the movie? There was one parent. And she was smoking cigarettes while breastfeeding. She was smoking cigarettes every second around her baby. To me this movie is really about bad parenting. ""Do you know what your kids do when you're not around?"" No you don't because you aren't ever around, you are being a bad parent, maybe if you raised your child normally and taught him/her whats right and wrong, acted as a guide and a loving parent, that wouldn't happen.I bought this movie for seven bucks thinking it would be more along the lines of requiem for a dream. I thought it would be like a punch in the face and a knife to the heart. I wanted to see a movie that would really hit me. Watching this movie was just a waste of time. I wish there was some way i could get the 2 hours of my life back that i wasted.",Kids
277,BigFatCone,Summer in the city.,10,24 November 2005,"This is a great film about something very true and very real. In the real world we don't have heros and bad guys, life is more than black and white and this movie shows you how life really could be or in some cases actually is. Sex, drugs, violence and HIV are around us all the time but most of the time we don't notice or even care.I wasn't raised in NYC nor had I bad parents but I recognize either my self or my friends in almost every minute and do you know why? Because we are human beings - We make stupid decisions, hurt other people, lie and steal. But we also have friends, dreams and hopes. The kids in this movie aren't bad, they're just not like you.This movies isn't about the dangers of unsafe sex, drugs or how wrong it is to beat the crap out of some one - It's about other human beings and the world they live in - The world we all live in.",Kids
278,anddontforgettobreathe_3,All too real..,10,21 December 2005,"I first saw this movie when i was 10 years old. I didn't take much from it then, but when you grow up you see just how real it is. I thought the little kids doing drugs and all of the sex were just there because it was a movie. Now that I have grown up and i see all of this stuff happening, the movie truly shows how scary life is for stupid-ass kids like us. Drugs are EVERYWHERE and it shows just how easy it is for us to find them. Sex is the exact same way. Its everywhere. And you don't know who has what. And just because a kid is 12 or 13 or 14 doesn't mean they cant or wont have sex. Their young minds can be persuaded very easily. Look at the first and the second sex scene with Telly, the words are almost exactly the same. That is one of the most real parts of the movie. I've seen it myself. Not with 12 year old girls but with girls who are anywhere from 16 to 17 to 18. The movie should be something that every parent should watch and take it very seriously.",Kids
279,lane1981,Should be required to watch in High School,10,21 December 2005,"KIDS is a dead-on accurate portrayal of the troubled youth of our times. But what a lot of people don't realize is this problem exists not only in large cities like NYC, but is without a doubt a serious problem in small towns. Homemade drugs and some '40s' followed by a 'roll in the hay' is the favorite Friday night pastime in a lot of rural areas. In some ways, small town kids have a bigger risk because the free clinics and youth programs available to kids in urban areas don't reach out to the country. Kids and parents alike seem to share the mentality of ""that stuff just goes on in the cities"". I grew up in a town of less than 10,000, and there were kids exactly like Telly and Casper in my high school- from the lingo and behavior right down to the dirty, stretched out t-shirts.AIDS aside, what I think is the scariest part of the movie is when Telly and Casper go to Telly's house, and his mom is there. She takes her parental duty as far as asking ""where have you been?""- to which Telly responds with a lie, saying they were out looking for jobs. The audience knows they are lying, obviously- but you can tell the mother doesn't really believe it either- she's just too lazy, or preoccupied to bother with the whole thing. Pretty common occurrence among today's parents.KIDS should be a part of the required curriculum in Sex Education classes for all high school freshmen. Any parent who believes the vulgarity and sex and drugs is exaggerated or glorified is in need of a serious wake up call. If it's not your kid doing these things, then it's the one sitting next to him in class. And don't be so sure it isn't your kid.",Kids
280,nangelo-50699,One of my favorite all-time films,10,6 April 2021,"It's good to see this movie still disturbs people so many years later. I absolutely love this movie. It brings back so many memories of my teen years. It also makes me nostalgic. I love pushing the envelope of what's acceptable and this movie certainly does that. It speaks to my soul. It's explicit, raw and vulgar, but also truthful, enlightening and educational.",Kids
281,JsJnJcNh,This movie was very disturbing,1,23 February 2006,I made the mistake of picking up this movie and talking my mother into renting it. I said kids hey this should be a good movie I AM a kid so why not. My mother fell asleep before it could even begin and the first scene just took me a for a loop I thought maybe it doesn't go any further than that. Basically it's about all these kids having sex and passing AIDS to one another. At 12 years old. It confused the heck outta me kinda. scared me for life really. I never could figure out if I didn't like the movie or if i did. This movie has the potential to either scar you for life or help you. either way this movie is not something that I would recommend you see.,Kids
