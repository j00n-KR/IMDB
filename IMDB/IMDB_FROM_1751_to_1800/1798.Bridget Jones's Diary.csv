0,TheLittleSongbird,Much more than a chick flick,8,11 July 2017,"It was the cast that drew me into seeing 'Bridget Jones's Diary', although there were doubts as to whether Renee Zellwegger would work, as well as being familiar with the books, finding them entertaining enough reads if not among the best personally read, and that Richard Curtis has done some other great work.'Bridget Jones's Diary' is a pretty darn good adaptation of the book, it doesn't have everything included (that would have been a tall order) but the essence and what made the book work are captured incredibly well. This said, it is a very good film on its own terms, it can be dismissed (and has done) as a chick flick and a film just for women. It is much more than both those things, being a film that tries to appeal to both sexes and having more depth than your average romantic comedy/chick flick.Maybe 'Bridget Jones's Diary' doesn't cover any new ground. Maybe it doesn't break any conventions. That didn't matter to me, because whether it does matter with any film, TV series, episode etc. is wholly dependent on how well it executes everything else, everything else is executed with very little to complain about.Some parts were a little contrived and there is a slightly draggy section around half-way, but these were minor issues really.'Bridget Jones's Diary' is attractive visually in a film that doesn't require epic sweeping cinematography or opulence, but still manages to be beautifully shot, cohesively edited and have striking locations. Personally really liked the music, with a mix of the old greats and more contemporary performers, and it fits well.A good script always helps, and it's the script that's one of the main good things here. The humour can be daft but is often hilarious and full of wit, while the romantic parts are sentimental but never mawkish or overdone and the more drama-oriented moments have an air of poignancy. Much of the film is also deliciously charming and to me relatable. Bridget manages to be more endearing here than she is in the book, to me she was easy to sympathise with and feel pity for regardless of her faults and the numerous things she does wrong, and quite a lot of us will find a lot of ourselves in her character.Even if new ground is not covered, bright and breezy pacing and remarkably deft directing from Sharon Maguire in her directing debut help make that not count against the film.Renee Zellwegger is fantastic in the title role, any initial doubts were completely subsided after seeing a performance of immense charm and that was both funny, awkward in the adorable sense and sympathetic. She does a good job with the accent too.Cast against type, Hugh Grant still brings a smarmy charm so despite being a cad (which he brings out without seeming ill at ease at all) you do see what Bridget sees in him. Colin Firth is reserved and understated but injects the right amount of dignity, charisma and charm to not make the character dull in a role that seemed like it was written with him in mind (that his character's name is a play on from his most famous role, Mr Darcy in the wonderful 1995 'Pride and Prejudice', further gives that impression).The rest of the cast are a whos who of veteran British talent, all doing reliably solid jobs, with the always good Gemma Jones and Jim Broadbent coming off best.Overall, a delight and much more than a chick flick with something for everyone regardless of gender or age if given a chance. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Bridget Jones's Diary
1,Leofwine_draca,Ugh...,3,11 June 2018,"BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY is exactly the kind of film I hate watching: a chick lit adaptation which is supposedly warm, quirky and loving, but which instead turns out to be a presentation of cliches, lame humour, and some embarrassing mugging performances. It's the film that soured me to Renee Zellweger with all of her fake mannerisms and plummy, fake-sounding British accent. I have liked Colin Firth and Hugh Grant in other films and I'll admit that they work very hard on their characters here, but the end result is just too schmaltzy to be effective.",Bridget Jones's Diary
2,SnoopyStyle,Renée Zellweger adorably awkward,7,4 January 2016,"Bridget Jones (Renée Zellweger) is 32, over-weight, drinks too much, smokes too much, and perpetually single. At the New Year party, her mother tries to set her up with family friends' son divorced lawyer Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) who isn't happy with the setup. She starts a diary vowing to fix her life. She has a crush on her boss Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) at the London publisher. She begins a relationship with him despite his womanizing past. It goes bad and she quits. She gets a spot as a TV reporter which results in some usual reporting. Darcy gets claimed by lawyer colleague Natasha (Embeth Davidtz). Darcy and Cleaver were once best friends but an affair with Darcy's wife have made them enemies. She bounces back and forth between Darcy and Cleaver. All the while, Bridget's parents' marriage is in trouble.Renée Zellweger is adorably awkward. She does some tough work transforming herself into a chubby Brit. I'm sure a real Brit would probably work better but Zellweger does a good job. Also there is a question of exactly how chubby she really is. The movie tries to accentuate her weight but she's never not adorable. The story is fun and sitcomy. It has its own heart especially with her father played by Jim Broadbent. It has two dashing male leads and all the angsty love triangle fun in the world.",Bridget Jones's Diary
3,kosmasp,Relatable Individual,8,25 May 2021,"I had completely forgotten how well done this was ... it's been a minute since I last saw this (or the sequels for that matter). But now that I've rewatched it I remember why I really liked the first one. And why this was another example of Renee Zellwegger being the go to girl/woman back then! She was the everyday woman, everyone could see herself in her or with her. She was charming, fun and just seemed to be the woman you'd want to spend the rest of your life with.Having said that, she also was accessible to a man like Hugh Grant - well the character he was portraying! I do not think I know him personally - private escapedes aside. His character is charming, yet you know something is off with him. He just can't love only one individual ... which you know for a romantic comedy is not the best partner for our female main character. We're not there yet that polygamy is a thing in mainstream movies ... maybe it never will be a thing ... maybe it will!? Who are we right now to judge such things? Exactly, let the others do the judging.Having said, there are things that are cringe worthy (fist fighting depicted as an event and some other non PC related incidents) and there are inconsistencies: while the already mentioned fist fight is based on reality, we also get a totally movie moment when breakaway glass gets involved ... of course all is just there to enterain, so while one is real and the other is fake, both are meant to be fun. So if you are not to nit-picky ... you will quite enjoy yourself!",Bridget Jones's Diary
4,gavin6942,Not My Cup of Tea,6,2 April 2015,"A British woman (Renee Zellweger) is determined to improve herself while she looks for love in a year in which she keeps a personal diary.Whether or not this is a good film depend on who you are, I suppose. Romantic comedy is not really my cup of tea, and this one is more romantic and less comedy, so it may be even less my cup of tea than just the average romantic comedy. I like Hugh Grant and Renee Zellweger, and this was a good role for Colin Firth before he went A-list... but still, following a woman's love life is not my preferred subject matter.Why this ended up on my list of things to see is completely beyond me, but now it has been seen and cannot be unseen. Let us chalk this up to taking one for the team.",Bridget Jones's Diary
5,lee_eisenberg,I guess that we can add Renee Zellweger to the list of Americans who can actually do a believable accent.,7,31 December 2005,"I wouldn't call ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" the best movie of 2001 (and I usually have no interest in ""chick flicks""), but I do think that it was worth seeing. Renee Zellweger plays the titular character, a working Brit who has some plans to drastically change her life. I think that Colin Firth's and Hugh Grant's characters weren't totally necessary, but I guess that they were conduits of a sort. Bridget herself can gravitate between sweet and bitchy, and she does just that. Overall, Zellweger's energy makes the movie really good. I don't know whether anyone else would have done the role better, but she certainly does a good job. Definitely worth seeing.",Bridget Jones's Diary
6,jboothmillard,Bridget Jones's Diary,8,11 March 2005,"Helen Fielding originally started writing the leading fictional character's scribbling as articles for The Independent, this was later fully published and became the biggest selling book of the 1990s, so it was only right for her and rom-com writer Richard Curtis (Blackadder, The Vicar of Dibley, Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill) to team up and bring her to the big screen. Basically Bridget Jones (Oscar BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Renée Zellweger) is an average woman living in London who works in an office, has issues with her weight, smokes and drinks, has many imperfections, and is single. Following New Year, to take control of her life, Bridget decides to start a diary, to tell the complete truth, to try and change her habits, to lose weight and stop smoking, and express her true feelings about her job, her family and friends, and of course her pursuit to find the right man. Bridget works in publicity at a book publishing company, and fantasises about her boss, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant), one day he starts to flirt with her, and soon enough they embark on a relationship. Bridget has fallen head over heels for Daniel, but his feelings are not reciprocated, she discovers he is a womaniser, and he even becomes engaged to another woman, she quits her job at the publishing office and eventually finds work in television journalism. Bridget on many occasions encounters barrister Mark Darcy (BAFTA nominated Colin Firth), he is good looking, but she cannot stand him, she also assumes he is already dating colleague Natasha (Matilda's Embeth Davidtz), but he surprises her at event by confessing that he likes her. Bridget celebrates her birthday, inviting her friends round for dinner, only to cause chaos with her cooking skills, Mark is there to support and show affection for her, a drunken Daniel also shows up, assuming she was alone, Mark and he step outside and have a fight, Mark wins but is shunned away, while Daniel is rejected by Bridget. Meanwhile, Bridget's mother Pamela (Gemma Jones) has left Bridget's father Colin (Jim Broadbent) and started an affair with shopping channel presenter Julian (Patrick Barlow), they do reconcile, and Bridget's mother reveals a truth, Bridget assumed it was Mark who had an affair with Daniel's wife, in fact it is the other way around. Bridget at the Darcys' ruby wedding anniversary party she wants to confess her feelings for Mark, but she is devastated to find out that he and Natasha have accepted jobs in New York, but Bridget speaks out about how England will be losing a good man like Mark, her words obviously have an effect on him, but he stills travels to America. At Christmas time, Bridget's friends invite her to join them on a trip to Paris, France to forget all about Mark, but he surprises her showing up at her flat, they kiss for the first time, there is a moment when she assumes he leaves, after reading about her hatred for him in her diary, but they embrace in the snow after he explains he was buying her a new diary, to start the New Year. Also starring Smack the Pony's Sally Phillips as Sharon/Shazza, Shirley Henderson as Jude, James Callis as Tom, Celia Imrie as Una Alconbury, James Faulkner as Uncle Geoffrey, Drop the Dead Donkey's Neil Pearson as Richard Finch, Honor Blackman as Penny Husbands-Bosworth, Paul Ross as Mr. Sit Up Britain, Crispin Bonham-Carter (Helena's cousin) as Greg, Sarah Alexander as Daniel Cleaver Lover, Salman Rushdie and Jeffrey Archer. Zellweger does an impeccable British accent and is adorable as the 30-somthing heroine who gets herself into embarrassing situations but you root for, Firth is very likable as the good looking uptight lawyer, and Grant is splendid and escapes the posh twit persona seen previously to becomes a caddish bastard. All the acting by the ensemble cast of stellar Brits is great, the script is witty, daftly funny, hilariously cringy and suitably sweet, and the pop music soundtrack, including ""Out of Reach"" by Gabrielle and ""Have You Met Miss Jones?"" by Robbie Williams is great, it just has all the right ingredients, a brilliant romantic comedy. It was nominated the BAFTA Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film and Best Adapted Screenplay, it was nominated the British Comedy Award for Best Comedy Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. Hugh Grant was number 73 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 8 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, Colin Firth was number 29 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, the film was number 52 on The Ultimate Film, and it was number 48 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films. Very good!",Bridget Jones's Diary
7,rmax304823,Fantasy Numero Uno.,6,6 March 2015,"It's an amusing romantic comedy with Renée Zellweger is a plumpish woman on and after her thirty-second birthday. She's single and nothing much is going on. She seems cheerful enough about it all but she decides to begin life anew, starting a diary and making resolutions such as losing fourteen pounds and cutting down on the drinking and smoking.Zellweger works in a London publishing house and begins to wear short skirts and rather vulgar see-through blouses to the office. Soon enough she's flirting with her boss, the ever sly Hugh Jackman, and soon after than they're in the sack together. She begins to get a bit mushy and asks him if he loves her. For that, he buggers her for the second time.Well -- does he love her? Is he willing to ""commit""? (That's code for ""willing to get married."") Evidently not, because she pays him an unexpected visit one day and finds a luscious babe naked in his bath room. The babe eyes Zellweger with a smirk and remarks, ""I thought you said she was THIN."" Ouch.Meanwhile, always hovering around the background, is the successful but stuffy and decidedly unchic Colin Firth. Zellweger has loathed him at first sight. He never smiles or flirt or jokes around like the roguish Jackman. Not much fun, you know. But one day he takes her aside and tells her grimly that he ""likes her"" just the way she is. Coming from him, that's a Niagara Falls of a confession. In the meantime, though, Jackman has abandoned all his girl friends and tells Zellweger she can give him rebirth. That is, he's now willing to get married and so, it develops, is Firth.At a dinner one night at Zellweger's flat, Jackman and Firth run into one another and have a fist fight over her. Now this has got to be female fantasy Number One -- two men fighting over you, a plain girl with not much going for her but brains and zest. And they're both successful and have other women salivating over them. Wow. I won't claim it began with Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" because I'm sure the theme goes back in history through the Greek masques, and is lost finally in the mists of antiquity. (For men's fantasy Number One, viz., The Conquering Hero. Start with ""Rocky."" Go back to ""The Iliad."") Much of the wit lies in the writing itself, full of irony and vulgarity. There are a few slapstick scenes -- Bridget trying to cook -- that hark back to ""I Love Lucy"" and Laurel and Hardy. They're still funny and the absurd characters are well defined.Zellweger is a decent actress and though hefty she has an engaging blue eyes and a smile that could brighten a room. Jackman is his usual on-screen self, stuttering slightly, a little embarrassed at times. Firth is unpleasant and stiff but Zellweger has juice enough for both of them and she'll turn him into a paragon of élan before you know it.",Bridget Jones's Diary
8,Tweekums,More com than rom,8,4 November 2014,"The titular Bridget Jones is in her early thirties, smokes too much, drinks too much, thinks she is overweight and most worryingly for her single. Her mother tries to set her up with stuffy lawyer Mark Darcy but she takes an instant dislike to him. Instead she ends up dating her boss, Daniel Cleaver, who is clearly a cad and a bounder who claims Darcy once took the woman he was engaged to. Over the course of the film she comes to realise she is with the wrong man but by then it might be too late.I probably wouldn't have picked up this film if it hadn't been on the 50p bargain shelf at the local charity shop I'm glad that I did though as it was a lot of fun. There are plenty of great laugh out loud moments and Texan Renée Zellweger does a great job as the English Bridget. She is ably supported by a cast of well-known British actors; most notably Colin Firth and Hugh Grant as Darcy and Cleaver it was particularly fun watching Grant play the cad rather than the sympathetic male lead; not that he plays the two all that differently! It was also a highlight to see the two scrapping; not a well-choreographed fight but a believable brawl with them kicking, punching and grabbing each other in a messy but realistic and hilarious way. Overall an enjoyable way to pass an hour and a half; it may be considered a bit of a 'chick-flick' but blokes can enjoy it too!",Bridget Jones's Diary
9,moonspinner55,A sex goddess wannabe: stumbling through romance and laughing through her tears,6,20 November 2011,"Romance and humorously-derived self-humiliation mix somewhat uneasily in this glossy adaptation of Helen Fielding's book (by Fielding, Andrew Davies, and Richard Curtis). Bridget Jones, a British working girl with a mad crush on her boss, keeps crossing paths with a handsome lawyer whom she's known since childhood--a man who is naturally charmed by Bridget's downright clumsy attempts to socialize. Renée Zellweger (with added weight and an uncanny accent) is a perky heroine, a young lady prone to embarrassing herself in the midst of having a good time, who doesn't poke fun at her mistakes and bad choices (and who doesn't allow much guff from others, either); she's occasionally a flibbertigibbet but also a strong female character, one with drive and determination who goes after what she wants. The two men enamored of her (Hugh Grant and Colin Firth) work well with Zellweger, though the strained relationship between the guys is the worst type of movie contrivance (culminating in a fight scene that is also the very worst of its type). The movie doesn't scuttle its chances at being a funny love story...though there isn't enough of either element in the first half, and Bridget's initial job as a publicity executive is just a sketch (due to callow writing). Nevertheless, some big laughs and a wonderfully old-fashioned finale, plus fine work by the star-trio. Followed by a sequel in 2004. **1/2 from ****",Bridget Jones's Diary
10,blanche-2,a pure delight,8,13 May 2001,"Wonderful film with a fantastic performance by the super-talented Renee Zwelleger, ably supported by Colin Firth and Hugh Grant, both marvelous, as was the entire cast.Strangely, I saw this film and ""Someone Like You"" around the same time -the basic plots are the same, though the subplots are quite different.  And, of course, both use the song ""Someone Like You"" at the end!  But Bridget Jones is a real film and Someone Like You a TV movie reject someone got Ashley Judd to star in.  Amazing how the same basic plot can be so differently handled.There were many laugh out loud moments, to the extent that a man behind me said, ""I'd like to hear the movie,"" after Hugh Grant gave a line reading that rocked the audience.  I had one criticism and that was that the film could have been a little shorter.  Bravo, Renee and the entire cast on a great time at the movies.",Bridget Jones's Diary
11,Quinoa1984,One of the most charming romantic comedies in a while,7,14 April 2001,"Bridget Jones's Diary actually gave some laughs, and for that alone gives this film reccomendation, since so few romantic comedies now adays (outside of the classic Woody Allen flick) deliver laughs WITH corny plot twists.Renee Zellwegger is as charming as she was in Jerry Maguire and Nurse Betty (though Nurse Betty has her best work) as a British woman who has some low self esteem about herself- she drinks, smokes, and eats too much, and has trouble staying away from bad boyfriends.  In the movie, it focuses on her relationships with Colin Firfth, a honest British lawyer, and Hugh Grant who is a coniving yet charming scoundrel.Some of the movie might be a tad too over-conventional for some tastes (at times it was for me), but the film delivers enough surprises and good feelings (lame for me to say that isn't it) that it should make for a good date movie that the guy might not hate with all his being.

12,michaelRokeefe,"Sexy, sassy and still single.",7,3 March 2002,Looking for love in all the wrong places. This is a wonderful romantic comedy about the misadventures of a thirtysomething British lass(Renee Zellweger)determined to find Mr. Right while giving up her bad habits. I admire a girl that knows to wear special panties for special occasions. Delightful situational comedy that has Hugh Grant and Colin Firth competing for the zany girl with lack of self esteem.

14,Doylenf,"Screwball comedy is still alive in this modern age but needs Lombard, Grant and Stewart...",5,29 September 2008,"RENEE ZELLWEGER plays such a klutzy frump of a girl in this British screwball comedy that it's hard to imagine COLIN FIRTH and HUGH GRANT fighting over her. We're told that it's because she so ""natural"" that she has men buzzing around her. Well, that might be true if Miss Zellweger looked more like Carole Lombard. In fact, one could easily see this as a screwball comedy back in the '30s if Hollywood made the story starring Lombard, Cary Grant (not Colin Firth) and James Stewart (not Hugh Grant). Get my drift? Instead, Miss Zellweger looks more like pudgy Lynn Redgrave of ""Georgy Girl,"" an overweight and rather awkward young woman given to wearing tight clothing and making the most inappropriate remarks at the most crucial moments. She speaks her mind without any regard for the consequences and lands into one troublesome social situation after another because of her quirky attitude.An inside joke has COLIN FIRTH's character called Mr. Darcy--and indeed, he behaves as that gentleman did in ""Pride and Prejudice,"" at first utterly rejecting Bridget Jones and then making a pass at her which she turns down, only to change her mind before the final reel.HUGH GRANT has a thankless role as a witless cad but plays it with his usual charm, the sort of role James Stewart might have done had this been made back in Hollywood's Golden Age when screwball comedy was just as mad but a lot less risqué.But Renee, Colin and Hugh are not Lombard, Grant or Stewart and the film suffers because none of them can make this kind of material seem like anything more than a manipulative romantic comedy about an awkward girl finding her Prince Charming in a Jane Austen kind of way--with all the modern sensibilities destroying most of the charm.Unless you're a devoted fan of these stars, this one is pretty hard to recommend except as very lightweight entertainment in quirky British style, but Bridget's gaffes are too monumental to be accepted by Darcy.",Bridget Jones's Diary
15,preppy-3,Worth seeing for Zellweger,8,30 April 2001,"Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger) is 32, a Londoner, and panicking about being single.  She falls for her cold, commitment-phobic boss (Hugh Grant) and finds herself somewhat attracted to tall, handsome, arrogant Darcy (Colin Firth).  Who should she go with?  Three guesses.  Predictable storyline overcome by a sharp script, fun soundtrack and a VERY energetic performance by Zellweger.  It's her film all the way and she's just fantastic.  She fakes a British accent to perfection and carries the whole movie on her shoulders.  Also it's interesting to see Hugh Grant play a total jerk and do a very good job of it--he's played the innocent, bumbling Englishman way too often.  However, there are two very bad performances--James Callis as Bridgets' gay best friend Tom.  The guy is so obviously straight I didn't believe him for one second--but he's a minor character so it really didn't hurt the film.  What did was Colin Firth's performance.  He's tall, he's handsome, he's WOODEN!  He always has a frown on his face and is SO serious...you wonder what Bridget sees in him.  It's surprising because Firth is a good actor...just not this time around.  So it's worth seeing for Zellweger...this might be the film that makes her a well-deserved star.  A perfect date movie.",Bridget Jones's Diary
16,zardoz-13,"Don't Miss ""Bridget Jones's Diary!""",10,2 July 2008,"This delightfully funny British import from the guys who gave us ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" (1994) combines the best elements of Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" with the classic fairy tale favorite ""Cinderella."" Bestselling author Helen Fleming, who penned the phenomenal 1996 novel of the same name, wrote the screenplay with ex-boyfriend Richard (""Notting Hill"") Curtis and Andrew (the BBC's ""Pride and Prejudice"") Davies. This saucy romantic chick flick with its unconventional heroine, clever slapstick farce, witty charismatic cast, predictable happy ending, and relentlessly self-depreciating British humor qualifies as the best chubby girl comedy since the 1966 ugly duckling English romp ""Georgy Girl"" headlining a plump Lynn Redgrave. Texas native Renee Zellweger of ""Jerry Maguire"" adopts a serviceable British accent and captures the klutzy charm of the eponymous 32-year old West London bachelorette torn between her womanizing boss Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant of ""Mickey Blue Eyes"") and divorced human rights barrister Mark Darcy (Colin Firth of ""Shakespeare in Love""). As comparisons go, ""Bridget Jones's Diary resembles a funnier, more down-to-earth, big-screen version of TV's ""Friends."" ""Diary"" chronicles our neurotic but sympathetic, size twelve, London office girl's year-long efforts to discover love and happiness. The vetty British soap operatic action opens one snowy Christmas. Bridget resolves to lose twenty pounds, to stop chain-smoking, to stop bingeing on chocolate, and to stop swilling Chardonnay at home alone while warbling the lyrics to Eric Carmen's ""All By Myself."" In an ironic voice over, poor Bridget muses, ""Unless I changed my life, I was destined to die alone and be found three weeks later, half-eaten by Alsatians. Bridget sets about entering her current weight as well as cigarette and alcohol use in a daily diary. At the same time, she vows with mock conviction to find a ""nice, sensible boyfriend to go out with"" and refuses ""to form romantic attachments to any of the following: alcoholics, workaholics, commitment phobic's, peeping Toms, megalomaniacs"" and so forth. No sooner has Bridget made such pretentious pledges than she finds herself dating Daniel Cleaver and flirting with the scoundrel at the office via e-mail. Meanwhile, Bridget's well-meaning but intrusive parents introduce her to another eligible bachelor, Mark Darcy, at their Christmas party.Bridget and Mark get off on the wrong foot. She overhears Mark call her a ""verbally incontinent spinster."" Later, Daniel reveals that Mark stole his previous girlfriend. Bridget's dislike for Mark mounts. The conflict reaches boiling point when both guys confront each other at a dinner party that Bridget has whipped up for her friends. Basically, she serves them blue soup. Suddenly, Daniel and Mark tie into each other with fists flying and wind up in the street for one of the funniest fights ever filmed. The highlight of the fisticuffs occurs when our combatants carry their slugfest into a restaurant and pause long enough to chime in for a chorus of ""Happy Birthday"" for a dinner guest! Happily, unlike ""Four Weddings and a Funeral,"" nobody dies in ""Bridget Jones's Diary."" Nevertheless, scenarists Fielding, Curtis, and Davies maintain a commendable level of suspense throughout about Bridget's uncertain destiny.Freshman director Sharon Maguire manages to keep everything light and flighty with an occasional poignant moment. For example, Bridget attends a ""Tarts & Vicars"" costume party dressed as a Playboy bunny, learning only too late that costumes were no longer required. Later, after she leaves Daniel and takes a job as an on-camera reporter for the TV show ""Sit Up, Britain,"" she ends up exposing her buttocks to the camera when she slides down a firehouse pole! Basically, ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" features several embarrassing moments, one wedding and a marriage renewal. When Bridget cruises for the elusive Mr. Right, her parents (Gemma Jones of ""Sense and Sensibility"" and Jim Broadbent of ""The Avengers"") break up and her mom takes up with a TV shopping channel host. Lonely, single, average females without the heroin-chic, media-made looks of haughty Cosmopolitan cover girls searching for love in all the wrong places (might as well include their similarly distressed masculine counterparts) will applaud this helium light whimsy.A truly outstanding cast breathes credibility into their characters. Zellweger steals every scene she has with her handsome English co-stars. Interestingly, Barbara Berkery, the dialogue coach who trained Gwyneth Paltrow for ""Sliding Doors"" and ""Shakespeare in Love,"" guided Zellweger's miraculous vocal transformation from Texan to Londoner. Further, Zellweger pulled a Robert De Niro stunt and packed on 20 actual pounds to appear plump enough for the role. Finally, to prepare herself intellectually, she spent time working at the London publishing house Picador, so she could get a feel for Bridget's job. Clearly, on the basis of this kind of dedication to her acting, Zellweger deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Actress. Hugh Grant breaks new ground playing a convincingly leery-eyed, conniving cad, while Colin Firth maintains his dignity no matter how silly he appears in a clownish brawl with Grant or whatever outfit he wears, such as a reindeer sweater when Bridget and he meet for the first time. Mind you, it is no mistake that Firth won the role of Mark Darcy. Fielding has written complimentary remarks about Firth in her two ""Bridget"" novels and the in-joke is that Firth portrayed another Darcy in the acclaimed BBC version of ""Pride and Prejudice."" ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" proves a thousand times better than Renee Zellweger's earlier and abysmal ""Nurse Betty.""",Bridget Jones's Diary
17,evanston_dad,Zellweger Surprisingly Likable,6,26 July 2010,"Renee Zellweger might seem like an unlikely choice for playing the title role in this romantic comedy based on a popular book, not least because she's American. But she's surprisingly winning and likable, and she makes the movie winning and likable too.Colin Firth plays Bridget's love interest, in only one of several leading-man roles that have made me question why women are so ga-ga over him. His character's last name is Darcy, in a wink-wink nudge-nudge reference to his portrayal of the character with that name in the A&E version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" that his fanbase is so nuts for. He and Zellweger have enough chemistry to make the film work; nothing else is really asked of them.Zellweger received a Best Actress Academy Award nomination for her performance.Grade: B",Bridget Jones's Diary

While it goes overboard with the cussing (less is always more) and the accents are too thick to grasp at times, the flick eventually won me over because it tries so hard and everything builds to a comical melee. It helps that Renée is adorable in a roundish way and is tastefully shown in alluring apparel, including a playboy bunny outfit.The film runs 1 hour, 37 minutes, and was shot London, Surrey, Gloucestershire and Hertfordshire, England.GRADE: B",Bridget Jones's Diary

This film is a cute, comedic unrealistic commentary on women in their thirties like Bridget Jones played beautifully by Texas American Renee Zellwegger. A role that could have been done by any British actress striving for her big break has been done by one of Hollywood's brightest rising stars. Renee can sure play British and she also plays Beatrix Potter. THe casting choice of her to play this very British role might be shocking but she manages to do this role without being Meryl Streep and being more a talent to watch out for. Bridget's parents are played by the underrated Gemma JOnes and Oscar Winner Jim Broadbent. Colin Firth and Hugh Grant play the men who seek to win Bridget's heart. Firth plays Darcy here and in the 1995 Pride and Prejudice television mini-series and Hugh Grant is famous for playing the lovable loser at love. The film was filmed mostly in London and England. Although you can't stand in any airport for JFK in New York City. Any way, the film is a lot of fun to watch and should be shown over the Christmas holiday season.",Bridget Jones's Diary

23,JamesHitchcock,Have You Met Miss Jones?,7,8 July 2011,"Bridget Jones is a single woman in her early thirties who works for a London publishing company. The title derives from the fact that she confides all her feelings, her frustrations and her obsessions to her diary. And Bridget certainly has plenty of obsessions. She obsesses about her weight, about the amount she smokes, about the number of ""units of alcohol"" she consumes and about her inability to find a boyfriend. She is haunted by the thought that she is fated to remain single forever and worries that the destiny of all single women is to be found dead in their flat, their bodies eaten by their dogs. She is so desperate for love and affection that she even begins dating her boss, Daniel Cleaver, although she is well aware that he is a notorious womaniser with a phobia about commitment.Helen Fielding's novel was a huge success in Britain in the late nineties, so much so that the phrase ""a Bridget Jones"" entered the language to describe a certain type of thirty-something career woman. Fielding deliberately drew upon Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" when writing her novel; her hero, for example, is named Mark Darcy. Bridget first meets Mark, a barrister, at a Christmas party hosted by her parents, and their courtship follows the same pattern as that of Elizabeth Bennett and the other Mr. Darcy; they start out by disliking each other and gradually come to appreciate each other's good qualities. Mark and Daniel, once friends, now cordially detest one another, and the reason for estrangement becomes clear in the course of the film. (Their relationship parallels that of Darcy and George Wickham in Austen's novel).Before his Oscar-winning performance in ""The King's Speech"", Colin Firth was perhaps best known for playing the other Mr. Darcy in the famous BBC adaptation of ""Pride and Prejudice"", so he was perhaps a natural choice for the role of Mark. Like his namesake, this Darcy is gentlemanly and possessed of firm moral principles, but is quiet and reserved and finds it difficult to express his feelings. Hugh Grant was best known in the nineties for playing middle-class romantic comedy heroes in films like ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", ""The Englishman who Went up a Hill."" and ""Notting Hill"", so playing a rotten cad like Cleaver- a man for whom the concept of morality is an alien one- was perhaps an attempt to broaden his range. (He had also played a villainous character in his previous film, ""Small Time Crooks""). He throws himself into the role with gusto, so it is unfortunate that since 2001, except in the sequel, ""Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason"", he has tended to retreat back into his romantic comedy comfort zone.Of the three main characters, it is Bridget who bears least resemblance to her Austenian counterpart. (Elizabeth is generally cool and self-possessed, Bridget anything but). The casting of Renée Zellweger in the role caused some controversy in Britain, as some felt that it should have gone to a British star. (She was to cause a similar controversy five years later when she was cast in the title role of ""Miss Potter""). The normal reason for parachuting American stars into British films is to win over those Americans who refuse to see any film unless it contains at least one well-known name, but that may not have been the reason here, given that the British actresses considered for the part included such internationally-known stars as Helena Bonham Carter, Rachel Weisz and Kate Winslet. The film did, however, prove two things about Renée Zellweger. The first is that she can do a splendid English accent. Like Gwyneth Paltrow in ""Sliding Doors"" she manages to make her character sound convincingly like a middle-class Londoner, avoiding the twin traps of making her either too posh or too cockney.The second thing we learn about Renee is that she has a gift for comedy, particularly important in the latter part of the film. (This is a romantic comedy where the stress is on the second word as much as on the first). Bridget leaves her job in publishing and becomes a television reporter; she tackles her assignments gamely but incompetently, and normally ends up making a laughing-stock of herself. Yet all the time she remains sympathetic, not merely ridiculous, which is important.Another feature is the witty use of pop music, using titles which have some connection to the plot of the film. Examples include ""It's Raining Men"", ""Have You Met Miss Jones?"" and ""Can't Take My Eyes off You"", each of which occurs at some pertinent point in the action.There is nothing very deep about ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" unlike, say, ""Four Weddings."" or ""Sliding Doors"", both of which display a greater degree of ambition than one would normally associate with the rom-com genre. It is, however, a likable and occasionally witty comedy, one of the better British romantic comedies of the 2000s. It is certainly better than the below-par sequel. 7/10",Bridget Jones's Diary

27,sddavis63,Over-Rated But Enjoyable,6,18 May 2002,"After all the hype this movie received when it was released, I was almost expecting to find a comedic masterpiece that redefined the meaning of comedy. What I found instead was a mildly amusing and quite pleasant tale of a 30-something woman (Renee Zellweger) dealing with being single and in search of the right man. The stereotype bothered me a bit; this idea that Bridget just couldn't live a satisfied life unless and until she found her man. Zellweger was good in a performance that didn't really demand all that much in terms of acting ability - the idea that her performance would even be considered for an Oscar is something that I just don't understand. I'm not saying that she was bad; simply that the role didn't ask very much of her.A strong supporting cast including Hugh Grant as Daniel and Colin Firth as Mark - Bridget's rival love interests - helped move the story along. How enjoyable this movie is depends on what you're looking for. If you believed the hype you're going to get less than you expect, but if you simply go in with an open mind you'll probably find this a decent enough movie. Overall I was a little disappointed, but would still rate this effort as a 6/10.",Bridget Jones's Diary
28,paul2001sw-1,Bridget Jones's dreary,3,14 November 2004,"In the early 1990s, British newspapers were suddenly filled with columns written by journalists suffering from the arrogant delusion that their own lives were an subject matter of interest to their readers; journalists who often, with a startling lack of awareness, expressed shock and surprise when some of those they ridiculed in their articles (spouses, friends, etc.) took public offence. In response Sue Limb started writing the 'Dulcie Domum' column in 'The Guardian', an entertaining spoof whose fictional author was a struggling writer, whose limited understanding of the implications of their own words was the best part of the joke. 'Helen Fielding's 'Bridget Jones's Diary' came later in 'The Independent', but was very much in a similar vein.In both columns, the terse style of a diary was used to invoke images of complete catastrophe in a minimum of words. Arguably, both belonged to a tradition started not in newspapers at all but by Sue Townsend in her 'Adrian Mole' books a number of years before. 'Bridget Jones', of course, had much more success than 'Dulcie Domum', although the writing was actually less good. But its subject matter, that of a thirty-something woman looking for love, had more resonance, I like to think because the concept was implemented with some subtlety. Bridget was a woman with deeply ambiguous feelings towards the romantic dream (of getting married, having kids etc.) that seemed to have passed her by; but was also a woman with little self-confidence whose erratic mood and behavioural swings owed much to her inability to handle the knowledge that she'd failed to fit the only approved template for a woman's life. The hidden tragedy was that if only she could think more of herself, she might find her life (disasters included) was actually not so bad. The column thus sympathised with Bridget, laughed at her, but contained also a degree of feminist anger at the way social values can on occasion reduce even highly competent women to states of emotional imbicility. But popularity brought popularisation: a move to 'The Daily Telegraph', then to hard covers and finally to celluloid.And the load of witless drivel that is this film.The original idea has here been reduced to a sub-Austen story about a beautiful but utterly ditzy idiot (with an apparent mental age of about thirteen) appearing in lots of sitcom-inspired moments of excruciating embarrassment, and falling in love at the same time. In many respects, the film character is the sort of person the original Bridget might have feared (when at her lowest ebb) she would become if she didn't find a man: a recognisable caricature of herself, but not the same thing at all. The essential angst of Bridget's condition is not dwelt on at all (the original was reliably single except for occasional one night stands, the film version claims to be afraid of being left alone but actually has no shortage of chasing men); while the dry comments of the diary, instead of inspiring the imagination as they did in the columns, in the film simply underscore already obvious incidents (the use of pop music to re-enforce every other point is also crass). Meanwhile, the overall direction of the plot is telegraphed from the start. American Renee Zwelleger manages of British accent of sorts, but her social class is wrong (she sounds far too posh): indeed, the essentially middle class dreariness of the original Bridget's life is traded for something altogether more glamorous (and fake). The film also invites us to accept her self-assessment as ""fat"" as face-value (it's true she fattened up for the role, but this tells us nothing except the perverse standards of actresses).'Bridget Jones Diary' is romance for teenagers (the smutty, unfunny jokes and exaggerated swearing also confirm this). Incidentally, a new report out last week said there are far more single men than woman in Bridget's age bracket. But there's no market, I guess, for films that encourage men to do themselves down and identify with characters as juvenile as the Bridget who is represented here. The implications of that statement are even more depressing than this monotone film.",Bridget Jones's Diary

30,Pjtaylor-96-138044,That extra 's' isn't doing you any favours.,5,23 June 2021,"'Bridget Jones's Diary (2001)' is basically a modern day take on Austin's 'Pride and Prejudice', with our hero having to choose between two men who seem to value her for very different reasons. It essentially wears its inspiration on its sleeve and pays homage to it in a number of often surprisingly blatant ways (sure, let's just call one of the characters Mr. Darcy and see who notices, shall we?). Still, it has enough of its own personality to feel like a distinct thing. Its plot follows Bridget, a 32-year-old singleton who fears dying alone more than anything else, as she enters a loose love triangle between a soft-spoken bore who insults her the first time he sees her and a bumbling bloke who clearly isn't invested in the idea of a long-term relationship as she is. The picture goes through pretty much all the expected motions, ticking off each trope in a somewhat knowing but still ultimately checklist way. It has an undercurrent of humour that lends it some likability, but the jokes don't land often enough for the thing to be considered particularly funny (though there are a couple of moments that fit that description). It just isn't all that compelling, really. It is well-made, though, with its performances lending proper credence to the script and its occasional shortcomings. It's fine, really; I almost don't have any feelings about it one way or the other (an issue in and of itself, I suppose). Also, I'm sure that extra 's' is in the title just to annoy me (and it does, somewhat inexplicably, annoy me). 5/10.",Bridget Jones's Diary
31,g-bodyl,A Deserving Chick Flick!,8,7 December 2014,"It must be some kind of unwritten rule that men are supposed to despise chick flicks. I myself despise the bad ones, but I can enjoy the good ones. Surprisingly enough, Bridget Jones's Diary can fit into that latter category. The rom-com looked so clichéd and dull based off the trailers, but instead it's a warm, charming, and funny film. It's not the greatest and not entirely original, but it's still a charming British rom com.Sharon Maguire's film is about a woman in her 30's named Bridget Jones who is struggling to find love and is a little plump, and have smoking and drinking problems. Her life becomes even more confusing when these two men fall for her in different ways: her boss who has got everything a woman would want and a lawyer who is socially awkward.This film is well-acted. Renee Zellweger's role is actually quite daring and she is perfect for this role. She plays it with her best and I'm not sure if anyone else would be right for this role. Both Hugh Grant and Colin Firth were excellent and quite charming as two men with opposite personalities fighting for the same woman(in one great scene, there was a legit fight.) Gemma Jones was excellent as Bridget's crazy mother.Overall, Bridget Jones's Diary is a rather solid chick flick. It seems a little overdrawn and it is not totally original, but one cannot deny the charm the film oozes out. It's a warm film and it has simple messages of love. I am not sure if the film was in need of a sequel as the ending was so perfect, but I know I'll check it out at some point. A very charming romantic comedy and I am pleasantly surprised.

Again, she is going alone, with no boyfriend in tow. Once there, her parents re-introduce her to an old childhood friend, Marc Darcy (Colin Firth), who is divorced and a hot-shot, human rights lawyer. However, Marc insults Bridget, accidentally, and Bridget sees him as a stuffy, boring gentleman, too. So, a romance between the two of them seems mighty improbable. Back at her small apartment, Bridget gets a bit tipsy but makes a New Year's resolution to keep a diary. It will record the doings of a thirty-something, biological clock-ticking lady in London. Soon after, book publicist Bridget receives some overtures from her handsome but lothario-like boss, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant). Unbelievably, Daniel takes a shine to Bridget and they begin a ""thing"". Yet, this leave-it-to-Cleaver has wandering eyes and Bridget is about to be on the receiving end of his infidelity. Horrors! On the upswing, Bridget and Mr. Darcy, that is, Marc, meet time and again, by happenstance, and their icy feelings for each other appear to go through a semi-thaw. Is it likely that ""our Bridget"" will find true love in the early 21st century? This is a wonderful movie and a true antidote to the cares of the world, especially for women everywhere. Most of us, like Bridget, are insecure, a bit overweight, and clumsy at love, among other things. Therefore, it warms the heart to see the underdog succeed. As the main character, Zellweger is nearly flawless, exhibiting high humor, a sunny nature, and self-deprecation in perfect pitch. Then, too, Firth and Grant are likewise terrific as her love interests; in truth, no one could have played these roles better, either. All of the secondary actors, Jim Broadbent, Gemma Jones, Shirley Henderson and the rest, are quite fine, too. As for the setting in London, it is lovely, as are the nice costumes and camera work. Above all, the script, based on Helen Fielding's best-selling book, and the skilled direction are to be greatly admired, for they absolutely capture the essence of the unhappy, aging-by-the minute single woman in her thirties. If you were to keep a diary of your own movie views, dear reader, do make certain you include BJD as an entry. In fact, it is one of those films to watch whenever a spiritual ""pick me up"" is needed.",Bridget Jones's Diary
34,johnnyboyz,Pleasing and effective comedy about the ups and downs of seeking love.,6,22 July 2018,"They say that if a man is not a socialist by the time he is twenty, then he has no heart, and that if he is not a conservative by the time he is forty, then he has no brain. So far as I can tell, ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" depicts not a man but a woman who falls somewhere in-between both these two particular ages and, as a bonus, these two somewhat rudimentary world outlooks. While not a particularly political film, it is interesting to note how it seems to push the message that men and women are better together, and that individualism and empowerment is all well and good, but will ultimately lead to loneliness.Texas-born actress Renée Zellweger plays the eponymous Bridget Jones, a desk-jockey in a plush London office belonging to a publishing firm. She is single; 32 years of age and desperate for a man in her life as yet another New Year's ticks by- bellowing out the lyrics to ""All by Myself"" after a day's slog, complete with all the drum and cymbal actions right on cue, to emphasise the point. Despite this, Jones is not lonely in the technical sense - she has a large group of contacts and acquaintances: her friends are an assortment of homosexuals and liberal metropolitans; her parents, played by Jim Broadbent and Gemma Jones, eventually become separate shoulders to cry on, while at the office, there is her boss Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant), to whom she takes a fancy.The film makes some effort to point out as to how Jones has been living life fairly liberally: she smokes; falls drunk out of taxi cabs after nights out; has neglected her diet over the years and has placed a lot of effort and energy into her career in order to be where she is - there are not many people in jobs, after all, who might be able to rub shoulders with both Salman Rushdie AND Jeffery Archer at a function. Much later on in the film, there is a scene involving Jones having to do some actual cooking from original ingredients - the likes of which comes as totally alien to her, inferring a complete lack of skill in this department. This is something which would not have been the case for her previous generation, the likes of whom kept the homestead.The film depicts Jones seemingly want to break from most of this, and has her set about tidying up her life through a manner of ways which predominantly revolve around shedding her liberal skin - depicting the events amusingly in the titular diary, with her optimum goal being the obtaining of a man. Working with books for all her life, she is therefore afforded a degree of comedic prose with which to construct her entries. There are two men in her life who have the greatest potential of filling her life's largest chasm: one of them, and despite having already identified him as being somebody who embodies all that's wrong with men, is Cleaver. The other is a barrister and an old family friend played by Colin Firth called Mark Darcy, whose good looks the film feels need confirming to us early on by two women during a private conversation and whose paddling pool Jones happened to play around naked in when they were eight. Playfully, the film affords Cleaver and Darcy an antagonistic history in that one once slept with the other's fiancé. I was struck by just how passionate the film feels about its central message, that of how men and women are happier together and that love, it would seem, conquers all. At the time of the film being made, female employment actually outnumbered male employment in the United Kingdom for the first time in history. Feminism had found a happy place in society, allowing women to possess their own freedoms and careers - free from feeling ashamed about their bodies and allowing them to have relationships with co-workers on top of whatever else.
 
I'm not sure the film is necessarily taking a stand against much of this, and in its heroine, it has somebody who embodies these philosophies better than most, but it treads dangerously close to a line the other side of which commends monogamy; married life and things like pride in appearance: items which you might say are/were anathema to many of those who helped Labour to their landslide win at around the exact same time the source material for this film was conceived.Certainly, by the end, the film has depicted more than just Bridget Jones turning her life around: Jones' mother, in actual fact, goes in the opposite direction - describing herself as living in the ""winter"" of her life and admitting that, if she'd had a second chance, would not have even bothered with having children. Being more liberal in old age, she leaves her husband for another man. There is even room for an otherwise irrelevant narrative about a Kurdish man who escapes illegal deportation and thanks the heavens he has had a wife by his side all this time. The manner about which these supporting strands eventually unfold only seem to serve to reinforce my belief that the film is about how human beings do better as twosomes. Aside all things, the film is often just terrifically funny: moments such as the montage of job interviews Jones undergoes cannot help but make you laugh, whereas her desperate attempt to provide a speech at a book launch with the equipment not fully functional works on more than just the singular level. From the point of view of straight up genre film-making, the film ticks enough boxes. ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" has spawned two sequels, neither of which I have seen, but will certainly hunt down - I would recommend this particular entry besides.",Bridget Jones's Diary
35,filipemanuelneto,I didn't expect it to be as good as it turned out to be.,9,27 October 2021,"This film is perhaps one of the most iconic romantic comedies of the last thirty years. It's very fun, engaging, and the main character, with her blunders and confusions, ends up deserving our sympathy, a factor that makes us wish that everything ends well for her. Of course, with the film being a light and humorous comedy, the happy ending is almost a certainty.Directed by Sharon Maguire, the film is based on a book that is indirectly inspired by the novel ""Pride and Prejudice"", by Jane Austen. The story revolves around Bridget Jones, a thirty-year-old women who are still single and decides, on New Year's Eve, to quit smoking, lose weight and find a boyfriend. Of course, her talent for arranging troubles and minor disasters promises to greatly derail those plans, but she quickly finds herself torn between two very different men: Mark Darcy, Jones' mother's favorite, a wealthy family lawyer recently divorced and, on the other hand, her own boss, Daniel Clever, a womanizing, hedonistic and self-centered editor.For me, the best thing about this film is the perceptible feeling that it seeks to please a wider audience, and be included in the list of family films, rather than being a film focused on women and aimed at female audiences. The film isn't ultra-sentimental, it's not as hyped up or histrionic as some publicity had me think, and the main character isn't as dumb as I thought she would be. That said, yes, it surprised me on the positive side, and it was much better than I imagined it to be. In fact, despite recognizing the film's impact, mainly on popular culture (with several scenes becoming famous even for which, like me, had never seen the film), I just gave it a chance now, because it felt like a movie I wouldn't like to see. Thankfully, I was wrong... even so, the film is not perfect: there is a certain obsession with marriage here that I find reprehensible, as if someone's happiness depended on not being single, or it was not possible to be happy alone.Renee Zellwegger gets, with this film, one of the defining works of her career as an actress, as it earned her an Oscar nomination for Best Actress and remained in people's memories. She has really done an excellent job and deserves to be commended for it, and particularly for the way she has mastered the British accent and the native English way of being. If I didn't know the actress, I would say she is one hundred percent English. Colin Firth also shone in her role. Being an actor I'm used to seeing in characters that ask for an additional dose of charm, dignity or chivalry, and having already played Darcy in ""Pride and Prejudice"", he was a natural choice. I like Hugh Grant, he has his usual charm, but he can't seem to be a capable villain as he doesn't seem nasty enough. Last but not least, the excellent contribution of Gemma Jones and Jim Broadbent (who would receive an Oscar that year for another work).Technically, this film proudly lives, breathes, speaks and claims to be British. With contained production values, it presents us with an elegant cinematography, full of charm, but without artifice or great visual games, as is the hallmark of good British cinema, where light and color, a reliable camera work and editing and a good choice of filming locations guarantees almost half the visuals. The film bets well on creating a funny, light mood without letting itself relax too much. The costumes are an important part of the film, and the way they help to define characters is something to be aware of (Darcy's tasteful and expensive suits, Bridget's tight skirts, the anthological scene of her disguised as a bunny etc.). The film also has a very effective soundtrack, with several well-known songs that easily stays in our memories.",Bridget Jones's Diary
36,l_rawjalaurence,Spiky RomCom That is Working its Way Towards Classic Status,7,28 December 2013,"In structural terms, BRIDGET JONES DIARY doesn't have too much relationship to its source; the diary-form is soon abandoned in favor of the basic romantic comic plot. What the film does have, however, is a winning central performance from Renee Zellweger in the eponymous title role; many of her thoughts are heard in voice-over, and director Sharon Maguire has great fun exploring the distance between such thoughts and what really happens in Bridget's life. In many ways she is an idealist, perpetually in search of the ideal boyfriend but doomed to spend her life with lowlifes and/or cads. As Daniel Cleaver, her boss and one-time lover, Hugh Grant is a perfect example of this latter kind of person, the guy who protests love for Bridget on the one hand while trying his best to exploit her credulity on the other. The film also brings out the story's Austenian echoes; Colin Firth is wonderfully standoffish as Mark Darcy, but he understand his true nature from the way he stares at Bridget, even though he moves scarcely a facial muscle. Proud of his public image as a hotshot lawyer, he finds it difficult, if not impossible to acknowledge his true feelings - at least until the climactic fight sequence with Cleaver. BRIDGET JONES DIARY also contains at least two memorable cameos from Gemma Jones as Bridget's mother - whose antics put her daughter to shame - and Paul Brooke as Mr. Fitzberbert (or Tits Pervert as Bridget calls him), Cleaver's snobbish sidekick.

37,Anonymous_Maxine,"Not as good as some of Hugh Grant's other romantic comedies, but Bridget Jones's Diary stands out as one of the better comedies of 2001.",6,6 August 2002,"First of all, yes, I realize that it sounds kind of ironic to say that Bridget Jones's Diary is not as GOOD as other Hugh Grant movies, but keep in mind that even this hideously charming English actor has come out with some genuinely entertaining and memorable films (I am thinking, in particular, of films like Four Weddings and A Funeral and especially Notting Hill and even several of his other films that are not Mickey Blue Eyes). With Bridget Jones's Diary, director Sharon Maguire approaches the daunting task of attempting to convince the (American) public that there is a big-breasted blonde played by Renee Zellweger who has made it to her thirties without ever having had a boyfriend, and the film that results from this effort depicts the point in her life where she happens to gain two boyfriends at once. At the time that Bridget Jones's Diary was released, Hugh Grant had recently starred in Notting Hill, in which he famously uttered the words 'whoopsy-daisy,' removing any room for respect from his character that there might once have been, although at the same time making us love him whether we liked it or not as well as realize that his character was made un-respectable for that very reason. Because of this uncomfortable but ultimately pleasing love for his character in that film, we are willing to forgive a lot of the terrible things that he does in Bridget Jones's Diary, but only when we see him change from the womanizer that he amazingly plays in this film and reverts into the same caricature character that he always plays (see my Mickey Blue Eyes review) that we have grown to know and love, for the most part. Colin Firth, on the other hand, has just come out of his role in Shakespeare in Love, where he played the jerk who Viola De Lesseps was forced to marry, despite our desperate wish that she would find a way to escape the arranged marriage and marry her true love, William Shakespeare. Bridget Jones's Diary plays off of both of these past performances in the formation of its story, suggesting (erroneously) that the roles were written for the actors and greatly enhancing the effect of its plot. I remember watching this film and being disappointed from within minutes of the film that I was going to watch a childish exercise in the traditional romantic comedy (indeed, it's not hard during the e-mail trading within the office to assume that Bridget and her boss, played by Hugh Grant, are going to go through some weak romance trouble and then wind up happily in love at the end of the film). There is an interesting introduction of the other love interest in Colin Firth's character, who she hates from the moment we meet him. And, if I may interject for a moment, on a personal level, my two best and closest friendships, with Ryan Collette and Kyle Blount, started exactly the same way. When we met in high school, there were times that we were literally inches away from fistfights, and now, several years later, they're brothers to me. There is nothing that I wouldn't do for them or them for me, and it's interesting to consider whether something like this inspired the introduction we see of Firth's character into the film or whether the writers were simply trying to come up with something original.In any case, it doesn't matter, because while the film doesn't exactly generate the most respect in the way that it plods through its content (some of the interactions between Bridget and her two men are less than convincing, which is nearly catastrophic because the success of the film depends exactly on whether the audience is convinced of that very thing), there is a genuine element of not knowing how the story is going to end up. We are torn between our love for some of Hugh Grant's previous characters (as well as our expectation that the more well-known actor will end up victorious regardless) and our hatred from Colin Firth's character in Shakespeare in Love alone (a testament to the quality of that movie as well as to his performance within it) in trying to decide for ourselves what is to become of Bridget Jones's love life in the future. There's a scene where this indecisiveness between the two suitors comes to a climax, when they both get into a fistfight in the snow-covered street, but the uncertainty of who she is going to end up with pursues until near the end of the film, when it becomes progressively obvious. True, this is not the best love story ever presented on film, but Bridget Jones's Diary is definitely one of the better romantic comedies of the last few years.",Bridget Jones's Diary

This is perhaps because the movie moves along quite well, as any box office smash does. It's never really funny, I didn't think. I also didn't like the main character that much, though it's hard not to warm to Renée Zellweger. The running joke is that she's sloppy and keeps embarrassing herself. I didn't think it was that funny.There's a terrible fight scene between Colin Firth and Hugh Grant. Not that you'd expect Bruce Lee vs. Chuck Norris from those two, but the fight scene isn't really funny either.I still prefer stereotypical girl movies to guy movies, but I don't think this is one of the best, despite its status.",Bridget Jones's Diary

Granted, I wouldn't have chosen to watch this by myself, but if you're looking for a charming, date movie then look no further.
Predictable and basic but it does have a nice plot none the less, and many times we were laughing out loud. Very well acted and produced. I would, however, like to point out that very few Brits speak posh like they do here, and that snow is quite rare in England at Xmas (unless you're on top of a mountain!)

41,ianlouisiana,Inhabits a neverland of foul mouthed media luvvies.Terrible.,3,3 August 2008,"It is clear from reading a lot of reviews from this site that there are many who sincerely believe that ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" is a story of real English people and that the whole country is populated by extremely irritating types who all work in ""The Media"" and live smug,self - satisfied lives and have big houses in the country where they turn up en famille every Christmas rather like children on holiday from the public school they all undoubtedly attended.They are all terribly,terribly well - spoken and most certainly don't buy their clothes from Matalan. They all met up at ""University"",Cambridge,generally,rather than Middlesex or Manchester and live in an almost incestuous round of dinner parties and soirees.Mr Cleaver and Mr Darcy - rivals for Miss Jones's hand in the movie - met at Cambridge.What a surprise.We are not told much of Miss Jones's background but she is most definitely not a working - class English girl as fondly imagined.Miss Zellwegger is spared the need to ""do"" Estuary English and settles for a sweet""Well- educated"" accent although it is not clear how well - educated Miss Jones has actually been.Well enough presumably to have heard of F.R. Leavis but not well enough to have known he has been dead rather a long time, much to her better educated Cambridge boss's amusement.The England portrayed in this movie sets a lot of store by one - upmanship like that where the intellectually and socially superior can feel comfortable in their superiority,and say what you like about Mr Grant - and I am by no means an admirer - he is very comfortable in the sort of role where he can patronise those less fortunate. To him Miss Jones is,basically,a good sh*g and, almost, you might say,a bit of rough.So he does. Then he dumps her. Hardly pausing to take breath,Miss Jones changes her affections to his college pal Mr Firth,hardly the act of a feisty,independent 21st century woman one would have thought.What is it they say ""Man is to woman as bicycle is to fish""?Don't tell Bridget. As for any other Richard Curtis work I did not believe in a single minute of this film.Mr Grant has gone beyond the merely irritating,Mr Firth should really try to display some sign of life.The constant use of the ""F"" word is no more amusing here than in ""Full Metal Jacket"" where at least it was excusable. Salman Rushdie shouldn't give up his day job. This is a film set in England for people who have never been to England,about the English for people who've never met any.Do so on the strength of ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" and I guarantee you'll be disappointed.",Bridget Jones's Diary

Renee Zellweger prattles on with what has to be one of the phoniest British accents ever in movie history in this vapid, mind numbing story. But what is worse is the character she plays - an annoying, simpering, pouting, insecure, overweight woman whose sole preoccupation is trying to keep relationships with men who obviously do not care about her and should have absolutely nothing to do with her. The character is so unattractive, indeed abrasive, that there should be no surprise that she has problems maintaining relationships. But Ms. Zellweger's horrible, phony British accent is just too much to bear. The producer of this movie couldn't find an English woman to play Bridgit Jones? They had to hire an American actress? Why not have Brad Pitt play Hugh Grant's character? If you like movies which feature American actors playing unattractive, piggish-looking people, then this movie is for you. Otherwise, stay away!

Finally, I buy movie tickets (using my 1994 student i.d.)  for the new british romantic-comedy `Bridget Jones's Diary.' Since I am a big fan of british comedies such as `Four Weddings and a Funeral' and `Notting Hill', I did have high expectations.4:40 p.m.- I sit down in the multiplex and start shouting all the answers to the movie trivia questions that are shown on the large screen before the previews start. Yes, I know my mind has an endless capacity for useless information!! 4:53 p.m.- I view some previews to some upcoming summer films such as `Planet of the Apes' (which is the story of some of the girls that I have met when I have been really drunk and realize the morning after that the truth hurts) and `Legally Blonde'  (which is the story of some of the girls that have gone with me to watch the submarine races at a nearby beach).
5:05 p.m.- I start watching a quite amusing little gem of a film in `Bridget Jones's Diary.' I first notice that Renee Zellweger was born to play this part; even though many critics felt that she would be unable to play the part british. Renee's british accent and acting was excellent.  
6:10 p.m.- I get a good feel about what the plot of the film is all about: a distress chain-smoking social-drinker chunky british single female determined to fight the right man, lose weight, and change her drinking and smoking habits by year's end.6: 40 p.m.- I get up to go to the bathroom to do #1. Yes I know! That is T.M.I. (too much information). Anyways, at this point I do realize that the movie had made me laugh from time to time. I also realize that Hugh Grant and Colin Firth also deliver some very effective performances as the men in Bridget Jones' life. Screenwriter Richard Curtis again proves why his writing always deserves curtain calls. 7:00 p.m.- The movie ends. I was quite satisfied with `Bridget Jones's Diary', even though it is not in the same line of cinematic excellence as `Four Weddings' and `Notting Hill'. 11:00 p.m.- I write this review for `Bridget Jones's Diary' and recommend to all moviegoers that this film has the `write' stuff!**** Good",Bridget Jones's Diary

It's one of the most grating and unfunny romantic comedies I have seen. I don't know if it is a British thing or what but the entire film revolves around Jones embarrassing herself again and again to diminishing returns. I started to cringe at the jokes 5 minutes in and I didn't stop until the film ended.Romantic comedies are usually vaguely sexist but the office ""romance"" stuff was appalling. Every woman character is harassed and the subplot with the mother comes across like the harassment is just desserts. I'm aware the Hugh Grant's character isn't meant to be likable per se and they made meta jokes about it being harassment but post #metoo a lot of this crap cross into the not funny because awful behavior department.

Disappointed because no way does it do for ""Pride and Prejudice"" what ""Clueless"" did for ""Emma"" as modern-day Jane Austen, even with Colin Firth as a literally contemporary Darcy.Disappointed as well with Renee Zellweger's bland, generic British accent (hey I watch British TV shows so I can be attuned enough to the geographic variety of British conversation) and her bloomingly healthy good looks are just too American or even Australian.But it is fun to see Hugh Grant as a cad and the slapstick and embarrassing situations are laugh out loud funny. But the timing could be tighter and there's too many easy choices.The soundtrack is only 50% effective. For every on-target commentary by Aretha or Chaka, there's a smarmy ballad that turned out to be Robbie Williams or some other flaky Brit popster.

Anytime Mark and Bridget kissed, I got all warm and tingly inside. In addition to that, I went, ""Aw!""

I must say though that Renée Zellweger does a wonderful job and earns her Oscar nomination for portraying Bridget Jones. Colin Firth and Hugh Grant fit their roles well also. The script is pretty average for a film like this, I don't know why but I wasn't really struck with the writing like a lot of people were, although I did like hearing Bridget's narration throughout the movie. And there were also some pretty genuinely funny moments. Now with all that said, that still doesn't mean that this romantic comedy is the best of its kind, in my opinion it's not. There were just some scenes that I thought lagged on too long and other parts that were dull. I do think that there are better romantic comedies to choose from out there, but it is worth just one watch just to see Renée Zellweger, because she really shines, if only the rest of the movie would've kept up with her. 6/10.",Bridget Jones's Diary

52,adamjohns-42575,Have you met Miss Jones?,8,16 December 2020,"While there are some elements of the film that are already dated (Christmas jumpers being uncool for example - except I hate them still!), the story is still very relevant and I think there are lots of single people or people that have struggled to find love, that can empathise with Bridget. I know at 40, that the ""Smug Marrieds"" are out there and I do feel that maybe I am some kind of Bridget replica and that I have been repelling men with some sort of toxic pheromone. The dating world isn't any easier today, even with the technology and apps available, in fact I think it might be worse, but Miss Jones gives us all hope that love is out there, even if it has lost some of its potency for me, all these years later.It's a really well put together film, if I'd been her, I would probably have ended up pursuing Daniel eternally and completely missing the fact that Mark was there at all, whilst sleeping with my boss at Sit Up Britain, because I'm just that stupid and because I've never seen the Colin Firth/Darcy fascination. I'm not a fan of Hugh either, but his character does have an appeal here. Oh to have men fighting for my attention.The supporting cast are as brilliant as the leads and they have some of the best lines too.I have read the book and I can say that it remains quite true to it.

It's a sweet, poignant movie with warmth, humor and depth and very well done. This movie also made me a Renee Zellwegger fan. I saw it on the big screen and got into it wholeheartedly from the beginning. This movie combines a witty script, featuring classic comedy with great acting. Renee is perfect for the lead role, as she was utterly charming and whimsical in this. Actually Hugh Grant was pretty good as well, It's difficult for me to think any female wouldn't love this(of coarse everyone has the right to their own opinion). I found Bridget to be a very realistic character as well as the characters of many around her. The attitudes that were shown toward Bridget as a single girl are indeed very realistic even in today's times. I'd say this was one of the best movies of 2001 and a movie I'd wholeheartedly suggest seeing, to anyone who may not have seen it as of yet.It's warm, witty and fun.

Of course this means finding a man. Enter the frame two suitors. The charming and funny Daniel Cleaver, and the dull and sensible Mark Darcy. Bridget at first falls into all the trappings laid by Cleaver. This is actually highly believable as Cleaver is played by Hugh Grant. Grant captures that unmistakable schoolboy charm, and blends it with his often cruel wit. It's simple to feel at ease with him, even though you know he's a bit of a cad. Firth plays himself wonderfully respectable. His inability to express himself can often be painful. At the heart of it all is Bridget Jones played excellently by Zelwegger. She isn't some desperate hussy, or lonely weirdo. She's a good role model that makes some mistakes. The humour often goes for that very British awkwardness, and the script is sometimes let down being based on a fictitious diary and all.

55,philip_vanderveken,A very charming romantic comedy with some excellent humor,8,27 February 2005,"The main thing that appeals to me in ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" is the fact that it is so recognizable. Of course it isn't exactly the same as my life, but the fact of getting older, the fear of having to live the rest of your life on your own without a partner, difficulties at work... all are very recognizable. Perhaps that's why I liked this movie so much. The other reason may be that, despite the fact that she doesn't exactly look like Miss World in this movie, Renée Zellweger has something appealing and adorable. She doesn't look like a model, but as the average woman, with all her imperfections like being slightly overweight, drinking, smoking, saying whatever she thinks... and she gets away with it perfectly.I'm sure that the fact that Hugh Grant has an important role in this movie as her boss, also makes that this romantic comedy works. As we all know, this is the kind of movies he has been doing so many times before and he is really good at it. His typical British flair and humor were essential to make this movie work perfectly.I haven't read the book, but if it is as good as this movie, than I definitely should give it a try.

56,bkrauser-81-311064,Zellweger Saves This Movie,6,17 February 2016,"The movie based on the novel by Helen Fielding is a bit of a misnomer. Despite, a few moments of observations told with the delicate staccatos of Renee Zellweger's inner monologue, the diary doesn't really fit into the story all that much. What the film should have been called is Pride and Prejudice 2000. Not to say that a loose adaptation of a classic is a bad idea it's just you don't have to be so obvious about it.Our charming protagonist Bridget (Zellweger) is a bit of a hot mess. In the words of potential love interest Mark Darcy (Firth), ""she smokes like a chimney, drinks like a fish and dresses like her mother."" Bridget decides to mend her ways in an effort to find ""true love."" This promptly gets the attention of her boss Daniel (Grant), a notorious flirt and head of the publishing company she works for. Bridget comes to believe Mark and Daniel are acquainted and not on good terms. So naturally her budding relationship with Daniel causes a further rift while the accident prone Bridget juggles her work, her love life and her family. As you can imagine not everything goes according to plan.All of he film's charm lies squarely on the shoulders of Renee Zellweger. The film goes through the motions as if it were in a trance yet she somehow makes everything bearable and even enjoyable. Much ado was made when she, an American was cast in lieu of a British actress. Rest assured her effervescence, her wit and her accent all make it through the picture unscathed. Truth be told finding a comedic character of this depth and verisimilitude is near impossible these days and for a female character to be this utter likable is a testament to Mz. Zellweger's abilities.If only the supporting characters and competing love interests were as fully developed. Both Firth and Grant do their best yet neither fully succeeds in winning me over. Firth's rendition of Darcy acts like he's come in from an entirely different movie and only adds to the plot when a certain bit of information needs to be conveniently pushed to the side to become a dramatic macguffin later. Grant on the other hand can play many roles including a romantic lead but being a deceitful wastrel who ""wants to make a change;"" oh brother. The less I say about the completely wasted talents of Jim Broadbent and Gemma Jones the better.As I've said before the magic behind the source material i.e. ""Pride and Prejudice"" is it's universality. Despite two centuries of wide circulation, the Jane Austen novel works because it ultimately is about finding yourself within the context of a stifling social structure. To that end Bridget Jones's Diary succeeds until the very last act. Instead of a shrewd Elizabeth Bennet meeting the stoic Darcy on equal footing sans pride or prejudice, we get Bridget coveting a man she knows she loves yet hardly knows and is willing to brave the cold in her underwear to prove it. Bridget Jones is not a subversion of rom- com clichés (or the lives of landed gentry for that matter), it's a submission to the idle, unworkable fantasies of romantic love that to be quite frank has warn out it's welcome in the 90's.Lacking the sharpness of the original source material and willing to submit itself and its audience to sentimentalism, the film is nothing more than your average run-of-the-mill romantic comedy made pleasant by Renee Zellweger. Bridget Jones's Diary should be viewed only to watch Zellweger find her muse in the rich inner-life of a single woman in her 30's fearing the looming threat of spinsterhood. Single people be warned, this movie is liable to push you into bad decisions; don't fall for the hype.",Bridget Jones's Diary
57,denis888,"Pure Fun, Excellent Entertainment, Albeit A Bit Rude",7,19 August 2007,"Bridger Jones is a clear phenomenon, nobody can deny the fact. What Helen Fielding managed to achieve with her book is enormous. Here, both in the novel and the film, we see the heroine who is far, far from perfect. She, in words of Mr. Darcy, smokes like a chimney, drinks lake a fish and dresses like her Mom. Bridge is not ideal, she is a woman on a fatter side, prone to fall a victim of all her weaknesses and her friends. The film manages to catch this. Renee Zellweger is a great choice for the main part, albeit being a Texan, she overcame the initial difficulties and here she is a real Londoner, with an unmistakable British accent, British ideas and customs. The other great winner is Colin Firth who depicted Mr. Darcy with his cool, reserved, down to earth manner. Colin is hilariously reserved and his near smiles are unforgettable. Hugh Grant is yet another perfect choice for the part of Daniel Cleever, a classic cad, sweet and deadly nice outside and terribly rotten inside. Typical cynical British humor shines and sparkles like a tinsel all the way through; unbelievably hilarious situations which Bridget finds herself in make you laugh all 90 minutes of this light, tight, bright and delightful comedy. What made me feel a bit repulsive was a continuous talk about sex, sex, sex. When the topic was repeatedly returned to even by Bridge's Mom, I was nearly shocked. Then, maybe this is a huge cultural gap, but the sheer impudence of some talks also nearly killed me. In my country, Russia, to tell a woman in her face that she is getting old and she absolutely must get a man is a unimaginable rudeness. Here, it is shown as if it is natural and no one seems to correct themselves after such a shocking case of rude behavior. Sometimes, the film gets pathetic, though, especially when it does show the way too prolonged scene of fistfight between Darcy and Cleever. After all, the film doesn't make you think too hard. Well, we all are created imperfect, we smoke, drink, and say foul words, have premarital sex, tell lies, cheat, et cetera. This has to be fought, not somehow celebrated. But it is good to be made fun of. In which, the film got very well.",Bridget Jones's Diary

59,DeeNine-2,Corny but cute,8,8 February 2002,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)What really makes this movie stand out from a venerable list of other working girl fantasies is the familiar but one-of-a-kind personality of the irrepressible Bridget Jones. Created by novelist Helen Fielding, who also wrote the script, and brought to life by the talented and zany Renée Zellweger, Bridget Jones is a 32-year-old pleasingly plump London working girl, a ""...verbally incontinent spinster who...dresses like her mother"" (to quote Colin Firth's character, Mark Darcy). She is also clumsy, the kind of girl who might spill sauce on her blouse, a little overweight, smokes, drinks too much and sometimes says what she thinks without consulting her brain. She is also very good at improvising on the spot, a talent that charms not only the two leading men, Hugh Grant and Colin Firth, who vie for her affection, but also the five o'clock news audience who like her bum and knickers just fine.Director Sharon Maguire, in her first outing, combines Brit witticisms, slapstick pratfalls, raunchy, sharp and realistic dialogue, and a blatant but inoffensive sentimentality into a romantic comedy that surely has Nora Ephron and Julia Roberts paying close attention. She keeps us guessing about who will get the girl (and who really deserves the girl) with the usual misdirections and misunderstandings characteristic of the genre. There's a little dead time about half way in, and the uncertainty about whether Bridget wants Hugh Grant or Colin Firth is milked a bit overmuch, otherwise this is nicely paced entertainment sure to chase away a blue afternoon.Hugh Grant and Colin Firth are both very good, and Gemma Jones as Bridget's mother is a charming, dotty sight to see.

I usually don't like Renee Zellweger, besides a few films. THe first Bridget Jones film is very funny and it ends on a nice note. Bridget Jones's diary is about a British columnist named Bridget Jones(Renee Zellweger), a British woman looking for some love. Her life is a bit of a blur. Every Christmas, she goes to a party at her parents place, filled with countless perverts who disguise themselves as close relatives. Bridget gets feelings for her boss Daniel(Hugh Grant), who states that Mark Darcy(Colin Firth) had sex with his wife. Mark Darcy is a lawyer that always goes to the Christmas parties. Also, she knew him as a child. THey didn't get along for a while. She soon falls in love with someone that she never expected to. Because Daniel Cleever is a man-wh*re. Bridget Jones's diary was based on a book by Hellen Fielding. Who has done many romantic novels. Renee ZEllweger is brilliant as Bridget, everyone in it is good. This is the first out of two films and is the best. Bridget Jones's Diary is a must-see.",Bridget Jones's Diary

Hugh (the compelling bad guy) and Firth (good guy) sort of compete for Renee's affection. I personally think Renee is one very attractive actress (I actually like her heavier look, what can I say), and she is very cute here in a self-conscious, somewhat over-played fashion. Maybe I've been around too long because I hardly think this one is unusual, I mean the personalized method of telling the story is different but hardly ground-breaking.

Renee Zelwegger was perfect in the lead role, and perfected the English accent, never making it seem forced.  Hugh Grant, for once, gets to play a sleazy, womanizing, villainous character and it was a nice change of pace.  I've always liked Hugh, he's a terrific comic actor with great timing (and I love his uncomfortable facial expressions during comic scenes), and he was just as much fun to watch in this movie as he was in ""Notting Hill"" and ""Mickey Blue Eyes.""  There are a lot of big laughs, and the film has a great message about accepting others for who they are, Bridget herself being a slightly overweight woman who's overly jolly and seems to never come up with the right thing to say.

I admit that I kind of like it when I first saw it on 2001, and gave it a good rating and review for IMDb. However, viewing the movie again a number of times over the years showed me there are many things that are wrong with this film. Look, Renee Zellweger has a good performance (though right now, her cinematic persona has kind of overstay her welcome). The plot is basically about Bridget having to choose between dour lawyer Darcy (Colin Firth) or sexy cad Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant). Neither of them is a very satisfactory individual. Arguing who was the best guy for her, as I did in my original review is besides the point. Besides, what is more off putting about this film is that Bridget stupidity is supposed to be representative of the modern woman. I want to believe that this is not true, but unfortunately, the huge success of this film shows that many women agree with that judgment. (in order to not be totally negative about this movie, let me say that the sequel is way worse).",Bridget Jones's Diary
67,jhclues,"Endearing, Funny Movie",10,19 April 2001,"Dissatisfied at age 32 with the direction her life is taking, a young woman vows to make some changes, and to keep herself on track she decides to start a daily journal, hoping it will make her toe the line, in `Bridget Jones's Diary,' directed by Sharon Maguire and starring Renee Zellweger.  Bridget (Zellweger) begins with some New Year's resolutions that include no more drinking or smoking, not being paranoid about her weight, and developing poise.  And-- last, but not least-- to avoid any romantic attachments to alcoholics, workaholics, peeping Toms or perverts.  Of course she promptly falls for the one man she knows who embodies all of those characteristics: Her boss, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant).  In the meantime, her mother, Pam (Gemma Jones), continues to play matchmaker for her daughter.  At a holiday gathering of friends and family, Pam nudges her in the direction of an old childhood chum, Mark Darcy (Colin Firth), now a respectable attorney, and recently divorced.  Their initial meeting, however, proves to be a less than monumental event, further complicated by the fact that Cleaver was Darcy's Best Man at his wedding, and has some tales-out-of-school to tell about the subsequently ill fated marriage that puts Darcy in a rather bad light.  But Bridget could care less; she thinks Darcy is rude and a bore, and anyway, Daniel is her guy.  Work is good, her life is going well and-- as she is about to wake up and realize-- she hasn't kept a single one of her resolutions.  And, oh! she should have.	First time director Maguire proves with this auspicious debut that she certainly knows her territory and how to negotiate it.  She has the touch and the eye for detail of a seasoned professional, and her sense of timing is impeccable.  She successfully avoids a major pitfall that do in many rookie directors right out of the chute, by never fishing for the cheap, forced, disdainfully pretentious or concocted laugh.  Everything in this film, especially the humor, flows freely and naturally from the circumstances of the characters and the story, which makes it all real and believable and allows it to be readily embraced by the audience.  This is a funny, often hilarious movie, but it's also very warm and at times poignant, and for handling it so sensibly, and with such sensitivity, Maguire deserves to be granted even more kudos.  It's quite simply an exceptionally well made film, presented with a style and grace that reflects that of the director herself.	Of course, having a superlative leading lady was certainly not disadvantageous to Maguire's efforts, either, and Renee Zellweger has never been better than she is here as Bridget.  With her quirky good looks, personality and charisma, she is endearing, and she invades Meryl Streep territory by affecting a perfect British accent.  Whether she's lip-syncing to a Celine Dion song, doing karaoke at an office party after having a bit too much to drink, or battling with a blender, it's easy to believe that someone would like her just the way she is.  Even with her hair mussed, or in a somewhat disheveled state, she's alluring, and it all has to do with who she is deep down inside; Zellweger makes it clear that this is a woman of substance, and it's easy to like her.  There's a down-to-earth honesty and accessibility about her that makes her appealing, and she's someone to whom many in the audience are easily going to be able to relate.  For her portrayal of Betty in `Nurse Betty,' Zellweger received a Golden Globe; `Bridget' should land her smack in the middle of Oscar territory.	As Bridget's smarmy boss, Daniel, Hugh Grant turns in a noteworthy performance, putting a rather tarnished sheen on his natural charm that works so well for this character.  It's a nice departure from his usual bumbling, reserved Mr. Nice Guy routine he perfected in such films as `Notting Hill,' and `Four Weddings and A Funeral.'  With this role he challenges Greg Kinnear's part in `Someone Like You' for the top spot in the Boss-You-Should-Never-Date category.  And Firth does a memorable turn as Darcy, fairly reprising his role of the same name in the PBS miniseries, `Pride and Prejudice,' from which this story is loosely derived.  Initially appearing a bit sullen, he gets the chance to develop his character as the story unfolds, and he does it quite nicely, ultimately revealing Darcy's true nature.	In a supporting role, Gemma Jones gives a performance that deserves mention, doing a good job of fleshing out Bridget's mother in the brief time she is allotted.  Rounding out the supporting cast are Crispin Bonham-Carter (Greg), Jim Broadbent (Colin Jones), James Callis (Tom), Sally Phillips (Shazzer), Honor Blackman (Penny), Embeth Davidtz (Natasha), Shirley Henderson (Jude) and Celia Imrie (Una).  A warmly humorous, uplifting film, `Bridget Jones's Diary' is a delightful and satisfying experience with more than a touch of magic in it.  Not only is it an entertaining showcase for Zellweger's many talents, but heralds the arrival of a director from whom we can expect great things in the future, Sharon Maguire.  A well crafted, reality based comedy/drama that is enjoyable and refreshingly devoid of inane nonsense or gross jokes is a rare find these days, and this is one of the best to hit the screen in a long, long time.  It's a film to be heartily embraced, and one I guarantee you'll want to see more than once.  I rate this one 10/10.",Bridget Jones's Diary

72,juliankennedy23,Strange what Hollywood Considers Fat or Funny,4,14 May 2005,"Bridget Jones's Diary: 4/10: There have been a great number of woman's films that have successfully crossed over to the mainstream. Sleepless in Seattle, Jerry Maguire and Aliens are three classic examples of ""chick flicks"" that men can watch with their ladies, enjoy the film, and still get credit for being a sensitive guy that likes what she likes. Bridget Jones's Diary tries to come across as a frothy crossover comedy. You know one of those estrogen flicks that Hugh Grant now does since Tom Hanks was shipped off to make ""important films"". Diary however doesn't successfully crossover. It's a real chick flick through and through. The thirty something equivalent of Sixteen Candles. In fact it seems to have basically the same plot and characters as that John Hughes eighties perennial. Instead of our sixteen-year-old ugly duckling we have a thirty two year old overweight alcoholic with virtually no social skills. And instead of one impossible cute and rich suitor we now have two impossible rich and handsome suitors that fight over our protagonist. Now I have always felt Renee Zellweger was easy on the eyes and talented to boot. As for the extra weight she put on,(An act that the media with a straight face called ""brave"") well let's just say she wears it well. Her character however is such a horrible deceptive person that one really wonders why either man would want her for anything more than a quick shag. Like those other lovable raging alcoholics of the silver screen say Arthur or The McKenzie Brothers two hours of screen time is one thing but day-to-day living is another. One really wonders how long either man would really stick around with Miss Jones? (A: Till he got tired of shagging her.) One last question. What's is with the music? It's Raining Men?

She has a crush on a suave editor Daniel (Hugh Grant) at the publishing company she works at. Daniel is a bad boy who charms and smirks his way into bringing Bridget into bed but stays steadfast that the relationship is not going anywhere.Meanwhile, Bridget's mother (Gemma Jones) set Bridget up with a wealthy, staid divorcée lawyer Mark Darcy (Colin Firth). Bridget used to act crazily as a child at Mark's birthday parties and it appeared as if Mark always had a crush on her. Bridget is a bit turned off by Mark's solemn nature plus Mark always has his coworker Natasha (Embeth Davidtz) shadowing him as she hopes to someday woo him. Bridget is led to believe that Mark once stole Daniel's wife and so she is under the impression that Mark is not a good guy.The show has plenty of comedy as Bridget tends to find herself in plenty of embarrassing situations due to misunderstandings and awkward clumsiness. She gets knocked down but refuses to grow melancholic and picks herself back up using a catchy soundtrack and one too many cigarettes.

Just acceptable and watchable, but without bad surprises.This movie is in the same line as other British romantic comedies such as ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""Notting Hill"", which wouldn't be surprising (considering they are all from the same producers and they all star Hugh Grant). I personally consider this neither better neither worst than those two movies that I mentioned.Nevertheless, it's a reasonably entertaining movie with its fun. Its most positive points are: a good soundtrack (""All By Myself"", ""Respect"", ""Out of Reach"" and ""It's Raining Men""), some beautiful landscapes of England, the British humor (despite some offensive lines), the blue soup made by Bridget Jones (I wonder how that soup tastes like) and a hilarious fight between the characters Mark Darcy and Daniel Cleaver.I also like the way how Renée Zellweger portrays Bridget Jones. Not that she is really great, but she's funny in the way she portrays this silly character. Hugh Grant is cool with this performance as the charming ""playboy"" Daniel Cleaver. But this isn't exactly a movie that I would want to add in my film collection.Overall, a funny movie and a full plate for any fan of the peculiar British sense of humor.

76,rebeljenn,I am Bridget Jones,7,6 October 2005,"Bridget Jones' Diary is a romantic escape into the life of an imperfect singleton and the little events and habits in her life that we find amusing -- probably in part because we are each a little bit like Bridget and want to be accepted and loved. Who hasn't been embarrassed by their parents, unintentionally made a fool of oneself at a social gathering, wore the wrong clothing (or costume) to a party, dated the wrong person, or messed up at an interview? Bridget Jones' Diary is lovable and funny because it is believable and deals with these every-day events, though usually with a cruel or embarrassing twist at the expense of poor Bridget.Overall, Bridget Jones' Diary is an excellent example of a romantic comedy, and its popularity is gained through lovable and quirky characters that are easily sympathized with. Although the same lovable characters appear in the sequel, the humor is not nearly as imaginative and not focused around the everyday little events.

I mean, I didn't expect to sympathize with such a character as I did. What really infuriate me is that I don't think this film needed to be that silly and schmaltzy at all. It had potential to be worthy of Zellweger's exceptional performance if it ignored the conventions of its sub-genre and the unnecessary, redundant twists near the end.

80,the red duchess,"Er, I enjoyed it. (possible spoilers)",6,19 April 2001,"There is a telling scene in 'Bridget Jones' Diary', when the heroine's errant mother comes home to a husband dazed and directionless having been abandoned.  Colin Jones has been set up as a model of dull decency on a par with Mark Darcy, and suggestive of why Bridget should prefer the latter's dogged solidity to Daniel Cleaver's caddish, fun, sexually explosive flibbertigibbet.  Mum begs Dad to take her back, apologising for what she has done.  Colin pauses and says he's not sure.  Mum bursts into tears, before Colin laughs, hugs her and says he was only joking.  good old dad. 
He waited until she had debased herself as low as she could go, until she was grovelling, had ceded any power (the great lack that decided her adultery) and independence to him as he restores his self-dignity.  It doesn't matter that he has treated her as a non-person for years, never mind not condescended to conubial favours.  There is a steely cruelty in this rare gentleman, and the scene is revealing about why Bridget has ended up as she has; what she wants; and a possible fate in store for her if she chooses Mark.people have complained that a film of this title has largely forsaken the diary format.  This is not just a tired question of fidelity to text - by writing her life, Bridget takes control, shapes and interprets a seemingly chaotic, random, and failed existence.  In a film where she is an objective player, if still the main one, she is likely to lose even this mediating power.  But the film we have here is not an 'objective', third-person story about a woman called Bridget Jones.  Everything in the film is filtered through her subjectivity - every pleasure and humiliation made to seem better or worse that it is because SHE experiences it.  In this way traumas like Salman Rushdie's ordeal, the racist treatment of refugees in Britain etc. all become reflections of Bridget's ego.  Cleverly, the film inverts the traditional male focus of Hollywood narrative.  Normally it is the man who is given the choice between two types of women, the 'bad', sexually active one, and the good, more 'spiritual' one.  Here it is the men who are types - and reduced to their types so they seem caricatures - and Bridget's sensibility  which is whole and coherent. 
Traditionally it is the male who seeks a good woman who will take him in hand, in effect mother him; as I have suggested, Bridget's uselessness at 'traditional' 'feminine' tasks (cooking etc.) means she needs a father figure; similarly, it is she who forces the resolution, who chases the love object, not the man.  Just as Bridget in the book fixes a messy life, so it sit the film heroine's desires and goals that shape hers.Ideological qualms aside (can't we see other Britains on film? etc.), 'Diary' is rather fun.  Quite why any woman would want to exchange a funny, charming, articulate rascal for a mumbling plank I don't know, but I am assured by friends that I am wrong, and that Colin Firth is swoonsome.  If you're looking for cinematic ingenuity, thematic density, an original story, or visual pleasure look elsewhere (Edward Yang, for instance...); if you want an amiable, undemanding film that passes the time, with cosy jokes and an excellent street brawl (loved it when caddish Cleaver fights back with a bin lid), than here you are.  Renee Zellweger is, for once, hugely sympathetic, not just for being winningly game - complaints about being too 'posh' miss the crucial point that she is only posh in public situations, as befits a work based on Jane Austen.",Bridget Jones's Diary
81,FlickJunkie-2,Zellweger shines as a quintessentially English girl,8,21 October 2001,"This film is another excellent showcase for the talents of Rene Zellweger. It is a fairly common occurrence for British actors to play American characters with varying degrees of success in duplicating an American accent.  It is almost unheard of for an American to play a British character, and when it does happen the accent is almost always awful. Zellweger nails both the accent and the demeanor of the quintessential middle class English girl and is absolutely charming in the role.The screenplay is an adaptation of Helen Fielding's novel of the same name that follows the single life of everywoman Bridget through the trials and tribulations of being a singleton.  Fielding unabashedly admitted in interviews that the original story was borrowed from Jane Austen's `Pride and Prejudice', going so far as to name one of the main characters Darcy (Colin Firth), the identical name of the corresponding character in Austen's novel.  To complete the bizarre crossbreeding, Firth played Darcy in the BBC production of P&P just before being cast in this role.Fielding's screenplay is full of the ironic and droll humor that makes English comedy unique.  Bridget is written as such an adorable ditz that you can't help loving her, especially with Zellweger playing the role.  First time director Sharon Maguire does a bang up job of keeping the silliness moving at a rapid fire pace.Zellweger is perfect for this role and must be commended for expanding her horizons (in all senses of the word).  She packed a great deal of weight onto her normally svelte frame to properly depict Bridget's weight problem. She then boldly allowed herself to be photographed in various skimpy outfits where flab burst forth from every seam.  Even more important than her excellent English accent is her comic ability to make the most of every peculiar situation with matter-of-factness so natural it is hard to believe that she didn't grow up in England.Zellweger totally eclipses her male leads in energy, comedic ability and charm.  The normally likeable and bumbling Hugh Grant is sorely miscast as the jerk.  Grant's strength is his sincerity and his character doesn't possess any, leaving him adrift in his ability to interpret the role. Firth, who has excellent comedic and dramatic skills, is really wasted in a role that mostly sees him leering dourly at Bridget for two thirds of the film.  When he finally gets a chance to interact he is very good in a stuffy sort of way that is right for his character.This is a delightfully wacky comedy with a fabulous performance by Rene Zellweger.

84,movieguy1021,Bridget Jones's Diary: 6/10,6,31 January 2004,"If there's anything I hate more than overrated movies, it's overhyped movies that don't even begin to live up to their reputation. Bridget Jones's Diary is one of the latter. With an original premise (which is of course taken from a book), a rising star, and charm out the wazoo, how could you go wrong? It's all in the marketing. A clever comedy has to have two things. A consistent clever quality to it and comedy. When lacking in either of these two categories, the company (usually Miramax) just overhypes it (as they're great at doing) so it'll be like the next Gone with the Wind or something and make sure that everyone knows that the lead actress packed on a couple extra pounds. And, unfortunately, that's what this movie is.The title character (Renée Zellweger) is a slightly overweight, slight neurotic thirtysomething who has a menial job and wants to make something out of her life. So she starts a diary and becomes romanticly involved with her boss. Without the diary, the movie would just be another British chick flick. The diary adds some characteristic to the movie, but, as most movies do, anything interesting they could do with the material is defenestrated for general romantic comed clichés and stereotyped characters.Why am I being so harsh on it, you may ask? Well, I had been hearing the hype for two years, since the movie first came out. ""Oh, Renée is so good, she gained 25 pounds!"" ""The movie is hilarious!"" Oftentimes I can just put away the hype and go in with an open mind. But I did not see this before hearing about it; if I had, I'm sure I would have enjoyed it more. For example, I saw My Big Fat Greek Wedding before it was huge and grossed over $200 million at the box office. I enjoyed it a lot, but if I watched it for the first time now, I'm sure I'd be thinking exactly what I am about this movie here. I was led to believe that this movie was strikingly original, nothing else had been done before that was even remotely close to it. As I have mentioned earlier, the only original part of it was the fact that the diary was getting us closer to Bridget's life. But after the first twenty minutes or so, when they knew they had us in, they took it out and went to cliché land.There were some funny moments to it, though. Nothing was down-and-out hilarious, but many points were pretty humorous, although I wouldn't be able to name them now. It's not one of those movies that sticks with you, it's just one of those that you can use to pass the time and that can be used by production companies for unnecessary sequels.Renée (who starred in here before she became America's it-girl) was pretty good and mastered a British accent masterfully, and proves that she's worthy of a future in romantic comedy. Hugh Grant, as Bridget's boss, is his usual self, and Colin Firth, as Bridget's other love interest, is alright, but that added a few plot holes, such as: if Bridget could never get a guy all of her life, how come suddenly she gets two at the same time, not to mention they look like Hugh Grant and Colin Firth? I guess I'm overreacting, but when I see something that's not what it's cracked up to me, I get upset, which is how Bridget Jones's Diary made me feel.My rating: 6/10Rated R for language and some strong sexuality.",Bridget Jones's Diary

So it's awkward for me to rent movies with my SO, who likes dramas. We often choose a comedy / romance, and some are pretty bad. Fortunately, ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" is the best of the lot, along with ""High Fidelity"", and best of all in a refreshing break from tradition, it comes with a female protagonist. Hey, I'm a guy, and even I get tired of every damn movie starring a male in the primary role, even the romantic comedies, which cater of course to an audience of women.The film is genuinely hilarious and quite original, unlike the generic films ""Serendipity"" and ""Pretty Woman"". And like ""High Fidelity"", it has something real to say about life without being so arty that the pace drags or only a film school type could appreciate it. In fact, apparently it's based on the classic book ""Pride and Prejudice"", but the deep thinking remains while the hard-to-identify-with British Victorian stuff is all gone, replaced with the hip modern stuff you'd see in ""Sex and the City"".The acting is good, and since I liked this film even better than ""Jerry Maguire"", I'm really starting to respect Renee Zellweger, who got an Academy Award nomination for her role.Who should see this film:-- romance types: a must-see-- comedy-lovers: dare this one even if romances scare you-- women in their 30s thinking way too much about datingI'll give ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" a 10 out of 10.",Bridget Jones's Diary
87,ruby_fff,The history of love between Miss Jones and Mr. Darcy - almost a modern-day Austen tale,7,31 March 2001,"It's talented Miss Z (Renee Zellweger) meets Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth), with Hugh Grant the Imp-erfect boss, Gemma Jones the glamorous Mom, Jim Broadbent the tolerant Dad, and Embeth Davidtz as Natasha, shadowing Mark Darcy. If you've seen the A&E 1995 miniseries ""Pride and Prejudice"" with Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy, you might think that they intentionally have Firth as Mark Darcy in ""Bridget Jones's Diary."" The two Darcy's truly belong to Colin Firth, who delivered both characters with equal brilliance and restraint. The latter, being outside of Austen's landscape, provided more room for Firth's subtle comedic touch.I thoroughly enjoyed the preview of director Sharon Maguire's 2001 ""Bridget Jones's Diary."" Zellweger put on 15-20 pounds and a British accent for the lead role. Once again, she optimized the chance to deliver the role with spot-on comedic tempo - one cannot not laugh and chuckle over the endearingly clumsy, not so articulate or business smart Miss Jones in her 30's, looking for the perfect man to take her away from the life of being single.Hugh Grant certainly is taking risks these days - he was a charming swindler in Woody Allen's ""Small Time Crooks"" 2000; here in ""Bridget Jones's Diary,"" still exuding his infectious charm, Grant has no qualms in displaying the slapstick side of him, appearing uncouth and downright drenched and untidy (and 'bit of bloody, too.)The audience at the preview obviously enjoyed the movie. I was unable to catch certain phrases due to the laughter and hearty chuckles. We're having such a good time watching Zellweger, Grant and Firth interacting. The dialogs were funny and engaging, and the plot is not entirely predictable - we were kept in suspense prior to the ending. (Demonstrating how easily we assume and react, thinking at once in our own perspective vs. pause to project - oh well, an inescapable human condition inherent to relationships, indeed.)There was no ending credit roll at the preview, but the songs were catchy and finger tapping. I hope they will keep the beyond-ending segment of rolling the childhood video of Jones (at 4) and Darcy (at 8) - it sure adds depth to the history of love.Other worthwhile Renee Zellweger films are: director Dan Ireland's ""Whole Wide World, The"" 1996, as Novalyne Price opposite Vincent D'Onofrio; director Boaz Yakin's ""Price Above Rubies, A"" 1998, a substantial gutsy role as a Jewish young woman in the jewelry business opposite Christopher Eccleston; director Carl Franklin's ""One True Thing"" 1998, as daughter to Meryl Streep and William Hurt; director Neil LaBute's ""Nurse Betty"" 2000, as Betty Sizemore, another funny and sensitive role, opposite Morgan Freeman, Aaron Eckhart, and Greg Kinnear.",Bridget Jones's Diary

They try to set her up with Mark (Colin Firth), the visiting son of one of their neighbors.This movie could have fell flat on it's face by it's cliché story about a women that needs a man in her life, normally I hate those movies but this one I like, because the movie itself knows what it is and tries to be something new and clever with it's story and it's main heroine, and that's what made this movie worked. The writing in this movie took all the same story that has be recycled over and over again and made something good out of it, taking away the stuff that we seen before and putting something new and clever. This has to be Renée Zellweger best role that she was in. Playing the cheeky, caring and witty person that she is.

Renée Zellweger, Hugh Grant and Colin Firth all deliver fantastic performances. Firth is the 'favourite' since he's also been brilliant in the best televisions series ever made (Pride and Prejudice) and one of my all time favourite films (Valmont).

I was a bit uncertain if I have the courage to buy Bridget Jones and is it a wise decision... but it was so cheap that I had to do it. I like Renée Zellweger and I sometimes have this weird feeling that I want to buy some chick flick which probably is not going to be to my liking - but it feels adventurous and there's always the chance of finding something surprising.I bought over 10 movies but the first one that I put in the player was...you guessed it, the curious abnormality and black sheep in the middle of my thriller pile. Reality hit me...what have I done?. The movie is playing, no turning back!Ok, the beginning was quite good. There were some funny moments and I liked the characters. But somewhere in the middle it started to lose the edge and the last third was mostly very boring. I get it that the movie is based on a book which, like the title says, is like a diary. I believe it probably works better as a book? Or maybe both versions only work for certain type of audience. For me it felt like the movie did not have a consistent plot. There was too much time when the story felt like going nowhere. Well, I guess that's also the whole point - that Bridget doesn't know which man to date, so that causes some random waddling. But I think it could have been done better.I liked Zellweger because she's cute, and good at playing a funny awkward character. Hugh Grant was also as cool as he can ever be, even though his characters are always pretty much Hugh Grant. Not a terrible movie, not even annoying.

97,TaylorYee94,I am seriously worried about how Sharon Maguire perceives women.,6,7 August 2021,"'Bridget Jones's Diary' presents how 90's rom-coms typically utilized women in the film industry. Bridget is helpless not just in love but also in her life. I keep asking how dumber she can be. Making soup out of strings and having zero knowledge of any author even when she works in a publishing firm are the examples how the director goes too far to make her clueless. Okay, I will try (so hard) to understand she is not talented enough but has a good heart. However, her behavior is unprofessional and lazy as well. She is late for work so often and is not even apologetic. It looks as she complains about her career and love life without even trying her best, which makes her a whiny and unattractive protagonist. When watching rom-com, audience expects the chemistry, 'how perfect they are together as a couple' while this film keeps reminding audience that Darcy is too good for Bridget not because of differences in social position or outer appearance but because of how incapable of she is and how she never tries hard for anything. She lets things slide. Uncle Geoffrey and Daniel casually grab her bottom, but she is just OKAY with it, especially even in the workplace by her boss. In current point of view, 'Bridget Jones's Diary' is definitely problematic, a clear sexual harassments. Additionally, Bridget's sexy bunny costume is a obvious example of how the movies in 90s sexualize women unnecessarily. Sharon Maguire should be thankful to Renée Zellweger because she makes Bridget more tolerable and adorable and be ashamed how she realizes the main protagonist as a stupid girl who does not bother to be sexualized on the screen.",Bridget Jones's Diary

I wasn't wrong. Even for the men, this movie contains much to identify with, even with the Bridget Jones character. The whole cast is fantastic, with Hugh Grant showing that he can actually pull off a really good role. Renee Zellweger is superb in the lead, and you just can't help liking her and her embarrassing habit of putting her foot in it. There are some clever and witty one-liners and some wonderfully put together scenes, with some well-observed comedy.

Helen Fielding wrote both, and her screenplay is very funny, and very clever. Zellweger is of course fantastic as Bridget Jones. There are so many great scenes, but my favorite one is probably the dinner party sequence where she's the only single person, and the overly enthusiastic pregnant couple makes her feel really bad about being single.

I'm not saying that it is completely pointless - I'm saying that the diary of Bridget Jones really doesn't reveal anything revolutionary or cast any new light on men vs. women. Some men are a**holes, most are not. Some women are degraded gold diggers, most are not. Most people are just like Bridget Jones - willing, kind and really low in the confidence department. Therefore, all the fuss about this being such an ""insight"" is bull. In the end Bridget Jones just wants stability, love and calm and shies away, quite rightly, from sleazy s.o.b. men like her boss (Grant)It is a very funny movie though - not quite in the caliber of ""Notting Hill"", but still a good laugh.

Maybe I would have enjoyed myaself more, if there hadn't been two girls sitting beside me, close to a nervous breakdown each time Hugh Grant appeared on the screen. The most stunning effort is of course Renee Zellweger's courage to completely destroy her outward appearance and look like the `average woman' instead of a sexy super-model (I suppose, that was the idea). Hugh Grant, like him or not, has great fun in the part of the macho guy. And Colin Firth does a good job as a phlegmatic cynic, though I am not sure whether I wanted Bridget to decide for him rather than for Hugh Grant.The problem of the film is that while it is some kind of ironic response to romantic comedies, it turns out to be nothing else after some time.

I don't know, it was just like that. Suddenly thinking the British guys can be uh, handsome.Five years on, I managed to catch it on cable.Adapted from Helen Fielding's novel, it's about the main protagonist Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger) trying to set things right on a new year by writing whatever she wants to say in her diary. In her 30s and still a single and a little kind of plump, she is determined to get a man in her life. The movie began with Bridget who went to attend a party and she met her former childhood friend who is now a lawyer Mark Darcy (Colin Firth). Mark had been divorced with his wife and is single again.But on the other hand, Bridget's boss in the publishing company she works for, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) started to become interested in her. Bridget found out later that her boss and childhood friend actually knew each other back in their university days. And the two guys never seemed to be on a good terms even before Bridget is in the middle of them.It was made worse when Mark and Daniel realise they both like Bridget. Though Bridget found out once that Daniel had a girlfriend, Daniel told her they had broken up. And he told her that during her birthday. It was complicated to Bridget that Mark had did expressed his feelings to Bridget before Daniel came for the birthday party.Well, who ended up had the girl in the end? The childhood friend or the boss?

It is extremely well written and each line is throughly tough and extremely funny.  I usually prefer to see movies when they come out on video because there is no one talking behind me or some really tall boy who comes to sit in front of me, but I love Renée Zellweger (One True Thing, Jerry Maguire, A Price Above Rubies), who is not just a beautiful person on the outside, she is beautiful on the inside as well. She is also a very good actress. Renée  has done some heavy duty acting with actors of the caliber of Meryl Streep, William Hurt, Jim Cary, Tom Cruise, just to name a few. She is wonderful in the part of Brigitt Jones. She is Brigitt Jones!!!!!!!!!! I hope she gets a nomination for this.  They tricked me because I thought she was going to stay with ""Daniel Cleaver,"" played by Hugh Grant (Notting Hill), but she does not. I am hoping they do a sequel, because I was reading that ""Bridget Jones : The Edge of Reason,"" is even funnier than ""Bridget Jones's Diary."" I think this movie is one of the best movies I have seen lately. It is funny without being canned. I think that Colin Firth (Shakespeare in Love) ,  Hugh Grant, all did a great job, specially Renée Zellweger's accent. There is a possibility that she learned British English at  home because both of her parents were born in Europe, and Europeans tend to have a British accent not and American accent in English. She also spent sometime in England studying the part. Favorites Scenes: Opening Scenes when Bridget  is singing along with a record. The fire station scene. Sending e-mail to Daniel Cleaver without showing any facial expression. Picking up which undies to wear. The whole movie is hilarious. Favorite Line so far: "" everyone knows that dating in the thirties is not the happy lucky free-for-all it was when you were twenty-two...""

I couldn't stop laughing at Bridget's misadventures, or feeling bad about her problems in life.But realistic? No.Here we have an incult, compulsive, alcoholic, chain smoker, whom, we are supposed to believe, gets the affection of the most decent, intelligent, witty and educated guy on the whole movie. That is a little bit too much to believe; I can understand the physical attraction part, but no sane man with such qualifications would dare to get romantically involved with a ticking time bomb of a woman. She was a great couple to Hugh Grant's character: both were basically airheads, only caring about love and sex in the most basic of ways. In fact, being harsh to Bridget's character, even Hugh would have been bored by Bridget's... hmmm... stupidity.Maybe that was too harsh, but I tried to find something, anything of value to Bridget's character. The only thing I found was her desire to find true love. The rest was shockingly bad: she was mediocre, full of vices, dumb, incoherent at times, fat, etc.I think I am looking too much into the movie. Maybe the whole thing was an exaggeration on loneliness and the failure of a human to find a partner in this time and age. If so, then this film is simply superb. If it is meant as an accurate depiction, then I don't think it's as good.Last, but not least, the minute I saw Renee, I was shocked. Was she the same woman that appeared as a sex symbol in ""Me, Myself and Irene""? She looks *terrible*. I wonder if she gained weight in order to appear in this movie (I don't think any woman alive would do that), or if she got the part because of her figure. Terrible.",Bridget Jones's Diary

All three are inextricably linked, yet who will Bridget ultimately find true love with? Yes, this kind of story has been done to death, Yes, it had a very predictable storyline, Yes, it was dreadfully clichéd, Yes, it stretches realism hugely, Yes, it yet again gave a rather stilted & blinkered view of jolly old upper-middle class England, Yes, it had a very telegraphed ending.But you know what? I couldn't care a jot!For it was pure, simple entertainment: I cared not about any of the above; I cared not how the film didn't live up to the expectations of the book; and I really cared not whether a ""plump"" Bridget Jones could really hit it off with a two very handsome men!Just take the film at face value and leave the cynicism on the doorstep.My wife loved it, and I was very entertained by it, especially with its light humour & slapstick; and of course the rather feel-good ending.For a person who prefers far more weightier genres & more thought-provoking scripts, I didn't think I would ever enjoy a rom-com.

109,lyubitelfilmov,A girl in her thirties looking for love or a Madwoman: part one,8,9 August 2021,"A romantic comedy. A screen adaptation of the novel of the same name by the English writer Helen Fielding. I will say nothing for the book, because I have not read it, so I will evaluate the film adaptation as an independent work. I decided to take a break from the cinema of the fifties and sixties, and wanted to see something modern, and then a friend advised this romantic comedy, which this year hit its anniversary - it's twenty years old, a round date. So this part also became the beginning of a trilogy about the adventures of the extravagant girl Bridget Jones, which we will talk about in the near future, because I aimed to watch the whole trilogy, but today we will deal with the first part, which was a tremendous success with the audience. And here's my brief opinion - A girl over thirty is looking for love. I was completely delighted with the picture, and I did not even find any minuses as such (although I looked meticulously), so I will only note the expressive merits of this romantic comedy.So, here they are:
1. Scenario - Richard Curtis was responsible for it (to which I promised to return after watching ""Notting Hill"" and ""Boyfriend from the Future""). And if you promised, then be kind and fulfill it! This is what I am doing. So, the picture tells the story of Bridget Jones, a lonely girl in her thirties who lives in London and who is terribly unlucky in love. Parents and friends are already beginning to sound the alarm, because the years are flying, and Bridget herself understands that if she does not hurry now, then the ending of life will not be at all rosy. How well two guys turn up, both of the same age and handsome, but with completely different characters. And now the word is for Bridget, who must listen to the voice of reason and determine which of these two will become ""the one"" with whom she will forever connect her life. The final for the rom-com is classic, there are no twists, no intrigue - and despite this, the picture looks in one breath and makes the viewer worry about the characters and Bridget herself. A classic romcom that works and will always work. If you are waiting for a simple story about the search for true love - then you definitely come here!2. Bridget Jones - the whole picture rests solely on the main character, her behavior, manners, character, humor (more on that below), and of course on the acting talent of Renee Zellweger. Bridget manages to simultaneously repel and attract the viewer with her antics and thrown inappropriately words. Well, the basis of the basics is her diary, where she writes down all the innermost thoughts. René here anneals so brightly and talentedly that not to pat it would be the height of indecency. She so convincingly played a madcap with enchanting annealing, and at the same time a gentle and vulnerable girl, capable of sincere feelings and excessive emotionality. The rest of the actors were no less convincing, but it was Rene who carried the bulk of the weight.3. Humor - subtlety, grace, rudeness, vulgarity (in some places) it is all there and it works exactly as it should. Of course, Bridget is the one who gives out the bulk of the humor - and that's great. I often caught myself in bouts of ""Spanish shame"" when Bridget did things that made her, and me, and me even more ashamed than her. Well, how can we go without the heroine's comments regarding these very annealing. The diary style here plays into the hands not only of the narration itself, but also of humor. He laughed heartily at almost all the moments.4. Memorable scenes - well, how could it be without it, I will not list them, because I do not want to spoil the viewing for those who have not yet watched this romantic comedy. I can only say that in them I also had bouts of ""Spanish shame"", because it was both funny and ashamed. And without Bridget's comments, these scenes would have been only half the fun!5. Music - lyrical, pop of the late nineties and early zero, plus classics from the eighties, which fit perfectly into the romantic atmosphere of this comedy. I even wanted to sing along. I am sure that you will easily recognize most of the compositions if you love music.A little about the main characters:
1. Bridget Jones performed by Renee Zellweger is an extravagant girl in her thirties with classic complexes for her age, who is trying to find true love. Awkward, funny and extremely memorable person. Rene is just a miracle here! Kisses to the pen!2. Daniel Cleaver played by Hugh Grant - Bridget's boss, with whom she starts a relationship that seems to her to be ""the very one."" Daniel is the typical wealthy bachelor with great ambition and character, the role of which old Hugh did very well.3. Mark Darcy performed by Colin Firth is a childhood friend of Bridget, a silent and quiet man, invisibly present somewhere nearby, in which a predatory beast clearly lives, ready to break out. What can I say, because Colin was no less convincing in this role and earned our sympathy. Well done!Frankly, the picture surprised me a lot and made me laugh and even think about some points, and the audience success also makes me happy. And now the picture already has a cult status and it definitely deserved it (in contrast to ""Casablanca""). And I just have to join those viewers who sincerely love this picture. And I am sure that one day I will definitely revise it, and more than once.But I'm a little afraid for the continuation, because the story ended here. What could be continued there? Well, okay, we'll see as they say. Well, next time we will meet after watching the second part of the trilogy ""Bridget Jones: Edge of Reason."" Until then, good luck to everyone!As a result, we have an excellent romantic comedy, with an excellent script, great romantic atmosphere, great humor, good and atmospheric music and great acting. Renee Zellweger did her best!My rating is 8 out of 10 and my strong recommendation for viewing!",Bridget Jones's Diary

I, on the other hand, was rolling in the aisles.  I had to buy this as soon as it hit the video stores.  I wasn't sure I was going to like Renee Zellweger as the British lead, but she pulled off her accent reasonably well...and Hugh Grant was excellent as her jerky boss.  And then there's Colin Firth!  ...also good were Jim Broadbent and Gemma Jones as Bridget's mum and dad.  The director kept this movie short and sweet, and the humor works.  My guess is that women will like this movie more than men will.  I loved it.",Bridget Jones's Diary
111,David_Frames,Fantasy Island,5,25 July 2005,"Want to know what its like to live in England? Ask Richard Curtis. Hes always on hand to paint a picture of London life as imagined stateside - a London where everyone is middle class, has eccentric friends who are frightfully naughty because they swear a bit - where the ever so slightly repressed English handle sex with a mixture of crude embarrassment and the odd 'outrageous' outburst and a London in which it always snows at Christmas. If reality was half this middle of the road we might all kill ourselves with two and half big neurofens to a large glass of Chardonnay but thankfully this version of my fair city only exists in the mind of the Chelsea set and the Oxbridge media cult. Women love Bridget Jones of course, shes one of them you see. She worries about being fat, drinks too much, gets screwed over by men all the time (they ARE bastards aren't they?) and is prone to getting squiffy and making a fool of herself. A comfortable caricature for a lot of people I'm sure and lets be honest, if you identify with Bridget then its odds on that you've never held an original thought in your life. I'll bet you drink Pinot Grigo at pubs, are currently on a fad diet, have a fitness video hosted by an ex-Big Brother contestant and read Heat magazine. OK, you may say, what's wrong with a light bit of fairytale entertainment? Well nothing except that it seems to be the only kind of national representation that has any hope of being made these days and it gets on my bloody nerves. Also, would it be possible for an English lead to be played by, wait for it, an Englishwoman? Its bad enough that we've got to watch ourselves being parodied but surely to God we don't have to be impersonated as well? Incidentally, and I don't wish to offend anyone...which obviously isn't true but stick with it, there's nothing remotely funny about being the sort of Cosmo reading, ever so slightly kooky girl depicted here - if this is you, sit down and have a rethink tonight - life's too short to be a cliché.",Bridget Jones's Diary
112,aramo1,Average all round,5,28 December 2001,"Based on R1 (Canada) DVD 98 minutes.Echos of Adrian Mole with much toned down humour. Bridget (Renée Zellweger) is 31, single and keeps a diary - this is their story. Zellweger plays the part well, Grant is the predictable cad with Firth donning the role of the decent though often misunderstood chap.Aside from Bridgets solo routines the humour lacks sparkle, chemistry is absent, the story is predicable and everything is decidedly average.Watch it, miss it - doesn't matter much.5/10",Bridget Jones's Diary
113,TuckMN,Bridget -- just as she is.,9,18 April 2001,"One of the things that make this film so appealing and so good is the superb casting of absolutely everyone.Renee Zellweger is simply marvelous as the slightly daft Bridget Jones  unsure of who she is, whom she wants to be with, what she wants and how to go about getting it.  The character of Bridget is a bit of storm-tossed flotsam on the sea of life  going where the wind and waves take her and only occasionally taking charge of her own life.Colin Firth  Mr. Darcy in this film and in `Pride and Prejudice'  is dark, brooding and enigmatic: he seems as unsure of what he wants and whom he wants to be with as poor Bridget does.  He underplays his character; and his performance is all the richer for it.Hugh Grant is sublimely smarmy as Daniel Cleaver.  I understand how a woman could fall for such a jerk but you want desperately for them not to.The sound track is great: lots of old songs that evoke the mood and feeling that the film is trying to achieve.Though there is little overt nudity this film is rated `R' for language and sexuality.  I saw this film at a large metroplex theater and the girls in line in front of me bought tickets for a `G' rated film but after the obligatory stop at the concession counter made a beeline for ""Bridget.""  I don't think they were warped for life  but I have never heard the `F' word used more in any film.This is a wonderful example of a plot and story driven film.  No big splashy special effects just a story of a young woman's journey of self-discovery. I highly recommend it.",Bridget Jones's Diary
114,Geofbob,It's only a movie,7,28 April 2001,"Some IMDb commenters are taking this movie way too seriously - it's a comedy for heaven's sake! Like many other best sellers, the book is no literary masterpiece, so it would be surprising if the movie was on the level of, say, Philadelphia Story.Yes, the film's sexual politics are hardly ""correct"" - though many thirtyish women seem to find no difficulty in identifying with Bridget -and its portrait of Britain displays the usual Richard Curtis (sorry Sharon Maguire!) cozy stylisation - with almost all the faces as white as the inevitable snow. But Zelwegger, Firth and Grant are all excellent, and there are lots of laughs. In particular, high praise to Renee Zelwegger, who as well as having a near-perfect English accent, projects that mix of sexiness (though muted here) and vulnerability that makes her appealing to both male and female members of the audience. One specific criticism - the fight scene is a tad too savage and prolonged for a movie of this kind.",Bridget Jones's Diary

Is the only way out to get laid with a good-looking boss? Or date a casual neighbourhood friend?These are just some answers on which Bridget (playing Renee Zellweger, a perfect pick for this role, btw) wants answers. Will she find it? Well watch the movie and see it for your self, as for me, I didn't search the answers with her, I just simply enjoyed an hour and half romantic comedy (heh, with a touch of British humor), though i would prefer that Hugh Grant would play a casual-looking guy with a ""deer-pullover"" instead of ""woman-just-can-resist-me"" type of boss.

Renee Zellweger is outstanding as Bridget. She perfect adapts a British dialouge and fall so deeply into the role that You forget she is an american.She is perky,caustic,cynical and quite fetching. Colin Firth and Hugh Grant are priceless as the objects of her affections. Grant finally gets another chance to stretch his acting muscles as a vapid womanize who prove quite unloveable...and Firth finally gets another big screen role to equal ""Valmont"" or his stage performaces.He develops his character slowly and deeply throughout the film. Special attention must be given to the wonderful Jim Broadbent as Bridget's Dad.Although not on screen for any length of time,It is another well drawn character in his ever growing list of great portrayals. On the down side I can only state the under developed nature of some of the supporting roles,I would have liked to see more of Bridget's friends,Mother and family.",Bridget Jones's Diary
118,Starbuck-13,"Nice movie in the tradition of ""Four Weddings""",8,6 September 2001,"...but not that good.As a Single watching this movie is certainly kind of painful on the one hand, but on the other hand you recognize a lot of yourself in Bridget (even as a man) and therefore you get some delight in knowing that you are not alone with your fate.Especially not when a beautiful girl is sitting next to you in the theater ;-)The movie is light and funny, a nice piece of work but missing the absolute grandeur of ""Four Weddings and a funeral"", still better than ""Notting Hill"". Hugh Grant being a bad guy is hard to swallow - even when he behaves like a total a**hole, he still seems to be nice and funny and therefore he just does not fit into his role - but Renee Zellweger really has done a great job. Recommended to watch any time - you can't do anything wrong with this one!",Bridget Jones's Diary
119,jordyntsmith,I'm Not the Target Audience,3,29 December 2020,"I'm sorry, but I'm just not who this movie is for. My wife seemed to enjoy it somewhat though.The movie felt too awkward, too cheesy, and too unrealistic. It didn't help that it is essentially a poor modernized retelling of Pride and Prejudice (a book which I did enjoy).The main plus was watching Colin Firth! He's just a great actor!",Bridget Jones's Diary
120,neenahhh,Bridget Jones: The Awkward 33-Year-Old,6,2 January 2011,"Bridget Jones is a crazy woman. She's in her early 30's and single. However she's full of hope and she managed to get her boss, Daniel Cleaver, interested in her by a skirt (or lack of it) she wore to work one day. I think their relationship was too rushed and too full of sex. It's no surprise it didn't work out. After detaching herself from Daniel, she's hit on by Mark Darcy, one of her childhood acquaintances. Apparently, she fell in love with Mr. Darcy after he said that he liked Bridget ""just the way she was"".The movie is subtly implying that women can't live without men- a woman is nothing without a man. Bridget should learn to stand up for herself. Even when single, she's already mentally and emotionally unstable, with her drinking and smoking problem! So how can she survive a relationship? Then again, this comes from a teenager who's been single since birth, so you can feel free to disregard that.Despite the subliminal messages, this movie was okay. I couldn't see Shirley Henderson as anyone other than Moaning Myrtle in the Harry Potter series. I had to pause in the beginning of the movie, when I heard her moaning/complaining to Bridget. Anyway, this movie was not Colin Firth's best movie. And DEFINITELY not Hugh Grant's best one. However, Renée Zellweger was perfect for this role. Even though I haven't read the books (but I am planning to!), Renée just seems like a Bridget Jones! Her English accent wasn't that bad, either.I was turned off by Bridget's alcohol and smoking problem, but her awkwardness and silliness made her lovable and easy to relate with. When I first watched this movie at a young age, I remember rooting for Daniel, simply because I was in love with Hugh Grant. And every time the ending came on, with Bridget in her underwear, kissing Mark Darky.. Yeech. I always thought, ""Why would she pick him when she could have Grant?!"" But watching it now, I realize that Mark was the better choice (and he might even be as sexy as Grant is).",Bridget Jones's Diary
121,hbs,"sweet, funny, excellent performances",9,24 April 2001,"It's a standard Hollywood movie, but a clever script, Zellweger's performance, and an excellent supporting cast lifts this predictable story to a level well above most of the romantic comedies. Hugh Grant is perfectly cast as the devilish ""bad boy"", and Colin Firth is the only choice for the rather thankless role of reprising Mr. Darcy of ""Pride and Prejudice"" (he is a very good actor but in most American movies he plays a pompous and humorless jerk; at least here he is a generally sympathetic character). But as good as all of these actors are, it's Zellweger that carries the movie. Her performance is perfectly nuanced -- she's funny, adorable, and goofy, and manages to convey just enough pain during her character's misadventures to be touching, while still letting you laugh.It's an ideal date movie, and she's still as cute as a button with the extra weight she put on for the role.",Bridget Jones's Diary

123,shu-fen,"459 already, why not one more to make it 460, right?",6,8 November 2003,"Oh, it's a ""Cinderella of 21st Century"" movie.  I have to make it clear, it's the movie which carries the smell of Cinderella but not the book.  The book is more realistic.  B once said to M in the book, ""what would we talk about?""  Right, when M may talk about the Parliament, the legal circle gossips, what things about B that he's really interested in?  I just find it hard to imagine Bridget is able to communicate with Mark and vice versa.  If they come together, divorce is not unlikely.  The UK, a class-conscious country. Daniel Cleaver, somehow, fits Bridget more, as long as he really cut down his number of affairs with other women.  Let's see how they deal with the sequel. Besides, Cinderella's enemies this time, are not the stepmother and the two step-sisters but her weight and life-style.We all need this movie, I mean unmarried women approaching mid to late thirties.  Reality in workplace is cruel enough to suffocate us,  why not some sweet delights to add some colours to the greyness of real life?  No one would hate this movie even though arguments about unrealistic treatments may arise.For those who want the ""real life"" in the movie, these are the real faces:Natasha of course would be Mark's wife for they are both blunt and wood-block-like with tongue full of acid.  After having been betrayed by a Japanese wife, how could Mark dare date Asian but Caucasian?Daniel would cajole B into staying with him again for some more time and gullible and kind B would fall into trap again.  But she will wake up quicker this time.Bridget's mom for sure will have another or some others affairs/extra marital adventures.Some smug married couples would divorce and the women would demurely keep their ""Mrs""Not hard to predict, right?

126,Captain Ed,"Entertaining, funny, a bit predictable",7,24 May 2001,"I saw BJD last night with my wife, who has been asking about this film for weeks now.  I kept putting it off, thinking it to be another clunky, formulaic romance film.  I wasn't exactly incorrect, but the film is rather inventive in how it handles some conventional situations.Renee Zellweger did a fine job as Bridget Jones, although it's difficult to see why men would find her physically unattractive, even with the modest weight gain Zellweger had for the movie.  I thought she looked terrific. Hugh Grant and Colin Firth (one of my favorite underused actors) swap their normal roles around for this film, and both are outstanding.  Grant is the sophisticated, ethically challenged Lothario, Daniel Cleaves (nary a stutter!) while Firth's character seems almost unable to break outside of himself at all.  You can feel Mark Darcy's tension, his wanting to express himself and his despair at not being able to do so.  I'd say Firth's performance is easily the best in the film.Unfortunately, but not too importantly, the crucial plot twists in the story are pretty obvious to anyone with half a brain, especially the one concerning Cleaves and Darcy.  In the meantime, there's a lot of edgy humor in watching Jones bounce from disaster to disaster, trying to exceed her own abilities and in a few instances succeeding.  Some people have commented on her lack of moderation in drink, tobacco, and sex and how that made her unsympathetic.  That seems to me to be a somewhat sexist point of view, as many films feature male characters with the same exact issues, and these manage to garner sympathetic reviews.One last note: Previous reviews have mentioned ""Someone Like You"" in comparison to BJD.  My thoughts were on ""Circle of Friends"", which dealt with an overweight central female character trying to break free of her own expectations and those of the people around her.  While I really enjoyed BJD, and CoF doesn't have the same edgy humor, I think CoF does a much better job of handling the central conflict of both films and treats the characters better.  (Colin Firth is also in CoF, although he is in his traditional jerk character.)  When Bridget Jones' Diary comes out on DVD, my wife will be clamoring for a copy, and then we'll put both on the same night and have a film duel!",Bridget Jones's Diary

Renee Zellweger did a brilliant job as Bridget, and pulled off the accent well. I loved Colin Firth, he was so good as Mr Darcy and seeing him play Mark Darcy after Helen Fielding based the character of Mark on Firth's performance in Pride and Prejudice was just great.

130,jangu,Almost perfect comedy and really heart warming,8,8 November 2002,"Surely, there is a Bridget Jones in all of us! At least I can certainly recognize myself in a lot of the things she says, thinks and does. This movie manages to be heart warming without getting too sugary and still it doesn't lack guts! We have love, hate, disappointment, excitement and a fist-fight. There are some scenes that are absolutely hilarious (like Zellwegers tv-debut in a fire station and the ""Tarts & vicars party"") and others that are touching or heartbreaking (look at Zellweger's face when she finds another woman in Hugh Grant's bathroom). Every member in the cast is perfect. Grant plays a manipulative yet very charming creep, and does it well. It's a long way from ""Four weddings..."" where he was the one who had a sort of Bridget Jones-character to play. You DO however understand why Bridget is attracted to him. Colin Firth is the straight-laced lawyer who develops a crush for Bridget early on (if not at first), but have great difficulties to express his feelings. A character like his isn't easy to put across and might become a bore in the wrong hands. It is a great strength of Mr Firth that he conveys a sort of boyish awkwardness and lack of confidence instead of inducing yawns. Smaller parts are equally well cast with a few stand-outs, like Gemma Jones and Jim Broadbent as her parents and James Callis as her gay friend. But finally there is Zellweger and she is perfect in her part! Absolutely amazing performance. You root for her all the way because you always feel she is so HUMAN. She makes foolish mistakes and put her foot in her mouth on quite a few occasions, but who hasn't? She is sweet, funny and a fighter. And she is in every single scene in the movie(except for a few funny ones during the end-credits) and yet I didn't spot a single false note in her performance. Academy-award stuff, really! If the movie has one small fault it is that a few scenes tend to drag a bit and are not as funny as they could have been. I also think that too many of the minor characters were reduced to clichés, but i have to admit that I probably wouldn't have laughed as much if it had been otherwise. All in all, a treat!",Bridget Jones's Diary
131,HanShotFirstGR,Totally cheesy but equally adorable,8,22 January 2021,"Plot:Bridget Jones is determined to improve herself while she looks for love in a year in which she keeps a personal diary.Analysis:Through the feeling of a TV movie, the totally cheesy lines and some very cheap humour, Bridget Jones's Diary is a romantic comedy with a certain charm that is not possible to justify. This one includes every possible cliché in modern romantic cinema, from character development to a relatable looking-for-true-love protagonist and a whole third act full of excessive romanticism.Bridget is the typical main character in rom coms, a not-so-young lady that tries really hard to find love and of course there are 2 possible men with the ""Mr. Perfect"" personality, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) Bridget's boss, somewhat of a ladies' man with a playboy attitude and the totally serious but still charming Mark Darcy (Colin Firth). She is clumpsy, she is awkward and too wannabe sexy, she is the perfect mediocre girl so the female audience can relate and that's what made this movie so successful. It's a well known trick that applies to most rom coms out there and this one was no exception.Each one of the three actors did a great job. Hugh Grant and Collin Firth are both handsome and talented men, so their performances have been simple and perfect, they are charming and they have great chemistry with Reneé Zellweger. Zellweger is also gorgeous, she has this cute style that makes this movie so sweet that it could probably cause you diabetes by just watching it. Their charming personalities and natural charisma are probably one of the reasons this movie feels way more satisfying than others of the same genre.Despite being a charming addition to the genre, it is also a very cheesy one. Something about those big romantic words and poetic theme feels way too dreamy to be portrayed in a modern era story. In our times, romance is way harder to find, way more imperfect and the unrealistic belief that love comes easily when you look for it, is something completely utopian and makes this one could be a Wattpad fanfiction. Love is way harder than what is portrayed in this one and it was done in a way that gives the audience the false impression that being madly in love is an easy task.But all of this objective criticism is actually not so important when a movie can give you a nice time and make you a little happier. Just by accepting that this is just a fictional story, everything is enjoyable, cute and basically a beautiful dream, something like a pretty ""What if?"" situation you would love to live in.Conclusion:Bridget Jones's Diary is the cheesiest rom com you can possibly find, it's like a fairytale for kids, or the romantic dream of an everyday teenage girl, but it's presented in such a sweet way and through the talent of such great actors that will definetely be one of the most enjoyable movies of this genre especially for the romantic ones in the audience.Rating: 7/10",Bridget Jones's Diary

133,cleary-joshua,"This is occasionally funny, sickly sweet, but does nothing in the way of breaking convention...",6,1 June 2014,"I'm gonna come straight out and say it – I don't really love romcoms. Recent and future entries in this blog may lead you to think otherwise, with both ""Love Actually"" and ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" reviewed within days of each other. Actually no, on further thought, I love a lot of romcoms. The classics, like ""Some Like it Hot"" or ""Manhattan"", or recent subversions of the genre, such as ""(500) Days of Summer"" and ""Punch Drunk Love"", are films which I admire greatly despite being in this genre. These are the films which either began the clichés in an unforced and genuinely romantic way, or which turned the conventions on their heads. ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" is occasionally funny, sickly sweet, but does nothing in the way of breaking convention.The film follows the title character, played by Renée Zellweger, and her search for love with a few different men – including those played by Hugh Grant and Colin Firth. Her impressions of the two change throughout the film as she gets new information, with her love for Daniel Cleaver (Grant) turning into hatred after he cheats on her, and her hatred for Mark Darcy (Firth) turning into love. She is a clumsy woman, prone to faux-pas, which leads to some interesting and witty comedy, and often leaves her unlucky in love.Renée Zellweger is a good choice for Jones, and she passes off a sense of 'ordinary' which is important for the character. The comic set pieces and dialogue is managed well by her and she is actually a very likable character. Colin Firth also brings across the bumbling British romantic well, and despite their initial hatred for each other, you see how the two work as a couple. The biggest problem is Hugh Grant, who I continue to dislike strongly. Having seen this and ""Four Weddings"" in such close proximity, it's hard not to draw comparisons between their characters, basically the same in both.""Bridget Jones's Diary"" has a lot of great things in some cast choices, and some excellently funny moments. The fight scene between the two men is genuinely funny, and I love many of Zellweger's scenes, particularly her terrible public speaking. Where it falls down is at the bare romance and reliance on genre clichés. It's too predictable and from the introduction of both men, we know which one she's going to fall for. The one grace in this is that, despite its cheese, the final scene is very sweet. It's not a particularly clever film, but then again, it's not trying to be. I didn't love it, but I'm sure that fans of this genre will – especially if they take a particular fancy to Hugh Grant.",Bridget Jones's Diary
134,Ripe Peach,Compromises don't come much finer than this,10,18 January 2002,"I sat down to watch this film certain that it would be a horrid compromise of British humour and US influenced shmaltz.  The casting of Renne Zellweger over the likes of Minnie Driver aggravated me.  There's just no *need* for it.  And the news that Renee had the same voice coach as Gwyneth Paltrow filled me with horror.  Paltrow's English accent is very credible Standard English.  The only trouble is, nobody except newsreaders speaks Standard English.  Everyone - *everyone* - in the UK speaks a recognisable dialect.And initially, Renee struck me as similar.  Her accent is Standard English, except where it verges into generic over-rounded ""posh"".  It's not a dialect, and it rings just a little false.  Oh well, I thought, here we go. At least it's not Dick Van Dyke.But to my delight, five minutes into the film, I'd (nearly) gotten over it. Because Renee *is* Bridget Jones.  She looks perfect, and her mannerisms are flawless.  I was won over, and quite in love, and considering that Bridget is actually not a sympathetic character, that's quite a feat.And from there it was plain sailing, because the rest of the cast acted as though the roles were written for them.  Colin Firth's role *was* written for him (in the original columns and book) in fact, and Hugh Grant's might as well have been.  The support were equally as comfortable and recognisable, with only a couple of exceptions: Cosmo, who should have been more Tim Nice-But-Dim (British reference, but it's a British film) and Julian, who, to be fair was playing one of the few characters that had been changed significantly from the book.Highlights were the scenes that were recognisable re-workings of the 1995 BBC miniseries of ""Pride and Prejudice"", lowlights were the slightly kludged ending that actually veers away from the Diary (and Austin) original, and the couple of Americanised scenes.All in all, a splendid adaptation and a splendid film in its own right.  The big outstanding question is: if they film the sequel, which features an interview with Colin Firth, who will they cast to play him?  Enquiring minds want to know. ;-)",Bridget Jones's Diary
135,segacs,Harmless chick flick,8,5 February 2005,"See this movie if you're female. But make it a girls' night out, and leave him at home. Don't say I didn't warn you.Bridget Jones is a neurotic, lonely, but ultimately likable character. She is a heavy smoker, a heavy drinker, a few pounds overweight, British, a terrible public speaker, and has terrible judgment when it comes to relationships, but these qualities only help make her human and make it easier for people to identify with her. Of course, the fact that her character is portrayed by the very un-British and un-fat Renee Zellweiger makes some of what she says a little hard to believe. Despite this, Zellweiger pulls off the role with charm and grace - not an easy feat.The story itself has no surprises. From the first five minutes, everyone in the theatre knew exactly how it would end. There's no exciting revelation or universal truth to this tale. It's a simple romantic story, and it doesn't pretend to be anything else.Hugh Grant plays a fairly one-dimensional bad guy, and Colin Firth an equally flat good guy. Aside from the lead role, there are no noteworthy acting performances here.I haven't read the book, but I hear that some of the quirkiness is lost in the movie. In addition, the movie has some issues with the plot that just scream ""should have been cut out when adapted from book"". After a while, watching Bridget make the same mistakes over and over again gets a little tiresome. But ultimately, the story works.All in all, she's a likable heroine and we identify with her. The story is realistic and charming and, above all, harmless. It's a chick flick, but go see it if you're looking for a light laugh.",Bridget Jones's Diary

138,bedazzle,not just a chick flick,7,23 May 2001,"First thing, I had wanted to see this movie but almost did not go because of the main review which described this movie as ""Brill!"" I thought, ""Oh god, not only is this a chick flick, it's a teenage chick flick."" Gladly, I overcame my apprehensions and came over to the movie house...Though this definitely could be considered a chick flick, there must be something else to it; for, I do not enjoy the typical chick flick. Thinking back at the most humorous scenes, I believe it was the dialogue that made this movie enjoyable for me.I, you see, am a regular word smith, a true logophiliac. When a movie has no plot, or a disagreeable plot, or a predictable plot, creative conversationist nuances can certainly bring a movie forward. For example, at one point Mark refers to Bridget's speaking skills as ""verbal incontinence."" Later, referring back to that comment, Bridget uses the phrase, ""verbal diarrhea."" Another time, Bridget comes to work skimpily clad. Her boss asks if her skirt is ""home sick."" Bridget replies that her skirt is indeed present and that his attitude must represent some sort of biased ""size-ist"" ideology. Those are the first two instances I could think of. I found them quite amusing.But if such subtleties to not amuse you, I'm sure you may enjoy this movie for it's chick-flick aspects. Aspects include: problems in dieting, embarrassment of ""spinsterhood"" (another gem of verbosity), self-pity followed by triumph!, and other such not-nearly-as-unique-as-the-dialogue scenes. Just to brag a bit, SPOILERS, I did predict both ending and the cloths misconception and cheating misconception that allowed for said ending to occur. Yet this was not a plot movie for me, so it did not detract from anything, for me.Also, I thought the fact that the heroine was to purposely game weight for the movie was a refreshing change. Although more plump than when sleeping with Jerry Mcquire, Renee was not over-ripe and did a fantastic job. The accent did not hurt either, scruptous.One more thing I thought was interesting, if not contradictory or revealing reverse sexism. Why does - yet another SPOILER - Bridget finally wise up and drop the cheating dog Daniel, while Mrs. Jones leaves Mr. Jones to go have a month long orgy with a television star and he takes her back with no thought whatsoever? There is only one answer: miss Mcquire and her feminine agenda do that think a man can get past his self-pity enough to escape his dependence on an unfaithful partner, while Bridget has no problem doing this even before she learns the truth of the cheating misconception.
That was partly joking, because I do not remember having ever seen a movie with a female director. Yet I give you kudos, miss Mcquire, for making a film with two levels of enjoyability.",Bridget Jones's Diary

Mark, Daniel, and Bridget all had a prior history with one another, adding some depth to their motivations. Bridget's parents gave her another dimension, as a more complete person. Renee looked positively zaftig and hot, which just underlines how unhealthy the (weight/body type) standards are for screen actresses nowadays.Not having read the book, I cannot comment on the job the writer/director did in translating it. Obviously, the movie went easy on the anguish and self-loathing a real person who wants to stop eating/smoking/drinking goes through; after all, it is meant to be a comedy!",Bridget Jones's Diary

I read the first reviewhere on the IMDB- by a person who, oddly enough, has yet to review anyother film- and feel like the Miramax pr team has a mole here on theIMDB. Perhaps there should be a rule about no reviews appearing untilthe film has actually opened- but that's neither here nor there. Readthe book instead, it's richer and fuller and has real committedcharacters. Renee Z was cute, yes, but afraid to really commit to therole- can anyone really picture Bridget Jones making love while keepingher bra on!?  And she does this TWICE in the film! Oh well.

But she was never through with men.  She just was just tired of meeting bad ones.  And she hardly ever writes in her diary. WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?But Renee Zellewegger (or however you spell her name) once again, proves that she is a FUNNY ACTRESS.

143,jmverville,Surprisingly Good,7,7 December 2004,"When I saw previews for this film, as a man, I thought that it would not appeal to me. It was really by chance -- seeing it on while a former roommate was watching it, sitting down, expecting to leave within the next five minutes, but I ended up watching the entire thing, becoming completely incapable of pulling myself away from it. In fact, I would later feel compelled to drag somebody along with me to see the sequel that came out in the Fall of 2004 on opening night. It became very obvious that I was greatly mistaken.In an age where 'war' films like Pearl Harbor contain sappy romance stories, this was very bizarre seeing something that was a Romantic Comedy that was more of a comedy than a sappy, cliché Romance that makes the more sound of mind wish to vomit. I find that opposed to other romantic comedies, this one really embodies a sense of a realist's look at life, and as opposed to focusing on sexy women trying to get sexy men with horrible, predictable jokes being thrown in on occasion, this is far more refreshing. Great performances by everybody involved, and a very refreshing story overall.It breaks all the stereotypes of modern comedy, lacking any crudeness or immature antics, and it breaks all the stereotypes of Romance, giving an honest portrayal of a relationship and the attitudes of normal people, often poking fun at itself. As far as major motion pictures go, this one is a tremendous surprise as far as entertainment & content go. It is the kind of film that anybody can appreciate. If I were to make a list of films that pleasantly surprised me, this would probably be at the very top. A tremendous production.",Bridget Jones's Diary

The banter is wonderful and the ending is great.  Please, no more stinker endings for comedies.  This movie delivers as an entertaining comedy without any deep thinking.

146,Rozinda,So-so movie though would have failed without Hugh Grant,6,20 January 2010,"This is entertaining enough to watch once and perhaps even twice - because Hugh Grant is so good in it.]Anything Hugh Grant is in is worth watching in my experience, whether he's sending himself up farcically, which he does so well, or acting a serious part as in The Man who went up a Hill and Came Down a Mountain. HG is a real charmer. Even playing the caddish Wickham part in this Jane Austen sort of take-off, Grant manages to make Wickham likable in spite of being equally caddish! I used to read the original B.Jones column in the Independent. It was fairly entertaining although eventually I got tired of her endless problems and moans and stopped reading it - it went way past its sell-by date, I felt. The movie isn't nearly as good as the column, mainly because Zellwegger is so badly miscast althuogh the actress clearly does do her very best. I just can't imagine Bridget Jones like Zellweger, nor does she as scriped and acted have the slightest connection that I can see to sparky, clever Elizabeth Bennet.The original idea of having Mr Darcy and Wickham in the story was always amusing. If you can be tolerant of a very weak Mr Darcy and a completely non-Elizabeth, you may well love this movie. 6 stars mostly for Hugh Grant. Without him, it would have been only stars. The movie might have worked better for me if Zellwegger had been Elizabeth Bennet's silly younger sister Lydia and ended up enforcedly with a resentful Wickham!

Not to mention the complete ineptness at executing any kind of real career.So how does she capture the attention, then devotion, of two upper-crust British men (one gentleman, one cad) who can and do have other women who are slinkier, richer, more poised, and quite willing?

149,RJBose,A Pathetic Loser and Her Pathetic Life,6,15 May 2001,"An unambitious, lazy and coarse woman of decidedly loose morals who drinks and smokes too much, is irresponsible and inept at work, and sadly (and drunkenly) warbles sentimental songs (""All By Myself"") between slugs of vodka alone in her apartment has not managed to find someone who would like to be her boyfriend.  What a surprise.   We are supposed to perceive of 30-something Bridget Jones (Renee Z.) as a sympathetic character; (the audiences are predominantly female, and presumably are commiserating).  What I saw instead was a foul mouthed lout and obtuse loser who, despite promises to the eponymous diary, made no real effort to address the deficiencies she herself fully recognized.   Working at a publishing house in London, she responds to the lewd e-mailed suggestions of her boss, played by Hugh Grant (the caddish snake with a proper British accent is a slight variation on his usual character, but one he does well).  Although she seems to know he is up to no good, she happily proceeds, merely setting herself up for humiliation and disappointment (the two common occurrences which provide the ""humor"" of this movie).  The alternative with whom she is presented is a stodgy (divorced) lawyer whom she ostensibly knew as a child, but seems to have been raised in a manor house on an estate some distance away, contradicting a central theme of the story, which is that (according to her mother who is trying to set them up) she romped naked as a four year old in his wading pool (he was eight at the time).   The representation of middle class life in London for a young single person is interesting, as it was in ""Notting Hill"", but it was also noteworthy that the two significant incidences of potential calamity had their origins in ""New York"" (interestingly the home office not only of her publishing firm, but of the lawyer's firm as well).   Most people have some vices, bad habits or other imperfections.  Bridget has these, but precious little else.  Her troubles are those caused solely by herself and her actions (or inactions).  The story laboriously drags itself to its clearly telegraphed ""happy"" conclusion, but we are left wondering, why?     Midway through the movie, after cataloging a list of faults, the lawyer and potential suiter somewhat inexplicably states ""... but I like you"". That's more than I can say for Bridget, or the movie.  If your girlfriend (or date) insists, then go, but otherwise stay away!",Bridget Jones's Diary
150,Paddy-49,Renee stars in a funny and entertaining film,8,27 December 2007,"A delightful film which accurately and skilfully adapts Helen Fielding's unusual novel for the screen. Key to the film's success is Renee Zellweger who is truly outstanding as Bridget. I expect that a few eyebrows were raised when an American actress got the part of the quintessentially English heroine  but Ms Zellweger delivers a performance of such authenticity that you soon forget her Texan roots. It is not just her accent (accurate though that is) but she IS the epitome of a thirty-something English girl of modern times. She is Bridget Jones.As with most movies in which Richard Curtis is involved below the surface of the very funny script there are some quite serious undercurrents running. These include the fact that groups of friends are a source of strength when times are difficult. We saw this in ""Four Weddings"" and ""Notting Hill"" and we see it again here. Indeed some of the best moments involve Bridget's support group with James Callis particularly good as the gay faded pop star.Hugh Grant and Colin Firth bring to life the very different characters of Daniel Cleaver and Mark Darcy and there is a delightful cameo by James Faulkner as the predatory Uncle Geoffrey. But the best supporting performance is Jim Broadbent who believably portrays Bridget's father coping with the mid life crisis of his rather barmy wife.The soundtrack is also good  worth buying the album.",Bridget Jones's Diary

A good person, suffering from a lack of self esteem, suddenly experiences the elation that new love (or just hot sex) grants a formerly lonely soul. Along the way, she looses love, gains love, looses love again, has misunderstandings, work conflicts, dealings with creepy old co-workers, (the nickname ""Tits-Pervert"" is fantastic!) it's all happened to every last one of us, woman or man, at one point in our lives.

Frankly, I knew beforehand that I was probably not going to be thrilled with the Bridget Jones' movies; however, my fixation on Colin Firth's career since I saw him in ""Pride and Prejudice"" finally overcame my good sense. I rented both movies.Amazingly, from the beginning, I was utterly stupefied to hear the amount of foul ""F"" words come out of some of the characters mouths. I couldn't really believe how many situations they felt that word needed to be used  one character used it repeatedly when she talked and it was actually supposed to be FUNNY! Among this, we are supposed to find a plot in the fact that this supreme klutz with her horrible taste in clothes is trying to find true love between two different men  or between two different sets of bed sheets. Bridgett does one mistake after another and can't seem to keep her goal on anything.The viewers are supposed to believe that while she is having rampant kinky sex with Hugh Grant, the ""real"" love of her life, Colin Firth, is watching with longing from a distance. He has issues with the Hugh Grant character that are not revealed until the end, even though all the evidence is very clear that Grant is the one in the wrong. After all, Bridgett, look what he did to you.In the meantime, we are supposed to swallow the fact that Firth's character is still crazy about Bridget and forget the fact that  out of the celluloid  a normal man would probably think twice or more about getting involved with a woman  any woman  who was sexually involved with the man who broke up his marriage. Very neat, huh? And oh, so romantic, that this is not even mentioned. Yeah, right! Ask any jealous husband or wife in the same situation.If England thinks this type of movie  with the ending line by Firth's character, which not surprising includes one last offensive ""F"" word remark  is romantic, then no wonder their divorce and illegitimate children rates are up! There are two other points that have to be addressed when discussing this first Bridget Jones movie. I heard that the writer watched ""Pride and Prejudice"" and modeled Colin Firth's character from the ""Mr. Darcy"" character he portrayed in the P&P movie. I wonder what hallucinogenic drugs she was on while watching the A&E production? Another item I heard was that using Renée Zellweger as Bridget Jones was in essence like using Vivian Leigh as Scarlet O'Hara. Yeah, right.

She is a regular person; who has not put their foot in their mouth from time to time? Or did something totally embarrassing? Everyone should be able to relate to her.Her character is non-pretentious which is part of her appeal. Bridget is fun loving, genuine, honest and funny.

156,IridescentTranquility,"Not quite the book, but as good as",9,25 November 2005,"It pains me to admit, as a huge fan of Pride and Prejudice, that - in spite of reading Bridget Jones's Diary numerous times and repeated viewings of the film - I didn't actually notice that the storyline was based on Jane Austen's famous novel. Even before I realised this, and perhaps more so now that I have, I love this film.I heard that - while getting into character for Bridget - Renee Zellweger worked undercover at a publishers in Britain without anyone realising that she was in fact American, and having watched Bridget Jones's Diary I can completely understand why. If I didn't know it, I would certainly never have said she was an American. There are a lot of subtle bits in this film that I like, as well as some of the less subtle bits. Look carefully at any scene in Bridget's flat and you'll see what I mean. Cans of Sprite, videos and packets of Silk Cut are dotted all over the living room. There is stuff all over her bathroom, which does make a big impact in one particular scene where she sits in the bath crying and the camera zooms out so that we see that she has hung her tights up to dry on the shower curtain rail above her. There's something about this very subtle scene that seems to express all the sadness she is feeling at the time. As someone who - like Bridget - is always trying to look elegant (or even - dare I say it? - glamorous) and never seems to quite pull it off, I really appreciate those bits of the film where she tries to look good - dressed up in the manner of a Grace Kelly-type film star as she leaves for a mini-break - and ends up looking like she's been dragged through a hedge backwards. The see-through top scene is classic, and I love the very brief shot where she's off to a book launch and we see her trying to rearrange her granny knickers as she walks. Although, like most people, I cringe for Bridget when she arrives in costume at her parents' friends' home expecting a Tarts and Vicars party that never really happens, what I really love about this bit is when Bridget and her dad are sharing a cigarette together. It says so much about their relationship with Mrs. Jones, Bridget's mum, and really reminded me of times when my friends decided to take up smoking as teenagers but always did it in places where their parents wouldn't catch them.Something I like about the love interest aspect of the film is again to do with the subtlety of how it begins. Just a look between Mark and Daniel is enough to indicate their hatred for each other. Daniel's character is very much like Wickham in Pride and Prejudice - there are hints that he is not what he seems right from the start - but Bridget, like Elizabeth Bennet, quite naturally misses them.",Bridget Jones's Diary

158,Jose E,"Excellent and hilarious, with Renee Zellweger at her best",10,20 July 2001,"Bridget Jones would not be as good were it not for the great Renee Zellweger. I am not dismissing the film (I liked it a lot), only saying that Renee's wonderful performance is absolutely the best. Her expressions are priceless. As a matter of fact I 'discovered' her in Nurse Betty (Another masterpiece), where she shone as well, and here she hasn't let her standards slip. Excellent job Renee!Warning! - Little spoilers.Aside from Renee's awesome performance, Bridget Jones' Diary harks back to the typical (And sadly not too frequent) English humour, also featured in movies like Four Weddings And A Funeral, unfairly overlooked by the way. Here Hugh Grant plays a selfish jerk who is Bridget's boss and also her lover, until she can take no more abuse from him and dumps him on the spot. Colin Flirt (Hadn't heard of him before) is a sullen and grim ex neighbour from Renee's childhood who will eventually get her love.The film is full of comic situations and wacky and hysterical lines. Probably the funniest scene is that of Renee's butt descending by firemen's pole broadcast live on the news.What I did not get is why British press reacted negatively when Renee Zellweger was chosen to play Bridget Jones. As far as I am concerned there's not any other actress who can beat her now. How they could ever think the fact of being from the US would prevent her from playing a good role? If they have seen the film I hope they have realised how wrong they were.To sum up, an extraordinary, funny and intelligent movie. If Hollywood ignores this movie and doesn't nominate it for next year's Awards the little credibility they still have will fade away, not to go back.

Me being 29, never married, always unhappy with my weight, and most of all...the grandma underwear! I thought I was the only female who wore those! This movie was so cute and absolutely hilarious. Me and my sister laughed non-stop throughout the whole movie. Renee Zellweger was quite impressive as Bridget. The butt scene from the fire station is still going through my mind 2 hours after the film ended, and I'm still laughing.I cannot wait for this movie to come out on video. 9/10!",Bridget Jones's Diary

Based on Jane Austin's Pride and Prejudice, this one alters some of the situations and characters without changing the central theme or the outcome at all!My only complaint is that, after seeing Colin Firth in a wet shirt in Pride and Prejudice, I would MUCH rather have seen HIM again in a wet shirt, (idea:  the Green Gunge explodes all over Mark Darcy's nice white shirt, AHHH, the possibilities), than Hugh Grant.The final 10 minuets of the film are worth the price of admission and/ or the price of the terrific DVD and it's marvelous documentary on how the film got made.The director's comment track is priceless as she practically drools when she says, ""Oh, Collin is SO sexy here...!""Rene Zellwegger (sp), is a warm, vulnerable, believable Bridget, and the always fabulous Gemma Jones and Jim Broadbent make charming and fey parents.Hugh Grant is a fine Mr. Wickens character, full of insincerity and sexual aggression.Love Bridget's mad dash after Mr. Darcy, through the snow not quite dressed but determined not to flub-up again!",Bridget Jones's Diary
162,Mr.Uxo,British Comedy Rules,9,21 April 2001,"Bridget Jones' Diary is a hilarious look at life for a single, professional woman, played by Renee Zellweger, who has no luck when it comes to men. The movie is very funny and I'm sure we can all (males and females alike) relate to being in Jones' situation one time or another. Excellent supporting roles, most notably that of Jones' boss played by Hugh Grant who gives an A+ performance as a ""sex-starved, power-hungry pig"".  Colin Firth, who plays Jones' complete opposite, is funny in a very proper ""English"" way. I gave this film a 9 out of 10 stars. Enjoy!",Bridget Jones's Diary
163,GrammarMatters,I won't watch this,3,4 October 2020,I started to watch this today (after seeing it at least once years ago) - but I refuse to invest my time in a movie with people smoking.It's time for movie producers and directors to get it through their thick heads that smoking is a disgusting repulsive drug addiction and anybody involved in the production of a movie should expect that the majority of people who don't smoke are not going to enjoy exposing themselves to this noxious habit.And it bugs me that the lead actress mutilated her face with plastic surgery so that she is unrecognizeable.,Bridget Jones's Diary
164,hprill,Between oddball and screwball: near-perfect comedy,9,30 July 2001,"Romantic comedies seem to have a hard time in reviews, they don't seem to get the truly high ratings other types of movies get. Perhaps this is because they are slightly predictable and generally wearing a bit thin.Not so this one. Helen Fielding, who wrote the bestselling novel 'Bridget Jones's Diary' also co-wrote the screenplay and co-produced this film, which was probably a good thing. Instead of standardized, stereotyped U.S. romantic comedy stuff, we get some truly wacky British humour, somewhere between oddball and screwball, but never in bad taste (the elk sweater early on is as bad as it gets ;-) ).Considering the number of copies Fielding's book has sold, the plot probably needs little comment. Bridget Jones, age 32, tries to find a man for fear that she may die a spinster and be eaten by alsatians.Great acting from Renée Zellweger, who manages to portray Bridget as clumsy, chaotic, but also as very likeable and believable. Despite the fact that there were many traps for overacting, she managed brilliantly to come across as a person rather than a caricature. Kudos.Hugh Grant was finally cast in the perfect role. This is so much better than the type of character he usually plays. I don't think he's a great actor or particularly good in this film, but this role was just so perfect.Colin Firth as the other possible love interest seemed very distanced and strangely cold -- that's okay considering his role, but I felt he should have thawed a bit more towards the end.Of the remaining cast, Jim Broadbent stood out in a brief, yet remarkable performance as Bridget's father.All in all, one of the better comedies this year. Usually I'd give it an 8, but this has a serious acting bonus for a great ensemble who seemed to have enjoyed themselves, so I'll give it a 9.",Bridget Jones's Diary
165,NJtoTX,How Disappointing,4,1 December 2001,"I thought that after all the good words I'd heard about BJD, it would be a safe-bet rental. I was wrong. This was a first for me; my first DVD in which I had no desire to check out any of the extras on the disk. Indeed, I found myself calculating the remaining time during the last half of the film.Renee Zelwegger was fine, but the role was demeaning and sitcom-like.(spoiler) Typical is when she arrives at what she believes will be a costume party, only to find everyone dressed. Not only does everyone look at her with their noses in the air (curious, since they were all told last minute that the 'tarts' theme was off), she does not explain, and does not pull off the bunny head and tail.Colin Firth is supposedly the good guy, the one we want her to end up with, but he goes around pouting and angry and miserable and bitter through most of the film. Really endearing.Hugh Grant is good, but (spoler2) his betrayal of her is so formulaic. Yawn. The fistfight scene with Firth is embarrassingly bad and could have been written by any 1st year film student.Is this what we've come to? This is what's passing as great entertainment? I should have known better. I ignored my own rule: ""Any film showing up on multiple shelves at Blockbuster can't be any good."" 3.5/10",Bridget Jones's Diary

Iam in love with you,7,10 September 2007,"Have you seen how Renee can master the British accent, she was just terrific, I am telling you, ain't no body can do that except a very few very talented actors and actresses like Kate Winslet and Johnny Depp and Cate Blanchett.I don't know if she deserved or did not deserve the Oscar nomination but with the extra pounds of weight gained and the adorable accent and the absolutely amazing performance something should've happened.The rest of the cast made the movie very funny and the fight scene, oh my god it was hilarious, and we were out of control.I am afraid that I have nothing to say but this, Bridget Jones.. I am in love with you, thank you very mush.",Bridget Jones's Diary
167,jennifer_litchfield,Star rating: 4 out of 5,7,27 December 2002,"Bridget Jones's Diary is a surprisingly good movie.  Detractors who deride it for its admittedly minimalist plot miss the point - this is a film that shows life without the layers of artificiality favoured by directors (resulting in movies somehow removed from the realm of the everyday in which us mere mortals dwell).  Life is frequently aimless and trivial; and therein lies the movie's attraction.  Notwithstanding of course that this is a very funny and highly original comedy.
Bridget (played with considerable aplomb by Renee Zellweger) belongs to the ranks of that modern phenomenon - the over-30, unmarried career woman. Just when it seems Bridget may be destined for terminal spinster-hood, two opposing forces enter her life - charming cad Daniel, and uptight (but very sexy) lawyer Mark.  Which of the two is her Mr. Right?  And why does everyone insist on asking that question detested by all singletons - ""How's your love life going?""  The movie's conclusion is predictable, and although any other ending would leave the audience feeling cheated, it does seem somewhat tame and ultimately unsatisfying.
The film encourages the viewer both to get involved with Bridget emotionally and to laugh at her at the same time.  Perhaps the best joke is the milieu inhabited by her parents - where the mini-gherkin is the height of sophistication, and 60-year-olds throw garden parties with such alarming themes as 'tarts and vicars'.  Bridget is certainly no social butterfly, and whilst we cringe at her public embarrassments (notably her TV report involving a fireman's pole and a bottom the size of Brazil), we triumph with her when she manages to turn a bad situation to her advantage.  Maybe we can recognise a little bit of Bridget Jones in all of us.",Bridget Jones's Diary
168,MeloDee,A delightful romantic comedy.,8,25 January 2007,"I really didn't know what to expect when I tuned into Bridget Jone's Diary on ABC Family.Though when I saw the very first scene, which features Bridget lip-synching hilariously to a depressing love song whilst watching an equally depressing movie on her television, I figured that it couldn't be that bad.I was right.Of course, for this to be a really good review, I would have to address the things I learned about the movie after watching it. I learned that some see in it a totally adorable woman they can relate to, and others see sexist trash.To say that Bridget isn't a terribly desperate single gal would be a total understatement. As a result, I must warn those of you females who feel that the portrayal of any such female- who, I MUST remind you still actually exist- is a jab at your independent womanhood, to stay out of this one.Although the plot in this movie can sometimes be a little predictable, Bridget is not. You never really know what is going to come out of the woman's mouth at any time- and neither does she, which adds to the entertainment.Additionally, the story is not entirely about Bridget Jones. A decidedly tongue-in-cheek side story involving her dysfunctional parents is present as well.I loved the performance of the actors in this movie. First of all, Renee Zellweger, of course, and second of all Hugh Grant, as he seemed perfect for the charming-yet-decidedly-perverse Daniel Cleaver.I certainly think that this movie is worth giving a chance to.",Bridget Jones's Diary
169,Aphex97,Kind of fun but hard for me to relate,6,30 May 2001,"Another movie I was drug to by my girlfriend. I went into the picture with no expectations. What I saw was a silly little romantic comedy. Though don't get me wrong, the film was not without its charm. Other users wrote that this movie captured the singleton life at 30 dead on. It is hard for me to relate since I am a bit out of the target range being a young committed male in my 20s. However, I did enjoy several of the film's funnier moments. After it was over, I was generally pleased with the film.Its faults (like so many romantic comedies) lie in the completely predictable plot (I mean this one was super-predictable!) and the mega-cheesy and ultra-predictable ending. The merits of this film are the wonderful performances of Renee Zellweger and Hugh Grant. Zellweger's bumbling Bridget provides most of the genuine laughs of the movie. The film did provide good characterization of the Bridget character; we are left caring about her at the end.I was pleased to see Hugh Grant in the role of sleazebag for a change. He plays it with comedic style. His behavior in the movie provides the rest of the genuine laughs. This is the best role I've ever seen him in as he really makes the movie funny.  FINAL RATING: 6/10 A good genre film. Fans of romantic comedies will no doubt love it. Other movie fans should be able to find something enjoyable about it. A good way to pass a Sunday afternoon.",Bridget Jones's Diary
170,cottrellpj,"Good Performances, Middling Direction",7,13 April 2001,"The good stuff:Renee Z: Pitch perfect as Bridget. A performance without ego, winning every moment she's on-screen (in other words, the whole movie).Hugh Grant: His best role for years. Not the stuttering, bumbling sweetie, but a deliciously slimy cad.Colin Firth: My wife finally sees why women are nuts about him. Wonderful counterpoint to Grant, their jousting was fun and provided some nice edginess.And now the problems...the movie lost it about the halfway mark. The ""diary"" structure which worked so well for the first section was abandoned altogether and it became a more ""conventional"" romantic comedy. Also, England was shown as either dusted with snow or in bright sunshine (where's the rain, lads?) everyone (except Bridget) has homes worthy of millionaires and the ""supporting friends"" roles (well written by Richard Curtis in 4 Weddings and Notting Hill) are woefully sketchy and incomplete. The fight between Grant and Firth is ludicrous and out of place.
So, I was looking for at least a 9 (after half an hour) but in the end 7/10 will about do it. Bring Renee back to London for ""The Edge of Reason"", please!",Bridget Jones's Diary
171,b-a-h TNT-6,"Not bad, but not very good either",6,24 April 2001,"The reason why I was not disappointed about this movie is that I didn't have many expectations. Yes, it's funny in a couple of scenes, but nothing better than your average sex/sentimentality ""chick"" flick. I didn't read the book and I still don't think it's one of my priorities but as the story was presented, I wonder who wasn't already prepared to see Bridget disappointed with one guy and switch to the other, only apparently less likeable one. Good acting performances make me slightly raise the rating, but just like many other movies, ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" is definitely not worth the hype.6/10",Bridget Jones's Diary
172,Bernie-56,Pride and Prejudice II,6,8 January 2002,"Hugh Grant and Colin Firth reprise ""Pride and Prejudice"" in modern dress. Heavens, Firth's character is even called Darcy!  Well, at least he didn't have to rehearse his expression or learn a new character. And he still gets the girl by playing the serious, brooding type. For all that, ""Diary"" is a lightweight, pleasant but improbable diversion. Not hard to see how how Zellweger's character got to 32 without getting married. Not real bright, no interests, no talent for anything much other than feeling sorry for herself. Felt like screaming 'get a life, you dozy cow'. Her best feature: voluptuous figure, even if a little on the short side (similar build to Marilyn Monroe).",Bridget Jones's Diary
173,gabridl,Broken Wing Attracts Male Every Time,3,27 April 2001,"I went into this movie expecting to find a sad and funny tale of loneliness. What I got was an atavistic lecture in antediluvian sexism. Never mind if a woman is slovenly, overweight, smokes, drinks, and totally inept: all that matters is that if she appears pathetic enough, and speaks like a sex kitten, she will snare The Right Man (older, richer, smarter, and higher class) who will then Fix Everything. The last scene says it all: Bridget in Underwear in Snow Embraced by Protector. Please. As for men who do not fit the perfect mold, well, they're Losers and don't deserve sex. And as for attractive, competent women, well, they're ""Stick Insect"" castrating witches.This movie displays a reversion to sexual politics as crude and pathetic as anything I've seen post-feminism. Its myopism is the funniest thing about it. Bridget can hardly see that she is imitating perfectly her mother's choices and is headed for exactly the same misery. Maybe that is the film's subtle message, but I won't give it the credit of being that intelligent. Too bad, because the cast are all fine actors.",Bridget Jones's Diary

Renée Zellweger is fine as Bridget, in a variation of her recent character sketches.  and Colin Firth convinces as a halting, up-tight barrister.But the directing is sloppy, there are a few problems with continuity, and it is painful and embarrassing to sit through the sappy pop music used to portray the characters' feelings.  This becomes a bad version of soap opera or MTV.",Bridget Jones's Diary
175,homer_simpson91,"Funny, original movie with great acting",8,24 October 2001,"There are many things that make this a great movie, but probably the biggest of them all is the acting. Colin Firth and Hugh Grant appear to be perfect for their respective roles, and they do a great job. But Renée Zellweger shines and gives one of the two best female performances of the year (along with Julianne Moore of HANNIBAL (9/10)). This movie is especially great because it gives us a female lead that isn't a gorgeous supermodel and has her share of flaws, but we still love her. Renée Zellweger played the role perfectly.This is also one of the more original films this year. It also is not too predictable. At times it is predictable, but until later in the movie, I honestly did not know which of the two men she would choose from. The movie is also very funny, as I laughed out loud more than one time during this movie. (Which is more than I can say about the ""comedy"" ZOOLANDER (3/10))Highly recommended.

Renee Zellweger was absolutely wonderful in this movie. Her English accent was dead on the target. In fact, I saw the movie with some friends from the U.K., and they complimented her endlessly on her performance. Hugh Grant and Colin Firth were ideal as Bridget's love interests.

179,qrt7,Fair romantic comedy,6,11 June 2001,"This is nice little film about an insecure (well neurotic) woman and her life for one year.The film has its moments, especially the fight scene between Grant and Firth - quite clever to get the two biggest Brit-flick heartthrobs to slug it out on a film, high irony that.  Contrary to a lot of opinion, I thought Zellweger handled the part reasonably well.  However I do agree with the opnion that she probably wouldn't have had THAT much trouble with men given the way Zellweger looks...and no-one is fooled that Jones is a bit flabby by squeezing Zellweger into a Bunny suit that is blatantly a size too small for her.A big up for Sally 'F***ing Shazzer' Phillips though, a good talent that needs more scope.Overall I found the film a bit plodding and rather predictable, but blokes can watch this and quite enjoy it - although it only really 'works' I fear, for female neurotics.6/10",Bridget Jones's Diary

181,Julie-30,Loved it!!!!,9,29 April 2001,"I've read the book more than once, and was a little leery of the film, but those fears were completely unfounded.  This movie was truly one of the funniest I've seen in a long time.I know that some feminists don't like this character, but they just don't seem to get it. I am a woman of a certain age and, while I can't say I know anyone who is exactly like Bridget, I can say that every woman I know has some elements of Bridget in her.  Whether or not the anti-Bridget factions like to admit it, women have always obsessed about their weight, or about men, or about their parents, or whatever.  What the people who snub their noses at this book/movie fail to see is that Mark Darcy has his own neuroses.  This is a man whose mother who shows a dubious taste in Christmas gifts (but he loves her enough to wear them in public), a man whose wife had an affair with his best friend (but is too much of a gentleman to discuss it), a man who wants to have fun but who isn't really sure just how.  Hence his attraction to Bridget.  But since the story is told from Bridget's point of view, we dwell on her problems, not Mark's.  Bridget is Everywoman, and Renee Zellwegger turns in a stellar performance in this role.Colin Firth, who was a fine Fitzwilliam Darcy in the 1995 version of Pride & Prejudice, is, in my humble opinion, even better as Mark Darcy in this modern twist on the Austen novel.  Hugh Grant should stick with playing cads and forget about the stammering leading man he has played once too often. He is wonderful as the Wickham-like character who has no scruples about taking what he wants, regardless of the consequences.Gemma Jones and Jim Broadbent are terrific as Brigdet's parents.  Jones is delightful as the ditzy mother who goes off to ""find herself,"" only to discover that her real happiness lies at home.  I would have liked to have seen more of Broadbent, but it was not to be, unfortunately.From what I gather, the closing credits seen in Europe are different from those seen in North America.  While Europeans get to see interviews with Bridget's family and friends, we North Americans get to see home movies of Mark's 8th birthday party. Not surprisingly, Bridget is the life of the party; she stuffs cake into her mouth and strips down before jumping into the paddling pool while Mark sits quietly and watches.  I can only hope the DVD has both endings. I've seen the film twice, and I have to say I managed to laugh even harder the second time.  My advice to the naysayers?  Lighten up.  This movie is FUN.",Bridget Jones's Diary
182,Julie-30,v.v.g.,9,22 April 2001,"Yesterday, I saw it for the second time, and it was just as delightful as it was the first time.  In fact, I may have laughed harder because I was able to catch things I had missed the first time.  Renee Zellwegger was great, Colin Firth was (sigh) wonderful, Hugh Grant was a brilliant cad, Gemma Jones and Jim Broadbent were terrific... I could go on forever.  True, it doesn't follow the book exactly, but the departures worked for me.  ""Pride & Prejudice"" is one of my favorite books, and BJD does for P&P what ""Clueless"" did for ""Emma"" and ""Metropolitan"" did for ""Mansfield Park.""  It's a modernization that shows respect for the original.I'll probably see it a couple of more times before the DVD comes out.  Does anyone know when this is scheduled?",Bridget Jones's Diary

There are too many funny moments to pick one out, although the knicker scene is destined to become a classic. The whole cinema was laughing at the misadventures of this 32 year old single female trying to have a life despite everyone else. In the end she finds happiness with the right man, of course. The journey there is in parts touching but the story is always told with humour. Anyone who said that a Texan could not play a sometimes dowdy Englishwoman had not allowed for the tour-de-force performance by Zellweger, any doubts about her acting ability, in some quarters are definitely laid to rest here.

185,Bob A-2,A bit too much cynicism passing for humor,6,26 June 2004,"Saw Bridget Jones's Diary last night. Audience liked it, I must admit, but for me it was nasty and obnoxious. The fact that she's cynical is automatically inferred to mean she's funny. In the first five minutes she's put down her mother for serving pickles on toothpicks as hors d'oeuvre, a potential boyfriend for wearing a funny reindeer sweater at a Christmas party, and a gay man simply because women have some unquestionable God-given right to do so. The unintentional irony is that, for all Bridget's self-alleged independence, the picture's central, driving purpose is to attach her to a wealthy, influential man, at which point her story will end -- in marriage. Ultimately nothing better than a throwback to most of the Julie Andrews musicals (My Fair Lady, Cinderella, Sound of Music, Thoroughly Modern Millie) of ancient times -- minus the songs. The other irony is, even Julie's material has grown beyond such a shallow self-image for modern women.Snowflakes at the end looked fake in close-ups.",Bridget Jones's Diary
186,marz1966,"an unexpected gem...(some spoilers,mates.)",10,4 November 2001,"Ok. I will be the first person to admit that I really didn't expect much from this film. In Fact, I did all what I could to get out of seeing it.(Faking colds,financially challenged,I have an impending surgery..etc.) But I must thank my wife for her tenaciousness and curse the creators of the video tapes..With a big all encompassing grin on her face and video in hand, I knew the jig was up,as it were..... Well,from the beginning,this wonderfully enchanting film had me. Renee Zellweger's Bridget is a happy go lucky single woman in her early thrities who is in search of true love(hoping to avoid all the ""commitment phobic"" blokes that she often falls for)and a slimmer waist line. I immediately fell in love with Renee's almost flawless performance in this picture. She,at least to me,took control of this character and breathed life into it. She made me care for Bridget as if she was one of my own friends,who was going through life's ups and constant downs. This is an oscar worthy performance by Zellweger.It seemed like it was tailor made for her. Written by Helen Fielding,Andrew Davies,and Richard Curtis(who wrote some stuff for Mr.Bean as well as the movie)this movie takes through the times and trials of Bridget Jones.All involved in this picture did a splendid job. Colin Firth, who sometimes plays a bit of jerk in films,does a great job playing the rather stiff but honorable,Mark Darcy...The movie,at first,makes him out to be rather a snotty sonofagun,but as it progresses,we see that's not the case. Hugh Grant,plays Bridget's wolf in sheep's clothing,boss,Daniel Cleaver. He is very effective as this womanizer that gets his claws into our dear Bridget,but fear not....all turns out well in the end. This movie was a real unexpected gem. It's not just a ""chick flick"".It's about accepting yourself and others.About making changes in your life,for yourself,and not for anyone else.Having good friends who love you,just as you are.

188,Rimmer-10,Renee steals the show,9,13 August 2001,"Bridget Jones's Diary is one of the best comedies I've ever seen. Why? I assume it's because every character is so relatable - none of them are cartoonish - maybe a bit clicheed (especially Hugh Grants character) but still they're so human that most of them resemble somebody you know if not yourself.The love affair between Bridgets mother and this TV shop host is  hilarious to say the least - but still there is a human angle on the whole thing. There's a wonderful scene when the mother returns to the father hoping for forgiveness. It's film making at its best.But the real gem in this movie is off course Renee Zellweger - she's just perfectly cast as the vulnerable and unconfident Bridget Jones. You can't help sympatizing a lot with her character - she's so genuine, so sweet, so real - so fantastic. I cannot imagine one single other actress that could have been better in this role. And you can bring them all: Julia Roberts, Meg Ryan, Cameron Diaz, etc. etc..

190,stevenleadbetter,Easy. Let's just print another one.,7,4 November 2001,"I was a bit late picking this one up. Still, it seemed worth viewing late, rather than not at all. Renee Zellweger, Hugh Grant and Colin Firth star in this not overly complicated love triangle story. Bridget is infatuated by her boss, who becomes more interested in her the more weight she loses and the more unattainable she becomes. Firth, in the role of Darcy (no, not his role in P&P) is the third person in the triangle. Some of the lines are genuinly funny. Zellweger's character as famed by the book that preceded the film is excellent, as are her co-stars efforts. The supporting cast is at best one-dimensional which is unfortunate. This is down, I feel, to the constricts of time, rather than of ability. Nicely paced and an uncomplicated story are always a boost for a mass audience appeal, which this has in spades. Think Four Weddings & A Funeral' meets Notting Hill' and you are in the right area. Not a classic by any stretch but follows a successful and pre-determined route to box-office millions.

I kept looking at the clock wondering when it was going to get interesting. I thought I would love this film, being a 20 something woman, but it bored me to tears. The only good thing I can say about this movie is that the marketing was wonderful.  How else would you get sooo many people to actually think they like this rubbish? I would have rather watched paint dry, it would undoubtedly be more interesting.",Bridget Jones's Diary
193,crazychap,Brilliant film!,8,24 May 2005,"Bridget Jones is not only one of the best date films of all time, it-s a work of art. To tell you the truth, it's better than most of the chick flicks I often watch with my girlfriend. I've read the book so I know the plot {again, many scenes have been omitted and others, like the fight scene, added in to give the movie some feel}.The movie is about a modern-day young woman living in London... actually, about a woman in her early 30s... with no serious relationship, unmarried, overweight-- her weight often resembles that of a man's--, and someone who simply spits out whatever she thinks about, regardless of the consequences. But this year is the year in which she finally experiences love, and also ends up in a dilemma: She must chose between her charming boss {superb performance by Hugh Grant}, and the far more reserved barrister Mark Darcy {Colin Firth give an equally great performance}.Although I'm disappointed by the fact that many scenes have been omitted from the book-- those who didn't read the book I shan't reveal them--, This is nevertheless a movie with a great plot, performances and charm.All of the three leads steal the show in his/her own way. Zellweger--being an American-- seemed an unlikely bird to play a typically British character, but She makes it very believable that those who never heard-- I knew from watching JERRY MAGUIRE years before-- of her thought she was a Brit herself. I couldn't imagine anyone playing Bridget, not even Winslet, who was one of the leading bets-- who almost got the part but was dropped because she was too young, 24 at the time, for the role--. Hugh Grant gives charisma to the naughty Daniel Cleaver, and sidesteps his usual characters. Colin Firth gives a comeback to familiar ground-- I remember watching PRIDE and PREJUDICE in 1995, in which he became a star in the UK-- as the solicitor Mark Darcy with no problems at all.For anyone who plans to strike a relationship or is in one already, this a perfect film to put and it is More than just a ""date movie"" or ""chick flick"". TO end it, it is by far one of my favourite films that is amusing all the way.",Bridget Jones's Diary
194,Spod-3,Is this the Notting Hill for 2001?,8,18 June 2001,"Another sweet-but-painful film labelled as comedy by the marketers, in the style of British films which started with Four Weddings and a Funeral and has continued quite nicely ever since. This is by no means as good as the best of them, but is quite watchable, and shows that Renee, like Gwynneth can do a credible British accent. Its funny how the real actress now resembles what her character calls a 'stick insect', which only shows she didnt take any hints from the screenplay. All the British leads are terrific, of course, and it makes for a experience that this male thought was eminently worthwhile.",Bridget Jones's Diary
195,kaylenns,"Oh, this is so much fun!!",8,4 February 2002,"I watched this movie unwillingly--a friend encouraged me to see it, since I thought it was just going to be a sex-diary sort of movie. As a fan of Zellweger's from ""Nurse Betty,"" I really enjoyed seeing her in this film. She looked like a ""normal"" woman, and the humor was wonderfully down-to-earth. I've never been a fan of Grant's, but I was happy to finally seeing him playing the greasy playboy I've always thought he was, and happy that he DIDN'T get the girl! (Drove me nuts that he kept playing stuttering nice guys in all these period movies, getting all dressed up and looking innocently lost. Gag.) But the guy who DID get the girl... ""Ummm,"" I thought (since I was unable to really get out a coherent thought :), ""Who IS this guy?!"" He gets the girl in this movie opposite two well-known movie stars, and I've never heard of him before!? So I wandered over to the IMDb and discovered Colin Firth (and ""Pride and Prejudice""! WATCH THIS MOVIE!! :), and have never been the same since. :) People wrote articles asking the question: ""Grant or Firth?"" and I snort. Firth, of course. Hands-down. No competition, and there never was. Grant is just an overly-confident British guy with a posh accent. Firth...is worth admiring. The final sequence of the film with him in that great coat and turtleneck and look oh so...um... Anyway, that whole sequence makes up for all of the grating you have to endure for Bridget's sake to get through the Grant parts to the really good parts at the end of film, when Grant's character is finally out of the picture.In any case, all three actors (and the supporting cast) do a really wonderful job with this movie. You will laugh--guys AND girls--and not mind watching it again. I've never before seen a fight scene like the one this movie has. Downsides: a lot of obscenities. Otherwise, though, this is a really fun movie. And you have to appreciate the whole ""Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy"" background to understand how truly ironic and wickedly funny this movie actually is. There is a whole subculture in the female English-speaking world surrounding Mr. Firth, and this film capitalizes (and is actually partially based on) this subculture. Bridget Jones is the embodiment of 30-something unmarried females who love watching ""Pride and Prejudice."" :) Enjoy!",Bridget Jones's Diary

I just thought the film a bit on the silly side, and many situations were contrived.  It could have been a comedy with some depth to it, but there were too many stock Hollywood sequences like a fight breaking out with the restaurant windows breaking and cliches like that.  The music didn't fit well, it seemed too obvious that they were trying to sell the soundtrack. (I know, what else is new?)  The Pride and Prejudice parallel is really thin, see the BBC Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth if you want to see the real thing.",Bridget Jones's Diary
198,Kiwi-7,"Disappointing, really...",6,15 August 2001,"I think I must have different contact lenses from the other people who've commented on this film.  Either that, or I saw a different film.                      ***SPOILERS AHEAD***First of all, I have to say that I found this a mildly amusing film with some good moments that made me laugh out loud.  I also have to agree that Renee Zellweger does a fantastic job playing Bridget Jones:  she's plain, gawky, funny, warm, sincere, and a real twit all at the same time.  That said, I confess it took me a little while to warm to her character, partly because Bridget is such a twit.  I mean, she's 32 years old and she doesn't have a clue how to fix a meal for friends?  She automatically assumes that first-date sex is inevitable even before a relationship begins (hence the underwear angst)?  She cannot string two words together without babbling?I guess the thing that bothers me the most about this film, though, and people's glowing reactions to it, is wondering what Bridget and Mark are going to talk about from now on.  I mean, he's a top barrister with education, money, social standing, and a variety of interests, humanitarian and otherwise.  Bridget, on the other hand, seems to have no interests, other than drinking, smoking, feeling sorry for herself, and catching a man. She's not intelligent, well-educated, committed to anything, or even with the prospect of being a viable, supporting housewife.  At least with Daniel, cad though he clearly is, [I muse cynically here] she had fun--and so did Daniel.  Fun and Darcy don't actually go in the same sentence! In the end, I thought she ended up with the wrong man.I walked out of the movie theater a bit disappointed.  I'd heard lots of good things about this film, and although it has some good moments and some funny lines, and Zellweger's acting is commendable, I thought the film just didn't live up to expectations.",Bridget Jones's Diary
199,m_finebesser,Offbeat fun,8,3 August 2001,"Renee Zellweger's accent is uneven, but the rest of this enjoyable what's-a-gal-to-do comedy is spot on.

200,kwongers,"Delightful, witty, and sexy  a TRIUMPH!",10,10 February 2004,"As a huge fan of the books, I had incredibly high expectations of the movie. In order for the movie to work for me, it had to capture Bridget's plucky-heroine character and the hilarious-poignant emotions that are in the book.  Needless to say, `Bridget Jones's Diary' the movie worked very, very, very well.  Although Helen Fielding also wrote the screenplay (w/ Richard Curtis, very skilled with romantic comedies) and keeps the laughs coming, this movie could have fallen flat on its face.  But it doesn't because one, the casting is absolutely divine and two, smartly builds on some elements the book downplays.  	 Renee Zellweger is absolutely perfect as Bridget Jones.  She has always been one of my favorite actresses and here, she totally displays Bridget's pathetic cuteness.  Zellweger gained weight for this role, too, so she looks adorably plump.  It's very, very hard to not fall in love with her the moment you see her at her family's Christmas party or drinking alone at home or listening to sad, Celine Dion music.  (You have a heart of stone if you aren't moved to laughs or tears or pity for her.)  I can't imagine anyone else playing Bridget Jones.  Zellweger fits the role because she is very much normal and approachablewe can relate to her.  As Daniel Cleaver (her caddish Cassanova lover/boss), Hugh Grant is smoldering and hilarious.  (Ok, I might be a little biased because I've been in love with him for ages and ages, but you can't deny he is a great comedic actor.)  There's no trace of his stuttering that we saw (and I loved) in `Four Weddings and a Funeral' or `Sense and Sensibility.'  Grant morphs effortlessly into a cad that we all love to hate and all love to love.  Yes, it's a paradox, but that is what Grant brings to his role.  He makes being `bad' look so sexy.  You can't take your eyes off him; he brings his own humor to his role.  It's lovely, smoldering, and incredibly sexy. 
Colin Firth is also a delight to watch onscreen as Mark Darcy (I think I might be in love with him, too).  He is also sexy and smoldering, but not in the same wild, fiery way as Daniel Cleaver.  Firth brings a very cute sweetness to his role.  I don't know if it is his adorable face or his hair or the way he dresses or just the fact that he is a major sex symbol, but you can't help but fall in love with him the MOMENT you see him onscreen. There is also one very beautiful moment where he tells Bridget, `I like you very muchjust the way you are.'  It's incredibly romantic and, for me, ranks right up there with Tom Cruise's `You complete me' in `Jerry Maguire.' He also has rather explosive chemistry with Renee Zellweger, which is moving and sexy all at the same time.  (And, of course, the author Helen Fielding used Colin Firth as the basis for Mark Darcy, so it all works out marvelously.) 	I also mentioned that the movie smartly builds on some elements that the book downplays.  Yes, there are certain parts of the movie that cannot be found in the book, but I'm still glad they put them in the movie.  Most of what they added doesn't necessarily build on plot but it does add to the characters.  I don't want to give anything away because it's rather hilarious what unfolds onscreen.  The movie is filmed in an almost Ally McBeal type of way but it remains true to the sincerity, cuteness, and pathetic naivete that Bridget Jones embodies.  There are no pretensions. It's an entirely wonderful film.   10/10",Bridget Jones's Diary
201,clarinets,Cute Romantic Comedy,8,15 June 2002,"I really enjoy this movie.  We first see 32 year old Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger)at her mother's annual turkey curry buffet.  We see some of the main people in her life, her parents, her ""uncle"" Jeffrey (How many of us have had an ""uncle Jeffrey in our lives that we've had to endure, because it's just ""harmless fun"", raise your hand), and Mark Darcy (played by Colin Firth), a divorced lawyer who his and Bridget's parents are trying to get together.Unfortunately, their first meeting gets off on the wrong foot, and Bridget spends that night drinking herself silly, alone in her apartment, listening and air-voicing to ""All by Myself"".  However, she decides to keep a diary. In her first entry she resolves to find a good man, and avoid her attractive boss, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant).However, he starts making suggestive sexual innuendos to her, and, enjoying the attention, she starts dressing in a miniskirt and see-through top, and passing silly, flirtatious e-mails back and forth. She seeks advice from her 3 best friends on how to handle this. This sequence events leads to a purely sexual relationship between Daniel and Bridget, although Bridget is a bit too naive and insecure to really see this.We learn that Daniel and Mark are archenemies due to some events in the past which led to Mark's wife leaving him.  Also, because Mark and Bridget often travel in the same circles, we do learn that Mark's opinion of Bridget has quickly changed.  From the look on his face, it's easy to see that he now likes her (Hmmm shades of Mr Darcy in Pride and Prejudice)Anyay, Bridget eventually catches Daniel with another woman, and once again she is alone, and decides to seek another job as a television reporter. Mark rescues Bridget from being canned from her job, by allowing her an interview with people he was defending in a high profile case.  After this Bridget tries to cook a dinner for her 3 best friends and Mark shows up and is able to show his feelings for her.  Daniel also shows up, and he and Mark wind up in a hilarious fight sequence over Bridget.While we are supposed to root for Mark to win Bridget, (I did), I was bothered by one thing.  Bridget was the one he wanted, but he was too spineless to break up his romantic involvement with Natasha, his law partner.  He even let it get to the point of the two of them becoming engaged before the predictable ending.  You could tell, everytime Natasha snapped her fingers and said ""Come on, Mark"", that he was kind of sheepishly following her.I saw one review here that criticized Mark's saying ""You are a bad public speaker, you tend to run off at the mouth, but I like you just the way you are.""  I like that honesty, and I like being unafraid to let myself show to someone I like, and still have acceptance.  I'd rather have that, than someone blowing false sunshine in my face.All in all, I gave the movie an 8/10, would have been a 9, had it not been for Mark's attitude of ""settling"" when he thought he couldn't have Bridget.",Bridget Jones's Diary

207,jacob rosen,Phony,1,27 December 2001,"Renee Zellweger's ludicrous British accent is only one of the outrages perpetrated in Sharon Maguire's film of the Helen Fielding bestseller about the life and loves of a thirty-something single woman. This is a film that could set the feminist cause back thirty years with its shamelessly aggressive belief that women have careers only to make themselves more available to men and that life isn't worth living if Mr. Right doesn't come along. Zellweger spends the entire film trying to convince us she's got the accent down but she's only a caricature--and a blank one at that. Maguire, meanwhile, spends just as much effort trying to convince us that a natural beauty like Zellweger is fat and plain--it's a sham (much like Janeane Garafolo is in `The Truth About Cats & Dogs'). The rest of the cast is uninspired; even the dependable Hugh Grant, trying to play against type as a cad, barely registers a pulse and Colin Firth, as Mr. Right, is curiously unlikable.

Well, that was exactly how I reacted. She was perfect for the part, in my opinion. As for the film, it was sweet, romantic, and DAMN FUNNY! I always laugh when I watch it, and I've seen it about 10 times. Hugh Grant is a good snake, and Colin Firth is very charming, even though he's pretty stiff in this. The end--or maybe what happens in the credits--makes it impossible for you to leave the movie not smiling. The end also makes me happy. There are two awards it was nominated for that it should have won: Best Kiss in the MTV movie awards, and the Oscar for Zellweger. She was hilarious!

""Bridget Jones's Diary"" was not made for the American male college students of the world. Us American male college students can enjoy movies like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""Animal House"", which were both made to play with our greatest dreams. Bridget Jones's Diary had middle-aged UK women in mind, and it's hard to imagine one would like this movie if he or she did not fit that exact profile.Bridget Jones's Diary is the story of a single woman who doesn't want to be single anymore. Two suitors fight for her hand.What really killed this movie was the character of Bridget Jones herself. The woman is not functional. In everything she does, Jones is cartoonishly inept. This ineptitude quickly stops being cute and becomes totally insufferable for the viewer. All of the movie's humor comes from Jones finding a way to embarrass herself. Sometimes she gives an awkward speech at a public event, sometimes she accidentally offends her friends and coworkers, et cetera. This constant use of cringe humor is lazy and unfunny.Why are there two men fighting over this woman? Both men are handsome and very successful in their work. These might even be considered ""dream guys."" Firth's character is handsome, rich, and a pseudo-famous lawyer. What does he see in Jones, a woman who constantly offends him and makes a fool of herself? Who knows. The movie sure as hell didn't give a good reason for it.I came into this movie expecting a lighthearted laugh, but I got a stream of annoying humor and nonsense.

She made a resolution to start writing in a diary, promising herself to get better physically and simultaneously dealt with other life problems. Things start to change this year when she met two men that somehow gravitated towards her but despised each other's company.Romantic comedies usually suffer from the case of a predictable plot and generic characters. This movie doesn't escape those stereotypes either. Packed with a clever script and solid execution, this movie tiptoes the romantic parts and the comedic ones. Some moments were definitely a bit too sweet to be true and too wacky of a comedy, yet somehow it has all the right twists and turns of a movie that will keep you glued. Sure, it has a big unnecessary subplot just to fill the empty duration, but with a supporting cast this strong, I wouldn't mind having to take a break from all the love triangle that was going on.Renee Zellweger and Colin Firth may not have that strong of a chemistry, but throw Hugh Grant into the mix and somehow all three of them play each other off really well. Zellweger particularly went lengths for this movie, and I must applaud her for her impeccable comedic timing and sweet charm that lured me into liking her careless, clueless character.It was a sweet romantic comedy for a date night, but don't expect anything original or mind-blowing about it.

219,MetaLark,Not a hardcore chick-flick,9,30 October 2001,"Speaking as one familiar with ""Pride and Prejudice""--the book and the 1995 miniseries upon which this work is loosely based--I like this spunky little movie exceedingly well, just as it is. Do not be put off by superficial comparisons to ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""Notting Hill,"" both shallow and pretentious movies memorable only for one fine eulogy and some physically beautiful protagonists. ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" is more.Bridget Jones is, as its soundtrack suggests, ""Everywoman."" Every woman who has ever fumbled for words, fallen on her face, been embarrassed by her mother, chosen her underwear carefully, picked a cad for a boyfriend--whether she's a thirty-something singleton or a sixty-something grandma--can identify with Bridget on some level. You can't help pulling for her. Cheering her on is cheering yourself on.But this chick-flick is not hardcore; it has a broad sense of humor. Male viewers have been caught in the act--smirking. There is even a fistfight to warm insensitive martial hearts. A couple of famous people make appearances here, too--one with a million-dollar price on his head--Salman Rushdie, who plays himself in a wryly irreverent little sequence.It's easy to miss the movie's charm on the first screening--some very good lines are swallowed at the ends; the gratuitous profanity, casual sex, prodigious smoking and drinking are turn-offs; the heroine is an awkward, fleshy woman with reprehensible fashion taste, and one may easily posit that she ended up with an unsuitable and unlikely mate.But I contend, after a second viewing, that this movie is a little gem. There is a wonderful economy in the editing; every scene, every action tends toward only one possible conclusion, a PERFECT conclusion. And the childhood clips in the ending credits give credence to that conclusion and provide support for it--which is that the hero and heroine are made for each other.I rate it a solid 9 (with a 10 for the BBC/1995 ""Pride and Prejudice"").* * * *  S P O I L E R S   A H E A D  * * * *At first glance, Miss Jones seems stupid and inept and the last woman in the world one would pick for the intelligent and successful Mr. Darcy. But consider this: Darcy already had ""a clever wife"" before--bliss must needs be sought elsewhere. Besides, Bridget, though somewhat gauche, is not unintelligent, as evidenced by her voiceovers and some of her sallies. But most of all this: Each has something the other needs--he is steady and reliable, she possesses liveliness and warmth. Notice the wistful look on Darcy's face as he watches Bridget and Cleaver cavorting on the river. He WANTS some nonsense and indecorum in his life--needs them; she would be his savior. Imagine Darcy's life if he had settled on the competent but priggish Natasha--both parties would have stagnated. Imagine if Bridget had surrendered to the charms of a Daniel Cleaver--fun for the nonce, but misery for the long haul.No, this ending is perfect in every way, down to the last delightful epithet uttered by an aroused Darcy. And oh yes, the kiss--very promising indeed; at once tender and ardent, it leaves one with the distinct impression that Darcy will be something more than ""helpful in the kitchen.""",Bridget Jones's Diary
220,MetaLark,U.S. GDP falls sharply due to Bridget Jones,9,25 November 2001,"The U.S. Gross Domestic Product fell 0.4% during the period ending Sept 30, 2001; a good deal of this can be attributed, I believe, to those of us ostensibly normal, usually productive women who have become obsessed--yes, obsessed!--with ""Bridget Jones's Diary."" I myself watch this flick at least once a week--let's see, that's 97 minutes multiplied by 52 weeks--84 hours a year--an entire two-week vacation, and that's not counting the time we spend thinking about it, and talking about it, and writing about it. If our husband's snoring wakes us in the middle of the night, we just hop out of bed and go watch the culminating KISS, or perhaps even the entire video; when this happens, we barely can function the next day at work. Our productivity is falling like the Leonid meteors.What is wrong with us?! Maybe it's that we can't deal with the terrorist crisis and must find a means of escape. If so, this little darling of a movie is perfect escapist fare for silly, romantic women like us.Here we have Bridget Jones--our alter ego--encountering our perfect hero--a man who's ""moral and noble and normal...and helpful in the kitchen."" And after many misunderstandings and missteps, at last he clasps us in his arms and bestows on us--um, I meant on HER--the most perfect, exquisite series of kisses in movie history. Omigosh! They're not your standard slobbery, predatory kisses of a male motivated by lust, but the tender and ardent kisses of a man fired by true love.So we crawl back into bed with our husbands, our own true lovers--who are starting to look better and better to us in our altered state of being--resulting in more lost sleep all 'round, and now our poor husbands' job productivity is affected as well.This film is practically subversive.

221,blkmgcbhl,Loved the film right from the very start,9,6 June 2013,"Bridget Jone's Diary definitely ranks top on the list of romantic comedies I have watched. It is a hilarious adaptation of the ""Pride and Prejudice"" romance. I can't think of anything I found irksome about the film, just can't find a downside considering the genre it belongs to. This film has introduced me to the charm of Colin Firth and I'm glad about that. Renee Zelwegger did wonders and seemed every bit British. Kudos to Grant too for playing a scoundrel type role, not something he usually essays. Although the movie's basic plot is predictable (this is intentional or else Colin Firth's character wouldn't have been named Darcy) pretty much from the start, the same cannot be said for the film's scene or dialogue. Not surprised that this film has been directed by a woman, Sharon Maguire, because the film captures the nitty-gritty aspects of a woman's life.",Bridget Jones's Diary

If you're a guy, it's a relatively painless way to score points for ""suffering through"" a movie that your wife or girlfriend will definitely want to see.Bridget is a sort of everywoman.  She'll likely remind you of at least one female friend, if not more.  It's easy to become emotionally invested in Bridget's successes and failures, and suspend disbelief (forgetting that it's an actress playing a character) while watching the film.Personally, I would have liked to see a bit more of Bridget's father in the film, but only because I think Jim Broadbent is such a great character actor.  Other than that, I find it hard to find fault with the film.

Bridget Jones is a brainless tart who sets the women's movement back about 50 years. my boyfriend thought it would be romantic to watch it together. he was wrong. this film reinforces every bad female stereotype there is. the characters were unbelievable and extremely annoying, the acting vapid and fourth rate. i consider it an insult to my backside that it had to suffer the discomfort of prickly cinema seating for the duration of this dross. if Bridget Jones were a real person, i would track her down and beat the crap out of her. if you haven't seen this film, please, PLEASE do yourself a favour and avoid it like the plague.",Bridget Jones's Diary

Women can relate and men can laugh. It really is a great movie.I was hesitant to bother with it, and would never have subjected my boyfriend to it, but now that I have seen it, I would actually go so far as to say its ownable.Renee is wonderful, Hugh played a fabulous slime ball and the real star of the show was the guy who played the keeper..

There is little true romance and no comedy whatsoever in a disjointed story that pales in comparison to its source, the namesake book. BJD has average journeyman performances, a horrible production design making for an ugly image and a story that meanders without any direction, other than Bridget's adventures with two men (neither of whom is remotely sympathetic). There is no inner core to the protagonist but a shallowness that detracts from any suspense as to what might happen next. As a result, watching Bridget becomes embarrassing and boring rather than exciting and funny considering the intent of the story, that of an obese 30 years old who wants to find a man. The whole film seems like an exercise in throwing out everything that worked (Bridget's great female friends, for one) in the book and keeping the worst parts (the parents and their excruciating friends) that ultimately fail to add up to anything. To add insult to injury, the editing (cuts) is so fast that most of the time this viewer was unable to see what had transpired. Stay away from this stinker.",Bridget Jones's Diary

If a guy is going to survive a chick flick, I think this is it. The deleted scenes on the DVD are a little odd, I think they were going to format the movie a different way, but it looks like they made the better choice in the end result. The movie does a good job of getting you to feel Bridget's joy and pain, happy moments and totally embarrassing ones.

It's soooooo sweeeeeeeeeeet!Hugh Grant plays a good a**hole. (As usual.) His hair is as floppy as ever, and he says lots of bad words. Every jerk's hero! Woot!Who can't relate to Bridget? I mean, seriously. Who hasn't burned vodka bottles and self-help books in a tin trash can? Who hasn't had two British men fighting over them in the street, with ""It's Raining Men"" playing perfectly in the background? (""It's a fight! It's a REAL LIVE FIGHT!"") Who hasn't dressed up in a Playboy bunny suit and paraded around a stuff British garden party? I mean, c'mon. We've all been there. ... right?ANYWAYS... this is a good movie! And it's not just a chick flick... it's a chick flick where guys get to see, um... booze, fighting, cleavage and... Bridget's ass while she's sliding down the fireman's pole! And while your girlfriend might not appreciate the staring and drooling, they will find a new respect for you, because they'll think that you like them enough to watch a chick flick with them.

What a woman!  Determined, honest, not afraid to be looking for her soulmate.  I'm not so sure that her soulmate is Mark Darcy (hunky Colin Firth) but at least he is smart enough and wise enough to see the inner goodness, warmth, and sexiness of our heroine.  I hope he really does love her ""just the way she is"", because that is what she deserves.  Hugh Grant, as Bridget's irresistible, sexy, smarmy boss, is a pleasure; Bridget's friends are just too funny; and her dad (Jim Broadbent) is touching and sweet.

229,cyclonev,Surprisingly worth watching,7,18 May 2003,"From the hype surrounding its release, I expected very little of BJD. I'm not generally a fan of mainstream films, especially romantic comedies; I'm not even going to mention the term ""chick flick"" (oops!) as I find it (the term & most of the movies described as such) utterly offensive.
Anyhoo, a friend got this out on DVD and I found it fairly consistently amusing. It wasn't offensively soppy, the characters, while still pretty stereotypical if you are used to more realistic, non-mainstream cinema, were at least slightly less commonly used stereotypes and there were a fair few laughs to be had for someone who expects at least a modicum of wit and intelligence from a comedy script.I can't, in general, stand Mr Grant, and Colin Firth has been so typecast of late as a terribly ""nice"" fellow without much substance; Firth played true to type - I too found myself wishing Bridget would tell him to p*** off, she was so much better than him despite her human frailties - but Hugh Grant was surprisingly not bad. I find him much more believable as an a***hole than his usual nice guy characters.To sum up, you'll probably love it if you're a mainstream romantic comedy fan and you might even like it if you're not. 7/10",Bridget Jones's Diary

Bridget, Mark and her friends are having party. Then, Daniel comes to the house and says he loves her. Mark gets angry and they fight. On Christmas, listening to Pamela's story, Bridget realizes that Daniel is a liar and Mark is sincere. This story has a lot of funny scenes. My favorite is Daniel looks at Bridget's big underpants.

Laughed a lot and it sure made me forget my problems of the day.It was unfortunate that they had to include so much swearing that was unnecessary to the story.The subtle and not so subtle similarities with ""Pride and Prejudice"" were enjoyable. Once again Colin Firth was perfect for the role and acted superbly. Hugh Grant was also well cast and was so believable as the scoundrel he played.

British humor can be funny.  `Men Behaving Badly' and `Coupling' are very funny British shows I see occasionally on BBC America. But, for the love of God, this movie is positively not funny.  It also is complete foolishness, not funny foolishness but utter foolishness.  Sleep inducing foolishness.  Most of the characters are unlikable in almost every way.  Bridget is not very intelligent to put it lightly.  Her escapades I assume were supposed to be amusing but were more or less annoying.  Hugh Grant is by far and away my least favorite actor of all time.  If I had known he was in the movie I would most likely have skipped it altogether.  Colin Firth's character was the only character I enjoyed watching.  He at least had some kind of intelligence and depth along with a little mystery and intrigue.In short, I wrote this because I am flabbergasted at how highly this movie is rated here.  To put it in simple termsThis movie sucks big time.  So for those of you who have not seen this film and say to yourself `IMDB ranks it high so it must be good,' think again.  Easily one of the most boring and meaningless films I have ever seen.If you wish to see a good Renee Zellweger movie see Nurse Betty or Jerry Maguire.  This one is pitiful.",Bridget Jones's Diary
237,stuffkikker,Don't see why this was so popular,2,23 November 2004,"Well, for some reason i really love romantic movies with that dash of comedy. U know, the kind of movies that leave u with a lump in your throat. But after having seen this movie I must say i've started to doubt this preference..OK, so there are some funny developments, and I find Hugh Grant a rather amusing character, esp. when he has this immoral streak going on.. nevertheless, the development was predictable, the characters were rather stereotypical, dialogues where very very ... dull.. and the soundtrack was without exception the most horrible sequence of pep-tunes i have EVER heard..yeh, i cant stress that enough: the soundtrack of this movie is horrible.. and since background music is able to make or break a scene, this might explain why scenes just lacked ambiance.. I actually had to turn of the sound to be able to keep watching certain scenes.. (now that cant be a good thing).. I don't know any names so i cant give examples, but rest assure that with its peppy and almost desperate selection of songs it stands out from any other romantic comedy in the most negative way.. it doesn't 'blend' the scenes.About acting; other than Hugh Grant (who is actually a bit over the top) i find other characters very unconvincing and 'propish' (which includes this movie's good guy).. esp the 3 friends of Bridget, hanging around her throughout the movie as a soundboard for her romantic developments, really feel like being put there as filling.. plus they are annoying.. (i mean, please; 2 girls and the typical gay guy..

The difference is that the movie is set in the UK and hence accomplishes a unique marriage of British humour and Hollywood film-making.
Zellweger does her role to perfection in all aspects, while the others are adequate. Grant takes a break from his ""nice guy"" stereotype. The soundtrack might be worth buying.

240,KatieBug19,I Love This Film!,8,3 August 2002,"For the hundreds of reasons people have already mentioned, I love this film. It is, very simply, incredibly entertaining!  Now, come my (few) non-standard reasons for enjoying Bridget Jones.  First, it was directed by a woman.  Very, very few films are (pay attention sometime, it will really shock you!), and I appreciate so much seeing a female succeeding and promoting other females to succeed through her subject matter.  Next, the way Bridget looks at men.  Do you ever get tired (really, really tired) of watching the camera slowly slide up the backside of some starlet?  Was it not the most refreshing thing in the world when the camera slowly slid up Colin Firth's backside?  Did you not want to stand up and cheer?  I most certainly did!  Finally, this was a film that displayed joy.  So many movies are just so exhausted.  Even many comedies just walk along comely, doing their thing and hoping to sell more tickets - but this was a film with heart and soul and joy and humor.  I would even go so far as to (gasp!) say it improved upon the book.  This is one of my favorite comedies of all time, and every time I see it, I just get the happiest, silliest grin on my face. If you are vacillating on whether or not to watch Bridget Jones (I really have no idea why you would be doing that or why this review matters at all, really), you must see this film~",Bridget Jones's Diary
241,Aerie-2,Load of tripe,1,24 April 2001,"*warning, some spoilers*I wanted to like this movie.  I really did.  However, the script makes doing so exceedingly difficult.  Firstly, Renee Zellwegger has a nice English accent, yet I was put off by the idea of weight.  She looks incredibly plump, yet we're expected to believe she's a ""whopping"" 131 lbs. Whopping? Since when was that a lot?  Wasn't there just a People article describing Charlize Theron's 125 lb. frame?  Not very realistic.  And people wonder about the rising eating disorder rate, when a size 4 is considered 'plump'.The story itself was sickening.  Alright, so Bridget makes a bonehead mistake by having an affair with her sleazy boss; I admit, I cheered her on when she wised up, yet the other leading male, Mark Darcy (played emotionally-dead by Colin Firth) made me snort.  He's arrogant, rude, and puts Bridget down so much, yet she ultimately jumps from one sleazeball to another.  So what does Bridget learn?  That someone loves her ""just the way she is"" (except when he calls her a foolish idiot, among other unpleasantries)?  What am I supposed to do?  Congratulate Bridget on this?If you want to see a great movie about switching one's life around and standing up for oneself, watch ""American Beauty"".

243,vernoncoffee,Bridget Jones is Pride and Prejudice Reworked,6,14 May 2007,"... Mark Darcy , the name and the character are boldly stolen from Pride and Prejudice, and in fact, in an inside joke, Firth played Jane Austen's Darcy in a famous BBC version of the book an excerpt from a 2001 film review of Bridget Jones's Diary. Like most others reviews, it didn't look very far below the surface to see that screen writers' Richard Curtis and Andrew Davies borrowed far more from Austen than Mark Darcy; they stole the entire plot. Proceed if you dare:1. In Pride and Prejudice, Mr. Bennet, the heroine's father, kindly, satiric and unambitious; spends most of his time hiding in his study from his silly wife. Is it a coincidence that in Bridget Jones's Diary, Mr. Jones, kindly, satiric and unambitious, spends most of his time hiding in front of the TV from his silly wife? OK, one coincidence does not plagiarism make.2. In Pride and Prejudice, Mrs. Bennet's main concern in life is to find eligible bachelors for her gaggle of five daughters, doing so in such transparent schemes and so much mindless chatter as to constantly embarrass her husband and two oldest girls; in Bridget Jones's Diary, Mrs. Jones main concern in life is to find eligible bachelors for her daughter, doing so in such transparent schemes and so much mindless chatter as to constantly embarrass her husband and Bridget. Another coincidence you say, your smile becoming less relaxed.3. In Pride and Prejudice, the two youngest girls are foolish and flirtatious, Mary is awkward and studious, Jane is kind spirited and Elizabeth has discernment and common sense. If you were lump all these personalities into a single character, it would look a lot like Bridget Jones's odd amalgam of traits: foolish and discerning, flirtatious, yet awkward and kind. Beginning to see a pattern... anyone, anyone?4. In Pride and Prejudice, the main action revolves around a contest between Mr. Wickham, a handsome soldier/cad who woos his way into the youngest daughter's heart and bed, and besmirches the character of his rival, Mr. Darcy; in Bridget Jones's Diary, the main action revolves around a contest between Daniel Cleaver, a handsome publisher/cad who woos his way into Bridget's heart and bed and besmirches the character of his rival, Mark Darcy. Anyone, anyone?5. In Pride and Prejudice, Mark Darcy defends his good name poorly because of his reserve, fastidiousness, and taciturn nature; in Bridget Jones's Diary, Mark Darcy defends his good name poorly because of his reserve, fastidiousness, and taciturn nature. Blinders, remove... anyone, anyone?6. In Pride and Prejudice, Darcy eventually manages to show Wickham for the cad he is, restore his own good name, and win Elizabeth's love in the process; in Bridget Jones's Diary, Darcy eventually manages to shows Daniel Cleaver for the cad he is, restore his own good name, and win Bridget's love in the process. This isn't a send up, a nod or a homage; to put it bluntly, Bridget Jones's Diary is simply Pride and Prejudice reworked for 2000, and if Jane Austen is not given a writing credit in the film, it's plagiarism.",Bridget Jones's Diary

Add in top-drawer supporting performances and you have a wonderful, hilarious movie that had everyone laughing out loud for most of the movie.

There were a few funny running jokes that didn't make it into the screenplay, but I hardly missed 'em.

It seems very common-place and at the same time, completely original.  I have found yet another movie to add to my list of why I like Renee Zellweger so much.  Brilliant in this movie!  Hugh Grant is also wonderful as well as the third in the cast Colin Firth.  The writing is masterful and the movie never gets old or boring.  A wonderful picker-upper.

254,Blou,WARNING! CHICK FLICK ALERT!,10,28 December 2001,"Yes yes. It's a chick flick. Thats not to say that guys shouldn't watch it or won't like it. They may. I know some that do. But will the understand it? NO! Those females who are flawlessly beautiful, are stick thin and have fabulous boyfriends and jobs will also not understand it. So do the rest of us like it? The answer is (and should be) and resounding YES! As the tagline says ""For anyone who's ever been set up, stood up or felt up.""Renee Zellweger plays Bridget Jones, a 30-something ""singleton"" who, along with her ""urban family"" (Jude, who calls Bridget daily with complains about f***wit boyfriend, Shazza, a journalist who likes to say f*** alot, and Tom, total poof and 90's rock icon who only recorded one hit record because he found out that one hit record was enough to get him laid for the entire decade) tackle the problems faced by young people and dealing with problems of love, life and parents! Although much outcry was heard when a Texan native would play British chick Brdiget, I believe Renee does this quite well. Hugh Grant and Colin Firth play Bridgets love interests, one who just likes to shag and the other who has some serious problems about exposing feelings (watch the movie and you'll figure out who's who).
A great adaptation of a fantastic book(""Bridget Jones's Diary"", not ""Pride and Prejudice"" hee hee hee) and a cool cast make this an ideal girls nite in movie. Don't worry if you haven't got a date for Saturday nite, cause, more than likely, neither does Bridget!!!",Bridget Jones's Diary

Zellweger is just perfect, our woman, even a little bit... fuller. :) Anyway, Colin Firth is great on screen, and about H.Grant... well, he does the only thing he knows: one of the two variations of a prince: puppy or playboy. Here he makes the playboy version.I recommend you all to see the movie, to enjoy the time you'll spend and to take a girl. :)I feel some more special effects with writing on screen of the diary could make the film richer, but, ok, ok, that's fine!RIC",Bridget Jones's Diary

257,swest2,My favorite movie,10,18 November 2005,"SPOILERS! Every time I watch this movie I feel like I'm falling in love all over again. Bridget is soooo lovable. It's a fact! Why else would two dishy men like Daniel and Mark be all over her. Let's face it -- Daniel is a dog. But Mark is a very well educated, accomplished man. I'm so glad that Bridget ends up with someone so worthy of her and her sweetness and good heart.Mark is very cautious because he has been hurt before. Therefore, his willingness to proclaim his feelings for Bridget and commit to her must be very difficult for him but he does because he wants Bridget in his life. Since he is an attorney, I would also assume he is very analytical and has looked at his relationship with Bridget from every angle imaginable.I also think that Bridget might remind him a little of his mother. Remember, folks, his mother is the one who picked out his Christmas ties and wanted to fix up Bridget and Mark in the first place. Also, Mark has seen how happy his parents have been for 40 years, so his mother's playfulness and humor probably contributed a lot to that fact. Besides, Mark has worked hard to become a very accomplished and well-thought of attorney, and he needs to balance it with the love, affection, sweetness, silliness, tenderness, and humor that Bridget can offer.

Bridget is everyone one of my ex girlfriends and at the same time none of them. Helen Fielding is a very clever writer, i think any Thirty-something person (male or female) that has had a rough or bad relationship can relate to this movie. a definite must own.

I rented the DVD and was disgusted that the ""deleted"" material was all stuff that came from the book!! Renee Zellwegger was *okay* as Bridget (great accent) but she just lacked...something.

I have been wallowing in the pseudo-romantic comedies that Hollywood has been pumping out.  And now, finally Bridgette has come along to save us from the insipid movies that have been plaguing our theatres.  Bridgette Jones's Diary is witty, entertaining, and endearing.  A story of a sexy but slightly overweight Londonite, ""Diary"" follows Renee Zellweger through the trials and tribulations of dating.  And what a ride it is.  Though I was a little tenuous to see Zellweger pull off an English accent, after 5 minutes I was lost in her clever non-sequitors and embarrassing faux pas.  Colin Firth and Hugh Grant are both perfectly charming in the roles as Zellweger's would-be suitors.  And, as in all Hugh Grant movies, the secondary cast of friends and foes are brilliantly written and acted.

I never at one time got bored with this movie, it is really good all the way through. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and I think it's really funny too. There are alot of funny scenes in this flick, and it isn't dull humor either. I think it's really really funny at times. All the characters play good roles, I guess what I'm trying to say is that the acting in this movie is really good as well.

I'm a real middle-age female and while I'm in far better shape than the average Walmart shopper due to regular exercise and having something of aclue re: nutrition, I'm still no fashion model. So the idea of Renee Z. asBridget being considered 'obese; is simply laughable-- unless she's 3 feet tall. Most heterosexual males don't care if a woman is a bit plump--most prefer it, Hollywood neuroticisms aside. The real quizzer in this movie's scenario is why Colin Firth's Darcy would develop an interest in such an emotional wet rag as Bridget. The women is a mess--not an interesting mess, a drippymess.(Honestly, one 'bad speech' scene was plenty, thanks.) Still, it's a fair cop. I've lost track of the number of movies/TV shows I've seen where theoverweight/loser male lead somehow attracts the devoted attentions of theimpossibly pretty/skinny female lead. After years of male-screenwriterfantasy fulfillment why shouldn't an unsympathetic average-looking femalelead get the attentions of a lovely male character. Only fair, eh? Aside from Messr's.

275,rsd22,Four Reasons to See this Movie - None of Them Important,6,21 February 2005,"I can't remember watching a film after which I felt less interest in the fate of ANY of the characters. The story is told without any feeling or energy whatsoever, with the sole exception of the Hugh Grant role (Daniel), and even he is far below his usual standard. Colin Firth is so wooden he has caused me to re-evaluate my opinion of the acting talent of Keanu Reeves. The film is nominally a romantic comedy, but the degree of apparent romantic attraction between Bridget and Mark (Firth) can only be described as microscopic even at the end of the film, when they've managed to get together. It's also hard to see what Daniel (Grant's 'Mr. Wrong') sees in Bridget, who is consistently presented unattractively, with respect to clothing, behavior, physical attributes, and personality. Perhaps it's that the two of them are equally shallow. As for comedy, the film (ie. the director) time after time walks away from potential significant comic scenes with a whimper, not a bang. This, after taking some pains to set those scenes up. Cases in point: the fire station interview, and the tarts and vicars party. In both of these cases we are apparently supposed to take the semi-exposure of Bridget's ample backside as sufficient comic payoff for the setup. This is more like British TV humor of the Benny Hill genre than what I expect to see as humor in a major motion picture. Given all of the above, and in all fairness, there are indeed four reasons to see this film: (1) Bridget's speech at the book launch, which is actually quite funny, (2) the fight between Daniel and Mark with their apologetic asides to the restaurant patrons as they trash the place, (3) Zellweger's British accent, which I wouldn't have thought possible, and (4) Daniel's stunning book-lined apartment, which appears, unfortunately, only briefly. None of these, of course, are important.",Bridget Jones's Diary
276,hansololover,Simply fabulous! Colin and Renee steal the show! SPOILERSSSS,9,13 June 2004,"""I like you very much...just the way you are""- Mark Darcy, Colin Firth
I had read both books before seeing this movie, and strangely enough, I WASN'T disappointed, as is usual for book-to-movie transitions. I mean there were a few missing elements that I thought would have worked well if they hadn't been left out, but it was really good.Most romantic comedies are cheesy and ""blah"". Bridget Jones's Diary, while having those cheesy moments in it, is still one of the most lovable romantic comedies out there. Renee Zellweger is fantastic at playing out the socially awkward, quirky and slightly lonely ""singleton"" who gets overwelmed by all the changes in her life, while trying to manage her weight, smoking and drinking. Her two leading men both bring great prescence to the movie, Hugh Grant as the cocky,full-of-himself, two-timing boss who has a charm and appeal that sucks Bridget in to what she believes is love. He also helps to make her dislike of Mark grow, as he makes up a lie about Mark stealing his fiance, which we later find out is a total lie...Then there's Colin Firth, who is just AMAZING as Mark, who almost oppositely first comes off as rude and ignorant, but is really INCREDIBLY sweet and kind hearted. There is just something about the way he stares, and the look in his eyes that makes him irresistable and he plays the part so well, I just love him. My only regret was they didn't include some of those adorable short scenes with him and Bridget in them that made it clear why he liked her so much. Anyhow, this was just a really sweet movie, that restores your faith in men, and gives you a happy feeling when you finish it. And I have a feeling even the guys won't mind this ""Chick Flick""",Bridget Jones's Diary
277,crossing_lethe,Baffled by it's popularity,3,7 August 2005,"I will never understand why so many people rave about this movie. I found it annoying and boring to the extreme. Neither the plot or the acting kept my interest - I ended up finishing the movie by sheer force of will. Renee Zellweger did absolutely nothing to endear me to her character. This movie single handedly ended any appreciation I had for her work - I now avoid movies that have her in it. Bridget is more annoying than anything else. Not to mention that ""fat"" Bridget is not that fat at all - the majority of women these days wouldn't look half so good in that bunny suit. For all the glorifying praise Renee got for gaining weight, there really wasn't anything to write home about. Frumpy clothing does not make someone fat. I actually think she looked better in BJD than she did in her wedding pictures. While I love Colin Firth and ""Pride and Prejudice"", I found his character boring and uninspired. I suppose he probably was bored and uninspired, considering this is exactly the type of role Colin keeps getting thrown into.I understand that the book (which I haven't read) was based on ""Pride and Prejudice"", but the movie turned out as such a blatant knock off of P&P that it probably would have made more sense to acknowledge the inspiration in the previews. I hadn't read the book or heard much about BJD before watching the movie, so the striking similarities in the storyline were more annoying than they could have been. I was expecting a clever movie about a modern woman's struggles with her self-image and social life. What I got was this.",Bridget Jones's Diary

I loved the humor, but was wary as to how well it would translate to the screen. Last night, I got a chance to go to a sneak preview of the film...it fulfilled all my hopes for what the film *should* be. It does prove to be a departure from the novel, but I feel it stays true to what BJD is all about.Zellweger, Grant, and Firth were phenomenal...they embodied their characters, really making them come to life. I was impressed with Zellweger's accent...I would have never guessed that she was a Texan. Her comedic timing was impeccable, adding to the believability of Ms. Jones. :) Bridget has got to be one of the most truly accessible heroines out there...she's flawed, but that doesn't matter. Her humanity is what makes her great.Colin Firth was fantastic. He really made the audience believe that a stuffed shirt like Mark Darcy could really fall in love with a quirky girl like Bridget. Considering that Helen Fielding has often commented that her inspiration for Mark Darcy was Firth's portrayal of Mr. Darcy in A&E's Pride and Prejudice (1995), it's no wonder that I couldn't imagine another actor in that role. Austen fans, be sure to watch for the parallels between BJD and P&P...even some of the camera angles in Bridget Jones Diary echo scenes in the Pride & Prejudice mini-series.I know this has already been said in other reviews, but it's so true...the audience was laughing so hard during the movie that I did miss occasional bits of dialogue. Bottom line, this is a witty film, with great dialogue, and a nice message...you don't need to a be a supermodel to find love...there can be someone out there who'll like you just the way you are.",Bridget Jones's Diary
280,Tenant_Uen,Attractive film,8,14 January 2002,"Though I gave it an 8 out of 10, I am very fascinated with this flick (I intended to rate it 9). This film again consolidates my theory that the British really knows how to offer the first class romance without humiliate the audience¡¦s intellect. Many of American romances appeal to the sensual attraction, with poor performance and terrible story, while English counterparts usually carry on with extraordinary casting and more serious implications. B.J. is no exception. Again we see the energy and power of British actors and actresses, with whose excellent jobs enrich the texture of the whole film. Of course Renee Zellweger is brilliant, who actually enlivens the woman with all kinds of foibles but at the same time makes it impossible for viewers to dislike her. The songs fit into the story seamlessly, and cinematography and composition of certain shots are unforgettable. However there is one reason that keeps me from rating it higher. While I expected to see a female enlightenment in this film, I found the ending quite disappointing in this dimention. B.J.¡¦s success in her career is a gift offered by Darcy, and her happiness, obviously, relies mainly on her love life. I don¡¦t know what other feminists think of this film, but I really think it¡¦s a setback.",Bridget Jones's Diary
281,Critic2017B,My favorite Romantic Comedy,10,1 June 2005,"This film I only discovered fairly recently, and just absolutely fell in love with it. It sure seemed familiar and lo and behold then I read about the Pride and Prejudice connection and then it all made complete sense.This is such a charming, lovely homage to Pride and Prejudice. The three lead characters are just perfect. It is funny, sweet at times, sad at others, and just wonderfully sexy and v. romantic (especially the last 1/4th of it).Renee is so extraordinary as Bridget Jones, who would have ever thought she could play so believable a modern Brit woman so well. Her accent seems flawless to me. Hugh Grant is hilarious and a charming Lothario throughout. But Colin Firth is who really sold me on this film. His ability to play a guy that you start out not liking but drooling over by the end of the movie is sublime.I am a big fan of the less is more style of acting that Mr. Firth puts forth in this film...much of his performance is in his eyes and his facial expressions. While Daniel (Mr. Grant's character) chatters on and on and tries to charm with his wit and words, Mark Darcy (Mr. Firth's character) just has a strong and rather silent presence along with an integrity of character that is revealed and he wins us over (as well as Bridget).This movie has a lot going on outside of the wonderful romance as well. Contemporary events, gender inequities, social differences, work place decorum, fashion, self-image, sex, family, and friendship all come under the scrutiny of Bridget Jones and her diary.This is a very good adaptation of a beloved novel. The tone, scene selection, dialogue and characters capture the essence of what fans of the book love about it. I cannot imagine it any better cast or written.",Bridget Jones's Diary
282,pessimistic_girl,"Nothing like the book, for better and worse...",7,20 July 2002,"I think I'll start by saying that I am not a fan of the book, which I found rather childish and pointless. Therefor I had no higher expectations when I went to see the movie. But fortunately I was proved wrong, I think I can honestly say that apart from the names Bridget Jones's Diary (the movie) is nothing like Bridget Jones's Diary the book. And in my case that was a good thing... for a while.Strangely no matter how dull the book is I get slightly ticked off if the movie doesn't follow it. And in Bridget Jones's Diary there are very few elements that resemble the book. On the upside, the movie runs smoothly and all parts are equally entertaining (for the most part). On the downside the movie is such a far cry from the book that I wouldn't recognize them if they didn't share the same name.So for the acting; Hugh Grant is great, and a lot less annoying than usual. Colin Firth was way too dry for my taste but I guess that's how Marc Darcy is. Renee Zellwegger did have me impressed, especially with the accent, I saw her in Jerry Maguire a few weeks ago and was stunned at how different she sounded and looked. Bridget's friends are fine, although you see VERY little of them.But honestly my main problem with this movie is that Bridget (and Renee Zellwegger) are NOT overweight. According to the BMI calculator 136 lbs on a 5,5 foot frame is HEALTHY! Bridget's BMI would be 22.6, that's normal. Over 25 is overweight. It's really sad the way Hollywood (and other parts of entertainment) makes 136 lbs out to be overweight.I guess I'd give it (with the cut scenes that were hilarious): 7½/10",Bridget Jones's Diary

Needless to say she seemed to love it, as very clearly did the majority of others there (females are very expressive aren't they).",Bridget Jones's Diary

288,witty_pseudonym,simply fantastic,9,13 November 2005,"What is it that makes Bridget Jones's Diary such an addictive film? Perhaps it's the great combination of wit, reflection, self-analysis, drama, romance and sheer hilarious situations. This is the story of Bridget, a very real British woman with many issues, mainly weight and romance related. Greatly portrayed by Renee Zellweger, Bridget is both witty and interesting, making for a purely enjoyable film. I first watched this film when it was released in 2001. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Three years later, I gave it my second viewing, and since then, I must have watched it over 100 times. I honestly can say that this is the ONLY film I can watch everyday if given the opportunity. Although not the best film, and perhaps without much depth (not to say none), Bridget Jones's diary is somehow addictive and absolutely enjoyable. Definitely set to be a classic, this is a film that all people should view at least once, not because it's philosophical or because it makes stunning comments on society, but because it is simply fantastically entertaining.",Bridget Jones's Diary
289,Leigh-43,Refreshingly funny romantic comedy.,9,21 April 2001,"I have never read the book that this film is adapted from but if it's as good as the film I'd rush out and buy it. I was wary of seeing this film to begin with because of all the hype prior to its release. I thought that (as has happened with many other films in the past) it would not live up to expectations.   The first thing that put me off watching was the choice of Texan Renee Zellweger to portray the very British Bridget. I thought the film would be ruined by another American actor failing miserably at attempting the British accent, however I was wrong. She sounded totally authentic. Also her acting was fantastic as a desperate, lonely thirty-something single woman. Hugh Grant and Colin Firth were also brilliant.  It's great to see Hugh Grant in a change of character. It shows what a talented actor he is, easily making the transition from his usual role of nice guy to the smug womaniser he plays in this. What I loved though was how realistic it was. I'm sure many women cringed as they saw something embarrassing happen to Bridget and remember when they were in a similar situation.   Usually while watching so called 'chick flicks' you hear a great response from the women in the audience but the men look half asleep. This was not the case as I watched this film. The men found it just as hilarious.Don't miss it!",Bridget Jones's Diary

Well, perhaps a bit, but this was nonetheless an awesome feel-good group hug dramedy that makes a great date movie and a great flick to see with a group of friends.Renee Zellweger turns in an awesome performance in the title role.  Her accent is surprisingly good -- she can even sing and yell well with it. Hugh Grant shows awesome range in his acting.  Well, not really.  He's usually the stuttering cute moron or the annoyingly gorgeous jerk and he's the latter in this one.  Still, good job there chap.This is definitely a chick flick, but one of those good ones that has poignant moments and a cool plot amidst the emotional rollercoaster.  Check it out, it's worth your two hours.",Bridget Jones's Diary

But then I saw it by coincidence, and I was stunned by the acting performance of Renee Zellweger. How could a Texan actress portray an English girl so well? This is a very good movie that also appeals to a man like myself, it's sweet, romantic and Bridget Jones is someone to fall in love with! And so is Renee Zellweger...",Bridget Jones's Diary

I am only 13 (whoops I shouldnt have said that seeing as the movie is rated a 15! :)) and my opinion is not usually valued. But before you turn around and stop reading,thinking shes just 13, what does she know,please just listen to my comment. I thought that the Bridget Jones movie was v.good. Renée Zellweger was excellent as Bridget,her accent,if maybe rather posh, was otherwise flawless and her performance was v. good. This is not one of those deep and meaningful movies that win 300 Oscars but it is pretty darn good and if there was a category at the Oscars for funniest romantic comedy, this would win hands down. Hugh Grant and Colin Firth both show that they can act but Renée is the star of the show. The jokes are genuinely laugh-out-loud funny and the best bit about this movie is that there are no boring bits in between. Usually movies have a good bit then half an hour of nothing before you get to the next good bit. But not this one. No its not the best in the world and it probably wont get that Oscar. But its pretty darn good.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",Bridget Jones's Diary

So if you are one of the above you will love this film me i didn't think much of it, it had a couple of funny set pieces but overall it wasn't funny. It is very much in the same vain as Four Weddings and Notting Hill which i equally didn't find funny. But the film wasn't as bad as i thought it would be and i can think of worse things to see, so give it a try you might be pleasantly surprised or you might like me think it was average.",Bridget Jones's Diary
296,BridgetJonesChick,I LOVE THIS MOVIE,10,17 October 2001,"This movie was a wonderful surprise.  I went to see it with few expectations and without having read the book.  I left the theater completely obsessed with this funny, interesting, and realistic character. There are many things that make this movie great but i think that the most important thing would have to be the wonderful performances by the entire cast.  Renee Zellweger was wonderful as the of balance and less then graceful Bridget.  Hugh Grant, who is ussually quite the good guy, changes his stripes in this film to produce a funny and believable character, and Colin Firth reprises his Darcy role (one that he originally portrayed in 1995 for the BBC Pride and Prejudice a film very worth checking out!).I can not stress enough how great this film is and how worth viewing it is.  This film is one of my all time favorites because it is so sweet and funny.  This is a film that almost anyone could relate to no matter what age, sex, or place in society and can be enjoyed by EVERYONE!",Bridget Jones's Diary

This movie rocks! I own it and watch it all the time and all I can say is it is right on the money. The books are great, better than the movie, but the movie is really pretty true to the books, as far as movies based on books go, this one is great. Helen Fielding must be a single woman to understand what it's like so well and Renee Zellweger as Bridget is stupendous! I recommend that any guy who wants to understand women see this movie or read the book.",Bridget Jones's Diary
298,Coupling,Great movie,8,10 August 2006,I first saw this movie with a friend a couple of years ago and I really enjoyed it now seeing it again after so long I remember why I liked it so much. I've actually got it on DVD now.The movie is about Bridget Jones a 30 something single woman struggling to find a good boyfriend. She thinks she finds the perfect man and for a couple of weeks she's really happy she thinks she's got it all but unfortunately Daniel isn't as perfect as he seems and they break up and she depressed again. But then she finds there's some one else interested in her.This movie is really funny! The cast is great Rene Zelweger is perfect as Bridget Jones. She does the accent really good and actually I prefer her with it. Some how she really uses her voice differently when she speaks with her 'real' American accent. Hugh Grant and Colin Firth are really good in it too.I would recommend this movie to any one.,Bridget Jones's Diary
299,juliafotvag,Best romcom of all time,10,2 January 2019,"Bridget Jones Dairy is without doubt the best romantic comedy ever made and personally my favourite movie.
It's basically a dreamy scenario.Two guys fighting for a girl's heart.The one guy, Daniel, the sexy and charming boss and the other one, Mark, a cold and distant but caring lawyer (they both have british accents). You can't even choose a side!Or maybe you can when Mark confesses his feelings and says that he likes Bridget ""just the way she is"".Best pickup line ever.
.The main character, Bridget , is just a regular girl facing the problems of a 30yearold women living in London.The two potential partners are gorgeously handsome and loving but still humans that make mistakes and have flaws.

300,iuliawo,I don't get it...,5,19 March 2009,"I found it difficult to imagine this movie to be a real life situation that I felt like writing this short review. I reckon it was meant to target the dull spinster audience in order to cheer them up and inflict the idea that there is a chance for them all. Well, this is not something bad as long as one could imagine something like that happen in real life. But to go so far as to believe that two handsome and accomplished young men could fall for this Bridget is highly improbable. I'll just be blunt: Bridget is silly, dull, ugly and a bit too old for the part. But don't get me wrong; this is not exactly that which disturbs me most but the fact that she doesn't do anything to enhance her personality and physical aspect.I strongly believe that the axiom inflicted by this movie- take me or leave me; I am the way I am and I won't change- is not a healthy guiding line in anyone's life. Everybody has to work in order to get something or to reach somewhere and strive not to comply with dullness, stupidity, fatness, narrow mindedness or whatever else one has been at a certain point in life just because there might be people who ""will definitely like me the way I am"".It kind of reminded me of ""She done him wrong"" and Mae West who appeared in such a great contrast with the young, absolutely charming Cary Grant...I've waited the till the end for certain changes in Bridget's behavior or aspect but since this is not the idea the film wanted to convey I'll just sit on the back sit and let you others marvel at this movie because for me it was quite disappointing.",Bridget Jones's Diary

Yes, I know we're only 1/3 of the way through the year but will you please go see this movie?It is a romantic comedy but I know of lots of guys who will want to see it too.  I couldn't stop laughing.  Hooray for Bridget!  Hooray for independent, overweight (although Renee Zellweger is not), single women everywhere!And of course the two gorgeous leading men don't hurt the movie AT ALL...Despite the buzz about Renee Zellweger being horribly miscast, I think she did a great job.  Also hot were Colin Firth (whoah!) and Hugh Grant (again playing the loveable rogue).Hooray for Bridget Jones!",Bridget Jones's Diary
302,wileykylie,"Too close for comfort, BUT...",10,11 April 2001,"Too close for comfort, but great for a laugh!  Despite the fact that this movie strayed from a beloved book, I thought it really captured the spirit that made Bridget Jones so lovable and someone with whom I could identify. I must admit, I had severe doubts as to whether Renee Zellweger could be ""normal"" enough for me to have that feeling in movie, but she did a fabulous job of really submerging herself in the character and within 60 seconds I was laughing so hard both with and at her.  Hugh Grant did a fabulous turn in a character that is deliciously out of character.  Colin Firth is perhaps the most beautiful stoic ever.  Must say, I liked this movie beyond all expectation and I think it ranks among my favorite date movies of all time.",Bridget Jones's Diary
303,jasmine_kung,"""Pride & Prejudice"" II?",6,15 April 2001,"This film has many hilarious moments and Colin Firth still makes my knees weak, but what's all the fuzz about this story? It's a modern version of P & P sans the more intellectual Elizabeth. Instead, we have a 30 something woman who can't control her weight, drinking, smoking or doesn't seem to have any talents except being ""good-hearted"". Her one break in career came from her association with Darcy. This woman is reportedly a heroine in UK? I found her a complete anti-feminist model. Is that the point of the story? The heroine for the new millennium should be like the one for the last, sweet, a bit cheeky, a bit plum, vulnerable and thus, needs a strong man like Darcy. All the intellectual career women in the film are portrayed as cold and calculating in order to contrast Bridget's sweetness, clumsiness and thoughtfulness. It's a enjoyable romantic comedy if I take it as a pure fairy tale. Once I think it a bit deeper, the storyline bothers me.",Bridget Jones's Diary

Renee was a ""beautiful"" Bridget and her accent was dead on. I will have trouble seeing her in other movies without her British accent because it seemed as though it was came completely natural to her. Hugh Grant was a wonderful ""cad"" as my mother referred to him. His sexy good looks stole the screen away and I found myself begging Bridget to go back to ""Daniel Clever"", even though Hugh was the ""bad"" guy. This was not the ""normal"" Hugh Grant role and I'm glad they casted him as Daniel Clever although he would have been good as Mark also if he wanted to go with his normal nice sweet guy role. This movie has a bunch of laughs and I love where it is set. I will always remember one line Renee delivered, ""I would rather wipe Sudamm Usanes (sorry about the spelling) a$$ then work with you!""

307,jrae99,Brill!,10,25 April 2001,"Speaking as a singleton of a certain age, I found this move dead on. Although set in England, the theme and feelings of single people everywhere were universal.  The plot line stayed pretty true to the book with a few exceptions but the tone stayed the same.  I know when I went to see this with a female friend there were many men in the audience who looked like they had been dragged there but 5 minutes into the move they were laughing as hard (if not harder) than the women in the audience.  This is definitely not just a ""chick flick."" Renee Zellweger was a perfect Bridget.  When I first heard that she was going to play this role, I was skeptical but after I saw it(which I did twice, so far!) I couldn't imagine anyone else with such a mixture of cynicism and innocence.  Bravo to the casting of Hugh Grant and Colin Firth as Cleaver and Darcy, respectively.  If this movie doesn't win some Oscars it will be a crying shame.",Bridget Jones's Diary

311,Eskargot,A guy's opinion,5,29 May 2002,"On first hearing about this film, dread filled my soul like a fart in an elevator. And as its simile counterpart, news of the event spread fast, catching up with my girlfriend like a fat sprinter in a cherry pie dash. As the lightning crashed and the thunder rolled, words that Mankind had feared since ages past found form on my girlfriend's lips: ""Hey Mark, let's go and see Bridget Jone's Diary""...Now don't get me wrong, ladies, I do like many films that are considered 'Chick Flicks', one of my all time favourites being 'Muriel's Wedding' or 'The Truth about Cats and Dogs'. The apprehension that clung to the bosom of my weariness lay more in the lack of any depth to the character/s. Bridget Jones is naive and abit thick - you'd think that any woman who was now about mid 30s could at least have a decent stab (no pun intended) at guessing if some guy (i.e. High Grant's Character) is a muppet. Although I can let that slide on the evidence so many friends have given me on how enigmatic most guys are (and how most of us are bastards, haha).Some of the jokes will most likely need explaining to quite a few guys. One example is why a chorus of laughter followed her getting drunk and singing bad love songs alone. Another example is when she's sliding down a pole, smacks her arse into the camera and generates crowds of girly laughter as if the audience had been contracted to provide tinned laughter for some slap-stick home video show.One issue however was with the tedious-neuroticism of Bridget Jones and her celebrating the latest fashions of excess with her incessant drinking and smoking. As I say I don't hate romantic comedies, it's just that this one seemed proud to have no depth and sectioning 50% of the humour to the 'Need to be explained to men' section...If your a girl you'll probably find this a stunning exploration into the amorous side of woman-kind, where a single real-sized woman stands up amidst a backlash of what male-kind throws at her. Despite all the disappointments and let-downs, her optimism has not been misplaced as prince charming finally cuts a path through the web of first-impressions, pride and prejudice (pun intentional) to sweep her off her feet... though if you read the sequel, Mark Darcy turns out not so positive.If you're a guy, it'll be mildy funny but a little tedious in places and Renee Zellweger'd get it...",Bridget Jones's Diary
312,ellenmeilee,Richard Curtis woz here,3,7 January 2012,"I read the book - loved it - but the film is unfortunately a cringefest. RZ does her best, but what's with the posh accent, a la Gwyneth Paltrow in Sliding Doors? I do think that a British actress e.g., Anne Marie Duff, who is actually a London gal, would have been a much more appropriate choice.Colin Firth is a great piece of casting - who else could it have been - and he does his best, but frankly the script is beneath him and I think he looks a bit embarrassed himself at times at the nonsense he has to spout. Hugh Grant is great - makes a change from his usual bumbling foppishness, and really well cast.I have added this film to a list that includes Match Point, Sliding Doors and any of Richard Curtis' films - namely - awful, but so bad, they are worth watching just for the unintentional comedy.",Bridget Jones's Diary

I've watched it over 10 times already, and none of the gags/jokes get old at all. I simply loved all the characters in this film: Bridget's friends, Bridget (of course), Mark Darcy (of course), Bridget's parents, and even Daniel Cleaver. I couldn't help but feel a morbid adoration for Daniel Cleaver; for some strange reason, I didn't really find him charming in the beginning of the movie, but I digress. The lovely constituents of this movie combined with each other to make this splendid comedy. All the cast members in this movie did an excellent job, and so did all the crew members. Renée Zellweger, Colin Firth, and Hugh Grant acted extremely well, and Sharon Maguire directed the movie superbly; digressing once more, I have to credit Helen Fielding for writing the book that inspired this movie in the first place.

The run time is listed as 97 minutes. It took me a 2+ hours to get through the DVD because of the timeouts wiping away the tears of laughter from my eyes.

316,dumbblonde416,Very Good Movie,10,1 August 2005,"I rate this movie a 10. Renee Zellweger did such a fine job in the role of Bridget Jones, and maybe it was because I am used to seeing her look beautiful in films, but it didn't really look like she gained any weight to me, she just looked like her very pretty self. It wasn't until she had on that bunny costume, where I went..oh, well, MAYBE she gained some poundage, but she still looks pretty. She also does a very good English accent. Colin Firth was so much fun to watch, especially because he is playing ""Mark Darcy"", whereas he played ""Mr. Darcy"" in Pride and Prejudice.I was rooting for him to win Bridget's heart, and I am so glad he did, instead of Daniel Cleaver. I am sure that Hugh Grant is not like this in real life, as repulsive as he is in the movie.I also enjoyed seeing Jim Broadbent in this role, as I have only previously seen ""Moulin Rouge!"" with him in it, and his role in this movie is SO different, I barely recognized him. The women that play Shazzer and Perpetua; and the man that plays Tom are also very good. Shazzer kept me laughing! The only recognizable flaw in this movie is Gemma Jones in the role of Bridget's mum. I found her unbelievably unattractive and so annoying it wasn't even conceivable. I have read the book, and from what I can tell, her mum is supposed to be like that, but I still, even now, every time I watch it have to suppress the urge to wring her neck lol This is a very funny movie, and it is an entertaining one.

318,Brian-45,Surprised at quirky casting,7,16 April 2001,"I enjoyed the movie thoroughly. However, I don't understand why a foreign actress had to be recruited to play the leading role. I found myself very distracted by her accent which, while it was a reasonable facsimile of a ""southern counties"" accent nevertheless failed her occasionally. Perhaps, were I not British I would not be aware of this. Could the reason for her being in this role (in which, to be fair, she was otherwise excellent) was that American audiences need to know that someone with whom they are familiar (i.e., an American actress), ""anchors"" the movie?",Bridget Jones's Diary

And I thought she looked very attractive - in spite of the ""extra pounds.""Much has been made of Ms. Zellweger's weight gain for this role.  All I can say is:  she should have kept it on...  I thought she looked very good and natural.  And I was very disappointed to hear her comments on the talk show circuit following the premiere of Bridget Jones -- that she felt disgusting with the extra weight and couldn't wait to take it off...I think she should take a second look and decide who she would like to be... a little, skinny girl or a beautiful, talent woman...",Bridget Jones's Diary

I LOVE THIS MOVIE!  I LOVE THIS CHARACTER!  ""Mark Darcy"" is the reason why I am still single.  For the simple fact that, I'm holding out for the fairy tale -- *I* deserve nothing less.  ""Mark Darcy"" proves that there are nice guys out there who aren't absolutely CLUELESS and afraid of love. This movie not only made me want to hold on to my ""fairy tale,"" but it also made me believe that it CAN happen.  It also made me want to read the book and learn about British culture.

I have a feeling that there are a lot of people who haven't seen the BBC ""Pride and Prejudice"" in which he starred as Jane Austen's Darcy and who therefore don't ""get it.""  Some of those people might think that he comes across as cardboard, inanimate, and even humorless.  However, Firth makes Darcy so subtle, so just completely as much the off-center character that Austen intended that it's possible to miss how great he is.  Firth is Darcy and he is perfect.  He is full of humor, unseen strength, and, above all, amazing sex appeal.  If you didn't see it in him the first time, watch Bridget Jones's Diary again (a great flick - Hugh Grant is totally on target), re-read Austen's Pride and Prejudice, and just look into those brown eyes of Firth's.  It's all there.",Bridget Jones's Diary

I have seen this movie over and over and over and can hardly wait for it to come out for home release.  I only wish I could rate it more than a 10!",Bridget Jones's Diary
326,stephenawebb,Absolutely Fab!!,8,20 April 2001,"Renee Zellwegger is a STAR!! Its an enjoyable film, both Hugh Grant and Colin Firth are good in their roles. But its Zellwegger's film and she rises to the challenge. After, the Academy missing her in this years nominations - were the five Actresses nominated really better than Renee in Nurse Betty??, she should be a front runner for next year. One criticism of the film - when did it last snow like that in London?? When Dickens was alive??",Bridget Jones's Diary
327,modusa,An American Pride & Prejudice,7,8 May 2001,"Having held the two books by Helen Fielding about Bridget close to my heart, I'll admit I was a little apprehensive about seeing this movie. I was excited about the casting of Colin Firth as Mark Darcy for innumerable reasons, not least of which was the question of the scene in the second Bridget book, when she interviews Colin Firth. Will they have him play himself and Mark Darcy? I wondered. But I guess I'll have to wait for the (much anticipated and hoped for) sequel for the answer to that question. As the credits rolled, I immediately noticed that Andrew Davies name appeared as one of Fielding co-conspirators on the script. Knowing that he wrote the adaptation of the BBC Pride & Prejudice mini-series in which Firth played Austen's Mr. Darcy, I thought that I might see something a little different from the Bridget Jones Diary I know and love so well. And right from the beginning, it appears that the intention is to cleave the books together much more than in the original incarnation. Mark Darcy is much sweeter in the book, and Bridget is much less independent. Mum gets her tv job for her, and overall she is much more reliant on her friends and family to guide her than she is in the movie. They've boiled down the story to the Bridget and her two romances, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. To try to include everything would have required a four and a half hour mini-series along the same lines as P&P. I think they've accomplished what they've set out to do. They've made a happy little romantic picture based on a limited Bridget. She's been Americanized so even though Renee does a great British accent and scarfs down Branston Pickle (ugh!)this movie really is most palatable to an American audience who might not take to Bridget's hard-drinking and ultimately British ways.Oh and Hugh Grant was good too.",Bridget Jones's Diary

I didn't even want to see the movie but my boyfriend and came onto it in a sneak preview show. My general opinion is that a film can never be as book as the novel. Having said that I can safely say that the film is absolutely great. Although it had to be abbreviated, it stays close enough to the book so that readers won't be disappointed. The cast is well-chosen as well and they play their roles convincingly. The only weak spot is that the film is not really British enough.",Bridget Jones's Diary

Finally, a film where the main character is not a Julia Roberts or a Gweneth Paltrow, but an ordinary girl who drinks too much smokes too much and wears granny panties. It was utterly refreshing to have a heroine who has self-esteem issues, who was never the pretty one or the popular one and to watch her deal with life and love as best she can.  And what a wonderful message to see that regardless of how much we try to better ourselves, succeed or fail, there is someone out there who will love us just the way we are!",Bridget Jones's Diary

332,dmy9999,a good film you won't want to miss,8,18 April 2005,"""why there are so many women unmarried nowadays?""maybe 3 main options,I think:1. don't want to get married due to several reasons. 2. want a marriage, but no choice at all. 3. want a marriage, have choices,but don't know which one is the Mr.right.Bridget Jones belongs to the second one.Jamie O'Neal's song ""All by Myself"" tells how Bridget feels deep inside.She is truthful,lovely,a little awkward, trying very hard to find someone to be with for life.She is unlucky to start an office relationship with a wrong person who is like a playboy.However, she is also lucky.Her directness attracts another man and she is carried by his word ""I like you, just as you are"".(I think it is the most romantic word I have ever heard.^^) Since it is a comedy, laughter goes along with the film and I think you won't forget the last scene of the film.Just like other romantic comedies,a happy ending is there, Bridget and Mr.Darcy get together at last.^^(I know in BJD II,the two are at the brink of breaking-up,but luckily,they still get together AT LAST. however,personally,I don't like the sequel. )Renee Zellweger is a flexible actress.She can play a rough county girl with a strong accent and a little husky voice in ""Cold Mountain"" and a passionate sexy girl in ""Chicago"". Her Bridget is also vivid. she did a great job.no doubt she got the Oscar.It is really unexpected to know Hugh Grant plays Daniel.In my mind,Hugh Grant usually plays those romantic good man,like Charlez in ""4 weddings and 1 funeral"" and the guy in ""Notting Hill""(sorry, forgot the name). It was really hard for me to re-build an image for him when the film goes on, but he did a good job.As to Colin Firth,I knew nothing about him before this film. But he is exactly the right person for Mr.Darcy who is deeply hurt by his previous love. Besides,his appearance reminds me of the original Darcy in ""Pride and Prejudice"".A good match I believe.(Colin's role in ""Love Actually"" is also this kind.)I have seen this film several times and enjoy it every time.I recommend it without any reservation.",Bridget Jones's Diary
333,ccave-62620,Destroyed by it's own hype,6,3 May 2019,"I probably would have enjoyed this movie more had there not been so much hype around it. But sadly the expectations were established and definitely not met.Bridget is likeable in a goofball sort of way, and has a few good moments, but overall it was difficult to respect her character and therefor root for her success.It was also difficult to find the relationships believable - especially between her and Darcy, who had little to no interaction. One thing I did like was how she and Darcy noted each other's faults before expressing their love. Too often people have this misconception that true love is someone who finds you perfect and who you find perfect. Those who have been in long term relationships know this isn't the case. There is something genuine in saying ""I see the worst in you and I love you"" and it's a rare take for a romcom.Darcy's business partners role was unnecessary and served no purpose to the plot, other than to make me question how good of a guy Darcy really was. He consistently included her in his life in such a personal way with no purpose other than to avoid attending functions alone. Given how even his family and friends viewed their relationship by the end, it was clear he was knowingly misleading her. But because Bridget is our lead, the writers don't care about the emotional games this woman would be subjected to.It had great potential, but is one of those films you'll only really enjoy if you dont think about it too much.",Bridget Jones's Diary
334,frobnoid,"A good balance of ""girl"" movie and ""guy"" movie",7,4 April 2001,"I went to the preview thinking this movie would be a complete ""chick flick"", but was pleasantly surprised. While it is a romantic comedy, it doesn't have the almost slapstick humour of a ""Meet the Parents"" or come on as strong as ""Sleepless in Seattle."" Most of the humour is based on severe bluntness, but not to the point it becomes unrealistic. ""Hotel de Love"" is the only romantic comedy I can think of that is in the same league as this movie. While I didn't like the movie as much as my girlfriend (who wants to see it again), I was quite pleased with the movie and its definately worth the time to go see it.",Bridget Jones's Diary

Well all I can say is the wait was worth it - This was one of the funniest and most enjoyable films I have seen in a long time. Hugh Grant was good as the womaniser but for my money Colin Firth and Renee Zellweger were both the stars of this film.

Zellweger has a wonderful way of communicating with her face, wrinkling her nose and squinting her eyes and seems sweet even when she is totally upset.  The scenes were beautiful; the acting made me teary at times and at many other times were so funny. There was one situation where she was puzzled but not enough to ask questions which almost doomed her, not too realistic, otherwise the movie is a 10.If you liked Nurse Betty, you will love this movie!",Bridget Jones's Diary
340,sheepeyes,"Just about the funniest romcom in a long, long time!",8,21 April 2001,"I absolutely adored this film. My first impression was how similiar in premise it is to Pride and Prejudice, indeed, it could have been sold as a modern reworking! Any little nigglings I had about Texan Renee Zellweger playing the very British Bridget Jones were completely dispelled with her kicking rendition of All By Myself in the opening minutes! She played Bridget to a tee, perfect accent, slightly chubby and conveying her scattershot, ditzy ways, but still managing to be totally adorable! Hugh Grant was great against type, playing basically a smarmy git! Colin Firth did less well however, he looked uncomfortable everytime he was on screen, but he still manages to smoulder and look moody as hell! His character is basically Pride&Prejudice's Mr. Darcy all over again, but it was a nice touch, as Colin Firth's portrayal of Darcy in the BBC's production of Pride&Prejudice made Bridget go weak at the knees in the book! Over all a superior comedy in every way. Forget Notting Hill and Four Weddings, this is in another league. It's sweet but not sickly and it does what most romantic comedies have failed to do before: make you laugh out loud. An adorable and utterly lovable film, a bit like it's ditzy heroine!",Bridget Jones's Diary
341,dmeshkov,"surprisingly good, went with low expectations, but laughed heartily and lengthily",8,13 August 2001,"This movie was surprisingly good.  I expected a full blown chick flick, with little entertainment and even less humour value.  However, within the first few minutes of the movie, I was not only enjoying myself but almost belly laughing at the well written and well acted film.  Moreover, the humour is not simply the plight of a single, aging woman, but rather how she makes a fool of herself and how her peers (and us, as the audience) laugh at her. She is treated like rubbish and we enjoy it.  Hugh Grant is great, very cool, very believe.  All in all an enjoyable evening.",Bridget Jones's Diary

Yes, alot is missing from the novel, but it doesn't detract, and the totally new bits are among the best parts of the film.Hugh Grant!  Yum!! That's something I've never thought before, but after watching this you'll understand why.  He is fantastic.

You went forget it in a long while!",Bridget Jones's Diary
344,sparklesgirl,Brilliant masterpiece,10,9 September 2006,Bridget Jone's Diary is of course the book that was made into a movie. This movie was released in 2004 mostly for European countries. Renée Zellweger plays the main character called 'Bridget'. Bridget is in her late 30's and is not married; she is very concerned and starts to keep a diary. Now starts the movie. Colin Firth and Hugh Grant co-star as amiable men that she falls for. Other actor/actresses like Jim Broadbent and Gemma Jones also co-star. I would give this movie a 10/10 for an excellent script. The movie is very humorous and shows different personalities of all the actors. The movie does contain sexual references and swearing so watch out if you are seeing it with younger children. Renee shows how wonderfully she can fake an English accent in this movie as well because of course she is American. This is probably one of the best pieces of works i have seen from Colin Firth as well. The movie must have been good you may think because there was a follow-up. The movie soon spread to America and critics from over here also give it wide remarks. I would recommend this movie too you 100%. Thanks for reading this and have a nice day! Bye,Bridget Jones's Diary
345,lillianecoldwell,"Wonderful, must see movie",8,24 April 2001,"Renée Zellweger packs a punch as a 30-something Bridget Jones in the brilliantly directed movie ""Bridget Jones's Diary"". She takes this character and embodies her as no one else can. Even though she is a native Texan, you'd never know it due to the superb work done by dialogue coach Barbara Berkery. While the movie does not stay true to the book, the literary license that has been taken is so cleverly done it doesn't really matter. Hugh Grant and Colin Firth, as her two suitors, are equally convincing in their roles. The plot line follows Bridget from one New Years to the next through her daily diary entries. She makes several resolutions to make her life better and as we find out, they don't exactly work out that way. From the very beginning of this movie, you'll find yourself captivated with her wit and humor. Aimed mainly at the female audience, this film charms one and all.",Bridget Jones's Diary
346,solange9,Wonderful treat!,9,4 August 2001,"I was a single who spent most of her twenties living in London during the 1960s. This movie is spot on! I couldn't fault Zellwegger's accent at all. Hugh Grant is finally playing the kind of sleaze-bag we know he must be in reality and Colin Firth was the obvious choice for Mark Darcy. Loads of laughs right through and I loved the fight scene, especially with Geri Halliwell's 'It's Raining Men'. It's politically incorrect these days to show a lot of smoking and drinking, but that was certainly part of the scene in the past. Suspend your political correctness and your cynicism. Go see it and have a ball!",Bridget Jones's Diary
347,Jkirkland2000,LOL!!!! They finely got it right!,10,10 June 2001,"Finely after years trying they did finely get it right a British film to be proud off!!! Love or hate it this film still fires on all four cylinders and never stops!Forget Four Weddings and Notting Hill this is in a whole new league and its easy to see why.  The three leads all deserve oscars for there performances, Hugh Grant for once gets his chance to shine and play a bad guy! (well tries to anyway)I loved this film and boy could I understand how Bridget felt!  Having the two perfect but different male stereo types to choose between, it got very confusing when both were on screen (all power to the actors here)Hugh Grant superb, Renee outdone her performance in Jerry Maguire and came one better here and as for Colin Firth someone who yes I had heard from due to P & P(never watched though) came completely into something of his own here and outacted everyone especially in the last half hour when we at last see the true character!!!!!!!Now I understand what they mean about feeling weak at the knees and sending your heart racing, you can not take your eyes of him in this film.  Made for the part and finely someone we can call a true British heartthrob, I really hope he now gets more big movie offers he deserves it after that performance!This film has you in laughter in one moment and tears the next. The fight scene was really good, the ending was an old movie classic brought into the 21st century and this film had a heart and soul to which you don't get often in these days of big names and big budget films.In short absolutely amazing, the chemistry between Renee and Colin made this film.  Anyone that says otherwise is wrong!  There were so many small moments that made this film from the blue soup, to the I like you the way you are, the missed the cake and went through the window fight!, the boat scene and Bridget's no, no , no!

348,popes002,I liked Bridget Jones: she is different,10,12 March 2002,"This  movie is extremely pleasant, funny and endearing.  It is also a relief to break from the typical perfectly successful, thin, invariably rich blonde that one finds in the American movies from the same class with Bridget Jones (such as ""When Harry met Sally"", ""Sleepless is Seattle"", ""You've got mail"" etc.  Love Meg Ryan, but sorry! have to be honest.) Bridget is different especially through her ability to think about what she is and what others are.  And, as some of us know, when one has a world inside one's head, sometimes one goofs with the world outside!  The script could have been better, sometimes things go too fast, I think.  But it follows the book and it doesn't disappoint. Renee Zellweger delivers a performance decidedly worthed an Oscar, she has the talent of a great comedienne.  Colin Firth is wonderful (as Mark Darcy), he can do a heartbroken, handsome, rich divorce like no other (hopefully he can do more than that!).  I love Colin Firth in all his movies that I have seen; unfortunately, his presence in this one gives the movie an air of unrealism, because the guy is too handsome not to be snotty and vain.  But because he is so unbelievably good natured, he makes us dream that he could be a real man.  Hugh Grant succeeds in being annoying, which is the purpose of his character (Daniel Cleaver). One should not accuse the movie or the character Bridget Jones for lack of philosophic depth, for imperfection, pretentiousness, or anything alike, because this movie is not trying to show how we should be, but is just telling a story of how some of us are.  The story is beautiful, the characters are well contoured and there is enough romanticism (see unrealism!) to make one dream and want to see the movie again, or read the books again. Another excellent point for the movie is that it is definitely not targeted to the half-brained sex-obsessed American teenage generation.",Bridget Jones's Diary

I think everyone both male and female have been through the ups and downs of love. What's great about this movie is that it doesn't rely on stupid tricks and plot devices to get through the basic point of...all you need is love.

But happy endings are possible and not just in the movies. This story is definitely the modernization of Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" but is more true to life than the funky ""Clueless"". Men may not understand all the things women are about, but I bet most will be able to see at least part of Bridget in their girlfriends or wives. Women have long known that their are only two types of men ... the bad boy and the nice boy. The only question is, which do they prefer. I think Bridget has the right idea.",Bridget Jones's Diary

It may be that the novel is better, I can't comment on that, I didn't read it. The film keeps being awful. It is called a romantic comedy but where are the jokes? It just an highly ""escapistik"" movie if you please recall the content. There is a drug addicted, not especially good looking woman in her mid-thirties as protagonist. She is clumsy and has no real abilities. But that is not stopping her in having a career as TV Journalist and two men who are both looking like models want to have her. Huh? That so makes no sense. Of course one could overlook this. But somehow I can't. In an Action movie or a fantasy film, i don't expect realism. Even in more grounded movies I can live without über-realism. But this movie claims to show the life of a woman in her mid-thirties. And this doesn't work for me in the portrayed way. I could ignore this if it were funny. But it isn't.

Renee is awful as Bridget and her attempt at an English accent is atrocious! The actors that played Bridget's friends were unimpressive. Not their fault since they weren't given the opportunity. In the book her friends were over-the-top and such fun people to hang out with. The only saving grace is Colin Firth who plays Mark Darcy. He is everything the book described him to be! He gave an excellent performance! Fans of the book would be greatly disappointed but watch it simply for Colin Firth.

At the sneak I was at, it was split 50/50 between guys and gals, and everyone, including young teen and 20-something guys, were laughing hysterically.

Renee Zellweger does a bang up job of playing Bridget, Hugh Grant is perfect as the sexy bad boy Daniel Cleaver, and of course, Colin Firth is sex on a stick (even when wearing a Rudolph jumper).
For those who've read both books, the casting of Colin Firth creates something of a crisis if they ever decide to film a ""BJD 2"", but he's so absolutely perfect for the part (with those smoldering eyes) that I'm sure we're willing to overlook that trifling detail.I had to go and see this film twice because the first time the audience was laughing so uproariously that I missed quite a lot of the dialogue. Nothing to do with seeing Colin Firth again... Honest!  Seriously though, the film is rich and warm and funny because it's so honest -- we can all picture ourselves in poor Bridget's fuzzy slippers, lipsincing to ""All by Myself""...Bridget Jones is an ""every woman's"" film, with a woman who has actual thighs who is sought after by two of the sexiest guys in English film today.

The gorgeous Renee Zelleweger did a fine job of portraying a British citizen.so much so that one forgets that she is an American. However, I believe a person with such a beautiful voice should not cover it up with a fake accent.  I have never been much of a fan of Hugh Grant and was disappointed when I found out he was in the movie.  His performance wasn't bad, but opinion of him hasn't changed.
Well, enough about the actors.movie review time.  As a single nearly thirty-somethinger, I found this movie hit close to home.for the most part. A story of a single woman's attempt to start the new year out right by losing weight, stopping smoking, drinking less and finding Mr. Right.and tracking her progress in her diary.  Fair enough, simple enough.  However, I found myself watching a character simply bumbling through the new year.including numerous tragically embarrassing moments and landing a great opportunity at her new television job by missing a huge interview but moments later being in the right place as someone she knew saved her butt by allowing her to interview the `headliners' wife.  She didn't lift a finger for this interview but reaped the benefits.  Sure this might be how it sometimes happens in real life but then why would I need to watch it in a movie.I'll simply land a television job.miss an important interview.and hanging out in a corner store until I end up with the interview.it could happen.just give me time.  Okay, so she bumbled her way through the movie.that's what made it so real you say.bull.that just told me that letting life push you around until your content is simply fine.  No, take life by the horns and pull.you can't sit back and simply let it happen to you.As far as the romance was concerned, I found it hard to believe that Cloin Firth's engaged character would move back to England for Bridget after his big New York promotion simply because `she liked him just the way he was'. Wow! She liked him! Let's throw away a New York promotion and a marriage engagement with a woman to whom, for all we know, there has been a lengthy and deep romantic relationship.  We know little about this other woman which is why it's easy to root for our heroine.yeah Bridget deserves him that's the way it's suppose to be.  Limiting ones knowledge about a situation always makes their way right and feel good and the other way wrong and inconceivable.  Its okay though.what ever makes money for the movie biz these days I guess huh?But with all of that said, I am a sucker for a happy ending and am a huge fan of Renee Zelleweger, so I'll rate this movie as one star better than average.six of ten stars.",Bridget Jones's Diary
365,swimnjello,Bridget Jones v. charming,9,4 April 2001,"The film version of Bridget Jones Diary is one to applaud.  Although some instances were excluded, the film is just as charming and remarkable as the book.  Zellweger is an enchanting Bridget Jones and just as Bridget's character is funny and lovable, so is Zellweger's performance.  Firth and Grant put in v. good performances as Darcy and Cleaver as they are both amusing and suave in their roles.  Even the music throughout the movie played a vital part in the film's explanation of Bridget's mood and feelings.  You'll laugh, cry, and sigh throughout the film as you see Bridget's foibles and love dealings.  You may even be surprised at how the film proceeds to share Bridget's experience.  I like it, very much, just as it is.",Bridget Jones's Diary

Bridget is a less than perfect girl, seeking a more than perfect life.  She does her best to succeed in work, sex, and fun, and more often than not she does her best at failing with hilarity!  This is a movie to see, and a book to pick up and read!",Bridget Jones's Diary
367,funky_jm,Read the book!,2,28 October 2001,The book was much better than the movie! The film left out so many parts in the book that made the book absolutely hilarious!

368,kai_farnhill,Brilliant Bridget,8,12 April 2001,"The story of a career girl in London fighting herself, her boss, her mother and her dinner parties. Ingredients for a comedy? Most definately.Settling down in a darkened room, having to endure the loud grating snickering of hysterical teenage girls is certainly not in my top 20 'things to do' list. But, come to think of it...Seriously, this is a raucous British comedy which left me feeling good.The story's simple. A three way love triangle theme, the way of many a great theatrical yarn. And this is great!  Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger) meets Mark Darcy (Colin Firth), a barrister of great repute, at one of her mother's yearly 'curry' get togethers. The word 'repel' would not fully describe their first rendezvous. Bridget works in the hustle and bustle world of London publishing,Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) is her sexually carniverous boss who charms 'Jones' to bed, a seemingly perfect match. Rejection leads her to begin her diary.The screenplay written by Richard Curtis(Four Weddings, Blackadder et c. et c. et c.) and Andrew Davies(Middlemarch et c. et c. et c. ) adapted from the novel by Helen Fielding  gallops on and on, at a pace that doesn't leave you much time to breathe, with stylish wit and humour. All credit has to be given to the director Sharon Maguire for keeping hold of those reigns!The role of Bridget Jones, certainly controversial, was an inspired choise.  Renee Zellweger was so convincing as the clumsy, bumbling, thirty-something looking for Mr. Right - You'll just fall in love with her! Colin Firth and Hugh Grant deserve their due. Also, watch out for Sally Philips the hip and crazy 'journo' Sharon ""Shazzer"". From the hilarious 'Smack the Pony' and a multitude of TV roles to the widescreen of cinema - let's hope her career continues to flourish.All in all, this is not a 'classic'and does not pretend to be so. It's just good fun - so get down to the cinema and join in!",Bridget Jones's Diary
369,daanvr,Most brilliant film ever,8,4 July 2001,"At our local cinema there is a special event, once a week, called ""Sneak Preview"". Every week I'm visiting this preview which shows a movie that isn't in the theaters at that moment. When my friend and I entered the cinema a little late, commercials were over, we saw the opening scene of Bridget Jones's Diary. At first sight I thought it was Pearl Harbor or something, but while looking closer, I saw it was Rene Sellweiger walking trough the snow. Then everybody started screaming: ""Oh my god, there playing Bridget, their playing Bridget"". This includes me, I waited so long for this film to come out, and I was so happy to see it at last. The film was really great, the type of humor used was fantastic, and the actors were even better. I really liked Hugh Grant, in a completely different character then the usual. I also enjoyed the view of Collin Firth, he really was the right person for this particular part. After seeing the movie I immediately bought the C.D. and the book, and I'm still enjoying it!",Bridget Jones's Diary
370,Ed_Vardy,I was genuinely surprised by this great film.,8,2 April 2001,"I caught this film at a special preview in January, so it is possible that the version that I saw will be different from the final release.  However on the whole I suspect that they will keep most of it. I was expecting a girly film that I (being a bloke) would not understand and thus not enjoy.  However (after a dodgy karaoke style start) the movie settled down into an enjoyable character driven comedy.  You end up enjoying Bridget's failed attempts at making a mark for herself whilst wishing that all will come good in the end and that she will choose the right man. Hugh Grant and Colin Firth are excellent as the love interests, with both of them having good and bad points, such that you can see why Bridget is attracted to both of them. Zellwegger is great and after a while you get used to her ""English"" accent, although at the start you feel like walking out, but then again the non-English people watching this probably won't even notice. Anyway a great film for both guys and girls, very funny.  Highly recommended.",Bridget Jones's Diary

373,dollfan56,Its the battle for good vs naughty,10,8 August 2006,"What a dilemma! Do you go for the revved up, sexy bad boy or the stable, common sense, respectable, honorable and loyal... It deals with that, self esteem and the ups and down of fitting in. Isn't it nice to see reality in a movie without blood and guts? Bridget is so vulnerable and yet she is stronger than she gives herself credit for. She is sensitive and sensible, yet she doesn't know it yet. She also has to deal with parent issues and struggles of life. All the characters play their parts incredibly. They do such a great job you wonder how much of themselves they really are playing vs. acting. I think this is a great flick. I love it!",Bridget Jones's Diary

Zellweger acts rather limited regarding above all her mimic expressiveness. H. Grant plays the same rule as always...and C. Firth seems to be a dull old stick.

I think there must be a bunch of, at least, 20 movies that can equally share the title of ""Worst Movie Ever Made"". But this one is surely among them. It is not funny, it is not dramatic, it is quite slow, there is no action, it is no ""noir"" movie. It is non-sense (Bridget should be a not so good looking girl with problems with the opposite sex, but she has two guys interested and in the end they fight for her). It's just a pain. After the prologue, when titles starts to appear, I was already bored. But I wanted to see it all because I really wanted to change my mind, some time during the movie and say ""well, it's not that bad""...... Well, it really is ""that bad"" !!!",Bridget Jones's Diary

381,jmerrington,A film with major problems.,3,10 August 2003,"I can't say I hated this film at all, though I have a lot of pretty major problems with it. Ok, the first: I don't think Briget is a likeable or sympathetic character. Her romance with Mark seems not only contrived but also lacks even the slightest chemistry or realism. Its little more than a ridiculous feminine fantasy lacking anything deeper, like actual emotion for instance. Her boss is a much more realistic and likeable figure - he makes one mistake and has to pay for it over and over again. The fact that he doesn't want to settle down with Briget and get married, etc, makes him evil. Are men then meant to wait their entire lives for the perfect woman and forsake all others? Come on. Secondly, it bothers me that for an English film to be accepted by America (I class this as an English film very loosely) it seems that it has to be concerned only with the dull lovelives of obnoxious upper middle class London media types, who amount to less than 0.1% of the population. As an Englishman I see nothing of the England I know in this film, or in Sliding Doors, Notting Hill, etc. Thirdly, the music is gut-wrenchingly appalling. Having said all this, I still don't hate it.",Bridget Jones's Diary
382,jacheia,Great for Jane Austen fans!,10,9 March 2002,"Any Jane Austen fans out there who adored the A&E mini series of the great book ""Pride and Prejudice"" will adore Bridget Jones' Diary.  Although Renee Zellweger's accent leaves something to be desired in places, she does a decent job of portraying a Brit.  But, then, what can you expect? Honestly. Colin Firth (Mark Darcy) is, as usual, stunning in this movie.  He does a phenomenal job of taking Mr. Darcy out of the Jane Austen movie and snapping him forward almost two hundred years and making it realistic.  Granted, a lot of this is credit to the author of the book (and the screenwriters), but he really does a smashing job and it does help that he was in that original great production of ""Pride and Prejudice"".  Again, for any Jane Austen fans, you will greatly appreciate the wealth of random ""Jane Austen movie"" characters from other adaptations of her books: Gemma Jones, James Faulkner, Jim Broadbent, Embedth Davidtz, Hugh Grant (of course), and Colin Firth (of course)!  It's a great plug for the origination of this storyline.  And it really is a great modern adaptation of Jane Austen.  Not quite as inventive as ""Clueless"", but great nonetheless.  Props to Helen Fielding for her great novel, and as well to the screenwriters.  This is a movie I would recommend to almost anyone.  Although, I have heard the criticism that the female character is whiny and unintelligent and on a completely lower eschelon than Mark Darcy (from a man, of course), I would definitely say this is a movie for the woman who has always wanted that one unattainable man--as well as a movie for those who believe in true love and that it truly does conquer all...even drunken stupidity, clumsiness, and outright moronic behavior. This movie proves that attraction and connection honestly are the two most important things when it comes to how we choose a life-partner...and that they're not exactly something we can control...",Bridget Jones's Diary
383,janet_joseba,Pure entertainment !,10,8 October 2008,"I saw this movie in 2002. I was, I remember, in a rather low phase those days. I'd actually gone for another movie but ended up buying tickets to this as the one I went for had a full house.Boy! I guess my stars led me to it! I left the hall fully entertained, satisfied and strangely with full of hope and a new vigor! The movie cheered me up and made me forget my sadness. I simply felt lighter and happier. And, although little over carried away as I might seem, this simple pleasure the movie brought me and the positiveness I felt is certainly worth sharing.Rene is truly truly fantastic! what an achievement for her! she totally deserves her best actress nomination and should have won it too! see the work! What an acting! A girl from the glamour world that she is and doing that and with such real effects that we can't help it but be totally CHARMED by her despite the character's many faults. Absolutely lovely and heights of romance! Back then, I did not know Colin Firth and had not yet seen him in Pride and Prejudice (Classis! Classic! Classis!). The man blew me away! I fell in love with him and set out on a rampage to find all his works! He's a perfect dream man. And Hugh Grant just sizzles the screen with his perpetual mega play boy good looks. He played his role wonderfully and was really really funny. His attitute and mannerism towards his treatment of Mr.Darcy is a roar. Darcy, so uptight and he, so loose and free - each thinking himself more up than the other. He entertained me the most! all three of them are marvelous in the movie! The story is fascinating! Unconditional love. two pole ends meeting and finding they suit each other. To have someone love you just the way you are even if you are a little pathetic..etc..etc. Go see the movie & enjoy. Think happy thoughts and escape to fantasy land.

384,Luc_Emuru,Funny,7,12 June 2004,"I adore Jane Austen. The woman could have been a Behaviorist, so far was she ahead of her time. Add to that her keen insight, sharp and witty tongue, and impeccable prose style, and we undoubtedly have one of the top 5 or so authors of the 19th century. While I agree that Bridget Jones's Diary could not possibly compete with Miss Austen, though based on themes and characters from several of her works, I have to say I found it extremely entertaining in it's own right.Renee Zellweger is a talented comic actress, and anyone who can play a difficult comedic role with such skill and finesse cannot possibly be as clumsy and inept a person as the character she is depicting, however limited she might appear to some. She made me laugh and call out to my roommate to ""Come and watch this girl; she's a scream!"", something I am not in the habit of doing on a regular basis.Hugh Grant was equally funny, and a wonderful foil for Colin Firth's character. Bridget's family was hideously but hilariously portrayed. I am normally not an admirer of the getting-older-woman-looking-for-a-husband-before-it's-too-late genre of films, but this was really less tired and superficial than some of these have turned out in the past.

This movie, even with the hilarious script and the two British men who make every married woman wish they weren't (Grant and Firth), the movie would not have been such a success with Renee Zellweger, who once again proved to be one of the best comedy actresses we have around. Relieving audience of the usual clichéd romance stories that get thrown in their faces, or the mindless comedies, comes this masterpiece that revives the rom-com genre and has you pulled in from the first scene, being so incredibly relatable and the idea that its never too late for a happy ending even if you haven't met Mr.Right in your teens or your 20's when everything's still pointing up is just another perkI would recommend everyone to give this movie a go!",Bridget Jones's Diary

The kind of film watched by teenagers kneeling two feet from the TV set, a box of tissues next too them, their pants at their ankles, remote in hand, masturbating while re watching the same 10 seconds of suggestive soft porn, looking over their shoulders every couple of minutes checking their parents haven't come back from their dinner party. The sad fact is i can imagine that it is actually an accurate representation of some peoples lives (which is why i gave it a 2 instead of a 1).

After seeing this great flick, I can appreciate Bridget's inane desire to lose weight and over fantasize what perfection should be. This film showcases the reality of true beauty. Casting in this film was perfect. As an avid lover of Jane Austen, Mr. Firth as both Darcy & Darcy made the role his own. His humility of looks and demeanor, made his character, dare I say, more sexy, than that of suave, and handsome but slicky-boy, Mr. Grant's. I definitely know who I rather have. Also I enjoyed seeing other fine British actors in this film (so under-utilized in our own American film culture.) Still U.S. born & bred Ms. Zellweger is very convincing as a English girl on the brink. As ""Sex in the City"" is a dish of the inner most thoughts that reflect what seems to me more comic fantasy, ""Bridget Jones"" is a lush serving of the inner most thoughts that reflect a more humorous sense of reality that most of us (singles) can relate to"". For that I wish this was a series to be viewed each week. Still enjoy reading the ""diaries"".",Bridget Jones's Diary

The gals will love it because it is a beautiful romantic comedy and the guys will even enjoy the humor and might learn a thing or two about women.Colin Firth is perfect as the brooding Mr. Darcy, and his dry demeanor almost turns us off until it wins us completely.  Hugh Grant is maddenly the wrong guy we all love to want, and Renee, well, she is amazing.  Although I haven't liked the comments I've heard from Renee after the movie about her weight gain, it's great to see a real size woman garner the attention of two of the hottest men on the screen right now.

Her accent could be better, but it didn't plague me through the film. As for Hugh Grant and Colin Firth one word: YUMMY!!! I was slightly disappointed to see the role of Bridget's friends: Shazz, Jude and Tom reduced to small appearances, only appearing to give Bridget comical insights to her romantic problems.

401,brush-4,Well worth seeing!,9,1 August 2001,"This was a brilliant movie. Renee doing Bridget Jones was extremely well done. To see a typical normal woman doing goofy things and being a normal healthy size female (goes to show you can look sexy without having to be the shape of a stick) made it a truly enjoyable movie. Renee should be very proud of her performance.Hugh shedding his image of 'Mr Perfect' was a nice change, though I love his movies and these roles.  He does the character of Daniel Cleaver being a cad very well and I'm sure there are many males out there that can relate to Daniel's dilemmas with relationships.Colin, what can I say, he was exceptional.  His performance was flawless and was a great shame he didn't get more screen time,  I look forward to seeing more of Colin's work in the future. His character of Mark Darcy is heart warming without being mushy or going too far and being labelled with a 'Mr Perfect' tag after Mark makes some insensitive comments.  The highlight of the movie, however, was the ""just the way you are"" scene between Bridget and Mark. It was moving.Colin, Renee and Hugh each deserve top awards for their excellent performances and Helen for her excellent writing. 9 out of 10 (It would have been a 10 if it had more Mark Darcy screen time!)",Bridget Jones's Diary
402,scolaboy,Very believable...and very charming!,10,15 April 2001,"Bridget Jones is a real person.  She's someone any of us knows, as are her two would-be suitors, her gadfly friends, her stroppy parents and the melange of people who populate her life in this year.  How they got a woman from Texas to sound so believably British is a minor miracle, and it's one of the many ways Renee Zellweger shines in this role. British women need not despair that an American got this role, because she does them all proud. Though I've not read all of Helen Fielding's book, the film captures the essence of a thirtysomething woman struggling for self-definition in a world of pigeon holes.What was even more refreshing was to see Hugh Grant playing a downright scoundrel, departing from the shy, erstwhile characters he usually plays. He, too, deserves kudos for a totally believable.  So does Colin Firth as the stodgy Mark Darcy.  Though a couple of characters in the book were a bit forgotten, the balance of the film is charming, endearing and down-to-earth. It's a film one can enjoy ""just the way it is.""",Bridget Jones's Diary

I was so excited to hear about the film being made. I have to admit, when I first heard about who was playing Bridget I got this awful feeling. However, I'm glad I was VERY wrong. Renee is Bridget to the core; insecure, clumsy, terminally unlucky and absolutely hilarious. Colin Firth just had to be Mark Darcy and doesn't disappoint. Hugh Grant was also a brilliant (but not entirely unexpected) choice for Daniel.I laughed and laughed through this film, admittedly as a hard core fan of the book I was disappointed that some of the plot of changed or was cut out completely. However, the film stands alone and works really well. Men and women of all ages seemed to be enjoying it equally and I am really hoping they make a film of the Sequel book ""The Edge of Reason"" ... it'd be fantastic.",Bridget Jones's Diary
405,tracy_lynn_l,Brilliant,10,30 June 2002,The best movie I've seen in a long time. Renee is brilliant as Bridget Jones and Colin Firth was amazing.

406,UnclePeter,"Funny, insightful if occasionally cringeworthy",8,12 April 2001,"Having never read the books and not been over influenced by the hype for this movie, I went to see it with an open mind, and was thoroughly impressed.  Renee Z is distinctly likeable as the eponymous heroine who's New Year resolutions slowly come to fulfilment throughout the year.  Her unlucky stumblings through relationships, public speaking and fancy dress parties keeps the viewer entertained throughout and often induces the odd empathic cringe (Salman Rushdie's experience especially).  And to be brutally honest her british accent isn't that bad. Hugh Grant is also well cast in the part of the office cad and Colin Firth plays the british barrister to perfection (trust me, I know enough) In all well made, well acted, well funny 8/10",Bridget Jones's Diary
407,colourblinded,ridiculously hilarious,8,5 April 2001,"Being a long time fan of the BJD books (three years and counting), I had nothing but high hopes for the movie version. I was lucky enough to get into a sneak preview last night, and I was not disappointed. The movie, like the book, has the most hilarious lines and moments, and each of the actors portrayed their characters so well you couldn't imagine anyone else in that part.  Renee Zellweger IS Bridget, there is just no arguing it. No other actress could have pulled off what Renee did in this movie. Hugh Grant makes for an excellent Daniel, who is completely two faced and has a smarmy sort of charm that makes you want him just as badly as Bridget does. Colin Firth is a superb Mark Darcy, but that was a given because the character was practically written with him in mind - as all avid BJD readers know, Mark Darcy's character is a play on the Mr. Darcy Firth portrayed in Pride and Prejudice.Some of the more hardcore fans of the book may be disappointed with all the missing jokes and scenes, but to film the entire book would have left us with a 10 hour movie. The writers did an excellent job distilling the essence of the novel, and the finished product has all the charm and wit of the original. The audience, many of whom I'm sure have never read the book (and many of whom, surprisingly, were male), laughed nonstop throughout the film, and everyone seemed to enjoy it thoroughly. As for those of us who have read it, I do believe that this is one of those rare book-to-movie jobs that was really spot-on, and everything that was noticeably changed in the process only makes the movie better.  So go see it, it's hands-down one of the best movies of 2001 so far.",Bridget Jones's Diary
408,stupidchica,"""Bridget"" is charming and endearing",10,5 April 2001,"""Bridget Jones' Diary"" was one of the best movies I've seen this year.  As Bridget, Renee Zellweger was witty, with an adorably self-deprecating sense of humor.  Hugh Grant and Colin Firth (as her boss and a man she knew as a child, respectively) also did well in their roles.  It was such a funny movie, definitely a romantic comedy, but I think guys would like it, too. It was so good, in fact, that although I've already seen a free sneak preview, I would definitely pay to go see it again.",Bridget Jones's Diary
409,patnevin4,Enthusiastic and full of praise,8,5 April 2001,I found Bridget Jones's Diary lewd crude and rude in fact i loved it.Renee Zellweger as Bridget is totally real i saw her on the screen and i believed it.The conflict between the two main male characters was rather obvious but well played.The film had a Four Weddings feel about it and it was probably just as funny.People who are offended by the F word should avoid this film as it more than slightly over used.I have no problem in recommending this film to any body in need of a good laugh.,Bridget Jones's Diary
410,DMC in Newport Beach,Loved This Movie But Now Have Insane Crush on Colin Firth!,9,25 April 2001,"I was pleasantly surprised to find that I actually like the movie better than the book.  My only disappointments were that the movie is way too short and that Colin Firth is not on-screen nearly enough.The entire cast does a fantastic job of bringing Bridget Jones's quirky world to life.  Renee Zellweger effectively portrays Bridget Jones as slightly ridiculous but lovable, and Hugh Grant and Colin Firth are perfect in their respective roles.  It's certainly nice to see Hugh Grant finally take a break from the foppish, stuttering, self-deprecating persona he's been cultivating ever since Four Weddings & a Funeral---and his new buff look (as made evident in the lake/wet shirt scene) isn't bad either!  I only wish the writers had come up with a reason to have Colin shirtless (or at least wet!)As much as I enjoyed the movie, the reason I and my friends have already seen this movie several times and will buy the DVD the day it comes out is Colin Firth and his quietly (but devastatingly) mesmerizing performance. Several critics have commented that Renee Zellweger and Colin Firth have no chemistry, but I beg to differ.  That very palpable chemistry (The way he looks at her when she's interviewing him? The incredibly charming cooking scene? The scene near the end where he leans down to kiss her on the cheek before she runs off to change into ""genuinely tiny knickers""?) is what makes the ultimate resolution of the movie so satisfying.Having long been a fan of British films, I've always been aware of Colin Firth as an accomplished actor (e.g., Another Country, A Month in the Country, Valmont), but it wasn't until Pride & Prejudice that it dawned on me that he was also incredibly attractive.  He then went on to play rather unappealing characters in such films as Circle of Friends, The English Patient and Shakespeare in Love, and, me being the fickle fan that I am, forgot about my crush on him . . . until now.  As a ""serious actor,"" he seems to choose roles that will ""challenge"" him, and unfortunately for us besotted fans, they are often unattractive villains and cuckolds.  But I've come to realize that the fact that he is so successful at masking his undeniable attractiveness is a testament to his extraordinary acting ability.It was clear from Disney's marketing and PR campaign that they felt Renee Zellweger and Hugh Grant would be the only draws here in the U.S., but I know a lot of people who went to see the movie because of Colin Firth.  I can only hope this film will earn him the recognition of audiences (and studios) beyond the legions of women who fell in love with him in P&P. It'd certainly be wonderful to see him fulfill his promise as a leading man (a la Ralph Fiennes and Russell Crowe) and leave all those ""character actor"" roles behind him.It looks like Working Title Films is already talking with Renee Zellweger about making the film version of ""Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason."" Apparently, she's only interested if she doesn't have to gain weight again. Let's keep our fingers crossed that Colin Firth's desire to pursue more challenging roles  doesn't keep him from signing on for the sequel.  I can't imagine anyone else playing the role of Mark Darcy.Finally, I'd just like to say that I wholeheartedly agree with other IMDB users who've described Colin Firth as ""sex on a stick,"" ""dreamy,"" ""swoonsome,"" ""a revelation,"" ""beautiful,"" ""delicious,"" ""riveting"" and weak-knee inducing.  I wonder how many of us will be trekking to London next year to see him on-stage in Hamlet?    SIGH . . .",Bridget Jones's Diary

419,Martha Wilson,Renee Zellwegger (and yummy Colin Firth) were marvelous!,9,22 June 2001,"Very, very good film overall. Renee Zellwegger was brilliant. Colin Firth his yummy self as smoldering hero. Even men friends have loved it -- the fight scene especially, I'm told. Audience laughing loudly and throughout. Was slightly disappointed in ending (bit too contrived and sappy) and annoyed, occasionally, with melodramatic violins (e.g., during ""Tarts and Vicars"" party, when Bridget smoked with her dad outside and during Naked-American-Stick-Insect- Sitting-on-Bathtub"" moment). Otherwise, the music enhanced many of the scenes (e.g., ""All by Myself,"" ""It's raining men,"" ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough,"" etc.). But the crowing glory was Renee's performance. Without her nuances of expression and comedic timing -- I think audiences would have been more critical of this first-time director's cut-and-pasted look. It definitely needed tighter editing and a better flow (musically and otherwise). Also, the British humor was sometimes completely lost on the Americans. Most American women don't find sexual flirting in the workplace funny, or comments from men to women like ""...you dirty bit__"" or ""...you ham-fisted cu__"" funny either. Nor do Americans find heavy smoking and drinking particularly funny. They can't really relate. Wonderfully naughty British humor. Would highly recommend the film, despite criticisms. To tell you the truth, when I raised these issues with friends, they all thought I was being too picky. Everyone I know has adored this film.",Bridget Jones's Diary

421,stephenwallace-1,Oddly dark but a wonderful film performance from Renee Z,10,31 July 2001,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS***I saw this film at its previews in Australia in July and was hesitant and a bit resistant because of all the raves from overseas. Also Renee Zellwegger had only come to Oz very briefly three weeks before for about a minute and there was no real premiere. I was glad she came but I suppose I felt it would have been nice to have her there for a premiere...I though maybe there was something wrong with the film...On first sight I thought the film awkwardly directed, not as smooth as Four Weddings and a Funeral, a bit oddly darker and Hugh Grant seemed to be hamming it up. Also there were some faltering, unbelievable moments towards the end of the film: like the big fight scene between Daniel and Darcy (they smash up a restaurant and the owner says NOTHING!)and the rather ridiculous ending (American style)where Bridget runs semi naked through the  snow in pursuit of 'Mr Darcy'(who walked out of her flat to buy her a new diary without so much as mentioning to her that he was doing it! (He'd just stopped her from going to Paris for New Year with her friends!) Has anyone EVER seen a British woman run out into the snow in her knickers and camisole and a cardigan? I think not. British women are the greatest overdressers in the world, at least when I was there. They are very vivacious women but bold, ridiculous displays of emotional longing are not their forte. Still, I am not British so what do I know?Despite all this I thought the film VERY funny and on second viewing, despite still some of the sometimes formula direction (wide shot, medium shot, close up) there was also some very imaginatively directed scenes (the aerial shot across the wheat paddock seeing Daniel's sports car and Bridget doing her Grace Kelly impersonation was bold and effective and must've taken an age, the title sequence when Bridget mouths to the song 'All By Myself' was inspired as were some of the drunk scenes in her room...the falling out of the taxi etc, and the fire pole sequence.However, for my money the most riveting thing about the film (and the director has to take full credit for this too)was Renee Zellwegger's performance. Considering she's a Texan this was a truly wonderful demonstration of cinema acting. To me, though she still stumbled a little with the accent, she was entirely convincing as the person 'Bridget Jones', she created a very believable person, at least in emotional tone. Perhaps not totally English because Renee Zellwegger has more direct access to her emotions than one sees in English women in general (I'm not saying they're not emotional just that they don't seem to display it!). Well, even more than Australian or American women if it comes to that. What distinguishes her performances (and it's true also of Jerry Maguire)from other actresses is her belief in the intensity of the moment, especially in moments of intimacy in relationships.  Renee Zellwegger takes enormous emotional risks all the time (look at her weight gain for this film) and she understands the way cinema acting works outwards from sincerity and emotional openness and spontaneity. How it can radiate if you only let it. Even Julia Roberts can't get near her in this department.There is an intimate moment with Hugh Grant when they are in bed together on the 'weekend', when he tells her that he has to go back to work and not to the Tarts and Vicars party, when, for a few seconds, she looks at his face(a few feet away)with such intense and painful longing and love that she transcends the moment in that radiant way that only cinema can capture. I don't know any other actress who does this with such easy passion. It looked effortless.There's another moment with Daniel, near the lift after she's been gawked at by the 'tits pervert' Mr FitzHerbert, when he tries to take her aside to ask her out and she suddenly giggles. It's only a moment but the giggle means everything...embarrassment at FitzHerbert, anticipation of Daniel's interest and just general sense of fun. Was this directed? To me it's an undirectable magic moment that must surely come out of Renee Zellwegger's spontaneity. But Sharon Maguire knew about it and got many of these moments out of her actress.When Daniel tells her he's engaged to the American publisher, the camera dwells on Renee till she goes out the door. The subtlety of the pain and emotional transition in her face as she leaves and the subsequent shot of her sitting at her computer, to me, is cinema acting at its emotionally balanced best. It might seem obvious to the eye but I think it is very difficult to get it on film. How often does one see even an attempt at subtlety and understated intensity in big budget movies? Most film acting, especially in love stories, is overstated and over controlled. Renee Zellwegger conveys the inner life of Bridget, the inner passion of Bridget (and all of us) so truthfully that you hardly notice it.
She also allows herself to be dressed in the Bunny outfit, not very flattering, and to pull on huge knickers in a not very flattering shot. This only added to the emotional range and truth of the character. To me, it's great to see an actress (now an A list actress I guess) not protecting her image of herself all the time but actually trying to act the part.I think this attitude, plus Renne's magic intense moments, made Bridget Jones more than it might have been. It still has some very funny lines, a wonderful performance from Bridget's gay friend Tom (?) and from Gemma Jones (as her mom) and some great use of music, though I thought putting It's Raining Men over the fight scene was a bit insensitive. It'll be big hit in Australia. So well done Working Title in general and Sharon Maguire in particular (though with a slight reservation).",Bridget Jones's Diary

I think the character I fell in love with Mark Darcy.  He was at first a ""cold fish"", but later as he revealed himself layer by layer, showed that he was a kind person, that loved his mother.  (Whoever would wear those cute but totally unsuitable jumpers or ties that he gets for Christmas. hehehe)His character reminded me so much of Fitzwilliam Darcy of Pride and Prejudice.  It turns out that Colin Firth has played Mr. Darcy in the BBC TV series.Interestingly, in the movie Mark Darcy possessed some of Mr. Darcy's characteristics - the aloof, snobbish trait, and then later (in the book) saves the day with his unselfish nature, assisting the heroine's family out of a bad situation.Karen Toh",Bridget Jones's Diary

426,justwand,Colin Firth is magical! It is a pity that most Americans don't know who he is.,10,17 November 2001,"Bridget Jones's Diary is full of lighthearted fun.  The cast is wonderful - especially true for Colin Firth. His performance is magical.  Being given such a thin material to work with, playing a `dreadful cold fish', he has artfully shown Mark Darcy's kindness and charm that gradually wins everyone's heart.  This would be an impossible mission for actors other than Colin Firth.  I enjoy every minute of his performance.  In my opinion, they should give this nice boy more camera times - that's the only complain I have about this movie.  Besides this complain, I have to congratulate the whole production team for successfully creating a movie of such weightless fun, and at the same time being honest and sincere to the human emotions. It is very hard to believe that this movie is Sharon Maguire's first one. I never read the book.  So, you can trust my observation to be totally independent of the book.  If you wish to have some fun and also like to dream a little bit, this is definitely the movie for you. BTW.  If you enjoy watching drama and haven't seen Colin Firth's ""Pride And Prejudice"" (BBC), do yourself a favor and rent it.

Excellent performances by co-stars - particularly Jim Broadbent as Bridget's Dad and a great sub-plot involving Bridget's Mum and a perma-tanned shopping channel guru called Julian. Great cameos from some great British comedy actors add to make this the perfect video for a great night in! Worth the rental if only to watch the opening ""All By Myself"" scene and the explosive Darcy/Cleaver confrontation.",Bridget Jones's Diary
436,saucymonkeyco,Funnier than Four Weddings?,9,15 May 2002,"Definately one of the funniest film of 2001! keep it up Working Title! American actress Renee Zellwegger's flawless English accent really made the film and will no doubt catapolt her into Hollywood! Truly a great film, enjoyable time and time again!",Bridget Jones's Diary
437,klmead,really nice,10,27 June 2002,"every now again i fall in love with a movie. It wont be a blockbuster and I find that many others see it as normal. I loved this movie , I loved the characters . I have the dvd and I would be embarrassed to say how often I have watched it. 10/10 =)",Bridget Jones's Diary
438,sandylskinner,Mr. Colin Firth was outstanding as Mark Darcy.,10,30 June 2002,"Colin Firth's portrayal of Mark Darcy made this a most memorable film for me!  It is a joy to watch the low-key acting of Colin Firth, not to mention what this actor can do with his voice, eyes, gestures, and graceful movements during this film.  He makes it look so easy!",Bridget Jones's Diary
439,yanny0808,"I really love this movie, and especially Bridget Jones. She is such a sweet girl, I don't think she is too fat, she is okay, a little chubby, but very cute.",9,28 November 2010,"I really love this movie, and especially Bridget Jones. She is such a sweet girl, I don't think she is too fat, she is okay, a little chubby, but very cute. Renee Zellweger is really a sweet girl and her voice is just amazing very girly and cute. From all the actrices she has the cutest and most outstanding voice.I'm happy Bridget has chosen for Mark and not Daniel. As Daniel has cheated and Mark has the same with his ex-wife. So I think they make a really good couple.The ending I love so much too, I thought Mark was angry because of what Bridget has written in her diary. I didn't expect that he went to buy a new diary for her. It was so sweet to see how Bridget was in little clothes chasing after him and their romantic kiss in the snow was so good!",Bridget Jones's Diary
440,p_pheonix,BJD is the best!,10,7 January 2004,"Bridget Jones Diary is a must see for all. Its really really funny, and the fact that it stars Hugh Grant and Colin Firth makes it even better. This is one of my favourite films of all time, and i can't wait to see The Edge of Reason.",Bridget Jones's Diary
441,yvonne_karatekidgirl,I just got to say...,10,27 October 2003,"....I love it!And it's so funny...And I can identify myself as Bridget....And the movie is so well made and the actors are very good.The men are kinda handsome too,and I just love seeing an actress having some flesh on its body...love it!",Bridget Jones's Diary
442,beth251993,Really good film,10,3 May 2017,"I heard many different reviews about this film, so wasn't sure what to expect. But I really enjoyed the film. It includes a lot of comedy and I would recommend this even if you haven't watched the others. It's definitely worth the watch. Definitely a gripping storyline to keep viewers interested and never gets the boring moments as many films do.",Bridget Jones's Diary
443,vt_house,Just do it.,10,4 May 2013,"Still LOVE this film after 12 years. Just finished watching Bridget for the ??? time (can't count that high). Every time I see Darcy look at Bridget during the birthday dinner, I melt. What normal woman can't relate to how well men can bring out our worst?!? Love Renee in this film (not so much in BJD 2, I'm afraid); love the Pride and Prejudice connections, want to marry Colin Firth in my next life (sorry, Honey!).Suspend reality for an hour and a half, and embrace the madness. Don't forget to view with some Chardonnay!",Bridget Jones's Diary
444,aqessaninda,A very funny and romantic film,8,31 May 2014,"An insecure 30-something woman had affair with her womanizer boss, intimidated by a perfect human rights lawyer that turns out he likes her just the way she is..A very funny and romantic film with snow and London views. A charming Colin Firth, a cool Hugh Grant, silly and funny Renee Zellweger with romantic songs as the soundtrack such as Ain't No Mountain High Enough by Diana Ross and I'm Every Woman by Chaka Kahn.My favorite part are: - When Darcy told Bridget that he likes her just the way she is - When Darcy and Bridget had having dinner with Bridget friends - When Darcy beat Daniel - When Bridget resigned - When Bridget just knew that Darcy wasn't wrong - When Bridget ran off to Darcy with leopard underpants in the snow",Bridget Jones's Diary
445,teamlol,Could've had more cute girls in it,6,11 August 2005,"The darker haired girls tended to be cuter, and I would say many flattering things about that one girl at the dinner party, and I'd love to get all up in Bridgette, but seriously, more hoes and fewer ho'mones. The tired antics of Hugh Grant, or ""captain charming"" as I've playfully dubbed him compel me to give away the ending of the movie. Hugh Grant = Bad Guy. And not just bad, but like, ick, girlfriend. Movie failed to deliver on its promise of 'brief nudity' and the 'blatant homoerotic/drug overtones' were highly overrated. The anachronism of the diary only made the movie's pretense all the more flimsy. I mean come on, everyone knows it's all about blogging these days.",Bridget Jones's Diary
446,nannan-1,brain meltingly stupid,1,22 November 2011,"the person who wrote the lines for this movie should be put in solitary confinement for one week so she/he could be bored to the edge of insanity as this movie had done to me.i tried hard to pick out even 20 seconds of footage that was not completely insufferable. i failed. i recognize the moments when the audience are supposed to laugh, instead of even a chuckle i feel like pitching myself in the thigh. think of a bowl of old soggy salad mixed with cigarette butts and pieces of eggshells.clichés, check. utterly predictable plot, check. ridiculously unrealistic characters, check. extreme cheesiness that makes you feel like you're teething again, check. flat jokes, check check check check.decent cast but god have mercy--what a bomb.",Bridget Jones's Diary
447,stephen509,Bridget Jones review: By me!,10,19 January 2006,"i absolutely LOVE this movie. Its had me in tears of laughter. Bridget Jones, arguably the funniest film of 2001, I think you'll agree. This is a film for anyone over the age of 15, but honestly I think seeing as I'm not fifteen myself, everyone will most probably love it. But, I'll give you one piece of advice, DO NOT, and I repeat DO NOT watch it with your parents or grandparents because it will lead to utter embarrassment.The Storyline- It's New Year's Day, hung over and still single, Bridget Jones- a 30-something year old journalist girl from London-decides to start a great new life. And in order to do so, she decides to keep a diary. Of which she rights down everything from her calories gained to her instant messaging with Daniel Cleaver (her boss). She makes new years resolutions such as: to stop smoking; make better use of time; and learn to programme video. It is a film like no other, a masterpiece of great storytelling. As for the genre-it is a Romantic Comedy, which is very equally balanced, which on one hand, makes you feel very sorry for Bridget at times, but on the other will leave you laughing uncontrollably. I mean, come on, how many films have you seen with a great storyline, a love triangle, and that can make you laugh till your ribs hurt? Now I think of it, not many!Characters: Mark Darcy, the love of Bridget's life, and Daniel Cleaver, quite funnily enough, also, the love of Bridget's life are sworn enemies. Mark is a very upper-class sophisticated character. Who is sometimes very up himself. Daniel is the complete opposite; he is a very laid back easy-going character. Jude, Sharon and Tom-Bridget's three best friends which give her some of the worst advice you can think of. But they do try to help, Tom-The main character-Bridget is a working class girl, slightly overweight, or so she thinks. She is infatuated with Daniel before Mark comes along.Movie Soundtrack-Well, I can't say it has the best choice in music to be honest, but its okay, if you're into the whole complaining of heart-ache scene. But I suppose it goes well with the movie so I can get over that. On the other hand, there are quite a few classics in the movie such as; all by myself and without you.",Bridget Jones's Diary
448,hborgida,Tries too hard,5,25 April 2018,"As a rom com, this film had humor and romance, but the two didn't mesh well. It was so often cringe-worthy in its attempt to over-normalize Bridget, making audiences truly pity her rather than relate. Even the most socially awkward of us don't spit out our thoughts at the most inappropriate times as she does. Colin Firth managed to portray charm and endearment while remaining externally aloof and haughty, nailing the ideal romantic interest in a way less obvious than usual. Unfortunately Hugh Grant did not pull off the same feat, making it hard to like Daniel Cleaver even in his romantic moments, making the ending all the more predictable to anyone in the audience unaware of the original novel the film is based on, Pride and Prejudice. As a modern adaptation of the classic, it's not as progressive as I'd hoped, with Bridget Jones still seeming too helpless and the male characters still too dominating when not downright harassing, making it seem as if Jones can't handle herself, very unlike the original heroine Lizzie Bennet. All in all, it was an entertaining film that just tried too hard to be relatable, but captured a sweet romantic ending. Perfect for a lonely night in.",Bridget Jones's Diary
449,Lennie_Hakola,The most stereotypical crap that came out of Hollywood...,2,27 September 2006,"Movies are supposed to be entertaining, informative or maybe even a little bit of both, and I know that most movies out there fail to do any of those things and Bridget Jones is one of those movies. But why?It's the stereotype of stereotypes. Let's do a checklist:Desperate single woman: Check!, two guys that wants her: Check!, she ends up dating both during the movie: Check!, the guys fight: Check!, sexually oriented jokes throughout the movie: Check! and finally a standard Hollywood ending: Check!If you have seen a romantic comedy, you know the drill. Sure, my expectations weren't high, but dear god, this was bad. The character's had ONE personality trait per person, the acting wasn't anything mind-swaying, the script was lame and the movie was incredibly predictable.If you've seen one, you've seen them all.",Bridget Jones's Diary
