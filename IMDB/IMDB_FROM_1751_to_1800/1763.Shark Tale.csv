0,MartinHafer,A knock-off of FINDING NEMO that lacks heart,6,10 June 2007,"I was not a huge fan of FINDING NEMO, though when compared to this film it is definitely a superior film. That's because while NEMO was a much simpler story and designed more for little kids, SHARK TALE was rather dark and grim, plus I didn't appreciate all the ""with it"" hip-hop references or inclusion of Robert De Niro as the boss shark. If I want to see De Niro, I might watch GOODFELLAS or RAGING BULL and I can't see why such an adult actor is given a role in what should have been a purely kids' film. Nothing new or memorable here--just a pale imitation of NEMO with some heavy-handed touches. The charm just isn't apparent and I can't see a compelling reason to seek out this film, though it is an agreeable enough time-passer.",Shark Tale
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Nice to look at, but I have seen superior animated films...",6,10 May 2009,"I did like Shark Tale, but there is a lot wrong with it. I did think the animation was very nicely done, and I liked the references to Jaws and Godfather. But I do think that Finding Nemo was much better than this. Shark Tale could have been a great film, had it not been devoid of humour and heart. My first problem with the film was Will Smith. He tries to be funny, but as the film progresses, he gets tiresome, and at times you feel like you want to reach into the screen and put a hand over his mouth. There were times when the script was funny, and there were some nice ideas, but the pace of the whole film was uneven. The characters could have been developed a lot more, particularly Lenny(a nice surprise from Jack Black), and whereas there were a number of nice visual jokes, there is some very over-familiar material in the script. Kids may find the sharks a bit frightening, and adults won't find much to enjoy, with the exception of the talented voice cast, such as Angelina Jolie, whose Lola(a very beautiful fish) was one of the better characters, Rennee Zellwegger, who deserved better than she was given and Robert DeNiro, whose shark was just a caricature of the Godfather. Though it is Martin Scorsesse who gives the most entertaining vocal contribution. And I did like the music score. All in all, it is nice to look at, but there are some parts of the film that aren't as interesting as intended. I did like the film, but I was kind of confused at who it was aimed at. 6/10 Bethany Cox.",Shark Tale
2,SnoopyStyle,Can't take Oscar's cynical lying character,4,17 February 2014,"Oscar (Will Smith) is a tiny prey fish working at a Whale Wash. Like everybody else, he cowers in fear of the sharks. In a freak accident, he survives a shark attack, and everybody believes that he actually killed the shark mobster's son. He encounters the shark mobster's other son Lenny (Jack Black) who is a vegetarian and they concoct a great scheme to increase his reputation as the Shark Slayer.First off, I don't like Oscar's character. Second I don't really like the Godfather motif. The animation is OK for the era, but I don't really like their faces either. The automatic comparison is to 'Finding Nemo' from a year earlier. The one word I describe Nemo is joy. This one leaves me feeling the blues. Oscar is a cynical fish, and his well being is of little importance to me. Also none of it is funny. It's just a bunch of quirky fish equivalence to the real world.",Shark Tale
3,jboothmillard,Shark Tale,5,13 December 2009,"From Dreamworks Studios, who had huge success with Shrek, I was really looking forward to this computer animated film for the cast more than anything else, but I was up for a giggle too. Basically, beneath the deep salty sea live Oscar (Will Smith), the young whale washing and tongue cleaning fish who aspires to be famous, with best friend Angie (Renée Zellweger) having a crush on him. Oscar chances on an incident that brings him instant fame, an anchor drops onto a shark killing him, and everyone thinks that it was Oscar that defeated the shark, so he has become known as the ""Shark Slayer"". Don Lino (Robert De Niro) and his mob gang are in fear, unaware that Don's secret right hand Sykes (Martin Scorsese) is behind the merchandising of Oscar, getting attention from Lola (Angelina Jolie), making Angie very jealous. Then Oscar meets the shark he met before after seeing his brother die, vegetarian shark Lenny (Jack Black) who has nowhere else to go, and wants to help him retain his fame faking a death. In the end though, after some chases and squabbles, Oscar comes clean about his fake status, and knows he does love Angie like she does him, and he goes back to his washing job. Also starring Peter Falk as Don Feinberg, Michael Imperioli as Frankie, Vincent Pastore as Luca, Ziggy Marley as Ernie and Doug E. Doug as Bernie. The animation is pretty good, the voice casting is very good, and the jokes along the way do have some good irony and satire. It might be a slightly predictable plot, and be an obvious morality lesson, but with sequences like the ""Car Wash"" song by Christina Aguilera and Missy 'Misdemeanor' Elliott, it is a pretty good family comedy adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, and it was nominated the BAFTA Children's Award for Best Feature Film. Worth watching!",Shark Tale
4,BA_Harrison,Not enough to get your teeth into.,5,5 March 2006,"Despite having the benefits of a very talented cast and some of the best digital animators in the business, Shark Tale ultimately fails to reach the levels of success achieved by its contemporary, Finding Nemo.Nemo had a sharp uncomplicated script that was primarily aimed at the kids, yet was funny and clever enough to amuse the adults as well. The characters were appealing without being too nauseating and the CGI was superbly executed  state-of-the-art, colourful and detailed without being too fussy.Shark Tale, on the other hand, is... ahem... a different kettle of fish. It has a leaden script, hampered by a lack of really funny jokes and too many references to urban popular culture, most of which will go way over the heads of younger viewers. The characters are some kind of freakish amalgamation of human and fish  quite possibly the ugliest animated creatures ever (the fish resemble the actors providing the voices  a bad move!). The CGI is packed with detail but is far too brash and fails to convince the viewer that the story takes place in an underwater environment.Sure there are the occasional funny moments  the two Rastafarian jellyfish and the shrimps made me chuckle  but these are too few and far between. What we are left with is a rather soulless affair that will struggle to find an audience when there is much better out there.",Shark Tale
5,Quinoa1984,An over-rated Hollywood churner that squanders a cast with only minimal interest,4,1 October 2004,"While Sharktale may appeal to an audience out there, it's hard to tell for which one. The film is not a failure, but thanks to the mega-hype by the Hollywood system, with marketing railing up the walls and the stars of the film (only recognizable by voice and oddly shaped animation on the faces) trumped to bring in the kids and adults, would have to do a lot to live up to it. As it is, the filmmakers bring in not just movie references to not only The Godfather but many other crime films and shows, but urban/hip-hop culture, and corporations like the Gap, Krispy Kreme, Burger King, etc. But the film is such in love with the in-jokes that it leaves the story and characters on the cloth-hanger. The jokes that do work are the ones that aren't as over-the-top as the others, or at least those that don't involve flatulence and over-emphasis on ""bling-bling"". This is not to say that there aren't ways to make such elements funny- Shrek 2 just skimmed the line on what was tolerable. But Sharktale gives the audience a story that involves a lot for kids to digest, despite the conventions and clichés of it (little fish wants big things, bets all his money at the sea-horse racetrack and loses, blow-fish boss orders execution, then has a run-in and takes credit for a mobster's son's dead corpse, becomes a celebrity, and is under pressure with the other son who's a bit of a wimp, and with his love interest). As for the adults, the gags and puns sometimes doesn't work either, as did in Shrek or Finding Nemo. Some of the ideal wit that emerged in Dreamworks' first CGI feature, Antz, does come through, like an (all to brief) Abbot and Costello riff by the fish played by Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese. There's even a funny bit with a shrimp cocktail.One big problem in the film is that the casting, while somewhat efficient, isn't utilized properly. Actors like Will Smith and Jack Black can be funny, but the lines and jokes they pull in the film lie kind of flat in the water. This might not be so for some of the kids and adults in the audience. However, Sharktale does depend on a varying sense of humor. The ideas being some of the casting is of interest, like small roles for Michael Imperioli, Peter Faulk, and Katie Couric. But then they don't get much to do. Are they just there because they're celebrities, or does the script give them something to do? From my point of view, the script doesn't deliver, at least with the kind of abandon it used to.In fact, Sharktale seems to compensate such things as a marketing-tested script and mis-casting with the usual extravagant and detailed animation. If not for the huge budget to cast the stars, implement the hip-hop soundtrack, and get the CGI, wouldn't this film be made under a direct-to-video or TV standard? There seem to be two double standards that also got to me as I walked out of the theater- 1) in order for the 3-D to work, as in a classic like Toy Story, the character shouldn't be 2-D. When an actor like Robert De Niro has only one emotion throughout the whole film, and changes at the end of the last act, the character as well as the actor playing him is reduced to something of a video-game caricature. 2) If the message of the film is to accept who you are and not to lie in order to get to the top (an admirable message for kids amid all the phooey in the story), then why would the Sykes character, played by Scorsese, have on the ""bling-bling"" and hip-hop language he hasn't had through-out the rest of the story? Even just as a stand-alone film, aside from the lineage of CGI in the past ten years, Sharktale is just nothing new. It's the kind of film you're glad to see once, so that you know you saw it, and know why you liked it or dis-liked it. C-",Shark Tale
6,studioAT,Shark Tale,2,8 June 2021,This film tries so badly to replicate the Shrek formula that it loses any originality of its own.Not great.,Shark Tale
7,Hey_Sweden,Fun for both kids and adults.,7,21 December 2016,"This CG animated feature can't boast a truly great story, but it does go far enough on the abilities of its very well chosen cast. It stars Will Smith as the voice of Oscar, a tongue scrubber at a ""whale wash"" in an undersea kingdom. Oscar talks big and dreams big, and is tired of being a ""nobody"". So when one of the sons of great white godfather Don Lino (voice of Robert De Niro) perishes, Oscar takes credit for killing the shark, and becomes the toast of the town. He also becomes friends with Lenny (voice of Jack Black), Don Linos' wimpy, vegetarian son.""Shark Tale"" is good entertainment overall, with plenty of amusing character design, and a respectable amount of energy. The filmmakers do come up with a lot of chuckle-inducing jokes, both verbal and visual. But the real hook is in hearing various actors play animated sharks as mobsters. On one level, the movie is okay viewing for younger viewers (although it might be somewhat intense for the youngest of them), and on another level, it's savvy comedy for grownups, with references to well known mob movies of the past.Smith is a real live wire as the fast talking Oscar, De Niro is a pleasure, and Renee Zellweger is appealing as Angie, Oscars' co-worker who's really in love with him. Angelina Jolie is just right as the self-serving, seductive fish who only attaches herself to Oscar when she thinks he's going places. Various other familiar voices here, too: Peter Falk, Michael Imperioli, Vincent Pastore, and Ziggy Marley and Doug E. Doug as a pair of Rastafarian jellyfish. It's a particular treat to hear the master filmmaker Martin Scorsese, who lends his voice to Sykes, a frequently flustered puffer fish.The hip, catchy soundtrack also helps to make this an agreeable 90 minute long outing.Seven out of 10.",Shark Tale
8,dbborroughs,Great cast done in by rotten script and direction,3,3 October 2004,"This movie is almost so bad it hurts. You hurt because your body goes stiff from holding a confused look on your face for way too long your muscles freeze up.This ""Its okay to be who you are"" tale is one of the most uneven films in memory. A sterling cast is let down by script that is obvious, soon to date, and not funny, as well as direction that hammers home every single point. Things that should put you on the floor with laughter have you shaking your head at how unfunny they are. Only the bits with Marty Scorsese have any real punch and are funny from start to finish (And all of his scenes with De Niro are classic).Yes, the animation is fantastic. The work on De Niro's Don Lino is simply some of the best character animation ever put on screen and will be a yard stick for years to come. And yes, there are some funny bits, but they operate in a vacuum and so fail to provoke any real laughter.If you must see this wait for video, or better cable. This is a car wreck.3 out of 10.",Shark Tale
9,Boba_Fett1138,Adults will like this movie better than kids.,8,12 February 2005,"It could be just me but I thought that the humor in this movie was perfect. I laughed lot's of times throughout the movie and was very entertained by it. I however think that this movie will not be loved by young children, they simply will not be able to understand most of the jokes and the movie also lacks some 'likeable Disney type of characters' for them.I never was really interested to go and watch this movie since it got lot's of bad reviews and I thought that the trailer looked horrible and very unfunny. I however decided to pick up this movie nevertheless because I was interested in how the famous voice cast would pull off, Martin Scorsese in particular. I was pleasantly surprised when I watched the movie. the humor was spot on and I was entertained the whole time. I know lot's of people probably are going to hate me for this but I thought this movie was even better and more entertaining than any of the two Shrek movies.The movie doesn't have a whole lot of story and is pretty average in every way. I however feel that this is one of this movies were the story really is secondary. The movie has your average love story, in which Angelina Jolie's character is really unnecessary and adds absolutely nothing, in my opinion but watching Robert De Niro's character scream and shout and giving orders to Martin Scorsese's character on the other hand was absolutely priceless.Will Smith was a great main character and just as entertaining as Eddie Murphy in an animated movie.I predict that the music in this movie will be absolutely hated in 20 years by now, just as much as I hate '80's music in movies now. No, I really didn't liked the songs in this movie mainly because in unlike the Shrek movies, they aren't any evergreens.If you plan to buy this movie for your kids, think twice, you're probably better of watching ""Finding Nemo"" with them. If you're a adult or young adult that likes animated movies, this movie might be worth your time and money, although the humor in this movie is really a matter of taste.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Shark Tale
10,view_and_review,Shark Tale can't hang with the animation big fish,6,28 February 2007,"In the annals of computer generated animations, ""Shark Tale"" will not be mentioned with the best of them. The animation was fine, they usually are. The story is what was totally lacking. I had no interest in a fish trying to become a rich big shot... I mean come on, it was a fish. There were a couple of compelling characters, Oscar (Will Smith), not being one of them. Oh, wait a minute... I'm confusing this movie with ""Finding Nemo""... there were NO compelling characters. Well, I guess those Jamaican Jellyfish weren't so bad. To top it all off, there was nothing to laugh at. Every good animation has to have its good comedic moments, or at least the one funny character. ""Shark Tale"" lacked both of those. But, ""Shark Tale"" was an animation, it was mildly entertaining, and as I always say: it's hard to go wrong with an animation. Let's review: Animation, good. Story, marginal. Characters, not compelling. Jamaican Jellyfish, OK. Movie, mildly entertaining.",Shark Tale
11,anaconda-40658,About as Bad as Any Jaws Sequel.,4,6 October 2015,"Shark Tale (2004): Dir: Vicky Jenson, Bibo Bergeron, Rob Letterman / Voices: Will Smith, Jack Black, Renee Zellweger, Robert De Niro, Angelina Jolie: Computer generated washout about deception. Lenny is the young shark whose father heads the underwater mafia but he is secretly vegetarian. Oscar is a small fish who works at the whale wash where he dreams of stardom, which comes his way when he takes credit for slaying Lenny's brother who was really killed by a lowered anchor. Bland storytelling with a ridiculous finale that forgets that sharks are natural predators. Directors Vicky Jenson, Bibo Bergeron and Rob Letterman are aided by spectacular images that nearly save the film but cannot overturn idiotic storytelling. Will Smith voices Oscar, the small fish destine for greater things. Jack Black voices Lenny whose vegetarian ways provide some humour. Other roles are merely celebrity character based. Renee Zellweger voices the standard female fish love interest, and Robert De Niro voices Lenny's mafia based father who would prefer that his son act like a real shark. Angelina Jolie plays a seductive female fish whom Oscar becomes distracted with. Its references to The Godfather and Jaws are likely to go right over the heads of the target audience, while adult likely should be watching those films to begin with. In the end it seems purposed only as a disciple of the superior Finding Nemo. Score: 4 / 10",Shark Tale
12,Smells_Like_Cheese,All in good fun,7,2 January 2007,"Well, I guarantee you that this is no Shrek, Shark Tale was over all an average attempt at film making for animation, but I have to admit that I still had fun watching it. I recently finally accepted the fact that computer animation is the craze and there will probably from now on be no more regular classic animation, so I've pretty much seen all the new computer animation films and Shark Tale was next on my list. While it wasn't up to par with Shrek 2, I still kinda had fun, especially with the cast.Oscar is a fish who feels like the ultimate nobody and Lenny is a vegetarian shark who's father is kind of the Godfather of the shark world, so his dad expects him to be a meat eating rough tough shark. When Lenny's brother accidentally dies as he's chasing Oscar to eat him, his brother gets slammed on the head with an anchor and dies. Everyone thinks that Oscar killed the brother and names him sharkslayer, too afraid to go home, Lenny stays with Oscar helping him keep his rep by faking a beat up. But when the father wants to see what the sharkslayer is really all about, Oscar may loose his true love, Angie.Well, the jokes were a little off every once in a while and it wasn't as impressive as some other animated films, but I still had fun watching Shark Tale. I was absolutely in love with the cast and the animation was pretty good, you have to admit. I would recommend this for a family afternoon, I think you just have to let go and learn how to smile with this film, like I said, it's all in good fun.7/10",Shark Tale
13,MovieAddict2016,"The best parts are on the trailer, and the trailer was poor.",5,12 February 2005,"I didn't think this looked very promising from the trailers I saw, but it had the vocal talents of Robert De Niro, Angelina Jolie, Will Smith, and Martin Scorsese, so I figured it had to be pretty good, right? Surely they all saw something in the material? Perhaps Jack Black would be funny as the cowardly shark? Nope. It's just poor animation in a poor film with poor humor and so-so vocal talents. First of all Will Smith is too self-aware. He seems to ""know"" he's providing his vocal talents so everything is sickeningly over-the-top and staged. De Niro's good but rarely in the film to be honest. Jolie is OK, Scorsese and Black are pretty funny and Zellweger seems to be most at ease with voice recording.Whereas the animation in ""Shrek"" was rather good (in a purposely fake way) the animation in ""Shark Tale"" is sloppy and disappointing. Also, I hate to sound racist but this really just seems like a version of ""Finding Nemo"" targeted towards the African-American demographic. Oscar the Fish (Smith) and his grandfather (complete with a stereotypical afro) run a ""wash"" and so we get a soundtrack with songs like ""Car Wash."" How original.The humor isn't consistently funny, there are a few good gags but they've all been done before (such as Katie Couric being replaced with Katie ""Current"" - didn't they do this in ""Shrek 2"" with another news reporter??).The fact that all the ads boast FROM THE CREATORS OF SHREK! says something for the quality of this film. It relies upon the reputation of its big brother for success. ""Shrek"" walked the thin line of brilliant satire and muddled adult animation. (I.e. adult-oriented jokes.) ""Shark Tale"" seems to stray from the path and somewhere along the way becomes _too_ adult in nature, creating a rather uncomfortable undercurrent dealing with murder and Mafia and violence and even sex, depending on how far you want to take the implications of the sensuous, seductive fish voiced by Jolie.I'm not going to say it's a bad film because it's adult. I'm just saying that's one of its fault. Overall, it's just not very interesting, funny, well-acted or impressive, in terms of both animation and story. I wasn't disappointed as I didn't expect very much. I'm hoping Dreamworks stops making animated CGI films - they've proved countless times with projects such as ""Ice Age"" and the overrated (albeit enjoyable) ""Shrek"" that Pixar is far superior.I really loved ""Shrek 2"" (more so than the original - by a long shot) and that gave me some hope in this project, but after seeing it I felt assured that the best parts were included on the trailer - and since the trailer was rather unimpressive to begin with, that just goes to show how mediocre this film really is.A milestone: the first CGI film to gain a majority of negative reviews from critics nationwide.",Shark Tale
14,sddavis63,Good Fun For Kids And Adults Alike,7,22 March 2008,"A fun story and good animation make this feature a movie that the whole family can enjoy together. There's nothing particularly deep or original about it, true, but to expect that would be to miss the point of the movie: it's intended largely for kids, who don't really care about depth or originality - they just want to have fun with it, and for parents who just want to be able to watch a fun movie with their kids. On those notes, the movie scores quite well. The characters are fun, and to the extent that one can talk about ""performances"" in an animated movie, both Robert Deniro (as the shark ""Don Lino"") and Will Smith (as the Shark Slayer ""Oscar"") put on good ones.Essentially, Oscar - a tiny fish who works as a tongue scrubber at the local whale wash - is mistakenly identified as the killer of a great white shark (Lino's son). From that point on, Oscar relishes his newfound celebrity, but finds out that his fame comes with a price (he now has to be the defender of the reef against all sharks, and he has to deal with Lino's desire for revenge against the guy who he thinks took out his son.) Oscar teams up with Lenny (Jack Black), Lino's other son, who happens to be a gentle, vegetarian shark who's something of an embarrassment to his tough dad. (This, and Lenny's decision to dress up like a dolphin, lead to some limited social commentary about the importance of accepting those who are ""different"" - which seems to be a message to parents with gay kids, frankly. Adults would get that social commentary; most kids wouldn't.) Eventually, through his adventures, Oscar discovers the value of honesty and Lino comes to understand the importance of accepting people (or fish) as they are.Some of the references in the movie (especially the repeated allusions to ""Jaws"" and ""The Godfather"") are going to be over the heads of the kids watching and, in all honesty, the story - while fun - isn't going to rival either of those movies, either, but what makes this movie work is the ability for parents and children to enjoy it together. It might not be the best movie either have ever seen, but it has enough for both to make it enjoyable. Other featured voices include Renee Zellweger, Angelina Jolie, Katie Couric and Martin Scorsese. 7/10",Shark Tale
15,Buddy-51,The True Chicken of the Sea,7,30 June 2005,"Set on a reef that resembles a pulsating, bustling, underwater Manhattan, ""Shark Tale"" is a reasonably diverting DreamWorks film that makes up in charm what it lacks in Shrek-level sophistication. Lets' face it: the ""Shrek"" movies have set the bar awfully high for animated features and it's hard not to compare every new one that comes our way with those earlier works. Even with that caveat, ""Shark Tale"" still manages to involve us in the world it's created and to make us laugh from time to time.Lenny (voiced by Jack Black) is the ultimate evolutionary anomaly - a great white shark who just happens to be a vegetarian. This is a particularly dicey problem because Lenny is no ordinary, run-of-the-mill shark; he is the son and heir apparent of a Don Corleone-type mob boss (Robert De Niro) who worries that his son may not have what it takes to assume his rightful place as ""godfather"" of the sea. Down at the very opposite end of the food chain is Oscar, a fast-talking, self-described ""little fish in a very big pond,"" voiced by none other than mega-star Will Smith. All his life, Oscar has felt like an unappreciated ""nobody,"" until, one day, through an utter fluke of fate, he inadvertently finds himself heralded as a fearless ""shark slayer,"" a position that gets him into deep trouble when De Niro and his henchmen descend on the reef looking to stir up a little trouble with the defenseless locals..""Shark Tale"" doesn't have quite the sharpness and wit of certain recent animated films, but it is fast-paced and clever enough to keep us entertained for most of its running time. Many of the gangster movie references may be lost on younger viewers, but adults will smile in knowing recognition at the gentle bits of parody thrown in from time to time (we finally get to see that Luca's been doing more than just sleeping with the fishes all these years). The film is lovely to look at, with the urban aquatic landscape beautifully rendered in multi-colored splendor. The three leading actors provide lively and energetic voice work and they are matched by Renee Zellweger, Angelina Jolie, Martin Scorsese and Katie Couric in somewhat lesser roles.As stated before, ""Shark Tale"" is no ""Shrek"" in either the cleverness or laughs departments, but it should keep young and old alike entertained if not exactly enthralled.",Shark Tale
16,cherold,generic,7,12 October 2005,"I only watched about 20 minutes of this, so maybe it's great after that, but after 20 minutes of not laughing or being interested in the story or the characters I just decided to give up. Shark Tale (or at least the first bit) has the feel of a cartoon designed by a computer that was simply fed all the recent hit cartoons. It is achingly predictable in every detail. Which would be fine if it was funny. It's not like I look to cartoons for brilliant, incisive stories that comment on the human condition (although it's nice when it happens). A funny movie about fish would have been just fine with me if it were funny. Ice Age had one of the same writers and it was very funny, and that's what I was hoping for, and I didn't get it.",Shark Tale
17,ElMaruecan82,"It was the Oscar for ""Finding Nemo"", and Finding Money for Oscar...",7,8 June 2016,"Whatever the differences between Disney's Pixar and DreamWorks Studios are in terms of animation and types of stories, I don't think they have been more opposite as when they were fully expressed by the two rival studios when they coincidentally decided to handle the aquatic world, in a one-year interval: ""Finding Nemo"" in 2003 and ""Shark Tale"" in 2004. If it is a coincidence or a case of some 'leaks' (no pun intended) doesn't really matter as the two films don't navigate in the same seas. Starting with Disney, ""Finding Nemo"" was a charming and heart-warming tale about a father fish looking for his missing (and titular) son, while the son was trying to escape from a fish tank. The story featured some of the most dazzling images ever created by Disney Studios, with the same hypnotic beauty as ""The Little Mermaid"" and a story that emotionally resonated like Disney's old-school movies, such as ""Dumbo' or ""Bambi"". For a film made In 2003, to be listed in the American Film Institute's Top 10 Animated movies proved the impression the movie left among the professionals.On the other hand, DreamWorks has always been about very flawed and loose characters engaged into story lines that worked more as vehicles for countless pop- culture references, remember the ""Shrek vs. Robin Hood"" fight with the whole River Dance and the ""Matrix"" parody, or the fairy tale creatures featured in very modern situation? Well, the counterpart of ""Finding Nemo"", titled ""Shark Tale"" isn't much a story set in the Ocean than all the narrative fragments of other classics reassembled to form a seemingly story. It doesn't strike for its originality (""Shrek"" made the AFI's Top 10, not this one) but the creators seem to have built the fun on our recognition of the many movies or pop-cultures elements they refer to.Indeed, there is no situation that is not archetypal, no character-type you haven't seen before. In fact, even the characters look exactly like the actors voicing them. So, if you don't have Scorsese's voice in mind, (which would be surprising) you might recognize his fishy alter-ego from his huge bushy eyebrows just like De Niro's shark has a mole, and Jolie's fish huge sensual lips. That's it, it's déjà vu from beginning to end, even the title is a take on De Niro's father-and-son movie ""A Bronx Tale"". But guess what? the story works nonetheless and this is why I'm surprised by Roger Ebert's review, or personal take on the film.The late critic, who could be wrong but not very often, deplored that ""Shark Tale"" with all its references to classics like ""The Godfather"", ""Goodfellas"", ""Scarface"" and of course ""Jaws"" (the inevitable one, even parodied in ""Nemo"" and that grabbed the earlier laughs in that one), there's nothing left for the usual universal and simpler material that can appeal to children. And he's right. I'm pretty sure that if I was 10 when I saw ""Shark Tale"", I wouldn't have gotten most of the references, and I would have probably enjoyed like I enjoyed 'Fish Police'. However, I was 22 when the film was released, so I guess I was in the right demographic target.Indeed, my cinematic education, if not complete, was mature enough to get most of the jokes, to instantly recognize De Niro behind Don Lino's mimics and having ""The Godfather"" as my all-time favorite increased the enjoyment. Gee, I was even a fan of ""Car Wash"" at that time so I didn't miss any reference. And how could I? ""Shark Tale"" is one pop-culture reference after another, it almost becomes a gimmick. And I understand that for some viewers, it might get tiresome, once you have played the spot-the-star game and managed to guess Jack Black or Renee Zelwegger; you want the story to grab you a little, and it does, sort of.There are basically two plots: Oscar, a whale washer, is a nobody trying to be somebody with a sort of end-justifying-the-means way, ignoring the cute assistant in love with him, and there is Lenny, the vegetarian shark who disappoints his Godfather- like father, Don Lino. The two plots get intertwined with a share of unevenly predictable twists, but let's not kid ourselves, the whole story is rather predictable, countless mafia parodies have been made, including ""Analyze This"" a few years before, but the script overcomes the predictable stuff by providing some nice one- liners and funny moments, and such lousy puns they miraculously work.The whole thing leads to the kind of conclusion that comforts that this was not a film to take seriously in the first place, it's meant to be fun. Now, to get back to Ebert's comment, yes, he's right that the film doesn't find the right touch to appeal children, and on that level, it would be an average film. But once you get the idea that this is not a film for kids, but for adults young adults or adults adults, its quality suddenly improves. It's all a matter of angle.And at least, it didn't try to emulate ""Finding Nemo"", and had instead a sleazier ""Finding Money"" story line (and I'm sorry for the lousiness of this pun).",Shark Tale

However, the film is a parody of the Godfather films, which are films kids haven't seen. So, I don't think Shark Tale makes a good kid film since they wouldn't get a lot of the jokes. Also, I didn't care for the rap and hip-hop music in this. I liked the look of the sharks from Nemo better than this movie. The Jamacian jellyfish was a neat idea and a couple of the best characters. The plot was simple as it was in Nemo, it just wasn't as entertaining.One thing's for sure: even as a fish, Angie Jolie is one hot moma!FINAL VERDICT: I just don't see this as being a film kids really love.

20,slightlymad22,Does Not Know It's Audience!!,6,7 December 2017,"Continuing my plan to watch every Will Smith movie in order, I come to Shark Tale (2004)Plot In A Paragraph: When a son of a gangster shark boss is accidentally killed while on the hunt, his would-be prey and his vegetarian brother decide to use the incident to their own advantage.When done well, animated movies can be a joy to all ages. The Toy Story trilogy, Up, Lion King, All Dogs Go To Heaven and Shrek are all in my collection. This movie seems largely forgotten about, whilst perfectly fine and well voiced, it always felt off to me. The target audience is obviously kids, but the movie is based around The Godfather. A movie very few who went to see this will have known, let alone seen. The movie doesn't follow the plot of Godfather, the problem with this story is that the movie seems to aim it at an older audience. Do kids care that Oscar wants to clear his debt with the loan sharks and become rich and famous?? Or what about the love triangle that he finds himself in?? Yawn. Too tame and dull for the adults, and there is nobody the target audience can identify with. All of the major characters are adults, with adult problems like debt, and romance, which has the characters doing way too much talking. The movie went into gross $160 million at the domestic box office, to end 2004 as the 11th highest grossing movie of the year.",Shark Tale

A lot of good voice talent was assembled for this movie; I don't think the plot was terribly original or even important to the appeal of the film. Mostly it is just fun to look at; CGI works really well for the underwater setting. The film is fast-paced enough to keep you going to the end.

His best friend is Angie (Rene Zellweger), an angel fish with the typical heart o' gold. Angie loves Oscar to death, but he's too dopey and blind to figure that out.But Oscar's the fishie on the spot when he's witness to a descending anchor that kills a shark that was chasing him. Aha, problem solved! You bet it is, especially when Oscar sort of takes credit for the death, proclaiming himself ""Sharkslayer."" Top of the world, ma! Will Oscar finally realize that Angie is his One True Love, or will he fall to the considerable and formidable charms of the lovely and mysterious Lola (Angelina Jolie)? And will he figure out his romance situation before he's iced by the local Mob boss Don Lino (Robert DeNiro), who happens to be the father of the shark who was killed by the anchor, the shark everyone thinks Oscar killed? Charming, whimsical, and fulla heart and moxie, Shark Tale tries - and succeeds - to do for fishfolk what Antz did for insectfolk. Both, incidentally, were Dreamworks creations, and it's somewhat assuring to see a company other than Disney consistently turn out fun, high-quality animation.For once, Smith is perfectly cast. Don't get me wrong, I've liked quite a few Will Smith films, but most of the time he's an entertainer and showman, not an actor. There's plenty of showmanship in his performance here, but for some reason the animation comes across as completely sincere. So it's the Will Smith show again, but against the animated backdrop of the briny deep, it somehow works wonderfully.Bearing in mind that during the making of animated films, the actors providing the voices often do not work simultaneously (although they did do so a few times for Shark Tale), I thought the vocal chemistry between De Niro and Smith was excellent. Strong performances abounded, from a fairly disparate selection of actors: De Niro, Smith, Zellweger, Jolie, Peter Falk, Jack Black, Ziggy Marley, and Doug E. Doug.So all in all, a whole lotta fun. You might say the movie has teeth, but you'd be wrong - it's an innocuous PG-rated movie, so rated merely for its mild cartoon violence. Your kidlets will probably love it - or at least they will if there's a Happy Meal involved, which I'm sure there was.",Shark Tale
25,dee.reid,"""Shark Tale"" is a ""fishy"" tale, all right, but a worthwhile one",7,11 March 2005,"I have to admit going into this review that I didn't at all have the slightest hopes of liking ""Shark Tale."" From the previews last fall, it reminded me a little too much of Pixar's ""Finding Nemo."" Not so, as I would later find out. ""Shark Tale"" draws much of its inspirations, as noted by critic Roger Ebert, from ""Casablanca,"" ""Jaws,"" and ""The Godfather"" - all movies that are considered to be modern American classics.""Shark Tale"" plays out like an amalgam of all three classic films, and has a plot that shares uncanny parallels to the current events debate about morality and homosexuality in America. The film is set in and around a coral reef that is controlled by a ""Godfather""-like mob family of great white sharks. Don Lino (Robert De Niro) is as ruthless as they come, and his two sons Frankie (Michael Imperioli) and Lenny (Jack Black) both have their eyes set on controlling the family and the reef when Lino retires.The sharks, who run their business out of a spruced-up version of the sunken Titanic, have a reputation for routinely shaking down clients and otherwise being pretty hard on the reef, but Lenny doesn't have that killer instinct in him - he's a vegetarian - and at dinner one night, he sets a shrimp free. This comes as a shock for Don Lino, as Lenny's behavior suddenly becomes a huge embarrassment for him.On the reef, a hustling fish named Oscar (Will Smith) is aspiring to rise out of his lowly existence working at a whale wash. He's thought up a number of schemes in the past that have all failed and his closest friend is his boss's secretary Angie (Renee Zellweger), who also has a crush on him.Things become complicated for all the characters when Frankie is accidentally killed by a fisherman's anchor being dropped on his head while he was trying to convince Lenny to be a killer shark by feasting on Oscar, who's indebted to Don Lino for a failed horse-betting scheme. Oscar, who bore witness to the whole incident, seizes the opportunity and using his boss Sykes (Martin Scorsese) as a shameless fight promoter, becomes a hero around the reef as a shark slayer, and Lenny is forced to go into hiding as a result.""Shark Tale"" is entertaining to say the least, with enough in-jokes and gags to certainly reel in unsuspecting viewers. Even though this is a children's film, there is a lot of thematic material that is just too serious to not go at all unnoticed.The animation is beautiful (though not as good as anything done by Pixar in the last 10 years) and it really gives the deep blue that admirable quality. The voice-acting is pretty impressive too, with all of the actors doing their best, including Angelina Jolie as the gold-digging Lola.7/10",Shark Tale
26,meeza,Sharkpun Heaven!,8,31 December 2004,"The Pixar computer animated classic ""Finding Nemo"" found itself a pool of box office euphoria. Since ""Finding Nemo"" were ""the fisher kings"" of the box office last year, Dreamworks decided to go fishing for some of their own dough and develop their own fishy animated story. I introduce you ""Shark Tale"". Audiences also took the bait on ""Shark Tale"" by rounding up satisfactory box office coin. However, it did not reach the deep sea pockets of Nemo. ""Shark Tale"" stars Lenny the tiburon (voiced by Jack Black) as a gentle sharkey lacking the fury of his fellow sharkanians. In other words, he is no sharkey's machine! I guess Lenny does not fit in the school of sharks. The situation does not ""boat"" I mean bode well with Don Lino, Lenny's shark daddy (voiced by Robert Deniro). Don Lino wishes Lenny was a bone shark instead of a lone shark. Next, I introduce Oscar the hyper bling-bling fish (voiced by Will Smith). Even though Smith will not receive any Oscar nominations for his voice-over of Oscar, it is still deserving of a goldfish statuette instead of the aforementioned goldman statuette. Oscar is chatty, manipulative, and debonaire. Angie the pescada (voiced by Renee Zellweger) is in love with the big ""O"" and would give her left gill for him. She wants to have Oscar at below! Then we come to Lisa (voiced by Angelina Jolie) who is the fish girl interrupted who is trying to prevent from Oscar & Angie from hooking up. However, Lisa wants Oscar for his bills and not for his gills. Through some unforeseen circumstances, Oscar is recognized as ""the shark slayer"" because of Lenny's generous antics.

30,aidanratesmovies,Underrated- better than some Dreamworks films today...,6,24 April 2021,"Although for the most part it is a rather standard family film, with silly gags and cheesy dialogue to spare, the film is rather entertaining and quite fun to watch, even if it is in an ironic sort of sense. Will Smith stars as Oscar the fish, in a role that seems explicitly written for him. No performance really stands out in the film, except maybe for Martin Scorsese as Mr. Sykes, because it's just such a weird role for him, and oddly enough it works. The films mafia shark sidestory seems incredibly generic, and rather forced at times. It's story focusing on the life of Oscar who is poor in a big city with big dreams is also generic, but feels more genuine and less out of place. The animation can be quite good at times, very bulgy and odd at other times. Its music is largely hip hop and rap singles from the 90's and 00's which feels largely what Dreamworks has become in the modern age- with films like Trolls and The Boss Baby focusing so much on modern culture- and yet Shark Tale works so much better than their latest attempts- and truly doesn't deserve the incredible amount of hate it receives. There are several rather funny moments throughout, and some gay and trans undertones that were surprisingly heartfelt considering the nature of the world at the time. In the end, Shark Tale is by far not Dreamwork's best, but it's an entertaining effort that can be amusing even with its rather weaker moments and storyline.My Rating: 6.3/10.",Shark Tale

His father, Don Lino (the mafia-boss around), is now considering retiring, and leaving Lenny and his brother Frankie in charge. As a last effort Frankie takes Lenny out to teach him how to be a real shark. At the reef Oscar is in trouble. He works at a Whale wash but aspires to become Somebody. His ambition also makes him overlook his co-worker Angie, who is secretly in love with Oscar. But Oscar's boss, Sykes, is under pressure from Don Lino. Sykes in turn, with his jellyfish thugs Bernie and Ernie, forces Oscar to pay his, somewhat large debts. Oscar, with help from Angie, puts the money together but loses them at the races. Sykes's thugs then bring Oscar out into the ""desert"" where Oscar is about to ""get lost"" when Frankie and Lenny stumbles upon them. Ernie and Bernie flees and when Frankie goes to attack to show Lenny how it is done, he is killed in a freak accident. Back at the reef Oscar take credit for the killing, is soon named The Sharkslayer, and becomes the hero and the Somebody he always dreamt to be. Things get complicated when Lenny turns up and threatens to reveal the truth if Oscar doesn't help him start a new life in the reef. Back at the shark hangout, Don Lino is furious about the news that one son is dead, the other one missing. He wants revenge...Comments: This is a great movie, which I believe can be enjoyed by everyone. The story itself is somewhat focused on ""mature"" aspects as love, revenge and so on. But I believe kids will have a lot of fun watching it as well. For the more movie-experienced audience the movie is full of evident or ¨subtler, all hilarious, references and spoofs of other movies. In other aspects, DreamWorks animators and crew have done a great job. The movie is illustrated beautifully and especially nice is that the characters have borrowed some physical features from the actors that lent them their voice. The actors and actresses do it well too, using their whole range of vocal abilities and peculiarities. And at last, but most important, the story itself is very funny and inventive. No dull moments.

32,rbverhoef,Fun for adults,7,18 April 2005,"I liked 'Shark Tale'. It is funny and has quite some original elements I will not spoil for you. But while I was watching I realized how many jokes were there intended for adults and how little for children. Since I guess you have to label this as a family film I was wondering if that was really the intention of the filmmakers. I mean, the main inspiration comes from R-rated films 'The Godfather' and 'Jaws'. Other little jokes and one-liners find their origin in films like 'Scarface', 'Gladiator' and 'Apocalypse Now', again R-rated.All those great laughs, for me at least, will not be funny or even remotely understood by children.That said, let's approach this film as a comedy mainly made for adults. Again, adults will probably find this very funny, even funnier when you have seen quite some films. The story tells about Lenny (voice by Jack Black), a shark who happens to be a vegetarian, a disgrace for his father Don Lino (Robert De Niro). This shark makes a deal with a small fish named Oscar (Will Smith). On the reef where Oscar lives they think Oscar killed another shark, Lenny's brother, so Lenny and Oscar try to keep the rumor that way. Subplots involve Oscar's longtime friend Angie (Renée Zellweger) who is secretly in love with him, a new fish Lola (Angelina Jolie) who likes Oscar now he is famous, and Sykes (Martin Scorsese), a fish who used to be Don Lino's partner but now teams up with Oscar. Sykes has two helpers, the funny sidekicks any Disney-film would be proud of.What can I say more about this film? The animation is good, although I liked the approach with 'Finding Nemo' better. On the other hand, this is the kind of film where realistic animation probably would be out of place. Now I have mentioned 'Finding Nemo' I could compare it a little more. 'Nemo' is the better film since it is equally funny for adults and close to the perfect film for children. 'Nemo' was simple in its story but very inventive as well in the little things. Think about the fish with short term memory loss. Things like that you will not find in 'Shark Tale' but you will have many laughs and smiles. Especially the one-liners taken from other films were hilarious but I have to say again; you must have seen the other film to really like it. I did, I laughed.",Shark Tale

It does depend wayyy too much on the star's faces being animated as fish, it does spew out cliché's and popculture refs. in place of actual dialogue, it also hasn't an original bone in it's body.Know what? Didn't bother me in the least. DeNiro and Scorsese were funny, Will Smith as always was Big Willie Style, Zellwinger and Couric and Jolie essentially played themselves okay if nothing else. You will enjoy the gay veggie Shark(Jack Black) gussied up as a dolphin, the reggae jellyfish are a hoot, and the whole staged fight between 'Oscar' and 'Lenny' is fun too. Best use of an Elvis tune in a movie in some time.Can't say that this is gonna be remembered for long or anything, but it IS worth watching if you like the stars or just want a fun time in CGI land.

35,Rob_Taylor,Very hit and miss,5,24 January 2005,"Shark Tale is not a bad film. A lot of thought and effort went into making this picture. Yet, when you sit down and watch it, two things become apparent.First, and most obviously, the movie is very hit and miss. Some scenes work well, others fall flat or are downright dull and tedious.Secondly, just who was the target audience? Very small children will, no doubt, appreciate the bright colours and simple action sequences, but if they are the audience, then why so many more adult themes here than, say, in Shrek? If adults were the target group, then why the silliness intended solely for children? In short, it comes across as a film uncertain as to what it was trying to achieve, and who it was primarily aimed at. As a result of this dithering, the film, which could have worked well if a specific audience was targeted, meanders along with little direction and little to keep you watching with anything other than mild interest.Will Smith reprises his role as The Fresh Prince here verbatim, almost to the point of annoyance. The others mostly have a good time with their voice roles but there aren't really any stand-outs among them, though it was good to hear Peter Falk in a role.In short, this one is purely for the little kids, who'll no doubt watch it again and again with glee. But for the adults, the humour runs out long before the end of the first viewing. Disappointing.",Shark Tale
36,Matt_Layden,Big Name Stars Don't Make The Film Any Better.,4,4 June 2010,"A mafia film of sorts, set underwater and with fish. Will Smith is Oscar, a fish that lies about killing a shark. The shark was actually killed by a dropped anchor, yet Oscar was at the scene and is now known as the Sharkslayer. Mob Boss Robert DeNiro hears about his son's death and takes matters into his own hands, this doesn't bode well for Oscar.Shark Tale at first glance seems to be a mere rip off of Finding Nemo. The Pixar film that had fish as their main characters was charming, funny and adventurous. It's not fair to compare the two, since this film lacks all of those ingredients. Shark Tale instead relies on pop-culture references to get the adults smirking and the bright colourful fish to get the kids wanting the toys. The story, the animation and the fun are all below the bar. With every film that is released by Dreamworks, the inevitable will happen. People will compare it to Pixar. Pixar is simply in another league, they seem to care about their stories and characters and not just having a bunch of people cash in on the current craze. Shark Tale has an impressive cast, if this were a live action dramatic film, starring Will Smith, Angelina Jolie, Robert DeNiro and was directed by Scoresese, then we might have a masterpiece on our hands. Alas, the actors of this world think that just because they lend their voice to an animated character, that their job is half done for them. Jack Black works in this film, even DeNiro, who plays up on his past roles. Jolie, Zellweger and Smith do not. They have nothing to add to the film that some nameless actress/actor could have done. There is no sense of adventure. We are trapped under the sea instead of exploring the depths of this world. It was interesting to see the fish life here, but I'm sure we've all seen creative takes on modern life in a film that has an odd setting, The Flinstones is famous for this. I still hear people talking about Finding Nemo today, hell even older animated films like Toy Story, but Shark Tale seemed to have faded the next day after the release. It's not memorable to kids, nor will adults find any real charm or wit. The film tries to hard with a lot of the jokes and references that it becomes tiresome. Shark Tale fails because it would rather have big name stars on the poster, than a tangible and interesting story. I'm sorry, but at the end of the day, what matters most in a film is the story. Sure, it can be done before, but as long as the story teller and the story telling is good and has my interest, I'm game. Shark Tale did none of this and it felt lazy, much like the cast.",Shark Tale

It's funnier than some of the Dreamworks films and deserves a lot more credit than it got. I think a 5.9 is being a little unreasonable. There is really nothing wrong with Shark Tale.

Shrek 2 had been released earlier that year and made just shy of $1 billion, so expectations were high for Shark Tale which had arguably more star power with the likes of Will Smith, Jack Black, Robert De Niro, and many others. While the film had a healthy opening, and became the 9th highest grossing film of the year, the movie had a mainly negative critical response and a more mixed audience response. Over 15 years later it's easy to see why Shark Tale hasn't had much staying power or lasting impact because the movie feels very cynical and manufactured with a frankly confused premise and a surprisingly ugly aesthetic.Shark Tale looks perfectly fine in some parts, but in others it becomes downright difficult to look at. While the sharks and whales are reasonably well rendered, everything else looks off putting. All the fish have this uncanny valley look to them with the animation putting a lot of effort into trying to make the characters look like the actors voicing them and it just doesn't work. A big problem with the fish designs is probably in the mouths especially in regards to the lips as the lips of characters are very oversized taking up nearly 40% of the characters face and giving this unnerving human/fish hybrid look that's just unpleasant to look at. Outside the character models most of the settings look very washed out with a lot of earthen tones, rusts, greys, and browns and Southside Reef just looks like a washed out version of Times Square most of the time. The movie also has a lot of references to Mafia themed film and TV shows such as Goodfellas, Godfather, and The Sopranos that really don't seem like they'll have much appeal for kids since it's unlikely they've seen those, or even adults for that matter since the humor is just referencing their existence.The characters and story are pretty underwhelming with Oscar really not all that sympathetic as a protagonist and at times downright hateful. When we're introduced to Oscar he's fantasizing in front of a billboard like he's on MTV's Cribs (in the first of many desperate references to pop culture) and his motivation for being famous for the sake of being famous just doesn't resonate because it's such a superficial and vacuous goal. On top of this Oscar is just completely unpleasant casually insulting people, blowing off his friends, and falling into stupid decision after stupid decision that's motivated solely by selfishness, greed and vanity. The storyline with side character Lenny has a bit more weight to it trying to be an allegory for coming out of the closet and the stigma that comes from not falling in line with society's expectations, but it's done in a very over the top manner with Jack Black's performance very utilizing a rather grating nasally voice. While I admire Shark Tale for trying to give us a sympathetic story on ""coming out"", it's not given the attention something like this needs being essentially a ""b-plot"" in a very confused story that doesn't feel consistent with the world logic established within Shark Tale mostly because Shark Tale doesn't really establish much of a world. While the cast is comprised of fish and other sea life, the way they're written it feels exactly like modern day New York with only the surface level details changed so it has an ocean/undersea theme crudely stapled to a story that doesn't integrate it all that well.Shark Tale is easily one of the weakest films Dreamworks animation studios has ever produced. While it boasts a good cast and a respectable attempt at sympathizing with individuals struggling with their identity against societal expectations, it's also a very vapid movie that features an unlikable protagonist who's lacking in charm. Even the animation is pretty disappointing with bot bland environments and off putting character models making Shark Tale one of the least visually appealing films of its ilk.",Shark Tale

43,Victor Field,"It's not fair to compare this to ""Finding Nemo."" Now ""Jabberjaw"" on the other hand...",4,6 November 2004,"The best moment of ""Shark Tale"" comes in the beginning, when the little boy in the DreamWorks Animation logo casts his fishing line out from the moon and sends the hook with a worm on it down to the sea. Unfortunately it serves as a cue for one of the movie's problems  when two sharks come along, one humming John Williams' shark motif from ""Jaws"" to the disgust of the other, and the first one says ""Hey, it's our theme song,"" we're supposed to think it's clever. It's not  it's obvious, and it's also representative of the movie's fondness for riffing off pop culture aspects - something ""The Simpsons"" also does, but it also does far more than this movie does. This laziness is so prevalent throughout the movie that the overall effect is of something that's computer-generated in more ways than one.The story is dull, clichéd and predictable  it's shocking that such an impressive cast was convinced to bring life to a script that's on a level with ""Fish Police,"" with its endless bad fish-related puns and dreary plotting. Come to think of it, the voice cast is another problem; there used to be a time when animated movies didn't feel the need to plaster the names of the voice actors, whether known or unknown, on the posters and in the trailers but even some of the TV spots for ""Shark Tale"" featured the live actors during the recording sessions, making it feel even more like a corporate concoction than it already is (and why did the producers gather such an impressive cast and then give them practically nothing to do?). The characters Smith, Jolie, DeNiro, and company are voicing aren't a help either  unlike ""Finding Nemo"" (I know I said it's not fair, but the point has to be made), we're denied anyone to give a toss about because they're nearly all stereotyped ciphers (especially the Jamaican jellyfish voiced by Doug E. Doug and Ziggy Marley), with Will Smith proving that even in animation he has to hog the limelight... if any character here is the star, it's Jack Black's fey shark (who practically has ""gay"" stamped on his fins). Just to add to the irritation, the movie's commercial instincts all but override the storyline  it often plays like an extended TV spot for its soundtrack (and both the songs and Hans Zimmer's score are nothing to write home about), especially with the presence of Missy Elliott and Christina Aguilera in fish and jellyfish form performing their appalling version of ""Car Wash""  as if the live-action forms weren't repellent enough already.With its sledgehammer winks to adults (although the newspaper ad for a horror movie called ""The Hook"" modeled on DreamWorks' version of ""The Ring"" and casting Peter Falk and two cast members of ""The Sopranos"" as mob sharks is almost okay) and the overall feeling of a bad '80s TV cartoon dressed up in 2004 silver screen trimmings, ""Shark Tale"" has no chance of being included as one of the three nominees for Best Animated Feature if there's justice in this world. And who decided to include British morning TV irritant Fiona Phillips on the UK release print (Fiona replaces Katie Couric as the voice of on-the-spot reporter Katie Current, which pretty much removes any possible point to the fish's name)? Fiona Phillips and Christina Aguilera have no business being on the same credit roll as Martin Scorsese and Renee Zellweger.",Shark Tale

45,Beta_Gallinger,"A film from DreamWorks Animation with some things to like, but it's still a bit bland",6,16 September 2008,"After Pixar had a hit with their 2003 underwater adventure, ""Finding Nemo"", another film featuring anthropomorphic sea creatures was released in 2004, this time from DreamWorks Animation, called ""Shark Tale"". When I heard about this film, I guess it was shortly before it came into theatres, it looked like something I would want to see, and it wasn't long before I did (it was shown in my English class during my last year of high school for some reason). I'm not sure how I would have rated it at the time, but I remember my verdict was that it was definitely inferior to Pixar's anthropomorphic fish story, but not bad. I've seen it twice since then, but I believe I think less of it now than I did when I first saw it.Oscar is a bottom-feeder fish in the ocean who feels like a nobody, and dreams of becoming rich and famous. Lenny is the son of shark mob boss Don Lino, and the brother of a shark named Frankie. However, Lenny is an outcast amongst the rest of the shark community, as he is a vegetarian and does not want to kill. Determined to make him a killer like the rest of them, the shark mob boss sends his two sons out, so Frankie can teach Lenny how to be one. However, while they are out, an anchor comes down, hits Frankie, and kills him, leaving Lenny feeling guilty! Oscar, the one Frankie tried to get Lenny to eat, has just witnessed the incident, and apart from Lenny, who has left, nobody else witnessed it. Being seen with the shark's body, the bottom-feeder fish claims he killed him, and soon gets a reputation around his part of the ocean as the ""Sharkslayer""! So, he gets the fame and fortune he's been dreaming of, but the fact remains, he didn't really slay a shark, and after the false news about the ""Sharkslayer"" gets to Don Lino, it appears Oscar is in a lot of trouble! One thing that makes this film suffer is the Oscar character - so dimwitted, so naive, and not too likable. He tends to get himself into so much trouble, and I'm sure he would be able to stay out of this trouble if he actually thought before he acted! Also, the things he does that get him into trouble are things he does for his own personal gain (before the shark incident, he bets money on a seahorse race instead of using it to pay off his debt)! As a comedy, the movie has its moments, but often fails with its humour, such as the part where they use a typical unfunny fart joke. The whale mouth cleaning part involves gross-out gags involving the filth from the whale's mouth. Although I've definitely seen much worse than that, this part is another example of failed attempts at humour in the film. Another problem I can't forget is that the quality of the writing isn't really that good, and it seems the writers may have been thinking a little too much about pop culture, and perhaps not quite enough about the quality of the writing.Some may call ""Shark Tale"" a ripoff of ""Finding Nemo"", but I tend to disagree. Yes, they are both CGI animated films involving anthropomorphic ocean fish, but they have a totally different plot, and not exactly the same type of characters. However, that one thing they have in common, and the fact that one came out the year after the other, makes it hard not to compare them, and in my opinion, Pixar's underwater adventure is far superior to that of DreamWorks Animation. I'm sure many would agree, since ""Finding Nemo"" has received a lot more praise. ""Shark Tale"" does have some good parts, sometimes because of humour, and sometimes maybe because of excitement, enough to earn it a slightly above average rating from me. The animation is nice and colourful, so I can't complain much about that, either, and the story might get a bit better as it goes along. However, due to its flaws, this DreamWorks Animation effort is a bit bland (overall, I would say Pixar is the superior CGI animation company), and not one I desire to watch again any time soon.",Shark Tale
46,vip_ebriega,"Something was very fishy about ""Shark Tale"".",6,25 May 2007,"My Take: Colorful yet under-written animated movie. Despite ""Shark Tale"" being a rather comical and colorful animation serial by Dreamworks Studios, this film somehow marks the beginning of the end for the studios big success, starting with such delights like the two ""Shrek"" films. ""Shark Tale"" started to loose its charm as time passes, something that any change to DVD can't cover for. This movie is rather unfunny compared to the likes of the first ""Shrek"", and most especially the superior sequel ""Shrek 2"". The film follows the success of Pixar's ""Finding Nemo"", but is sorely left behind by how much ""Nemo"" succeeded. How could it? Because this one tried to be cool and serious at the same time in one movie. They wanted to give its viewer both a fast-tongued comedy spoof and a ""Godfather"" of the animated kind. But some success are too big for all to come true.Now, enough of negatives. ""Shark Tale"" does offer some entertainment. The voicing may get pretty annoying at times, but Robert DeNiro's voice as Don Lino, the shark mob boss is very good. Admittedly, it's fun to see DeNiro going tough and bad as a shark. The animation is colorful and clear, may you see it on either the big-screen or DVD. And some of the laughs does work sometimes, when seen in the right mood.Overall, not a success, but not much of a disappointment. If only it targeted more on a frequent audience and had a more kid-friendly plot to accompany the fine colors.Rating: *** out of 5.",Shark Tale
47,Stampsfightclub,Predictable but funny and engaging animation for the family,7,27 October 2006,"With an all star cast including Smith (bad boys) De Niro (Taxi Driver) Zellweger (Bridget Jones) and director Scoursese (Goodfellas) this 2004 was lined up to be a smash and despite its criticism I enjoyed watching the amazing effects, cheesy jokes and acceptable plot. The cast lend their voices to the spirited sea creatures. The beginning of the story is really amazing. A typical animation move, taking audiences around the scenery. With many jokes as 'play on words' e.g. Coral Cola the audience are awarded cheap laughs and wonder how the producers come up with these ideas, its conventional but I believe its a technique that all audiences appreciate. Its an inconsistent plot with many engaging scenes but many questionable scenes. After the beginning you wondered is Smith's cool character Oscar was being given too much camera time. Once Zellweger's conventional boy-fish wanting fish came into the story did a sense of predictability arise. However its one of those films you know is awful but you enjoy it anyway. It is engaging because you wonder how the characters are going to fare with each other. The relationship between the under sea creatures is healthy and believable but always enjoyable to observe, despite maybe some people saying its predictable, clichéd etc. It's a slow moving story with typical human like ideologies put forth by director Bergerson. Money, family loyalty, betrayal, friendship and trust are all encoded so audience's can appreciate the film. There are a few twists used, perhaps in the wrong way but are still interesting to observe. The ending is atrocious. Never in my life have I seen a film end so badly. I was shaking my head and couldn't believe it. The soundtrack to the film is amazing. Upbeat energetic pop and reggae music are used for a variety of uses, mainly to encourage the scene to be enjoyable. There is never doubting the effects which are stunning. If you want any proof then observe De Niro's shark character which looks exactly like him. a film for the whole family - not the best animation but still enjoyable for cheap laughs and funny characters",Shark Tale
48,gregsrants,Finds its place amongst the computer animated Hall of Fame,8,14 September 2004,"It was nine years ago this November that one of the most influential movies of the next decade was released to mass audiences. The film was Toy Story, and it is credited as being the first fully computer generated feature length film. Expectations were fairly high for the $30 million production and continued to gather momentum through the roaring responses by test audiences and the reaction to the trailers and media hype. When released November 22, Toy Story flew out of the gate with nearly $29 million in its opening weekend alone. The landscape for films and the entries into the top grossing films of all time would be changed forever.In the nine years since Toy Story debuted, studios have yet to have a misstep with the computer-generated format. Monster's Inc, A Bug's Life and Toy Story 2 became incredibly successful films eating up box office dollar stats upon each release. Not be left behind in the cold, other studio's began to see the Disney cash cows mooing every time a Pixar/Mickey Mouse collaboration hit McDonald's Happy Meals. Fox Studio's released Ice Age (2002), and Dreamwork's lined up the Brinks trucks for Antz (1998) and everyone's favorite Ogre, Shrek and his even bigger sequel Shrek 2. This fall, children will throw sugar rush tantrums when two films, Pixar's The Incredibles and Dreamworks' Shark Tale hit theaters in the same season that Shrek 2 gets its widely publicized DVD release. In fact, Hollywood is banking on it. Animation studios and their respective creative powers are being dropped like stock in a Martha Stewart portfolio. Gone are the hand drawn ordered celluloid prints of The Little Mermaid, Peter Pan and The Aristocrats. We are in a new world now where even Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius can knock on the $100 million domestic gross doormat. I had the privilege of a screening of Shark Tale at this year's Toronto International Film Festival. Although only a child at heart, I will admit that I was more than a little excited amongst all the glitz and glitter of the red carpet. Trailers for the movie did not have the effect on me of say a Shrek or Toy Story. But whatever the coming attractions' originality lacked, Shark Tale more than made up in sheer star power. Will Smith, Robert DeNiro, Renée Zellweger, Jack Black, Angelina Jolie and Peter Falk's are some of the names that can all be found in print on the films' poster. One of these names alone might get me to buy a ticket for a panned film entry so surely this was a can't miss proposition. Surely?Well, fret not ye parents who will be dragged by shirttails on opening weekend 'cause Shark Tale fits along nicely amongst its peers in terms of effects, laughs and originality.Set in the undersea world, Shark Tale is the simple story of Oscar (Will Smith), a small fish with big dreams. A slacker at the local Whale Wash, Oscar is one of those dreamers that think the world should be handed to him on a silver platter. On the other side of the reef, live the sharks. They are a collection of mobster type stereotypes lead by Don Lino (Robert DeNiro) who is looking to turn his family over two his two sons, Frankie (Sopranos' Michael Imperioli) and Lenny (Jack Black). Typical of what you would expect if the actors were playing live action characters, Frankie is the relentless true heir  a mean, in-the-mold-of-his-father type, while Lenny is the vegetarian who can't bring himself to cause harm to another creature. When the two brothers meet Oscar, a freak accident leaves Frankie dead, Don Lino enraged and Oscar holding the key to the city after taking credit as a shark slayer. Lenny sees this as an exploitive opportunity himself  a chance to hide from his violent family responsibilities, and in a very humorously choreographed battle where Lenny pretends to be slewed by the inferior sized Oscar. The movie then plays out in true comedic style as Oscar builds a fortune out of his newfound fame, Lenny ties to hide living a life as a dolphin and Don Lino becomes increasingly incensed on the notion that a predator of sharks exists. But where the story might be 'simple' the execution is anything but. Computer generated films have spoiled us with sight gags that would be too costly with live action, and with adult-minded humor and references that makes the experience exciting for the grownups in the crowd. Shark Tale does not falter on these points. The opening sequence was captivating as we were taken for a swim through the underwater city. The ingeniousness of the creators and writers were found in every air bubble of the busy Whale Wash where turtles give turtle waxes, in every starfish laying in the celebrity walk of fame and in a sushi chef who wonders if he is in the appropriate market for his business. Each new turn within the city's infrastructure brought to life ideas that the audience cheered, laughed or marveled at the sheer brilliance of the thought process. Adding to the lure for the adult crowds, Shark Tale had as many film references as one could throw into a film without infringing on the original storyline. Godfather and Jaws references aside, you will may have to see the movie more than once to pick up quotes from films like Jerry McGuire and Ali. The little kiddies in the audience probably wondered what the adults were laughing and grinning at, but Shark Tale rivals Shrek 2 for film references.Even with all the adult pop-culture references, children will have no problem enjoying the aquatic world that Dreamworks has created. Add a love triangle between Angie (Renée Zellweger), Oscar and Lola (Angelina Jolie) and you have a filmgoing experience that has something for the whole family no matter what their age. But maybe the cherry on the top was the itself. Each character from Will's Oscar to Peter Falk's Don Brizzi is animated with wonderful detail and color with each creation having similar facial characteristics as their voiced impersonator. Jolie's lips, Scorsese's eyebrows and even DeNiro's mole are all present in their cartoon form. It's as if the actual actor was reincarnated as the fish that best suited their characters and mannerisms. Couple that with the incredible vibrant colors and attention to detail by the animators and you have what could very well become an instant classic amongst this still blossoming format.It's hard to knock a film like Shark Tale, but then, why would I? Scorsese and DeNiro seem to be having a ball bantering back and forth with one another, Smith has the reins off so he can act his inner child, and Doug E. Doug needed the perfect outlet for his humor that will make him as lovable and memorable as Eddie Murphy's donkey in Shrek. So hey, if they are having a good time, why should I complain. www.gregsrants.com",Shark Tale

50,mitsubishizero,Not a bad movie!,8,16 May 2018,"The animation's not that bad though I can understand why some people think otherwise. The voice acting and characters are pretty decent and the story's ok but some of the characters are unlikable and have questionable motives. Will Smith voices Oscar, a working-class fish trying to live a better life while working at a whale wash to pay off his debt he acquired from his boss. Supporting him is his co-worker Angie (Renee Zellweger) who gives him a pearl which he uses to bet on a horse race rather than pay off his debt as originally intended. Actions like those make Oscar selfish, unlikable and hard to root for. On top of that his design may turn viewers off. It never bothered me though.Things however look up for him though as he leads a shark that intended to kill him to his death by an anchor leading everyone to think he's the ""Shark Slayer"". using his newfound attention he sets out to create a better life for himself while also enjoying the rewards that come out of his lie. Unfortunately this attracts the attention of mob boss Don Lino (Robert De Niro) who sets out to find out who the killer is and punish him while also looking for is son Lenny (Jack Black) who faked his death with the help of Oscar to start a new life as a vegetarian after his father disapproves of his decision. Will he tell the truth and risk everything of keep it a secret and live the lie? I think you know where this goes.

51,TheNorthernMonkee,one of the worst mainstream animations in the last decade,1,14 February 2005,"SPOILERS Ever since the original ""Toy Story"" (1995), we've had some truly wonderful animations. With films like ""Shrek"" (2001) and ""Finding Nemo"" (2004), we've had some amazing stories for the whole family which are equally funny and impressively animated. By the law of averages therefore, it is perhaps not surprising we would end up with one or two truly woeful stories. That is what we have here with ""Shark Tale"". This is a film which is short on humour, devoid of originality and a mechanism for Will Smith's ego.Smith plays Oscar, a down on his luck fish who works as a tongue scraper at a Whale Wash. With dreams of making it big and moving up in the world, Oscar is a no-hoper who constantly bleeds his heart out to loyal friend Angie (Renee Zellwenger). When things take a turn for the worse however, Oscar inadvertently kills a shark and a media icon. Now with a Vegetarian shark (Jack Black) for company, Oscar must survive popularity, and the growing threat of Shark Godfather Don Lino (Robert DeNiro).On paper, any film which involves a Shark spoof of all Italian mafia films, should be hilarious. Truthfully, at times it shows signs of reaching this peak, but all too often it drifts away to leave us feeling bitter disappointment.DeNiro and friend Martin Scorsese appear to enjoy poking fun at a genre which they are culturally renowned, but with one or two jokes which are either stolen from elsewhere (a scene involving Smith's character at a Mafia meeting is a replica of a scene from 1999's ""Analyze This"") or based on seemingly personal stories, the story never clicks. Still, DeNiro and Scorsese are more tolerable compared with Will Smith's role.As Oscar the fish, Will Smith simply plays himself. It is like watching the Freshwater Prince of Bel-Air or something equally pointless. Smith walks around making irritating comments, wearing ""bling"" and generally making a fool of himself. Will Smith has proved in the past that whether comedy or drama, he CAN act, but the man is fast loosing any support with performances like this where he plays an old character in new surroundings. Perhaps it's time his wife Jada Pinkett-Smith convinced him to actually lay this Fresh Prince character to bed and actually do more challenging work. Sadly, this probably won't happen.Aside from Smith, DeNiro and Scorsese, ""Shark Tale"" also features vocal performances by Jack Black, Renee Zellwenger and Angelina Jolie. These three actors are famous for different styles of work, and they are worth mentioning for their performances in ""Shark Tale"" purely for the fact that they aren't awful. They're not particularly superb, with even Black seeming subdued, but they don't stand out as awful. They're simply mediocre.Another flaw with ""Shark Tale"" is a problem faced also by ""Shrek 2"" (also 2004). Whilst the later film was at times hilarious, it did possess a lot of jokes about current television series which might not be remembered in the future. The same is true in ""Shark Tale"". At first appearance, Smith's character appears in a fantastic apartment and is showing the furniture off. Blatantly joking about a modern MTV programme called ""Cribs"" the jokes are not only unfunny, but they won't last beyond a few years, if even that.All in all, there is little praise that can be given to ""Shark Tale"". A woeful story with little going for it, it fails on all levels and whilst it is harsh to say it should never have been made, it most definitely needed more rethinking. Should be avoided at all costs.",Shark Tale

53,ofpsmith,The biggest marketing excuse i've seen in a while.,4,28 May 2015,"Shark Tale is one of those movies that you can tell is just a thinly veiled excuse to make money. The problems with the film are pretty obvious. The film has all these big names that you know they only got to draw in big audiences, and there are a bunch of really bad puns. I'm not even kidding about that. The puns in this movie make A Bee Movie look funny. Oscar (Will Smith) is a cool hip hop fish in the underwater city, works at a ""whale wash"", and he's being admired by his coworker Angie (Renee Zellweger). But not all is well for Oscar as he owes money to his boss Sykes (Martin Scorsese) and he can't pay it off. Well Oscar inadvertently meets a vegetarian shark named Lenny (Jack Black) after it looks like Oscar killed Lenny's brother Frankie (Michael Imperioli). This is bad news because Lenny's father is the shark mafia boss Don Lino (Robert De Niro). Oscar and Lenny then make it look like Oscar killed Lenny making him the shark slayer so Lenny can run away and start a new life. Spoiler alert! We have to go through the liar revealed story again. I understand why they put that in kid's films but it get's old and predictable. But the real problem with Shark Tale is the idea. The story isn't done very well and you know right from the get go that this was an excuse to make money and throw in some pop culture references. Think about it. When you see the characters, you don't see the characters you just see the actors playing them. You now they choose them because of the names and nothing else. Smith's character is also annoying and to be honest a bit of a jerk.

This does not happen in a real ocean. Also, they've shown the ocean water being clear as crystal. It should have been darker. The idea of the shark slayer was fun and interesting.

The voice talent was well cast, with Will Smith as Oscar, the ambitious ""small fish in a big pond"" who finds himself an instant celebrity; Jack Black as Lenny, a peaceful vegetarian shark; Robert DeNiro as Don Lino, Lenny's father, the head of a shark mob, etc. The animation looks good, and a lot of movie references are clever. Sometimes, though, the producers of the movie seem to be trying too hard. But even if it doesn't always hit the mark, ""Shark Tale"" is worth a look.",Shark Tale
58,departed07,I've seen better kids movies,4,26 July 2005,"""Shark Tale"" is the latest addition to the DreamWorks production in which instead of the great adventures from ""Shrek,"" ""Sinbad and the Seven Seas,"" ""The Road To El Dorado"" and ""Antz"" where they took place in land, we are now going underwater where things have turned upside down.""Shark Tale"" is a story about a fish name Oscar (voiced by Will Smith) in which he has dreams of making it big in the little city that is similar to Times Square; but like everything else in his life, it backfires. His best friend is Angie (Renee Zellweger) a fish that has a crush on him and doesn't want to say anything as she writes love notes on paper. Oscar runs into big problems when his boss Sykes (Martin Scorsese) has made local shark boss Don Lino (Robert De Niro)mad where if the little fish doesn't come up with 5,000 dollars, Oscar will be shark bait.The subplot of the film involves Don Lino's youngest son Lenny (Jack Black) in which he doesn't want to take over the family business and the fact that he is a vegetarian where it upsets his father and his older brother Frankie, (Michael Imperiol) that the older brother forces Lenny to eat Oscar in which Frankie gets killed by an anchor leaving everybody to believe that Oscar killed a shark.""Shark Tale"" is not as smart or acute as ""Finding Nemo"" where we saw underwater in a new dimensional format or as funny as ""Shrek"" where mixing cruelty and ethnicity was the key pattern; ""Shark Tale"" is a parody of all of the Mafioso movies featuring De Niro and Scorsese from ""Godfather,"" ""GoodFellas,"" ""Scarface,"" and other films where the characters are caught in a money situation; not to mention that kids will be curious on who the hell is Scorsese and De Niro. I say that because kids will be familiar with Will Smith (M.I.B. Films and ID4), Jack Black (School of Rock), Renee Zellweger (Jerry Maguire), Angelina Jolie (Lara Croft: Tomb Raider); but I would have felt better if they wouldn't make so many references to other films or pop culture items and just show a film where parents can take their kids to watch.Oh well, that's why we have Shrek 1 and 2 at home.",Shark Tale

60,majikstl,Something fishy is going on...,5,12 February 2005,"SHARK TALE is an animated feature about fish and sharks and other creatures that live under the sea. So, why does Don Feinberg, the shark character voiced by Peter Falk, sing ""The Wind Beneath My Wings."" I mean in a film all about fish, shouldn't he be singing ""The Wave Beneath My Fins?"" There is no wind and they have no wings and logically these characters would not even know what ""wind"" and ""wings"" are. And when everybody is celebrating life at the Whale Wash, why do they all sing ""At the Car Wash"" and not ""At the Whale Wash?"" It would seem that they don't have cars and shouldn't even know what one is either. Could it be that funny parodies of the songs would be less marketable on the soundtrack CD? There is no real logic in this fish world. One creature is seen pouring tea into a cup, but none goes in because it disappears into the ocean water. Which is only logical, so why was he pouring tea in the first place? But other fish are into graffiti art and their canned spray paint isn't effected by the water. Oscar, the protagonist voiced by Will Smith, longs to live in a penthouse so the he can enjoy the view, but he is a fish in gravity-defying water so he can swim up and enjoy any view he wants, any time he wants. Plus, why would the said penthouse require an elevator? These are, admittedly, silly, insignificant details individually, but put together they are examples of just what is wrong with the film. It goes to extremes to make the fishy world on view a parallel universe to ours, like say, SHREK; while at the same time suggesting it is an unseen part of our world, like say, FINDING NEMO. The action mostly takes place in what appears to be a submerged human world, most notably New York City in general and Times Square in particular. But if it is a sunken part of the human world, why is it implied that this a uniquely fishy world? The film can't make up its mind: The Coca-Cola sign in Times Square reads Coral-Cola, yet Will Smith's Oscar brags about owning a PlayStation. (Did PlayStation pay for a plug and Coca-Cola didn't?) And apparently this civilization has electricity, but how it functions under water isn't clear. It is annoying that the film can't decide just what universe it exists in. Is this a fish built society (then why are there knobs on the door?) or is it a man-made world that has fallen to a watery grave like the Titanic (then what caused New York City to sink?)Likewise, the film suffers from a muddled story line. Basically, we are given a Damon Runyonesque tale of small-time hustlers and gangsters on the streets of New York (which raises the question of whether swimming fish would even need streets). But into this Guys and Dolls milieu we are also given hip-hop characters and hoods right out of GOODFELLAS. It is an everything-plus-the-kitchen-sink approach, which should make it funny in an AIRPLANE! sort of way, but instead the inconsistencies are just annoying. It is like nobody thought this through; this isn't inspired chaos, just confusion.The art and animation is just fine, exactly what we have come to expect from DreamWorks, but it is betrayed by a trite and sloppy screenplay. A simple test would be to ask ""Would this story work without the animation, with real actors?"" I don't think it would. Even with -- especially with this cast. Other than Falk, whose part is a slight cameo, the only strong vocal performance is given by Martin Scorsese, and overrated director and an underrated actor. His hyperactive, twitchy vocal patterns were made for cartoon voicers. The rest of the cast -- Will Smith, Robert DeNiro, Jack Black, Angelina Jolie and Renee Zellweger -- all seem to be examples of stunt casting; none give their characters a distinctive voice to match a distinctive character, like Ellen DeGeneres in FINDING NEMO or Eddie Murphy in SHREK or Holly Hunter in THE INCREDIBLES or Robin Williams in ALADDIN.The stakes have risen; remarkable films like TOY STORY 1 & 2, MONSTER'S INC. and SHREK 2 with their mix of artistry and intelligence, make it harder to accept that excellent animation can compensate for poorly crafted storytelling. SHARK TALES is well intentioned, with a moral about honesty and acceptance -- one shark confesses to being a closet vegetarian, with being gay the suggested subtext -- but the happily ever after, Capraesque finale seems fake. SHARK TALE is a well made film, but it is a small fish in an increasingly larger ocean.",Shark Tale

(I mean, come on, another 3-D animated underwater film with talking fish. How different can it be?) Maybe you can blame my lack of imagination, but this movie crosses the limits on turning the sea world into a human world. Finding Nemo had an innocent environment with ""schools"" of fish. Shark Tale had corruption, gangs, greed, seduction, a social hierarchy, racism, poverty, and even a Times Square. I'm sorry, but including all of these things in an animated children's film defeats the purpose of personifying the marina life. It's not like the story is unique either.

65,the amorphousmachine,"Light-hearted viewing, but lacks the magic of other computer animated films, particular its obvious competition in 'Finding Nemo'!",6,16 June 2005,"The influx of computer-animated films in recent times is proving to make for some interesting competition. 'Shark Tale', following on the heels of the well-received 'Finding Nemo' displays the comparison. No doubt about it, 'Shark Tale' is as hip as you can get, or at least it tries to be hip. Lots of cultural and movie references (some clever, some lame), in-jokes, and emphasis given to the voice cast. However, there is no magic in this film and no real awe. It's entertaining enough, and gives us an underwater version of pop culture, much like 'Robots' gave us the robotic version of what society would be like! 'Shark Tale' did manage to make me laugh, and Will Smith as Oscar does okay. Still, even with Robert DeNiro as the Mafioso shark in Don Lino- there is no formidable bad guy in this film! However, 'Shark Tale' does get the point over that getting fame based on a lie is never a good thing, and being yourself is the way to go. Jack Black does okay as the out-of-place shark who disguises himself as a dolphin, and you can pretty much guess the hidden reference about acceptance there-, which again is okay. All in all, this is a kids film with some adult themes chucked in, and its pretty good for a rainy day, but it hardly reaches 'Finding Nemo's' status as the ultimate underwater adventure, probably because 'Shark Tale' is too gimmicky and reliant on pop culture, and not to mention the god-awful ""Car Wash"" song at the end with many a fish rapping. Some nice touches like Katie Current (a spoof of Katie Couric and was the recast voice to represent the news presenter of Today in country of release even though the underwater city was New York amalgamated with Hollywood and the rest of the voices), as well as Coral Cola, the Whale Wash, the Sea Horses races etc. Now, all I have to do is see the other underwater-animated flick in the 'Spongebob Squarepants Movie'! 'Shark Tale' is okay in my book, and besides the very last groan inducing song at the end, it's light-hearted viewing!*** out of *****!",Shark Tale
66,dommercaldi,Dumb Family-Friendly Fun,5,3 May 2020,"Pros:
1. Will Smith (Oscar), Martin Scorsese (Sykes), and Jack Black (Lenny) all deliver great voice-acting performances.
2. The film serves as a fantastic allegory for accepting people for who they are, as well as critiquing obsession with wealth and fame. The latter being especially important in this day-and-age where celebrity-worship is ubiquitous.
3. The soundtrack is fun and bouncy and gives the film an airy and light-hearted feel.
4. The humour is mostly slap-stick and lands well for the most part.
5. The ending is largely satisfying and ends the movie on a suitably heartfelt note.
6. Will Smith and Jack Black have really good chemistry with each other.Cons:
1. The animation is extremely dated and at times, the animation is incredibly distractingly bad.
2. There are a few plot-holes here-and-there: How did Lenny pass as a dolphin, when he's quite clearly painted blue? How did Lenny one-bite through a steel anchor chain? How did Don Lino (Robert De Niro) not know who the shark slayer was at first, when he was being promoted everywhere throughout the media?
3. Angelina Jolie (Lola) gives a rather lacklustre voice-acting performance.
4. Some of the comedy is inserted rather forcefully and jarringly.
5. At the end when Oscar finally comes clean about lying about slaying sharks, everyone just accepts it and he faces no ramifications. It's rather unbelievable.",Shark Tale
67,jpintar,Pretty fun,7,3 October 2004,"I found this movie to be just fun. It is nowhere in the quality of Finding Nemo, Shrek, or Toy Story 2 but I found it a good time at the movies. Will Smith is very entertaining as the fish who tries to make himself into somebody by claiming to be a shark slayer. Robert De Niro is very good as the voice of the head shark. There are many in joke references to mobster movies and of course Jaws. I also liked Martin Scorsese as the opportunist blow fish who tries to use Smith's character to his advantage. The only one I was not impressed with was Jack Black as the shark who is a vegetarian. Maybe it is because I am not really a fan of his but his character is whiny and weak. This movie may not be appropriate for very young children because the sharks can be scary at times and the in joke references will go over their heads. 7/10",Shark Tale

I suppose Will Smith did this movie for his kids, or perhaps 'to pay the mortgage', but everyone involved in this movie is a lot better than this movie. I'm not sure which Cartoon Movie is worse, this one, or Rio(Cartoon Movie 2). I don't understand why a simple story of sea creatures can't be made, if I wanted to watch an episode of TMZ, I would do just that, but I don't want to watch it in an Animation though.

69,theinaniloquent,"""A new school's gonna rule""",4,9 May 2012,"I had expectations. Whoa, whoa. Don't freak out like I said something wrong. The cast was the only thing building up my expectations. The animation thing was out of my mind. It was made by Dreamwork's too, which is the only animation company that has reached heights Pixar has. And it was a film with gangster sharks. If that's not enough, the man himself Martin Scorsese plays one of the main characters. So the film had loads of potential. Potential that could either be surpassed or smashed...Smashed.I didn't like it, at all. My expectations were completely crushed from just the first ten minutes. So I'm going to tell you why exactly not to see this film, because there is no exact reason to anyways:Voice acting. It seemed liked the actors didn't even care. I mean the cast was built-up so well, this was the main thing keeping my expectations up and running, but no. It was the acting you see where you can hear the pain in the actor's voice, where they are waiting until their break-time to go out and escape this hellish film..The animation. Really? This was 2004. Animation was just picking up, I mean tremendously. But Shark Tale completely reverses what it could've been. The CGI was lazily-done and the colors were off-beat. It was almost like watching a bunch of colors dancing. But not good dancing, I mean really bad dancing.The story. Well, I can't even say it's the worst thing here, but it doesn't really attempt to tell a story. The film was meant to be a kid's version of gangster flicks, correct? Well, it's not. It's a disgrace to them. Almost like burning all the classics in your fireplace. It almost hurt seeing the plot mushed by the confused writers who have no idea what they are exactly doing. It hurts!But the film isn't the worst one ever, and it has a few redeeming qualities, but not the kind that makes you want to see it. I love the gangster references, and I found some of the humor to be somewhat hilarious, but other than that? I was sorely disappointed with what could have been.. I don't recommend.

But this movie had way too many serious messages for it to be an animation with fishes and sharks. I must say it took a lot of creativity to get Oscar the fish to do MC Hammer dances. This animation was to real! Someone pretending that he's someone that he's not. A lady fish using a man fish. A son shark not being accepted by his own father. We see another stupid movie where someone bets everything that he owns and loses all of his money at the 11th hour.

72,general-melchett,"Close, but no cigar...",7,27 January 2007,"Okay, first off, let me point this out to you - Shark Tale is not like Finding Nemo! The plots of the two films are completely different, as are the characters, the situations, and the settings. Finding Nemo encourages the idea of a wide open, empty yet interesting undersea world, whereas Shark Tale encourages the idea of a fish city with a Whale Wash and celebrity town. And unfortunately, it is probably this that ensured Shark Tale was not going to go down as well as Finding Nemo. The film was by no means a disaster (a $300 million box office gross is better than most), but it relied too much on gags, coolness and insanity rather than any real character and intelligence. Though it is very inspired and looks riveting on the big screen, it just doesn't have the ability to touch or grip as much as Finding Nemo. Though there's far more plot and a real dark side to this fish world (shark mafia, anyone?), Finding Nemo did better because it feels more like real life. And though neither of the two films are in the slightest bit realistic, Finding Nemo managed to turn a simple plot into a fun adventure, whereas Shark Tale turns several plots into an array of endless gags, jokes and stupidity. Though I found this far more hilarious than Finding Nemo and a really interesting depiction of an undersea world, Finding Nemo had more realistic animation and characters you could really care about - and not through endless jokes, gags or slapstick scenarios, just plain real life. Shark Tale seems more obsessed with being a cross between FN and The Godfather, and while it does pull off this job with hilarious results, everything is a bit too predictable and easily resolved. And at the end of the day, this really is just your standard animated flick. As James Bond would put it: ""Close, but no cigar.""

73,Avwillfan89,Awfully underrated,10,4 April 2010,"This animated story is set down in the ocean with the main characters as fish and mollusks. The story is about a unsatisfied tongue scrubber, Oscar, who works at the whale wash, owned by a blowfish, Mr Sykes, who has connected deals with local mob boss Don Lino. Both of them are literally in deep with the sharks. Oscar owes a huge and overdue debt to them, and his co-worker Angie, secretly in love with him, offers him the money to cover it, but he blows it all on a seahorse. Meanwhile, Don Lino is concerned about the image of his son, Lenny, who refuses to eat meat. He sends his other son, Frankie, to teach him how to hunt. They spot Oscar being tortured by Sykes's jellyfish henchmen, Ernie and Bernie and Frankie sends Lenny after him to gobble him up, but he just can't bring himself to eat a fish. Enraged, Frankie speeds after Oscar and is stopped by an anchor that lands on him and fatally wounds him. Lenny, distraught with grief and guilt, swims away. Ernie and Bernie then find Oscar beside the dead shark and assume that he killed him. Oscar now realizes he can take advantage of this and makes up a story that instantly brings him fame and fortune, and winning the heart of a beautiful but shallow lion fish, Lola. However, Don Lino, angered over the loss of his son, vows to find a way to get to him and make him pay.The message basically shows that Oscar, not knowing that Angie loves him, doesn't realize that he never needed to be at the top of the reef to feel good. Anyone who has good lives, making a good living and hanging out with friends, always want more out of life, and only once they loose the good life they had before, do they realize it. I think a lot of people can relate to that. This film has the best cast ever. The fact that all these brilliant actors are together in one film is what makes it worthwhile to watch. Robert De Niro, Will Smith, Martin Scorsese, Angelina Jolie, Renée Zelweger and Jack Black. I loved this film so much that I became obsessed with all the actors who appeared in it. It introduced me to Mafia films, which of course contained some of the best in all of film history. It also has an excellent soundtrack full of brilliant music, which in my opinion, is a thing a great movie has to have.Unfortunately, this picture has now become terribly underrated, so much that people don't even want to hear about it anymore, let alone praise it. After Shrek, Dreamworks produced this great film, then a second Shrek (not as good as the first one, but better than the third) and Madagascar. The latter, though compared to Shark Tale, was a disappointment, it became one of the last last good movies that Dreamworks Animation released. They just seemed to have lost it now. Even the acclaimed How To Train Your Dragon, which was much better than some of the previous Dreamwork films, lacks anything exceptional. Only Kung Fu Panda and Megamind seems to capture the real essence of Shark Tale and the first Shrek. They always mention Shrek and Madagascar in their new films, but never Shark Tale, which is a real shame. When you look it like that, there's really nothing bad about it. It's a funny comedy that really lifts your spirits. Pixar often continues makes outstanding movies, but I'll always remember this one as the film that introduced me to the real masterpieces of cinema.",Shark Tale
74,BadWebDiver,"Good, but probably the start of the B-grade CG movies.",7,17 October 2004,"Don't get me wrong, this is actually quite a dynamic and enjoyable movie. It has a great voice cast, plays very snappily, full of humor and emotion, and certainly works as a fun entertaining story for everyone.I especially enjoyed Martin Scorese in this. I've always thought he makes a neat actor - I also liked his role in QUIZ SHOW, and as a documentary narrator. His character is actually very funny in this; especially the fight scene with the ""turn on the TV, turn off the TV"" bit.I also give credit for Jack Black's work. If I hadn't known I would never have recognised his voice in this. It seems one of the few times when a modern actor has been allowed to put on an artificial persona for a role, and get away with it. And I thought the guy who played the octopus was very good, and gave some great personality to the story,And of course Will Smith and Robert DeNiro do hold their own as the central protagonist/antagonist of the story. Perhaps I'm being a bit flippant in almost taking them for granted.One of the scenes I didn't like however, was the big climactic statements in the ending. They are just too over-stated and pushy. The wrap-up is a little too neat and sentimental. In fact the big problem is that the whole story really doesn't seem ""worth it"" somehow. It's okay; but compared to some of the great CG animated movies we've been lucky enough to get over the past couple of years, this one does seem a bit second-class.

76,f-88612,Will Smith as a fish,4,7 May 2021,"It's a gangster movie... with fish. For kids. And that's as far as the originality goes. The filmmakers could even set this in the human world and literally have the same movie. While the movie made its budget back several times over, this is most likely the reason why it never got a follow-up. The protagonist dreams of fame, lies to everyone about being the hero, get involved in a romantic subplot borne of poor communication and because this is a kids movie, everyone just lets him off the hook. Being set in the human world would have no effect on the movie whatsoever. Oscar's shallow ambitions, selfish motivations, obnoxiously hip personality and downright criminal behaviour has made him one of the most infamous examples of a film's protagonist being the most disliked character. A major criticism levelled against the animation is that the character designs take Ink-Suit Actor to an uncomfortable extreme. Characters such as Oscar, Angie, Lola and Sykes look like the animators just stuck their actor's faces onto fish bodies and called it a day, with no other effort being put into anthropomorphisising them. The designs of the trendy pop stars on the soundtrack also look horribly off. They put Ludacris' face on a seahorse for goodness sake! The background characters look off due to Limited Animation, especially the stingrays, which have crazy eyes and large jaws.",Shark Tale
77,The_Orenda,Something was missing.,4,14 November 2004,"I can't explain why I didn't like Shark Tale too much. Visually there is a creative backdrop which is absolutely beautiful. I wonder if they just took pictures of New York, doused it underwater and worked around the scenery. Because with the exception of that imagery, Shark Tale has a very loud, very brash, in-your-face mentality that takes away from the movie. Other features like The Little Mermaid and Finding Nemo invite you to the paradise of being under the sea. Shark Tale throws you in the middle of the loudest club and tells you to get down on it. I don't buy it and with the exception of some visual gags, nobody else could neither. This is also another movie where Will Smith can get back into his Fresh Prince gear and get away with it and Jack Black could play a gender confused shark and be accepted for it as well. I wanted to enjoy the scenery and the sight of an underground New York. Shark Tale offered it but instead beat us silly with all the hoopla we see everyday on the television set.

78,oshram-3,Better than everyone is saying,8,4 October 2004,"Don't get me wrong, I like Pixar; I like them a lot. But they are not the ONLY people who can do CGI films. I heard all of this crap several years ago when someone dared to make Antz, which people compared to A Bug's Life; but because Bug's Life was Pixar, everyone embraced its mediocrity (IMO it was Pixar's one significant misstep) and shunned Antz, which was on the whole a superior film. Not that I would argue that Shark Tale is better than Finding Nemo; personally I don't think they're aiming at the same thing, anyway. But just because it isn't Pixar doesn't mean it's bad; and if you disagree with that statement, then just stop reading right now, because you won't like anything else that follows.Shark Tale follows the adventures of one Oscar (Will Smith) who dreams of being a big fish in, okay, a big pond. His best friend Angie (Renee Zellweger) loves and supports him no matter who he is. Trouble is, he's into his boss Sykes (Martin Scorcese) for five thousand clams, and a get-rich-quick scheme explodes in his face. About to become food for the fishes, Oscar has the good luck to run into Lenny (Jack Black) a black-sheep shark who is hiding out from his father, Don Lino (Robert DeNiro). Together the two of them make unlikely allies as they try to help each other out.Shark Tale indulges in a lot of puns, but most of them work pretty well. The non-traditional animation style  the humanoid fish sort of vaguely resemble the actors playing their voices  works better than you'd expect; the likenesses are pretty good, and yet still manage to fit the characters and their personalities (though featuring Angelina Jolie as, well, an overtly sexy fish reminded me mostly of Troy McClure from the Simpsons). The humor isn't aimed at kids; while they will appreciate much of the movie's bright colors and the broader jokes, a lot of the verbal play and send-ups are based on spoofs of adult films. I think your average adult will get more out of the film than your average kid.The voice acting is a cut above; Smith is right at home, and Zellweger, whom I normally don't like, is excellent. DeNiro is fine, as you would expect, as is Jolie; but the movie is really stolen by Jack Black and Martin Scorcese. The director's blowfish is the funniest thing about the film, from his quick rejoinders to the way his voice goes all helium when he balloons up. And Black, whom I really do not care for, is simply excellent.I was also surprised by the decision to have the central character be gay. While they never come out and call Lenny gay, the entire movie he is struggling with who he is, how he doesn't fit in with his family, and how he just wants to be loved and accepted by his father; interestingly, he is accepted into an urban culture, and then masquerades as something he's not. Again, while no one ever actually says the word gay, the metaphor is inherently obvious, and I liked and respected the movie for going in that direction; teaching tolerance, even in a semi-treacly form, is usually a good thing.I found Shark Tale to be witty, clever, and well-designed; it goes a little overboard in a few spots, but by and large it was immensely entertaining and I laughed most of the way through the film. I found it clever and engaging and a wonderful way to spend an hour and a half at the movies. Whether or not you go is your own decision, but I think you could find far worse ways to spend your time and money than to see this movie.",Shark Tale
79,Bravesfan17,It's fun enough,7,16 May 2011,"I honestly think that this is one of the Dreamworks Animation films that is nowhere near among their best. But it still is entertaining and fun.Will Smith stars as the voice of Oscar, a fish who seems content with just working at a whale wash. He keeps coming up with these ideas to make a quick buck that never pan out. They cause him to owe a substantial amount of money to his boss, Mr. Sykes. However, we find out that he really wants more out of life.When he has the money he owes ready to turn in, he ends up betting it instead. First, it causes a fish named Lola to be attracted to him. Then, the seahorse he bets on loses causing him to be tortured by Sykes's jellyfish assistants until some sharks come to attack him. One of them dies. The jellyfish think Oscar killed the shark. Oscar goes with their assumption.This causes him to live a huge lie. In order for the other fish to not find out, he must conceal with the other shark, Lenny, voiced by Jack Black. However, Oscar's close friend Angie, voiced by Renée Zellweger, finds out about Oscar's and Lenny's act and also has to keep it a secret.It's basically a fun story about a fish who keeps telling lie after lie in order to keep his reputation as the Shark Slayer. While it is not the best of Dreamworks, there is still some fun to it.My likes: I thought it was cool how the city that the film takes place in looks like an underwater version of New York City. I thought it was cool how the animation was able to capture the look of Times Square and make it look like a city for fish. I also liked seeing the sharks as a representation of the mafia. It was a great fit seeing how dominant sharks are. I also thought the actors all fit the characters they were voicing, especially Robert De Niro as Don Lino.My dislikes: I thought there were too many pop culture references. There were way too many lines and scenes that were referencing other films or related to modern culture. Most of the references will not be relevant 10, 20 years from now. The story drags at many times and throws off the pace of the film.",Shark Tale
80,dhaufrect-1,"""Shark Tale"" is a musical hit.",7,10 March 2005,"""Shark Tale""is a real musical hit. Katie Couric's voice is heard as Katie Current.She is delightfully cast in this role. Will Smith plays the voice of Oscar the energetic fish. Robert De Niro is the voice of Don Lino, and he does a whale of a good job. Angelina Jolie plays the voice of Lola,and her character is as sexy as the actual star. This cartoon done with much computer generated animation is a charm. It is not as satisfying as some of the original Disney cartoons of the 50's, but the music is worth the rental. It is now on DVD and one should see it with the kids. The credits are just as much fun as the film. The children will be enchanted.",Shark Tale
81,pokemon_trainer_lucas,A good watch,7,21 June 2019,"This film is definitely worth a watch. The characters are engaging but simple, the best of which is probably Lenny the shark because he is the more complex and relatable character. The graphics leave a bit to be desired, simply because they are quite childish and 2 dimensional rather than attempting to look immersive and 3D. There was the odd funny moment, but most of the humour was aimed at kids and so it wasn't all that great. It's probably a good film to see with your kid, but probably wouldn't merit a second viewing.",Shark Tale

So I believed this must have been a family/children movie as well. But it wasn't. Not entirely, at least. Mostly it was movie for adults. Not that it had sex scenes in it, but it focused on a life of a man instead of a boy fish like Nemo.",Shark Tale
83,Adam-09265,I suppose it was alright,6,18 December 2020,"It's hard for me to judge properly as when this movie came out i was 9 years old, i liked it as a child i thought it was a funny story, i liked the characters and thought the dialog was extremely quotable. As i got older infact quite recently i watched the movie again as it was on TV, i was feeling the nostalgia but at the same time dulled out. It just didn't feel the same anymore, i noticed straight away all the rip off quotes from greater movies. Knowing the cast, it strikes me as a comedy mobster movie or a tease at least, the story is original but riddled with puns, quotes, extreme stereotypes it can end up getting cringy.The animation isn't so bad but at times can look like videogame graphics.I wouldn't try to judge this too much, it's more of something to watch with your children because most likely they will enjoy it if you don't.",Shark Tale
84,Angels_Review,The story feels a bit bla. Very Typical,6,5 April 2014,"As a concept for this movie, I have to say this is a pretty typical story falling in the same lines as Dragonheart or other 'fake something to get famous' story lines. You know that soon the guy will be found out and that he will end up having to do something to make up for it. What I guess I wouldn't see is that Will Smith would have a face as fish but I guess being a blood cell would change a guy (Osmosis Jones). This show is very different then 'Finding Nemo' in that it's not a heart warming story but pretty much a make it or break it story. I find it slightly boring in that aspect since you pretty much knew exactly how the story would pan out. It's a simple story, city plagued by mobsters, one man that is on the bottom of the ladder wants to become better but he doesn't know how till he pretends he has done something really high and mighty to get there, screwing it up in the end.The character Oscar is a really predictable character. He is a man who can never really catch a break no matter what he does. He tries to become rich but then crashes to the ground. Soon he becomes a liar just to get on the top and ends up hurting those around him. Lenny on the other hand is a black sheep of the family who wants to just be left alone. I think Lenny's story is much more interesting although again, very cliché. There really isn't that much of a difference between other movies I watched with the same basic outline and it makes me feel bla about the show. They could of taken it much farther but came up short.The animation is pretty good, characters look more like humans then fish in the face and movement but still retain their fishy way of swimming instead of trying to walk on the bottom like some other shows. Textures look like they are where they are supposed to be and make everything real looking and popping out but the colors make it more childish. It has pretty much a perfect balance between 'real life' and animation. Some character designs have been made for the fish that it's supposed to be to a point that if you look up the type of fish they represented, it would look very close.Angelina Jolie, Jack Black, Will Smith and a couple other big names and voices are some of the bigger parts. I don't really have a problem with any of the voices in the main cast, though the problems I see are that some of them have been rather stereotyped. Still, it was rather enjoyable for the most part. Music sounded pretty good but I still have problems with the story even if it worked on the sound aspect.",Shark Tale
85,Derek237,The cinematic equivalent of fish food,6,5 July 2006,"Okay, so let's pretend for a minute that a wizard or something cast a spell on all of humanity and we were all turned into fish and had to live underwater, but had to cope with it in some way. This new world would look something like the one in Shark Tale. They're fish, but they seem a lot more like people anyway (and most of the characters resemble the actors who provide their voices). It's the same principle as The Flintstones, really, except with a nautical theme instead of a prehistoric one; instead of seeing Ed Sullistone on TV, we see Katie Current. You get it.The movie itself is generally pretty silly. It's not like Finding Nemo, a good family movie that all ages could enjoy, it's aimed more at the kids. It has silly jokes and cheap laughs, but the satire in the plot would most likely go over kids' heads. And even some of the smaller gags will not make any sense, as I really doubt any kids watching this have ever seen A Few Good Men, Jerry Maguire, or, well, actually, some may have seen Gladiator. The boys, at least. But never mind that all. Because it has enough silliness to distract the kids and annoy the adults.The cast is great, I'll admit that. It is definitely the highlight of the movie. Whoever thought of using director Martin Scorsese's voice? He is such a great director, but does have that unique voice, added to the fact that DeNiro, who starred in many of his most popular films, plays a role- I just think it was a great idea. But, that does bring me to a big nitpick of mine: If you had DeNiro and Scorsese together in an animated feature, such as this, wouldn't you want to have their characters interact more? They have only have two scenes together (3 if you count one with their characters talking on the phone- and since it's an animated film with only their voices anyway, why wouldn't you count it?) and they were just stupid. It was kind of like a pathetic, dumbed-down version of the ""Who's on first"" thing.I don't really think Shark Tale was a bad movie, but with CGI films increasing and increasing in releases, this will be one that probably won't be remembered as well as some others. It was really just a silly cartoon, and you can't really read too much into it. And it's not a movie you need to devote much attention to. It's sort of the cinematic equivalent of fish food. It keeps the fish alive and everything, but I don't think the fish really rave about the flavour. It works, it's fine, but it doesn't stand out.My rating: 6/10",Shark Tale
86,irishboy141,Garbage that has not aged well,1,10 January 2018,"This is a generic ganster movie disguised as a kids film. It has product placement out the wazoo. And the only reason it's animated was to leech off the sucess of Finding Nemo; I'm dead serious, the story itself would not change if you made it live action and set it in New York. Aside from that; the ""characters"" are shot like humans are shot in live action (because this movie was made by hacks), the voice acting is terrible, the ""characters"" are boring stereotypes, the plot is generic, the color pallet is ugly, the characters are ugly, the environment is ugly, and since I'm reviewing this movie in 2018, I can say this feels so dated and disgusting.Skip this trash and watch Finding Nemo.",Shark Tale
87,Boggman,Rotten fish........,3,10 June 2005,"Now a days, when you see a computer animated film (especially from Dreamworks), you expect it to please not only the kiddies, but the adults as well. You assume there will be humorous references that some children won't be able to catch, but that the grown-ups will understand and find entertaining as well.You count on a little something in there for everybody (i.e. Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Shrek, Toy Story).More importantly, you hope the movie will strike the funny bone of both generations so that the film can be appreciated and enjoyed by both genres.Shark Tale has very little of this, and what it does manage to muster up, is surprisingly unfunny. In fact, Shark Tale is a pretty horrible film altogether. Not all the star power in the world could make this film less than the dreadful bore that it is.These fish live in a very adult-like society (think of New York underwater), but there is just no good adult humor in this film!! Maybe kids will like it. But this is not an enjoyable film for us grown-ups. In fact, this movie is so bad, I won't bother to review its lousy story any further. There are plenty of other reviews that do that.Be warned: This fish STINKS......badly. The best thing for this reviewer about Shark Tale was the fact that I rented it and didn't buy it.Returning a movie never felt so good!",Shark Tale
88,Sparrowmaniac,A Tale Of A Nobody,7,1 April 2005,"I thought Shark Tale would be much similar to Finding Nemo, but after watching the movie I must say that its predecessor was way too good.....The one thing which maybe was a little more enjoyable than Nemo, was the script.... And that was expectable, since Will Smith had to have a funny script.... Tha animation and underwater graphics, is still the same if not a little better, than Nemo, but the entire story line is hopelessly weak.....The story revolves around a tiny little fish, Oscar, who aspires to be the most popular fish of the reef, but hasn't got the capability.... He owes loads of money to his boss, who decides to get rid of him... He orders his henchmen, 2 jellyfishes, to scratch him, but whilst they were planning, a shark comes out of nowhere, to have a bite.... Here in a an accident of the most freakiest kind, the shark dies.... But this shark was no ordinary shark, he was the son of the mafia don..... Maddened with grief, the dead shark's younger vegetarian brother, goes away, and stumbles upon Oscar.....From here on, the story goes on revolving upon the love interest of Oscar, and how he gets everything okay between, the sharks and the fishes.... The movie has parts which are sure to remind you of the godfather, and Robert DeNiro, gives an amazing performance as the shark don.....(For instance the don's right hand man's name was Luca, remember The Godfather) Also, Jack Black gives another great role as Leni, the vegetarian shark.... Renee Zelwegger's role as Oscar's love interest is also, very good and stellar, Angelina Jolie's small role as the illustrious Lola, the sex doll, is also pretty good, Martin Scorsese, does a cameo, as Oscar's boss, but doesn't create much of a mark to the movie.... And lastly Will Smith, well basically this was his movie and his voice gave a new life to Oscar, the shark slayer, and he brought the character to life, giving him the cool attitude that he is known for, and that may well be the only thing worth watching for in Shark Tale, otherwise a pretty forgettable movie.........7/10 from me.....",Shark Tale
89,JimD73,Some Funny Mobster Jokes Can't Keep Shark Tale From Going Belly-Up,2,13 April 2005,"Plot: 8/20: Oscar (Smith) feels like a little fish in a big pond. Literally. In the world of the fishes, he is a simple tongue scrubber at the Whale Wash (a car wash for whales). Oscar also happens to be a rapper wannabe, and his best friend Angie (Zellweger) is secretly in love with home, for a reason that remains a mystery to me. Oscar is sick of living at the bottom and wants to live at the top of the reef, where all the 'somebodys' live.The sharks, whom all the other fish are afraid of, are essentially the mafia. The current godfather, Don Lino (deNiro) is soon retiring and leaving control of the reef to his two sons, Frankie (Imperioli) and Lenny (Black). Frankie has the brawn for the job, but Lenny, on the other hand, is afraid to eat anything alive, and has become a vegetarian.Also, Don Lino is cracking down on pufferfish Sykes (Scorsese), who owns the Whale Wash, to pay up for protection. To come up with the money, Sykes cracks down on Oscar to pay the $5000 he owes. Angie lends him the money, but he blows it all on a horse race. When Syke's bodyguards Ernie (Marley) and Bernie (Doug) are torturing Oscar, Frankie is attempting to train Lenny. When he sees Oscar, he tells Lenny to attack. Ernie and Bernie run, but Oscar is tied down. Just so happens that Lenny sets Oscar free instead. When Frankie sees this, he chases Oscar himself, only to be hit by an anchor and killed during the chase. Lenny runs away, and Oscar takes credit for Frankie's death. In doing so, he becomes a phenomenon, the legendary Shark Slayer, and finally lives at the top of the reef.However, when Don Lino finds out about this, he is going to get very angryTechnically, the plot works. It doesn't come with any clever twists or anything really original. It is a nice send-up of mobster movies, though the rap influence is cringe worthy at time. And by 'at times', I mean through 90% of the movie.Not to mention the whole ""Be yourself"" message is pretty worn out by now.Comedy: 12/20: Surprisingly, this movie manages to have some funny bits. However, they only occur when it attempts to satire the mobster movies. Aside from the opening sequence and one or two jokes here and there, all of the comedy is derived from the mobster spoofs. Some are subtle, some are more obvious, but this movie does manange to be a rather clever mobster spoof. Most of this may go over the heads of the younger crowd, but it manages to keep the older crowd interested, at least for those parts.However, when it tries to put on its pimp face and do the normal silly crap we despise in animated movies, it falls flat on its ass. There is nothing I hated more than seeing a Martin Scorsese voiced pufferfish wearing a pimp hat and touching his butt and saying ""I'm hott!"" It just isn't necessary. It just isn't humane.Animation: 7/20: DreamWorks made Shrek, and Shrek looked pretty good. Then they made this, and while it holds up to old standards, it isn't all that pleasing to look at. The sharks looks good, but some of the fish, namely Oscar, look pretty bad. They manage to make the characters look like the actors playing them, which works well with people, but bringing the concept over to fish doesn't work as well. A mild taint of the actor is fine, but do not try to recreate the actor. Sykes is probably the only fish who looks good, and the technical crew had better luck with the sharks than the fish.There were also some major inconsistencies. Oscar's size grows and shrinks multiple times. Sometimes, he's small enough to fit in anywhere. Sometimes, he's big enough to logically fake taking down a shark. They really needed to fix that problem there.Voice Acting: 13/20: The voice cast has some bright spots. Robert deNiro (Goodfellas) is the obvious choice to spoof many of his old roles, and he does it pretty well. Granted, how hard could it really be? Its voice acting, it doesn't take much talent.Jack Black (Orange County) is the only real standout. He does a great voice for Lenny, and is the only one who doesn't sound like just his real self.The rest are mediocre. Scorsese just embarrasses himself with stupid pimp lines. Smith spews out enough bull that he gets on my nerves. No one else really deserves mentioning.Entertainment: 8/20: If you are in the mood for a gangster spoof, you will find parts of this hilariously entertaining. However, if you are one of these types, chances are the rap influence will just annoy you. Those who enjoy rapper slang will likely not catch the gangster references. It's a vicious cycle.Bonus-.3 for the advertising: We get pumped full of ads for Gap and Coke and, hell, we even get ads for Preparation H. Will it never end! At least it doesn't try to hide it at all and just comes out and says ""These people paid us!"" -.3 for rap influence -.5 for the end scene: Just to show that this movie is riding off of Shrek's success, there is a dance sequence at the end. Kill me now.TOTAL: 36%: I could tell that Shark Tale, beneath all the rap influence and bulls*** messages, was a decent gangster spoof. However, to look through all that crap for a couple jokes is just not worth it. Kids will not get the gangster references and basically only enjoy a pufferfish in a pimp hat. Adults will like the gangster references, but will cringe to tears at the rap influence. It is a lose-lose situation.",Shark Tale
90,Minerva_Meybridge,"This is not, repeat, not, a kids's movie!",10,2 March 2005,"I don't know what critics were thinking. The writers and animators had a field day. This is a subtle adult comedy that that works like a Woody Allen film. It is not for children. The film is loaded with subtle gags. Take, for instance, the shark character, voiced by Peter Falk. The shark's name is Don Feinstein. Don is an Italian title and this is supposedly a shark mafia, headed by Robert Diniro's character, Feinstein is a Jewish name. And, if you look closely, you notice that Don Feinstein has a ""glass"" eye like Peter Falk, which doesn't quite sink with the other (no pun intended). When old Don Feinstein passes gas bubbles. the shark behind him takes a moment to inhale them, then passes out. Virtually every scene has something, but you have to look. This is an ""insiders"" animation film. I guess Dreamworks feels they have enough money to do something like this once in a while. Remember, Dreamworks animation started out by winning Cannes awards for their shorts.So, if you're not a TV and film buff, prepared to be bored by what appears to be a mediocre story line. Or if you're a teenager who think Columbo is a country in South America... Drown me if I'm lying, but this is a great film! And don't miss the Gigi the Whale short on the DVD.",Shark Tale
91,qball_82,"Big, stinky, rotten Shark Tale..",3,25 October 2004,"We'll be seeing Shrek 3 within the next couple of years and I'm sure a Shrek 4 is in the pipeline already. DreamWorks must know it can't milk the Shrek franchise forever and if it was hoping SharkTale could prove a worthy successor, they are sadly mistaken.I believe this film was originally titled SharkSlayer (before becoming the unimaginatively titled SharkTale), and I bet DreamWorks was hoping it would be their NEMO Slayer. Too bad, try again. I'm sorry but comparisons are inevitable between two completely CGI films set in a vast watery expanse. SharkTale is all flash, pretty colors and big name actors with an endless drivel of pop- culture references. Pretty on the surface, completely lacking underneath. Will Smith's over the top, contrived schtick became irritating after the first couple of minutes and Black, De Niro, Zellweger and Jolie are nothing but big name drawcards.The ""weird-looking humanized fish-people"" kept making me think I was watching some alien film. It was only because of the bubbles and seaweed and sand that I was reminded this was set under the ocean. This film is for the kids, and anybody who gets a kick out of pop-culture jokes and flashy CG visuals. For something meatier, with heart and originality, go elsewhere.DreamWorks had better get a new recipe because this one was tired and stale six months ago. Get some better stories. Get some funnier jokes. Get some originality. For now and the foreseeable future, the computer animation crown is safe and sound in Pixar's hands.",Shark Tale
92,fibreoptic,Just as good as Finding Nemo if not better.,9,19 October 2004,"Yet another fun animated movie which unfortunately will live forever in the shadow of Finding Nemo. Shark Tale has got fishes and sharks in the ocean just like Finding Nemo but that is where the similarities end. Finding Nemo doesn't really have a true villain where as Shark Tale does. Finding Nemo is based more on reality where as Shark Tale isn't. The animation for Finding Nemo i would have to say is slightly better but i enjoyed Shark Tale slightly more.In Shark Tale the humour is quite good and a couple of subtle jokes for adults to laugh at. The characters are all pretty good especially the shrimp. Funny how that shrimp sounds a lot like Mr Hankey and Towelie from South Park! The Jelly fish also kick ass!My only little annoyance with Shark Tale is how Oscar looks too much like the guy providing his voice, Will Smith. Did they really need to do that? Don Lino looks a little like Robert De Niro but Will Smith's character is really taking the p*ss! Also the ending where Christina whats her face and Missy something or other (sorry, not big into pop music) come on as fishes and do a song. I thought that tarnished what is otherwise quite a great movie. Oh well, can't have everything. 9/10",Shark Tale
93,miro-6,Bad rates and bad posts -Why?- This movie is fantastic,8,17 October 2004,"Don't listen to people who talks bad about this fantastic movie. I loved all made by Pixar 3D movies (Toy Story, Monsters, Ice age and Nemo)and I respect Pixar as the company who invented this kind of cartoons but I loved Dreamworks 3D movies too(Shrek and Shark Tales). So I have seen the all of those. In my opinion Shark Tale is very better than Nemo. Nemo has been the first one under water and I can understand that impressed people a lot but Shark Tale is really funny and cool. I don't know why so many bad posts. Somebody wrote: ""Don't bring your children to this movie they will be bored"". This is an absurdity. I liked this movie very much more than Nemo as it is great in the same way as graphic but very funnier. I guess that many of those posts are pushed by somebody who has a particular convenience to do that. Shark Tale is a great great 3d movie, funny and intelligent. I'm on the point to come back to the theater and see it again. Go and see it with or without your children, you will be not disappointed. My vote is 8 on 10.",Shark Tale
94,filmbuff-36,"Lifeless product of Hollywood groupthink, devoid of even the slightest inspiration",4,2 December 2004,"Had ""Shark Tale"" had even an iota of the wit and charm that seems to have little trouble finding its way into Pixar's creations, the movie might have been more enjoyable. At the least the filmmakers could have snuck in some funny social commentary through the veil of animation.What we have instead is an urban, glib, lifeless product that is market-tested and ready for consumption. An empty ghetto-fabulous morality tale loaded with pop culture references and plenty of bling-bling but no heart.Under the ocean, Oscar (voice of Will Smith) is a tongue-scrubber at a ""whale-wash"" and part-time hustler. He wishes for a better life, hoping to swim his way to the top of the fish social ladder, though his coworker Angie (voice of Renee Zellweger) thinks he should be happy with who he is, and tries to subtly drop hints that she's quite taken with him.Meanwhile, great white shark and local crime boss Don Lino (voice of Robert De Niro) is planning to turn his family business over to his two sons, Frankie and Lenny. But Lenny (voice of Jack Black) is harboring some serious issues concerning eating other fish, and the godfather is worried his weak son with reflect poorly on him.Oscar has problems. In debt to his boss Sykes (voice of Martin Scorsese), he soon ends up in hot water. However, fate runs him smack into Frankie and Lenny. During the scuffle, an anchor accidentally kills Frankie and Oscar is mistakenly given credit for the kill. Now a media celebrity for being a ""shark slayer,"" Oscar rides his status all the way to the top, with Sykes managing his interests and the sharks fuming that their top spot in the food chain is quickly losing its power.Situations soon escalate and Oscar and Lenny reach an agreement: if they fake a battle and Oscar emerges triumphant, he can keep his credibility as a shark slayer and Lenny can start a new life.""Shark Tale"" openly references ""The Godfather"" and ""Jaws"" at every opportunity, which in and of itself isn't too bad except that so little is made of the main plot itself that the whole move feels like a patchwork of other, better movies, just with a meaningless hip-hop attitude. The special effects are up to par but there's nothing really special about them. The audience needs a story and characters, not just choreographed dance sequences and goofy product placements.All this might have been negligible had the movie actually been funny. This, sadly, is not the case. I only recorded one good laugh during the screening I attended, and that involved a shark voiced by Peter Falk whose flatulence had the expected effect on a henchmen. When a fart joke is the best you have to offer, then you've got serious problems.The story also steals shamelessly from the 1942 Disney cartoon ""The Reluctant Dragon,"" which featured a fixed battle between a loudmouth braggart knight and a pacifist dragon to keep the locals off both their backs. That story was at least short and cute, neither of which can be said about this debacle.Along with the plot, voice acting is pretty lifeless as well. Smith gets to indulge his ego, playing his own persona on screen once again, this time in fish form. De Niro and Scorsese seem to be having fun spoofing their own tough guy roles, but that's about it from them. The biggest surprise is how much of a laid-back performance Black gives. His trademark manic desperation is nowhere to be seen, playing instead a shockingly normal character. Had he cut loose, the scenes he's in might have been more enjoyable. What's stranger is his hiding of his vegetarian leanings from his dad is handled like an allegory for a gay person coming out to his parents.When is Hollywood going to realize it doesn't matter how many famous actors you get to do voices for your characters; if the story sucks, then no amount of acting talent is going to save it? There are three Academy Award winners in this cast, just don't use that as a benchmark for excellence.This all amounts to another animated project from DreamWorks high on energy and low on inspiration. After ""Spirit: Stallion of the Cimmarron,"" ""Road to El Dorado"" and ""Sinbad"" all tanked, it's clear that the ""Shrek"" series is the only good thing the studio has going for it right now.Of course, there's no escaping comparison to that other computer animated fish movie, either, and that's when this film looks most wanting. Where Pixar's ""Finding Nemo"" swam the full depths of the ocean, ""Shark Tale"" seems content to just tread water in the wading pool.4 out of 10 stars. Pretty to look at, but any movie that tries to push this much ""coolness"" down your throat is just asking to be despised.",Shark Tale
95,JAKastner,The Moose Hole - Review of Shark Tale,6,4 October 2004,"Undoubtedly one of the most famous, and most entertaining (depending on who you ask), rivalries in Hollywood would have to belong to the ongoing conflict between the Walt Disney Company and Dreamworks SKG. After Jeffrey Katzenberg left Disney in 1994 to form his own movie studio with hot-shot director Steven Spielberg, the two studios have butted heads on more then a few occasions and look to continue to do so in the future. This rivalry has gotten so bad that one or the other have accused the other of ripping off their ideas in order to profit from their success. In 1998, two animated films featuring insects opened up in theaters  PDI's Antz in October followed by Pixar's A Bug's Life less then a month later. Conveniently Dreamsworks' eventual Oscar winning animated film Shrek, featuring a monster for a lead, opened just six months prior to the release of Disney's Monsters Inc. which, obviously, focused on the world of monsters.And if this obvious trend of copy-catting isn't apparent by now then perhaps this latest match-up will. Following the smashing success of Disney/Pixar's Finding Nemo which netted $340 million domestically alone, Dreamsworks, attempting to one-up Disney before the release of their latest venture with Pixar The Incredibles, hopes Shark Tale will raise their future IPOs to sky-high levels.The story centers on a 'small fish in a big pond', also known as the ocean, who lies to become a big shot but finds out that holding up the lie was a lot harder then he originally thought. Oscar has huge aspirations for himself but little effort to back it up with. Most of the time he spends coming up with crazy 'get rich quick' schemes, for example  bottled water, and trying to persuade his boss to give him the money to enact on those plans. Unfortunately, those plans, as would be expected, never pay off and Oscar finds himself five-thousand clams in debt with his boss, who is pressuring him for the money thanks to his partnership with Don Lino, the mafia shark of the ocean. When Oscar can't pay his boss, he's tied up and dumped into the middle of a training ground for sharks, with Frankie, the oldest son of Don Lino, heading straight for him. Just as Oscar seems to be done it, an anchor mysterious falls onto Frankie's head and kills him. Since no one is around when the event occurs, Oscar makes up the story that he beat up Frankie in a fight and dubs himself 'The Sharkslayer'. This outrageous event brings Oscar a wide range of fame and fortune but when the Don discovers who he is, a bounty has been placed on his head. Oscar can't see what the fuss is all about over one teeny-tiny little white lie. The story for Shark Tale is a problem within itself, specifically there's very little of it present and any that does exist is all too generic and predictable to be called the least bit interesting, even by preschool standards. The film's entire premise and purpose is based on its trivial references to popular culture. This means that whenever there is a drought of references then the story suffers severely and slowly begins to drag. Even when references are made (for example, Corral-Cola  big laugh everyone) they aren't gut-busters, let alone thought provoking, which is the direct opposite of Pixar's line of humor.As with any Dreamworks animated venture, whether it be traditional, which has virtually gone the way of the dinosaur not just with this studio, or computer-generated, the studio devotes more time on stock-piling A-list voice-over talent rather then a more prominent issue, specifically the story, and Shark Tale is no exception to the rule. Will Smith, the former Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, voices the fast-talking fish-out of water  well, umm, fish named Oscar. If you find Smith's slick spiel and  then you'll be loathing the hour and a half of this film. There was so much promise as his fabulous performances in Men In Black and Independence Day but now it seems as though Wild, Wild West woke us up to the reality that, like the film, his choice of film projects stinks on ice. And here's a question for the older audience members, aka the parents purposely dragged to this feature by their all-too cute children, does Will Smith's Oscar not draw eerie similarities to the Incredible Mr. Limpet? Scary, huh? The problem with the film's aquatic cast of characters is not exactly their material, though that's separate problem itself, but rather it is the performers themselves. The real issue is that we've all seen, or heard, these actors and actresses play out these exact same characters in an obviously different environment. For example, Robert DeNiro as a mafia boss  Who didn't see that one coming? Granted it might have been slightly more entertaining had the filmmakers stuck with their original choice, that being James Gandolfini, but not by much. The same goes for Smith as the fast-talking and wise-cracking hero, Jolie as the sexy seductress, and Black as the dim-witted, yet lovable, sidekick.Overall, whether Shark Tale is a cheap attempt to cash in on the success of the underwater family film Finding Nemo or a lame attempt at pop culture humor, in either case it just simply doesn't work. After marveling audiences this past summer with the vastly superior Shrek 2, both Dreamworks and PDI demonstrate that someone seriously dropped the beach-ball on this one, perhaps while executives at the top were distracted counting the stockpiles of money the highly anticipated sequel brought it. It's a hard job but someone, beside the accountant, has to do it.First off, there doesn't seem to be a story with this film at all except for a striking similarity to the Brave Little Tailor, but other then that, it was basically free reign for the animators to do what they wanted. And secondly, the differences between Pixar and PDI are prominent when it comes to pop culture references. With Pixar, they concentrate primarily on the film's story and, whenever they have the opportunity to, they insert a reference to a movie or a celebrity or something like that  they never force the story into a direction for the sole purpose of a joke or base an entire film on a running-gag concept, as this film does. Shark Tale is not by any stretch of the imagination a horrible film, parts are even quite charming, but, not to give the filmmakers too much credit, does lack the originality and spunk that would deem it an enjoyable film.My Rating: *** out of 5 (Grade: C-)",Shark Tale

98,Edu-16,Compared with it's illustrious peers - very average,5,12 October 2004,"Spurred to write after reading the rather blatantly biased front page user comment....In no way should this movie be mentioned in the same breath as Nemo, Toy Story, Shrek 2, Ice Age etc. It's not in their league - or should that be fathom? It lacks 'wit' and subtlety and tries waaaay too hard to be fast and funny - when it's actually neither. It's bland and very forgettable.The storyline was un-original and linear - the characters stereo-types. I winced at each 'fish related' gag - and found the main character annoying. The whole was predictable and ironically - colourless.I think that the energy of this medium wains. The wow factor of the comp. animation has worn off - and the focus falls more and more on the storyline and characters. It's not enough to pack each scene with visual detail and hire charismatic voice-overs. Ice age was a lesson that less can be more - and it's a shame that Sharks Tale didn't work this out. They thought underwater detail and light effects and a few fin-gags was all that was needed. Not for this viewer it isn't.What bothers me is that this is top of the box office in the states. Hoping they have a school holiday over there at the moment....Is it me - or does the lowest common denominator get lower and lower each year?",Shark Tale

101,lumieretrain,"Shark Tale by Vicky Jenson, Bibo Bergeron, Rob Letterman",5,21 March 2020,"The stories about how the main characters who get popular, through either the truth or a lie, are interesting to see how they would handle it. Especially to see if they would feel initially grateful, to then start to have doubts, if it is right or wrong in what the main characters do. As often their parents, their friends or even their fiancés would react in the negative way, to disagree with the popularity of the main characters. Then in the end the main characters would take the decision, by either remaining as popular as the people recognize, or giving everything up to follow a different life and try to do the right thing. The DreamWorks Animation have been interested to develop a story with this theme, but set the story underworld of the sea, as the fishes and other undersea creatures are the characters to be followed in the story. By relating the audience with the way the characters do around in the television, shops, advertisements, journalisms and so on. The filmmakers Vicky Jenson, Bibo Bergeron and Rob Letterman have been involved as the directors of the project, by trying to develop the story in the creative way as well as in the profound way. The movie has been elaborated with the settings and with the characters, in every single details of the animation in the creative and in the colorful way. After a long time of work, in 2004 came out Shark Tale by Vicky Jenson, Bibo Bergeron and Rob Letterman, with Will Smith, Robert De Niro, Renée Zellweger, Angelina Jolie, Jack Black and Martin Scorsese. The movie's plot: In the underworld of the sea, the son of the shark mob boss Frankie (Michael Imperioli) gets accidentally killed by an anchor, while he was hunting with his vegetarian brother Lenny (Jack Black). The young fish Oscar (Will Smith) is found in the scene, as he takes advantage by telling a lie that he killed Frankie. While Oscar gets popular like he's a kind of superhero, the boss mob Don Lino (Robert De Niro) seeks vengeance by trying to find Oscar, who gets then called the Sharkslayer. The premise of the movie seems to be interesting, to give the audience some reflections about the popularity. As the animation of the movie has been elaborated, to be as detailed as possible in the colorful way, by making the story funny and in the same way emotional. Especially in the moments where the characters are taking some important choices, to see if they are going to do the right thing or the wrong thing. The movie from the beginning to the end, entertains the audience with funny as well as thrilling moments, which are fused with humor and rhythmic songs. As these elements capture the audience attention, to be perfect as a family movie. But there should have been more exploration, about the lives of the people in different social classes, by making clear if there are some people who want to believe in a big dream, or even what they hope for their future. Will Smith has done a well done performance as Oscar, a young fish who works in the Whale Wash as tongue scrubber and he wants to be loved as much as some popular celebrities. Oscar's biggest influence has always been his father, who was the number one tongue scrubber. Once Oscar gets popular from a lie, he would be initially so happy, to be loved by everyone, until he realizes that is better to be honest, rather than to be a fake image. Even there should have been more details, about the way Oscar lives to see how difficult his situation is, before he gets popular. As well as there should have been sequences, about how the relationship between Oscar and his father, was more or less close with each other. Another more or less sequences which could make the movie interesting, is since Oscar gets popular how he would use the money to make more or less kindness on the people who need help. Robert De Niro did an excellent performance as Don Lino, a shark boss mob who takes care about his sons Frankie and Lenny. Even Don Lino's relationship with his son Lenny is difficult, as he hopes Lenny would become a strong shark like Frankie. Since Don Lino has heard about the popularity on Oscar as the Sharkslayer, his anger would increase to seek the vengeance with no mercy. Even there should have been more details, about the relationship with Don Lino's family, to see how close he is with his family, as well as how his anger would grow in every steps. In the same way, there should have been some flashbacks about Don Lino's father, to see if there are more or less parallelism on the relationship between him and his son Lenny. Renée Zellweger did an interesting performance as Angie, a young fish who is the best friend and colleague of Oscar. Angie is the one to believe in Oscar, as well as she is the one who would make Oscar reflect about the choices he takes. Even there should have been more details, about how Angie hopes to get close to him with love. As well as about what Angie's family think about the way, she moves forward with her choices. Angelina Jolie has done a well done performance as Lola, a seductive fish who pays attention only on the popularity. Since Oscar gets popular, Lola starts to have a romantic relationship, which would cause a problem between Oscar and Angie. Even there should have been more details, about the way Lola lives, as well as if she is following a particular lifestyle. To see if Lola lives in a more or less illusory life, or even if she is more or less involved with the mob sharks. Jack Black did an excellent performance as Lenny, a vegetarian shark and son of Don Lino. Since the death of Frankie, Lenny leaves Don Lino to disappear, as he cannot be as strong as his brother Frankie. Since he finds out the popularity of Oscar, Lenny befriends with him. Even there should have been more details, about when Lenny has started to be vegetarian, to see also who has influenced him to be different from Frankie. As well as what Lenny wishes to become, rather than to become a mob like his brother and especially like his father. Martin Scorsese has done a well done performance as Sykes, the owner of the Whale Wash. Sykes is also the loan shark for which he asks Oscar to find 5.000 clams, to pay a debt to the sharks, after he had been fired by Don Lino. Even there should have been more details, about how Sykes met Don Lino and how the business of Whale Wash has started. To see also how the business keeps moving forward, either in the good or even in the bad way. Shark Tale is an entertaining colorful movie perfect as family movie, filled with humor and rhythmic songs. But the movie has some unanswered questions, which the characters could have been better developed.",Shark Tale
102,pwoods1,An ocean full of dying fish,3,21 March 2005,"I wasn't going to add to the tales of disappointment regarding this film, but: the producers deserve yet another diatribe.Perhaps we've been spoilt with choice. Previous CGA (no, I didn't mean CGI: it's an A for animation) epics and short films have had, in the main, original stories and plot lines. ""Shark Tale"" has no originality at all. Is it ironic? No. It's derivative and badly so. Is it contemporary? No. We saw the same films masquerading as entertainment last century. (I've always wanted to say that!) Any 'hip' romantic/musical comedy such as ""Carwash"" et alia would always have been uncomfortable with or refused bonding to ""Goodfellas"" or (because of casting and plot line) such TV staples as ""The Sopranos"".OK. The chosen voice talent is excellent. What happened to expression and nuances in delivery? It would perhaps have been better (and ironic) if each actor had reprised a recognised screenrole. The only one seeming to do this is Will Smith. Yet Oscar/Will is exactly what we expect: smartmouthed express delivery of clichéd dialogue.Look: the animation is excellent, the backgrounds to die for. Apart from the excessive product placement, they are exceptional. But it all seems so tired, so been there before.Loved the visuals, hated the film. A begrudging 3/10.",Shark Tale

Don't try a stereotype it saying only those in the ""black crowd"" like it, especially because it has Will Smith. lol wut???)Oh, and the the Nostalgia Critic is wrong, for being way too biased about this. I LIKE this film! Because it RULES! It's funny, it's creative, and it's cool & has effort! It ain't no ""masterpiece"", but it's not ""bad"" either! What do you expect from DreamWorks??? Don't put too much pressure on them! And Oscar the fish?? I never found him ugly! He does have a big mouth though. lulzBeing 12 when I first saw this, MAN, did I get a kick out of it! Though understand, ""nostalgic"" doesn't mean ""better"" - it just means you're more attached to it. But on it's own, I believe it still holds up to this day! And I think it DOESN'T deserve to get a majority of the hate it's been getting for who knows who. It really seems like films have the tendency to be overrated or either underrated, unfairly hated or unfairly loved these days - c'mon, all the hate on this film should be re-directed at something else; like ""Never Cry Wolf"", a horrid film that should NOT be called a ""Disney"" film.Moving way back, I give CREDIT to this animated film for INTRODUCING me to many big Hollywood names! Yeah, most of them I didn't really know at the time! I guess it's the cool thing about kid's films - famous names should at SOMETIME make their introduction to the minors in the audience! You name it! Whether it'd be Will Smith, Robert De Niro, Jack Black, Angelina Jolie, Renée Zellweger, or Martin Scorsese (despite his putrid films that seem to glorify horrific behavior). And to this day,the fish LOOKING like the celebrities they're being voiced by! And all the jokes in the film worked too, especially the in-jokes.Honestly, I've NEVER found this movie to be a ""rip-off"" of ""Finding Nemo"" - I like any film about the ocean, as long as they're done RIGHT & tell a good story. And I think that's what this movie does; movies like this strike a chord within all of us! I do think it's a relatable film, even though all the main characters are fish. lol. Both grownups and kids can both equally enjoy this - it's a great feel-good movie, with decent animation, with even some good lessons in it, especially about honesty & family.And the soundtrack is unbelievably good, too - timeless & catchy, I've got a bunch of the songs on my iPod, not just for nostalgia sake, but because they're COOL! ""Car Wash"", ""Got To Be Real"", or ""Get It Together,"" they're all so awesome!In the end, I'm glad this film exists, and I recommend every family to own a copy of it!8/10",Shark Tale
104,Scorching,Disney - Pixar = Shark Tale,7,8 February 2005,"Since this animated movie did come from Dreamworks the same company that made Shrek than it cannot be avoided that I compare the two. This movie just didn't have the same ""enjoyment factor"" as Shrek. The humor was not as good and the characters were not as lovable.Frankly the only character that I liked in the movie was that of Oscar (will Smith). The rest were just dull considering that this was a comedy. I thought the most disappointing character was that of Jack Black. He did a great job in School of Rock and I was expecting more of the same in this one but got very little of his wisecracks and antics. Perhaps it was a miscast and another actor could have been drafted in.I also felt that some of the characters were given less than desirable amount of screen time. I guess this was an effect if studios loading their cast with many star names with an eye to using this as marketing tool to sell the movie. I definitely would rather have had less stars but it would have meant more screen time for the main characters.In terms of the animation, I'm not really as astonished with the quality of the animation. Yes perhaps it may have the same quality as previous films like Shrek or Finding Nemo but given that almost everyone is using this technique it now looks all so ordinary. If this movie were done a few years /months ago then I would definitely be raving about the animation.",Shark Tale
105,alsation72,Idiotic attempt to cash in on 'Finding Nemo',1,9 July 2011,"Finding Nemo was a fable that occurred in the natural world. It was endearing and eminently entertaining. This idiotic abomination is set in an underwater world where electric billboards and telephones and nightclubs just defy logic.One of the main plot devices occurs with a great white shark which is killed by a falling anchor while hunting a tiny reef-dwelling fish. In nature such a large shark would barely notice such a tiny creature let alone try to eat it.Sharks in this film are a mafia-like organization, and the brother of the slain shark is a sensitive vegetarian type. Their father was played by Robert De Niro ... what on earth was he thinking? So the tiny fish that was being chased by the shark becomes known as a shark-slayer and reaches hero status in the reef. He even becomes the face of Coca-Cola (no, really) but eventually comes clean to be with the one he loves and to lead a more humble life ... running a whale-washing business (no, really).Don't even bother with this weak, shallow little effort.

The rest is garbage. The animation and the character design is AWFUL. Some other characters are pretty annoying. Oscar (the protagonist) is one of the most disgusting characters ever, betting the money he needs to pay, to a horse races and fooling everyone as he killed a shark, and speaking of fooling, the whole city is FOOL, because literally EVERYONE believes something that is completely impossible and with no witnesses, SERIOUSLY?! In that world nothing makes sense, how can they worship Oscar so far and even make a videogame that rapidly? Some of the jokes are ok, but most of them even get annoying or are very bad references to pop culture. The buildboards at the background are tremendously bad; like ""Coral-Cola"", which just sounds poor; or ""Fish King"" (instead of Burger King) as it was ""Human King"" in the real world, and there's even a sushi place...

107,Sweet_Ophelia,Fails to really hook you.,1,23 September 2004,"Oscar (voiced by Will Smith) is a lowly fish in a big reef. He works at the local whale-wash (car-wash on land) as tongue-washer, but dreams of bigger and better things. He's in a 5,000 clam debt to his boss, Sykes (Scorsese) and is in the mindset that 'nobody loves a nobody'; hence, he wishes to become a 'somebody'. What he doesn't realize is that his best friend, Angie (Zellweger) already loves him, just as he is. One day Oscar gets his lucky break. A shark is killed by an anchor to the head, and by being in the right place at the right time, everyone assumes Oscar was heroically responsible and dub him as the 'shark slayer' and defender of the reef. Fame, fortune and a hot little lady fish named Lola (Jolie) finally come his way... but there's a catch. The shark he has boasted about killing was the son to mob-boss, Don Lino (De Niro) and along with his vegetarian brother Lenny (Black), was going to inherit the family business. Now Lino is out for revenge. It's only with the help of Lenny that he can hope to keep up the charade. Lenny isn't your typical shark you see, he disappoints his father by rejecting meat and when his brother is killed, he runs away, hoping to neglect his position to the family business. Now Oscar has to try and keep his big lie from being exposed so that he can continue living the High Life.I didn't expect much going in to this film, and luckily this mind-set kept me from being disappointed. Obviously this movie has lost much possible luster as it is released in the shadow of the hugely-successful Pixar film 'Finding Nemo'.Comparing the two films is really pointless because really, Shark tale ain't got nothing on Nemo. But if Dream Works were going to try and compete against the ultimate in animated film, Pixar, I thought at least they'd put a little more effort into their attempt. Honestly, this is one of the worst animated films i've seen in a long time. I thought the bar had been raised over the past few years with films like 'Toy Story', 'Shrek', 'The Emperors new Groove', 'Monsters Inc' & 'Ice Age' setting new standards. Apparently not. Oscar is annoying and loses his appeal after the first ten minutes in which he's already made a dozen wise-cracks. Lenny is your typical dopey character and a pretty boring one at that; you never really care two hoots about him. The other characters are all pretty dull and forgettable. Though i must say that Angelina Jolie makes a hot fish. The story is damn ordinary and quite boring as it is propelled by a lousy script with fall-flat jokes that don't live up to the more high-brow humour designed to amuse parents as well as kids in Finding Nemo.Its all a big yawn to be perfectly honest.",Shark Tale

The children in my theater were not entertained in the slightest. The five-year-old next to me was ready to leave about 20 minutes into the movie, and there were babies crying galore from sheer boredom. Finding Nemo this is not! Next to me were also a group of preteens who squealed ""NO THEY DIDN'T!""(directed at the makers of the film I assume) at the end of the movie because the ending is so dumb. There are plenty of ""Godfather"" references that I'm sure anyone that likes comedy will have seen the jokes done before (and better). Most importantly, Will Smith is no comedian. When he sings ""Can't Touch This"" I can't help but think: no kid is going to get that reference, and the adults are going to think it's just plain stupid...isn't that song a little dated? And that's the thing - all the jokes are dated. The romance in the story falls totally flat, and not even the bright animation looks very well done.

It is fun and totally worth watching, at first I thought it would be a copy of Finding Nemo. But I was wrong. Finding Nemo is an animated comedy/drama about a dad who loses his son and goes out looking for him. Shark tale is totally different! A different plot, different characters, and a whole different meaning. Though Finding Nemo was a bit better, Shark Tale is definitely a fantastic movie.Some of the characters include Oscer, a fish who will do anything to be famous, Angie, Oscars's best friend who happens to have a major crush on him, Lola, a lying gold digger who likes Oscar only when he becomes famous, Lenny, a lovable vegetarian shark who doesn't belong with the other sharks,Sykes a blow fish who works for Don Lino, Ernie and Bernie, 2 comedic Jamaican jelly fish who love to torture Oscar, and Don Lino, Lenny's father who just wants Lenny to be a shark! A cold blooded killer, which Lenny would never be.The movie is about Oscar, a fish from the bottom of the reef who works at a whale wash and would to anything for fame and to live at the top of the reef. When one day, Lenny and his brother Frankie go out to train Lenny to be shark. When while Ernie and Bernie are torturing Oscar, they see sharks and Lenny swims over to Oscar. When he pretends to eat him, he tells Oscar to swim away, when he doesn't, Frankie gets mad and goes after Oscar and gets killed by an anchor. When Ernie and Bernie see Oscar on top of the great white, they ask him if he killed that shark, Oscar said yes and became known as the 'shark slayer' and gets famous. He also gets Lola. But then he teams up with Lenny to hide from the sharks that are after Oscar for killing Frankie while trying to hide Lenny from the sharks looking for him to come home.

The all star cast really helps it out too. I still enjoy this movie and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys animated movies. It's about Oscar the fish (Will Smith) who works at the Whale Wash is tired of living like a commoner and dreams about the lifestyle of the rich and famous. He works for a puffer fish named Sykes (sp?) whose business is controlled by the Shark mafia headed by Don Lino (obviously Robert Di Niro). Oscar owes Sykes a lot of money and is given one last chance to get it back for him. He tries to do so and fails and is about to be killed by the mafia's jellyfish henchman (Ziggy Marley and Doug E. Doug) and Don Lino's ""vegetarian"" son Lenny (Jack Black) and his brother who is trying to teach him how to be a killer. The brother is killed by an anchor dropping on him and a distraught Lenny flees. The jellyfish return to find Oscar standing over the body and think that he killed him. Oscar decides to go along with this story and is instantly famous for being the Shark Slayer. He ends up befriending and teaming up with Lenny in an attempt to keep up this appearance. This movie has some hilarious scenes and some really funny and sneaky references to other movies and things.

The Incredibles, yet this is one film I had avoided, purely due to the poor reviews it had received. A poor mans Finding Nemo was the criticism levelled at it mostly, so after just viewing it what a pleasant surprise it turned out to be!De Niro is superb as the mafioso Shark, as is Scourcese, who proves to be quite a good comic character actor. The animation is superb with an entire underwater New York-esquire city created with vehicles, taxi's, skyscrapers and shops beautifully recreated. There are plenty of gags with nods to such films as Jaws, The Godfather and Analyse This, and the film never loses pace throughout it's enjoyable 90 minutes.My only slight criticism would be that Will Smiths character is basically him as a fish, all wise ass, shades,sneakers etc but I supposed this could be levelled at De Niro, but really this really doesn't detract from an enjoyable movie.",Shark Tale

I think they even came at the same time in the theaters in my country. One was AntZ, the other was A Bug's Life. The first one was rumoured to be more suited to adults, the other a kiddie movie. While that statement had some merit, at the end it turned out that A Bug's Life was a far better movie entertainment-wise, despite cuter characters and simpler story and all that kiddie-like appearance. AntZ were just plain dull.Pixar seems to like choosing a simple story, one that a kid can understand, and than building upon it creating a wonderful movie for all ages. Dreamworks builds his scripts on pop-culture references and more adult themes, and while it works sometimes (Shrek was fantastic), at other times it just falls flat.Some say it's unfair to compare Finding Nemo and Shark Tale, them being totally different movies with the only matching characteristic being antropomorphic fish, but it seems that the comparison is inevitable. It's the ants thing all over again. Finding Nemo was simply wonderful, great movie with a perfect sense of humour and memorable characters. Sure, they were cute and cuddly, but they had a soul.Shark Tale, again, tries to appeal to the adults, but this time the results are even worse. The characters are not so important as the cast is, even so much that we are being sledgehammered on the head in who's playing who. A word to the wise - I don't care how big the names doing the voicework are, I want to immerse in the movie's story. When I saw Shrek, I didn't see Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy there, I saw Shrek and Donkey. Here I see De Niro, Smith, Scorsese and so on. At one point I even caught myself wondering why the other fish keep calling Will Smith ""Oscar"".As for the story, it kind of drags along. I couldn't really sympathize with the lead character - he is at the same time stupid and so full of himself that I didn't care about his motivations or the messes he got himself into. Also, somehow the story didn't map so well in the underwater world. What is the Shark mafia exactly ? Are they supposed to be predators or criminals? Basically the mafia thing is here only to serve as a playground for mob-movie references, but it serves no purpose story-wise. Also, the entire world seems very unbelievable. Flahing electrical neon signs? Fire hydrants? It actually backfires, since instead of getting a kick out of fishes living like humans, mostly you feel like you're watching an alien movie, with the aliens resembling our world's fishes in some ways.All in all, I did enjoy the movie, but only in the sense that I didn't feel cheated out of my money. A couple of the jokes worked, some pop-culture references were funny, the movie was not too boring. But when I remember that after Nemo or Incredibles I was smiling even a few hours after the movie, then I see that Shark Tale ain't what it possibly could be. It's just a popcorn movie, easily forgettable. And rightfully so.",Shark Tale
114,RoamingTigress,Good fun,8,2 June 2010,"I watched Shark Tale on a rainy day, wanting to catch up on some Dreamworks movies that I haven't seen before but not giving it too high of an expectation. I have to say, though, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. Yes, it had it's flaws; I didn't care much for a lot of the music, but it still gave me something to smile and laugh at. I thought the voice acting was great, and the animators did a pretty damn good job. The resemblance the characters have to the actors that have given them their voices was almost creepy. Would I recommend this? Yes I would! Go into it without comparing it to Finding Nemo and without having too high expectations.",Shark Tale
115,mswatsoninc,Shark Tale (2004),3,24 December 2004,"Another American Airlines flight...another movies I'd never pay to see in a theater, but, since it was available to me, I watched.I've read several of the comments on here, and although the criticisms are different, the overwhelming theme is the same...who were they making this film for? I don't consider myself slow on the uptake at all, but, this film went too quick for most of us who've sworn off cocaine since our rock star moments from the '80s. Therefore, I'm not the least bit surprised that kids were bored and/or lost interest.So, was it meant for adults? Possibly, I guess. I don't know many toddlers who could make the connection between Katie Couric and Katie Current--but, then again, I can't say as I run in too many circles where toddlers are present, so, maybe I'm sorely underestimating our wee youth in America. All that aside, it had elements of ""The Godfather,"" but was a little too hip-hop for me to truly identify with it. WAY too hip-hop, truth be told. Before I'm labeled as someone who's completely out of the loop, it's fine to have those references--but, there's such a thing as overkill. If you overkill with someone who doesn't listen to Missy ""Misdemeaner"" Elliot on a regular basis, you can't be too shocked when someone feels alienated.So, what about teens? I can't imagine they'd pick up on ""The Godfather"" references--but there again, I don't run in packs with teenagers. Also, the overall ""themes"" the movie tried to hammer home--honesty and acceptance--would seem to be a little too remedial for anyone over the age of 10.Target audience aside, there was nothing truly spectacular outside of the animation. This is sort of disappointing considering the vocal talents cast list included the likes of Robert DeNiro, Angelina Jolie, Renee Zellwegger, and Martin Scorcese. I've always thought Will Smith in the flesh was so over the top that he bordered on being a walking ""Looney Toon."" To experience him in actual animated form is a bit like dropping acid and participating in a high speed chase from the cops on a stormy night in Vegas. Scorcese's puffer fish dancing the ""cabbage patch kid"" was a little reminiscent of Barbara Billingsly speaking jive in ""Airplane!""--only not as funny. And, once again, we have a effeminate shark in ""dolphin drag"" coming out of the ""vegetarian closet"" to his mobster father shark. It doesn't tax the imagination too much to see where they were going with this, but, there again, the Island of Misfit Toys in ""Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer"" handled it with much greater sophistication...after all, no one wants a ""Charley in the Box."" Cost of plane ticket aside, I wouldn't have seen myself renting this film, and, as I said from the start, would never have paid to see it at the cinema. I guess if you find yourself on a flight across the country and it's on, provided there's not a $5 charge for headsets, you could do worse as a captive audience.",Shark Tale
116,DanielRobertRoss,Shark Fail,2,15 May 2016,"This lame comedy feels like it was written by studio executives, capitalizing on the latest trends. The pop culture references are stale and weak, I mean who was making MC Hammer jokes in 2004? Like Pixar's Cars, the whole idea makes no sense. How are there complicated electronics like video games and TVs working underwater? How do lava lamps work underwater? The endless fish puns are insufferable too (Mussel Crowe? Ha. Ha.) Most of the anthropomorphic character designs of the fish are weird and off putting. And Will Smith's fish protagonist is too thoughtless and uncaring to be sympathetic. Another problem is the tired ""Go to the big city story"". How many times have we seen this played out trope which has a bumbling but likable hero who has big plans and dreams of going to the big city, or moving up in the world. Flick from Pixar's A Bug's Life wanted to go to bug city and be somebody, Rodney from 2005's Robots wanted to go to Robot City and be an inventor. And here we have Will Smith fish, who wants to be a somebody. The actual dialogue is ""I'm a small fish in a big ocean"". How lazy can you get?The positives? Some of the music is cool, the animation is OK, and I liked Martin Scorsese as a puffer fish, he actually makes this tolerable to sit through.

117,cobbler88,"Decent production, but hard to identify with",4,10 December 2004,"First, I can see why people may feel the need to criticize the story of this movie. After all, it's been done a few thousand times. Keeping in mind that a young child has probably only seen the story played out a few dozen times, though, I can let that slide.What I would inform parents about, however, is that this roughly seems to be a hip-hop culture flick as much as a children's flick. The musical turns are to that culture, as are most pop culture references. A number of children in the theatre when I attended did not seem interested in the characters. My guess is that they couldn't identify with the characters, or understand some of their behaviours, because they don't share the cultural experiences. While I support diversity in a film's characters, it really only works when children can empathize with the bulk of the characters.And is it necessary to put images of seemingly stoned rastafarians in a children's movie? It seems to me that, as is the case with many Disney and other animated efforts in the past 70 years, only supports racial stereotypes.Overall, though, the story is simple and may have a valuable lesson for the child who is actually able to stay with the film to the end. There are just too many obstacles to arriving at the end, regardless of how visually appealing the film may be. Take care.",Shark Tale

It has been the source of many a laughable joke and it has been shunned. But the question remains. Is it indeed deserving of mockery? Many should think not. I am one of them, because I saw that this film had its funny points and its dramatics without appearing too vapid. The story is that of two characters, a fish named Oscar with hopes of wealth and glory, and a reluctant-to-attack shark named Lenny who is somewhat different, in an unexpected way from other sharks. When, by chance, the two meet one another, a rather large and unpleasant mix- up occurs, with Lenny's father believing that Oscar has killed his son, because the little fish was seen near the death site of his son.

119,pifas,Comparisons are not fair,6,16 February 2005,"I've seen in a lot of comments on Shark's tale that many reviewers says Pixar's Nemo this, and Dreamworks' Shrek that. Well, I think that comparisons are not fair. This film has pretty much edge (maybe not as much as any of those), but overall I believe it stands on it's own for all the elements and details it contains. I didn't think once on Finding Nemo watching this because the story, besides being underwater, it's solid enough to capture your attention, and it has to do also with the great cast in voices and the terrific job they've done. The only thing I agree with is that Dreamworks' tends to be more adult oriented in it's jokes, and despite I prefer Pixar in many entries, it's because of that (it's humor) that I enjoyed this one a lot, adding the scenarios, the metaphors they use, it's satire on mobsters, the well rounded characters despite their motivations (and I also loved the strong resemblances with the ones whom put the voices on, at least De Niro, Scorsese and Smith, which I consider it gave an extra in defining the character), and all the references in pop culture that whale with the ""wash me"" written on it was superb, and so it was Ernie and Bernie playing that Oscar's game on Playstation.I'm not exactly new in animation, so I'd like to think of myself as someone who can recognize whether if a movie is good or not, so when I rented this one didn't expect much based on all the things I've read, but I'm glad to see that I was way wrong. One could argue that it may be due to my low expectations, but I don't think so. I liked the story, the animation, the gags, the characters, and so on. I know it's not a masterpiece, but I chuckled hard with the little details thrown every now and then, and did it harder with the humor displayed by Lino, Lenny, Oscar, Ernie and Bernie. I rented Shark tale to see if it was worthwhile, but now I must have it.",Shark Tale
120,axeman-9,"And this is aimed at who, exactly?",6,1 November 2004,"I wanted to like this movie, I really did. Bob DeNiro can do very little wrong, and the rest of the cast are pretty special too. Will Smith can get up my nose a bit, but generally I don't have a problem with him. Yet this movie failed to win me over like Finding Nemo and it's less than stellar cast managed to do, and I could only give it a score of 6.0 in the end.Part of the problem lies in the execution of the thing, the characters are often so anthropomorphised that they cease to look anything like fish and look more like mutants. The Will Smith character in particular didn't know what to be, looking like a very bizarre cross between a black rapper and a thing with long fins. Freaky. The whole use of technology, city streets, TV etc semed to be laid on a bit hick too, it just didn't sit right or make any sense at any level.Who is this movie aimed at, I wonder? If it's kids, will they get all the gangster movie references? The actors, names and settings will all be familiar to adults who've seen plenty of that genre, but children? One of the main plot threads involves a vegetarian shark being an outcast, with the whole thing used as an analogy for gay son - tough father reconciliation. Gay gangster sharks for kiddies? Nah.

The story is boring, the characters are not sympathetic, and the whole movie seems to lack heart. The lead character, ""Oscar"", is one of the least appealing cartoon characters I have ever seen. He is a liar and a cheat. He is also lazy, selfish and a slacker (just the kind of role model kids need). There are a couple of funny spots in the film. For example. some of the action takes place on the wreck of the Titanic and in one scene a character is thrown against the wall. He lands on top of a picture which is the famous drawing of ""Rose"" from ""Titanic"". Unfortunately there are not enough funny spots to make up for the long unfunny segments.

With the exception of Renee Zellweger, characters in Shark's Tale are stereotypes. Will Smith is the streetwise but lovable hustler that is destined to find his inner depth; De Niro is the Don, Jack Black his the annoying prodigal son, and Scorsese as the spineless tough guy. In short, there's nothing new. Zellweger is the only fish for whom we ever feel sympathy. Shark's Tale is by no means a failure, especially if you look at box office receipts.

My children and I enjoyed the film very much. Shark tales also brings into light the good positive message that children must learn.

Really, it could have been produced with humans on dry land and it would have been the same. The fact that they were aquatic beings gave nothing to the film because every character was made to appear and move as much like a human as possible. So what's the point?

It didn't look good to me, and that made me care about the characters less.The second thing was the story line, which ran about as deep as a puddle. The humor was too juvenile for me to find humor in, and the more adult side of the story, the ""mob"" story, has been played out too many times for me in too many stories to peak my interest.If I were 20-25 years younger, I'm sure I would have enjoyed it a lot more.

131,OHHLA,It had all the right ingredients...,4,28 August 2005,"Start with DreamWorks. You all know them as the new kings of movie animation, the crew who brought you Shrek and Shrek 2. Add in a heaping helping of all-star vocal talent from Will Smith to Jack Black, from Renee Zellweger to Angelina Jolie. Sprinkle in what should be an obvious ""rags to riches"" tale about a poor fish named Oscar who makes good, only to find out the good life isn't what it's cracked up to be. With all those ingredients the end result should be a tasty morsel of a movie, but the only thing these sharks take a bite out of is your wallet. What's really surprising about this film is that with the previous deft hand the DW crew showed at appealing to both kids and adults by mixing slapstick and action with romance and subtle (and occasionally naughty) jokes, this time they manage to not hit any of the marks. Sure this film is ""cute"" but unless you are taking very young children to the theatre, cute alone isn't enough to shell out $10 for let alone cut it as a rental or a take-home purchase. Cute is quickly replaced by vapid. The over-the-top stereotypes quickly become offensive, from rastafarian jellyfish who talk jive to Italian mobster sharks complete with a ""don"" voiced by Robert DeNiro (and he should be ashamed of this role). The storyline hints at a desire to delve deeper into issues of class and disenfranchisement, but Will Smith's hammy dialogue keeps you from taking him OR this movie seriously. And seriously, who decided fish should emote? They are not exactly the best choice for conveying a range of complex emotions, but those poor schelps who spent tens of thousands of man hours at computers animating this dreck tried anyway. In fact they even tacked on a pointless short for the home release where all the fish and sharks ""get jiggy"" in the film's car/whale wash, turning into a nightclub for the evening. What this movie proved to me is that even when you follow a perfect recipe, you can make a mediocre product. Repeat viewings are not necessary, and you may even feel once is too much by the end. Save for the sparks of life Jack Black gave this movie as a misunderstood shark who wants to eat plants instead of animals there's almost nothing memorable about ""Shark Tale""; that is to say there's nothing memorable in a GOOD way.

This happens when in an accident a shark is killed and Oscar claims he killed it. Soon he has fame, fortune, and a girlfriend (Angelina Jolie) much to the objection of Angie (Renee Zellweger) who secretly has a crush on Oscar. He has a manager (Martin Scorsese) and has moved onto bigger and better things. When he runs into the shark's brother that he killed (Jack Black) they strike a friendship and Oscar tells him what really happened. The father Don Lino (Robert De Niro) still believes Oscar killed his son and sets out to find him. Things become more complicated when Angie finds out the truth.The Good News: The beginning starts out really promising with a look at life in the ocean. The music is really upbeat and modern all the way through. The animation is outstanding and spectacular. When Skye puffs up and squeaks in his little voice it is hilarious and you couldn't find another voice actor to do it better. Besides Will Smith the all star voice cast is all around great and superb. The characters are all well drawn out and you like them. My favorite character had to be Lenny by a mile. The story was pretty original and entertaining. The direction is good and nothing life changing. The sit down scene is a major standout and everything following that leading into the ending is action packed with some new ideas. The character interactions are all nice and they move like real people with fins. It was nice to see some everyday things parodied like the sign advertising Coral Cola (Coke a Cola) and ""O"" Mints (Thin Mints of Tic Tacs). The Bad News: Will Smith's voice for Oscar doesn't really fit the character and is really a major distraction. Some of the characters could have been thrown out for their uselessness. The jokes are pretty bad and only a couple of them work which is major foul on the film and maybe it's just my VHS player or video, but there is a large amount of grain. The secondary characters here to provide most of the jokes are downright unlikeable. This film also contains the overly clichéd montage when the main character is feeling down or sad and then the problem is solved which follows into another montage.Conclusion: Doesn't deserve all its hype, but provides decent entertainment. If you happen to stumble across it on T.V. or at the video store go ahead and watch it if there is nothing else, but I wouldn't recommend buying it.

I am very disappointed in them for wasting their time on this joke.The story is simple and easy to write and you know why? Because the fish are just like humans. They have trash cans, modern houses and TVs, playstations, electricity etc underwater!! I think they really over-exaggerated here. Finding Nemo was great not only because of the story, but it was very realistic with everything; colour, animation etc. This world the fish live in is as though it was fish in this world instead of humans and that they knew how to fly. Colour was good, but much too colourful for me. They rip off dialogue, music and other stuff from great films like The Godfather, Jaws, Apocalypse Now etc. There are a few funny moments, but overall the humour is lame and totally unsuccessful as to being hilarious.Also, this film is a bit too inappropriate for kids. Sure, maybe some crude humour here and there, but rude dialogue and a sexy fish (if you saw this you will know what I mean) and the ridiculous idea of a shark that says he is a vegetarian?

I mean, the plot was pretty good, and it teaches an important lesson: lying brings nothing but trouble. This is a kids' movie, they wouldn't just go out screaming 'homosexuality is good!"". Are you trying to stereotype against vegetarians of something? Cause that's what it sounds like to me! I am putting this post up because I liked the movie and I don't like hearing all this hating! You just have to search for flaws, don't you? If a movie's good, it's good, and if it's bad, it's terrible, but you just have to find every single fault. I just don't get how you can hate a good movie like Shark Tale but love bad movies. Whatever, you're lost. X-(",Shark Tale
143,duke33,Complete garbage...,2,28 October 2004,"Wow...what a waste of time this movie was. All the celebrities that contributed voice-over work can't seem to save this movie laden with bad animation and a so-so plot.The animation was really sub-par in my opinion. Maybe i've been spoiled by Pixar movies and Shrek, but it was just lousy. And, what was the deal with having to have the fish have Will Smith's head on it? Were they afraid that the general public was too stupid to recognize his voice, so they had to super-impose his face on the fish? Whatever it was, it just looked awkward.And, the product placement in this movie was really shameful. Can Will Smith ever do a movie that isn't one giant commercial? Sure, instead of Coca-Cola it was Coral-Cola, and instead of Krispy Kreme, it was Kelpy Kremes, but you get the idea. It seems like they sold all the advertising first, and then decided to write the rest of the script around it, you know?Overall - 2/10",Shark Tale
144,solebanana,Didn't hold my attention,6,30 October 2004,"Animated sea tale, with obvious comparisons with Finding Nemo. Shouldn't be any reason for it not to work, but in spite of some nice moments, increasingly as it went on I found myself checking my watch instead of watching it, and some of it was too embarrassing to watch.It's hard to put my finger on what the problem was, as it isn't obvious. The characters are a bit, erm, two dimensional, and Will Smith's Oscar is too foolish to be likable. It does look far too similar in terms of setting and some of the plot to Finding Nemo, as if there was a jumping on the bandwagon for lack of any better ideas. The ending, while it has Disney-type morality in it, is really too trite for anyone over five to be inspired by.You'll be entertained by this in places, though not consistently, but in the end it won't amount to very much. It doesn't have the flair, consistent humour and magic that say Emperor's New Groove had. It's more like Disney on an off day.... still cranking out the same formula, but not entirely convincingly.",Shark Tale
145,buzzpark,AN OVERT SOCIAL AGENDA MAKES THIS SHARK'S TALE SMELL FISHY,5,3 October 2004,"Excellent animation. Great cast. Fun music. Engaging story. However, the overt purpose of this film appears to tell children that they MUST accept homosexuality as normal, and in this movie, even desirable. There are many great movies with the good moral of accepting others who are different. This tale crosses the line by a specifically effeminate character who wears ""different"" clothes, hangs out with ""different"" friends, and is repulsed by that which is normal to the other sharks. Of course there is no direct mention of sexual preference in the movie. The 'victim' is a vegetarian shark. But don't be fooled by the analogy; the very precise use of gay stereotypes in the Lenny character leads me to believe this movie has a very specific pro-gay acceptance moral. The characters who don't accept Lenny for ""who he is"" are vilified as unintelligent, ferocious looking, but cowardly bigots. This reads agenda with a capital A. For those readers who are now seething in hatred towards me, don't misunderstand: I ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD NEVER TREAT ANYONE ELSE WITH HATRED OR LACK OF HUMAN DIGNITY, NO MATTER WHETHER OR NOT WE AGREE WITH THEIR BEHAVIOR OR SOCIAL ""PREFERENCES"". But I refuse to let Hollywood force me to tell my children what is acceptable social/moral behavior and what is not. For those of us who believe that sexual behavior is a choice and that not all ""morals"" or ""preferences"" are equally good for our children and society, this shark's tale smells too much like spoiled tuna.",Shark Tale

148,jesussaysohyeahtokungfu,Good Family movie,7,16 February 2006,"After the amount of criticism this movie received by critics/film fans alike I was pretty reluctant to sit down and watch this movie which is pretty unlike me seeing as I generally don't go on other peoples opinion. However I'm glad I stuck to my guns as this film really took me on a ride of laughs and emotions.To start with looking at a cast which includes Will Smith, Robert De Nero and Jack Black you would have to be a really bad scriptwriter to make these guys mess up. The animation is superb and the hidden story lines/jokes make a truly intriguing story.This film cant be compared to Finding Nemo due to the fact the films are totally different aside from the fact they are both underwater (it has more in common with spongebob than it does Nemo!) A sign of a good movie is when time flies and the film is in the closing credits before you know it, and thats what this film delivered to me, i felt good at the end of it and I would without a doubt watch it again.'Oscar' is a character a lot of people may relate to, he is in a dead end job, wants to be a character and make people laugh and dreams of living in a far off land getting everything he wants, the film takes us on the ride of what it is like to get it all, and shows its not all we imagine it to be, the rich can be upset to, and again be dreamers, this time of the life they had left behind.Totally worthy of a 'worth see' movie.",Shark Tale
149,wxid,"Mildly amusing, but no bite.",6,21 September 2004,"Shark Tale is doubtlessly going to be endlessly compared to Pixar's ""Finding Nemo"". It is unfortunate that Shark Tale comes out the lesser of the two movies, but truly comparing the two is generally a fruitless exercise.Opening with a detailed dive into the city of the fish Shark Tale presents a world of sight gags and moderate puns. From the star fish walk of fame through the dolphin police, through to the shots of ""the top of the reef"", the sequence is a bustling hive of activity. At this point I would make one valid comparison with Nemo - the graphics. Shark Tale fails to really seem as if anything is happening underwater. Yes, there are fish in the shot and yes everything intellectually should be under the sea, but where Nemo oozed and flowed in a very fluid vista Shark Tale shows colour and spectacle, but without that organic ocean feeling. This is not to say Shark Tale's graphic work is bad, simply that it does not feel waterborne.With that aside, the cartoon images in Shark Tale are well presented, with the anthropomorphic fish taking on the facial characteristics of their voice actors. Never has (or will) a fish ever look more like Wil Smith , or acted like him. This is Wil Smith in full Fresh Prince wise-cracking mode made piscine in Oscar. Renee Zellwegger is instantly recognisable in her fish counterpart Angie, as is the vampy Angela Jolie (Lola).The story itself revolves around Oscar's passage from an unhappy, dreaming, nobody to a famous, unhappy, somebody to a happy nobody. It's a generic, oft-repeated tale, albeit set in a world full of mafioso sharks, vengeful shrimp, and whales with poor personal hygiene.As such, the story itself is both predictable and can be safely ignored. You can feel each step of the way long before it hits the screen. It has no surprises, and so the movie resorts to banter and set pieces to amuse.It doesn't often succeed with these. Of the set pieces the shark funeral is by far the best part of the movie. It is hilarious and somehow moving at the same time. Lenny (Jack Black) and Don Lino (Robert De Niro) make an amusing scene in a restaurant debating with the food. The remainder, including Oscar's big fight scene, are generally uninvolving unless you have an interest in keeping an ear and eye out for the multitude of pop references - many of which are simply thrown in for no reason other than that somebody thought they should be there. Oscar's non sequiturs at the end of the great shark fight are particularly pointless and unfunny.Some in jokes and references do work - having Ziggy Marley solemnly tell Oscar (Smith) that he's singing reggae wrong is clever. Some gags also work - the pizza ordering Octopus is a gem.But despite playing heavily on racial stereotypes the movie as a whole feels rather bland - as if it was designed by marketers and a committee rather than by people who had a funny tale they wanted to tell.The actors supplying the voices vary in effectiveness. Wil Smith is effectively Wil Smith, love it or hate it. Zellwegger gives a decent, if shallow, performance as the love interest, and Jolie's Lola is barely on screen long enough for her to make an impact. De Niro makes the movie as Don Lino, shark godfather, and without his presence it would be fair to say that the movie would simply be too weak to sustain interest.The music is very MTV, and the end song sequence is atrocious - though kids will probably love it, parents should bring ear plugs for the time when Oscar releases ""Missy and Christina"" until you leave the cinema.Shark Tale offers an amusing hour and a half for the children but a rather predictable and only occasionally amusing time for adults. It lacks the magic, sparkle, and dare I say bite, that was so desperately needed.Six starfish out of a possible 10.",Shark Tale

I did think that it was better than Finding Nemo.It has a much better story-line and I did laugh out loud at some of the things.

Perhaps they thought it would be fun, but it AIN'T, guys. Will Smith is totally unfunny, as usual, and is as amusing as a cheesegrater rubbing on a bunion. Smart alec remarks that are stale, and all the sparkling wit of a mouldy cabbage. Really third rate and poor.

Robert Deniro, Renee Zellweger, Angelina Jolie, Will Smith, Martin Scorsese ... those people are top notch, but in this movie, they are exchangeable and not what they bring to their characters in non animated movies. Without them this movie would be yet another fun movie, but with a cast like that you could expect more: This is ""just"" one of those Hollywood movies, an underdog story with a uber-super-duper-happy ending. been there, seen that about a million times.But on the other hand, its just too fun to rate below 7. The jokes and sidekicks work from the beginning, you laugh about the ideas these crazy Dreamworks guys came up with, but you did so in all the other animation flicks, too.

160,pearl_girl79,Fantastic! Hilarious!,8,28 February 2005,"I think this movie is very underrated! Its one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. I liked it as much as Finding Nemo (there were few similarities) and it was certainly better than that horrible The Incredibles.This movie has so many hilarious lines, and so many great characters. Unlike Nemo, which had several annoying characters (Crush, the sea turtle), SHARK TALE has no annoying characters. Its actually not easy to pick a favorite. (Although I like Ernie and Bernie best) I thought that my parents wouldn't like the movie because it has a lot of street slang, but they actually really enjoyed it. There are several good lessons in the movie; 1) You shouldn't lie 2) You should appreciate what you DO have, and 3) You should accept your loved ones no matter what makes them different and weird (for example, being a vegetarian shark).I don't like to see comparisons to Finding Nemo, but everyone seems to do it. Finding Nemo is more innocent...there's no hemorrhoid or fart jokes. It takes place in a reef that LOOKS like a reef, and the fish look more like fish. SHark Tale on the other hand, takes place in a reef that looks like New Yorks Times Square, and there are shops with fish related names. Its a big city really. The only similarity is the fact that Lenny is a vegetarian and the sharks from Finding Nemo are attempting to give up eating fish.....because sharks have a bad name.Its absolutely hilarious.....a definite recommendation!",Shark Tale
161,Mathewdixon42,"PIxar's idea, with Dreamworks Humor!",6,6 July 2016,"Shark Tale was released in 2004, to mixed reviews and financial success. Now while many have brought up the fact that Dreamworks released this only a year after Finding Nemo came out. Does that mean it's a shameless ripoff? Eh, not really. Does that mean it's good? Eh, it's alright. The animation is good, but not as good as it could have been for the time it was made. Dreamworks released Shrek 2 that same year with far better animation to showcase. So it's not like they we're limited by the technology they had available. The character designs are a little off-putting at times. The concept to anthropomorphize the fish characters was an odd one, especially since they didn't do it to all of them. Some of them look just like the real fish counterparts, while others are designed to look like the actors portraying them. This is inconsistent and for the most part kinda creepy looking. At least the shark didn't look like Jack Black, shark were scary enough beforehand. The story line is very standard for a buddy comedy film, not much else to say about it. It's not unique, it's not that bad. As with every comedy film, it should be judged on the quality of it's humor. This film is actually pretty funny. Although it is filled with references that kids won't understand for the most part. Have your kids seen the Godfather or Titanic? No? Okay well they probably won't understand this movie's humor very well. Are you an adult watching this with your kid? Or alone? In which case you'll probably laugh. Crazy Joe was funny! Watch it and find out. ""You're blowin' it man!"" -Crazy Joe. The acting is actually not that bad. Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro are particularly good in their roles. Will Smith is not suited for animated roles, most of his cool charisma comes from being on screen. Anjelina Jolie and Jack Black are alright, but both would eventually do better work for Dreamworks in the Kung-Fu Panda films. Overall this film is too adult oriented for children. Although it has enough clever humor to be appealing to those of us who saw it as kids and revisit it now. Although there is a great deal of humor involving knowledge of gangster films such as the Godfather, those unfamiliar with these film may not find this intriguing at all. De Niro and Scorsese are fantastic in their roles, both being walking talking references to their own classic gangster films. Shark Tale is not on the same level as Finding Nemo by a long shot, but it makes for enjoyable viewing for the kids at heart.",Shark Tale

Usually you'll get the Flintstones kind of logic to explain cars, etc. I can understand if they make references to movies by slipping it in dialog a la Shrek. . But it is basically understood in the film that they actually watched the movies they are quoting. That's just lame. Why are they singing 'Car Wash' at the end of the movie? Oscar worked in a Whale Wash. But even forgetting that they don't even bother to be creative the story is just tedious. This is just some a scam film they can lure you in with the pedigree of big name stars doing the voices and the studio's past success with the Shrek franchise.

173,kewlmatto,Many spoofs does not a funny film make...,4,19 September 2004,"After seeing Shark Tale today, I am quite lukewarm about the movie as a whole. Being a big fan of the Pixar films, and, to a slightly lesser extent, the Dreamworks PDI films, I was quite eager to enjoy this new film (and went in without looking to compare it to Nemo). However what I found was that Dreamworks have taken their intertextuality license and worked it for all it's worth (and then some).The story is quite unremarkable, and the worst element is the main character - Oscar, who is incredibly annoying. The character is far too willing to wise-crack every second of the film, obviously because Dreamworks is desperately afraid that the audience may get bored. This has a very adverse affect however, and it is very easy to grow tired of what would otherwise be a ""sidekick"" character who will.not.shut.up. Empathy is hard to muster with a character like this, and does not compare to a character like Shrek, Woody, Z or Flik. Even Mike from Monsters, Inc. knew when to be silent and let the story carry itself. Other characters are really just filler, and are either boring (Angie) or unnecessary (Lola).A lot has been said about the racial stereotypes within this film, and although they are all in good fun, they do tend to grate. The sharks are an exception however, and really do steal the show whenever they are present. In fact, it's the references to Goodfellas, Jaws, the Godfather and other mobster movies which are the only ones which actually do generate some laughs. The rest of the film spoofs/nods really seem to be tossed into the sea hap-hazardly, or ""for the sake of it"". Many moviegoers may get some kind of kick out of hearing a fish say ""You had me at hello"", but I for one think there is a clear difference between using other films to be truly witty and clever (think Nemo's nods to Psycho, The Birds and Fight Club) and throwing in movie quotes for cheap laughs, which is what we see here.Other gags often fall flat due to being either too cliché, or not really relevant or humorous within the context: ""Don't worry, a lot of white fish can't do it.""Don't get me wrong, Shark Tale is not all bad. There are some redeeming qualities in the film. As I said, the sharks, particularly Don Lino and the ""extended family"" are really enjoyable, as is much of the animation (particularly when we really get to see the reef city). The film opens really well, with a number of great sight gags - which really set up the world nicely. It's just a shame that the characters and the story were not as well-rounded and formed enough to make use of this world. Even Lenny is not as enjoyable as he could be, until towards the end of the film.We have definitely been spoiled with the quality of previous computer-animated films, and a lot of love and attention has gone into their construction. This is obviously a back-burner project that falls behind Dreamwork's most important franchise, Shrek, and it is obvious that it hasn't received this care. It definitely is worth a watch, but high hopes may leave viewers disappointed, like me. Truly an example of how a cinematic format is only as good as its story and characters. Companies cannot ride the ""3D success wave"" forever...",Shark Tale
174,babiedol12,The Godfather Underwater,7,19 December 2004,"Forget about comparing Shark Tale to the monster hit Finding Nemo.Instead, try to enjoy a new film that puts to good use the voices of Will Smith, Jack Black, Angelina Jolie, Robert De Niro, Martin Scorsese, and especially Renee Zellweger, who exudes a sweetish charm without over doing it.Oscar (Smith) is a tiny but highly animated fish with large dreams. He wants to be at the top of the reef with a luxurious life. But while his dreams keep growing, he continues working as a tongue-cleaner at the local Whale Wash.Angel (Zellweger), secretly in love with him, is frustrated that she can't make him realize that he has a decent job and she loves him dearly.When Oscar falsely takes credit for the accidental death of a shark called Frankie, and becomes an instant hero known as Oscar the shark-slayer, he doesn't realize what lethal complications will ensue. For he has attracted the attention of a self-centered Puffer-fish, Sykes (Scorsese) and a sexy vamp, Lola (Jolie). Sykes knows people in the underwater mob; you can expect what is going to come.De Niro plays Don Lino the shark, preparing his sons, Frankie (Michael Imperioli) and Lenny (Black) to take over the family business. Frankie was believed to be the perfect heir to the mob world. Brother Lenny, does not really relish the competitive world, a closet vegetarian who likes to dress up as a dolphin.When news of Frankie's demise reaches Don Lino, he also gets to hear Oscar's claims that have made him a hero. Meanwhile, Lenny is more than upset that his brother is killed. He is afraid that his father would expect too much from him now, and runs off with Oscar, pretending to be a dolphin.Overall: 6.5/10",Shark Tale

Toy Story is simply the best film I have ever seem for children and I've watched it nearly 100 times! (With my son).Others like Nemo, Monsters and other films such as Shrek, Tarzan etc had a quality story if the animation or CGI was not the very best.Shark Tale had quite good CGI but that was all. The characters were so dull my son asked me to switch off after 20 minutes!. I later watched the whole movie on my own and I have to say it was the worst movie for kids I have seem in a long time. So was it made for kids or teens/adults?. I think the key problems were - 1) Everything. If I could score below 1/10 I would have.",Shark Tale
176,clumzy,The Fresh Fish of Bel Water,4,18 February 2005,"A poor urban guy by a series of chance occurrences becomes rich and famous, only to face an identity crisis which brings him back to his urban roots. Throw in a love interest, a few homie punchlines and Will Smith and you essentially have an episode of the wildly successful Fresh Prince of Bel Air TV Show. But this is no TV show, you just paid to watch Dreamwork's take on Disney's Finding Nemo. The comparisons will undoubtedly arise between these two underwater computer animated movies, and it's safe to say that Nemo blows this Shark out of the water.Let me get straight to the gripes. The cool factor of being underwater is that the dynamics of underwater locomotion. Let's face it, even Ian Thorpe isn't all that graceful with his splashing around in the water compared to a fish. And this is the source of my first gripe, these ""fish"" tend to just FLY around with no illusion of underwater movement. They could have been airborne humans. And they have HANDS! And they build building underwater with glass, bricks, concrete, asphalt, metal, and elevators! WHY does a fish need an ELEVATOR?? It's supposed to be a coral reef! And the Whale Wash uses suds and jets of water! That just doesn't make any sense.OK logical gaps are usually explained away as ""suspension of belief"" so let's look past that and get to the characters. I find it an odd choice that when depicting fish, that they look more like humans and less like fish. They have arms and legs that are supposed to be fins. And their faces! Really that fish's face looks exactly like Will Smith including the crazy ears. Did they do this just to get away from being too much like that other fish movie? However, I do give kudos to the sharks and the 2 reggae jellyfish guys. They look awesome.Now where this movie truly falls apart is the story. There's no reason why we should like Mr. Smith. He's a user, a poser and only at the brink of his best friend being killed does he ""take action"" ... which of course works out marvelously netting him even more fame and fortune. Honestly, this whole ""Shark Slayer"" thing was just a terrible plot device. Terrible. There's just none of the zing in this show. No magic, no charm. It just plunges through it's inane story to the end, not looking back to see if anyone really cares. This is a wrecking ball of computer animated movies.Now that's not to say that this film has no redeeming qualities. Kids would love it as my wife did. For me the movie was saved by some great supporting characters. Jack Black plays a genuinely lovable vegetarian shark in dolphin drag. Robert De Niro's mafia kingpin shark was hilarious, bringing to mind his comedy shtick from Meet the Parents. Simply great. Finally the two jellyfish guys, Doug E. Doug and Ziggy Marley, are spot on funny. Off the wall and well thought out. If only the rest of the movie could reproduce hilarity of these guys.Really this movie could have been so much better. Shame on you Dreamworks for trying to cash in on an animated underwater movie that's just like Nemo but not. All the big name voice actors in Hollywood can't save this one.

The plot was predictable, and way too ""New York"" centric. None of the characters were likable, with the exception of Angie (Renee Zellweger). None of the others had any redeeming characteristics.The Animation was OK, but not not spectacular. The settings seemed kind of bland. Final words: I paid to let my kids sleep in the theatre.

Lenny and Oscar meet when Lennys brother accidentally gets killed by an anchor and some fishes passing by think that Oscar slayed the shark, thus making him a celebrity.I was having high hopes for this movie, but I noticed that the laughs, even though they were there, were few and far between. But when they came, they're good. It started of promising when they showed fish town, but then there's a long period of virtually no good jokes. Siting in a cinema watching a comedy and hearing no one laugh for a long time was frustrating, especially as this movie has the tag ""from the people behind Shrek"" and when I saw Shrek in the cinema, people were laughing all the time.An OK movie. 6/10",Shark Tale

I liked the animation, and for that I give it 3 points. Otherwise, it was horrible. The filmmakers spent so much time showcasing all the top Hollywood actors' voices and showing us how many equivalents the Underwater Times Square has to the real Times Square that they totally forgot to create a plot! Hardly anyone in the audience laughed, because no one got any of the so-called jokes.

180,toontje-1,Shark Tale doesn't flow!,4,15 February 2005,"This movie has to much of a B-movie black exploitation musical feel to it. It would be fine by me if they didn't include all the spoof, the mafia angle and the forced ""I saw that coming ha ha"" kind of jokes in it. I think PDI wanted to incorporate so much in this movie that it became very thinly spread. The result: the story got totally diluted, which is a hard thing to do given its simple plot. The main failure of this movie is that they wanted to develop the characters more than the plot. But the problem is that the characters are very shallow, so when Oscar does his hip-hop thing for the 20th time, it just get boring, repetitious and the plot looses its drive. The visuals are OK. It is not my style. I think the color scheme is aimed at a more juvenile audience. My 2 year old son bursts in a laugh every time something purple appears on the screen. So that target audience is covered. And now for the inevitable comparison with Finding Nemo: there is no comparison other than it involves fish and water. The color scheme is different, the technology seems different too. In my opinion Finding Nemo looks more realistic (more accurate ocean and light simulation) than Shark Tale. Finding Nemo is about real fishes, Shark Tale is more symbolic. It is more like people disguised as fishes. My conclusion: if you belong to the crowd that loves flashy, 1-second-attentionspan MTV video clips, then Shark Tale is the thing for you.",Shark Tale

If you're looking for a well animated, well delivered film set underwater with some degree of character depth then perhaps 'Finding Nemo' or 'The Little Mermaid' will be more up your street. This film is slick and in some places quite amusing but it doesn't ever really engage the audience and I found myself really not bothered about any of the characters or the story. Admittedly this is for kids (and I'm 24) but I love a good cartoon/animation and to be perfectly frank this wasn't one.From the second the film was advertised I knew it was going to be a 'voice fest' - lots of famous people, playing caricatured versions of themselves for comedic effect. I sincerely hope that the good people at Dreamworks have learnt their lesson, in animated movies it's not the stars who sell, it's the story. Okay, there are probably Dreamworks fans who will jump to it's defence and draw parallels with Shrek, and yeah Shrek was loaded with stars but it also has a brilliant storyline and succeeds where this film fails.My advice for Dreamworks execs; with more plot and less stars they might have made a movie that didn't just sink into oblivion like a dead whale.

The soundtrack is unbelievable and fits in seamlessly with the action and comedy of the movie. You really have to hear Mary J.

Anyway, besides the fantastic soundtrack, every character in this movie matches beautifully with his or her celebrity voice.

186,michelgizy,The only thing I can take away from this movie is why did this one get nominated for an Academy Award?,1,12 June 2021,"Looking at this movie, it is baffling how this was nominated alongside Shrek 2, the best one in my opinion in the entire franchise, and the Incredibles. Not to mention that when this came out, The Spongebob movie existed. Yes, THIS MOVIE got nominated for Best Animated Feature, but the Spongebob movie did not. Why? I legitimately do not know.The plot is basically a mafia movie filled with pop culture references and dumb worldbuilding gags. You've got Gup, Coral Cola, and Fish King...yeah. You've also got them associated with race like with the white fish line from Oscar, and that just confuses me to no end.I don't really care for the characters, especially Oscar. He is the WORST character in the movie full of bad characters. Oscar is such a jerk that he actively proves against his earned emotional climax and all of the fame he gets. He sells off his best friend's pearl (who, we are told is his best friend from him specifically) to bet the money on a horse, and then starts bragging when Lenny's brother dies even though he should be swimming away. Literally EVERYONE believes him about slaying a shark when the shark is like twice his size, without evidence or anyone who actually saw the 'slaying.' Even though Oscar himself is not particularly likable to everyone. Will Smith is a great actor, I just wish he wasn't playing Oscar. Lenny is...okay...I just can't stand his voice, unfortunately. And the whole vegetarian thing has...much more meaning now than it did when I first watched it. Angie seemed fine for me up until she saw Oscar kiss Lola, and then I just lost all sympathy with how antagonistic she acted afterwards. Sykes is annoying, the jellyfish are a special form of agony, and the other sharks are there, I guess...Lola is kinda okay up until she betrays Oscar by suddenly being in the mafia for...reasons.The animation, holy lord! I didn't remember it being this awful when I saw it again. Why would you make realistic faces on fishes? What kind of appeal does that make, even for 2004? It's just freaky! And it's wrong! Who wants these designs? And the background characters are not only distracting, but give me nightmares.The voice acting is decent, but that's probably the biggest compliment I can give the movie. But for me, it's hard to notice when my eyeballs have to be subjected to the animation so much that I can't pay attention to it. The jokes are okay, but it didn't scream that this movie had to be made, yet it was. It's just not really dialogue-based comedy because they expect you to laugh at dumb fish puns and pop culture references and stereotypes, all of which are not funny on their own.And the ending is nonsensical. Literally every shark is okay with not eating fish (with a restaurant named Fish King that exists in their universe) again, and I cannot buy that. Not ONE shark is going to try to go against that? What killed any chance of this movie being good was that it just wanted to be Shrek, and it failed.

187,himene,"Entertaining, but cheesy.",7,25 September 2004,"Shark Tale was entertaining, but ultimately rather cheesy. The storyline is fairly simplistic about a fish named Oscar who wants to move out of the inner city and to the ""top of the reef"" without having to do anything to actually deserve it, like work. It comes out like a cross between Car Wash and the Godfather, which is basically as bizarre as it sounds.Don't get me wrong, it's full of sight gags and you'd have to watch the movie several times to determine what all those undersea versions of popular brands are (""Coral Cola,"" ""Kelpy Kreme""). Most of the dialogue is peppered with Wiseguyisms and hiphopisms that are a bit dated and unfunny. It was a bit bothersome that they bothered to use the ocean as a setting, yet made all the fish move in a completely human manner. But it was really fun seeing certain actors as fish, and the introduction of ""Sebastian the Whale Washing Dolphin"" was highly amusing. I also found Ziggy Marley telling Oscar that he was singing a reggae song poorly to be very funny. Decent enough movie, but not as good as recent DreamWorks animations.",Shark Tale

It isn't suitable for children in any way: not because of crude adult humor, but because the subject matter of loan sharks, mafia crime bosses, and MTV's Cribs would go right over their heads. Shark Tale also stereotypes black people and Italian people to the impressions of both races given from films like Friday and The Godfather. That being said, racism has never been so charming. This film has an undeniable charm that adults will enjoy, not because it's a quality film, but because it's quite the enigma. How could such a racially stereotypical film be so damn entertaining? Well, Shark Tale is one of those ""So-Bad- It's-Good"" movies. Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro had a great scene together, and I only wish we saw more of them.

It failed to keep me entertained as I soon got bored but I noticed that my younger cousins (around 12 years old and below) seemed to enjoy it -- so maybe the film was geared towards their age group, however they were too young to understand most of The Godfather jokes and speech.

191,elephant1024,Bah,5,3 November 2004,"Do not be fooled by the CG animation. Everybody thinks because a movie is animated by a computer, it's good. Thus far, most of Pixar's and Dreamworks' CG movies have had great successes in the box offices. And those movies that were smash hits, as they say, deserved to be. They were funny, entertaining, creative, novel, enjoyable, and always original. Shark Tale is grossing $147 million as I write this, but it has none of the qualities that made the previous CG movies great. Sure, it has its funny moments, but most of the humor is largely clichéd and overused. I suppose one could argue that most of the clichés are supposed to be parodies of ghetto and mafia movies. But if that was true, then the movie fails in its execution of the parody, which is merely a better way of saying the same thing.Shark Tale is in essence the mob meets the ghetto. It includes the well-overused themes of being different, wanting wealth and fame only to lose the self, lying to achieve that wealth and fame, girl loves boy but boy doesn't realize it, etc. Put it all behind some spectacular underwater animation and throw some famous names into the mix as the voices, and you have the whole movie. Best part is, you know exactly what is going to happen in the end at around 10 minutes into the movie. What irked me greatly throughout the entire movie was the inaccuracy of underwater life. Rather than a movie about fish, Shark Tale was more like a movie about humans, but hidden behind figures of fish. The setting could have been on the surface, and the characters live-action, and the movie would have been exactly the same. Well, except for a few bits of comedy here and there, the underwater setting was completely irrelevant. Now, if the characters are essentially humans, how accurate would the biological aspects of the characters be? Oscar doesn't even move like a fish. He has eyebrows and wears bling bling.But that was merely something that irked me. The story made me think I had wasted my time. I was going to put that there were spoilers here, but I don't think there's anything to spoil. After all, this isn't a deep movie in any way, and we all know what happens in the typical cliché movie about a guy who strikes it rich through a lie. We also know what happens when somebody who likes that person is introduced into the storyline. Add your typical ""different"" theme (a homosexual among the homophobic is my favorite example) sprinkled with mafia references throughout, and that's the entire story. As I mentioned above, this is supposed to be a comedy. Most people would call it an adult comedy, though there's no cursing (poopy-head, I think, was the worst it got). More accurately, it is a children's ghetto comedy. I don't have anything against black comedies per se, but to me, they're all the same, with the same overused humor, the same themes, and the same, predictable endings. This movie is exactly that. Basically, if this movie was released during any other time of the year, it would have probably done marginally better than Soul Plane, and only because it was computer animated rather than live action.There are several redeeming qualities. For example, the obscure references here and there are interesting. The comedy that actually involves fish can be funny at times. The technical aspects, including the graphics, are particularly notable. The voicing was done well. But these are nothing in terms of what makes a movie good compared to the story. After all, movies are supposed to tell a story, and if the story a movie tells is bad, then the movie can't be too much better.Keep your money for The Incredibles, and go to a bowling alley to hang out instead.",Shark Tale

I have watched it almost every week ever since it came out on DVD, and still I can't wait until the next time I watch it. I hardly EVER buy movies on DVD; usually movies for me are one-time events. But Shark Tale was just so funny and overall such a good movie.First of all, everyone seems to be saying that this is a knock-off Finding Nemo. Yes, it is an animated underwater film and just so happened to be released after Nemo. But they have completely different plot lines, and I must say that I enjoyed this FAR more than Nemo. Shark Tale also related their society to the human world- restaurants, shopping centers, newscasters, police, traffic.I would also like to point out that this is by no means a children's movie. I'm not quite an adult, but I'm in high school, and this is certainly a movie for the whole family. My little siblings (my youngest 7) love it, along with my parents (in their 40's). We all like different things about it, laugh at different parts, and relate to different themes. There's something in this movie for everybody.The animation is gorgeous and the voices are perfect. There is such a good cast in this movie, and they all seem to fit so nicely together. Will Smith is stellar for this role, Oscar's personality in the movie reminds me of Smith's role in the Fresh Prince -- the unlucky, awkward-with-girls, yet very likable kind of guy. Angelina Jolie as the seductive snob is priceless. Renee Zellweger's sweet sarcastic voice defines Angie's personality. Robert De Niro, in my opinion, seems to portray the perfect protective Italian father (Meet the Parents & Meet the Falkers). Jack Black was hilarious as Lenny.As for the plot, I'm not going to pretend it's the first time I've seen it. But you can't expect not to see reoccurring themes. The thing that set Shark Tale aside from movies similar to it is the HUMOR and CREATIVITY. Applying this plot to the ocean made this movie so funny. So many jokes are thrown in that sometimes I catch them for the first time, my thousandth time watching. Every moment has you on your toes, not always for the plot, but for the humor that you know is going to continue throughout the movie. I could watch one scene over all day, and chances are I would laugh every time.Overall, this movie is fantastic.

I remember the days when animation was all about telling/visualizing a story in animation form to provide good and wholesome holiday entertainment for the whole family. The names of the voice-over actors could be found, discreetly mentioned, in the credit rolls at the END of the movie. Gradually we saw more and more big names lending their voices to animated works usually ""in order to do something for their children"". Noble cause huh? OK, I must admit it was amusing for me as an adult to recognize a well-known movie personality acting out his or her typical roles in an animation. I was much less amused with the happenings in ""Sharktale"". We were first of all bombarded with the all the names of the big stars lending their voices to the movie. Mind you 1 whole frame for 1 big name. (Robert DeNiro, Will Smith, Jack Black, Renee Zellweger, Angelina Jolie, Martin Scorsese etc). Then to my utter astonishment I had to observe that their fishy counterparts were exact lookalikes. It was so dominant that it seemed to me that the whole movie was about THEM. Must be great not only to hear your mummy or daddy in a cartoon but see them ""animated"" as well. But I wonder seriously if this going to be a fashionable trend in Hollywood. Is it going to be a sign of true stardom to :a) have your name, feet/hands/boobs imprinted on a tile on the Walk of Fame and b) have yourself eternalized as an animated character? From a business point of view it is of course a clever gimmick to have these famous movie personalities in animated movies. Cartoons were for kids and families with kids mainly. A movie like Sharktale shall undoubtly attract a whole lot of teenagers and young adults. I feel mostly sorry for the kids though. Unknowingly children are now being ""familiarized"" with the big movie stars of today whose movies are as yet unsuitable for them. Perhaps this is a big Hollywood psychological plot to guarantee that the next generation of moviegoers will be guaranteed fans of the stars of today? In my opinion it is a sick trend!!!",Shark Tale

As; the comments and references to other movies, especially the godfather trilogy that I just saw recently. The shark voice over by de Niro WAS de Niro, his voice, his face marks, the details, they were all great. Without analysing and telling what line and expression comes from what movie, it's fun game to play with friends when you are watching. As for the star; Will Smith is funny, his ability to be fun cool and quick is an undisputed talent from the days of the Fresh Prince. The story was simple but fun, I really liked the way the parallels between a vegetarian shark and coming out of the closet. With all these pros, what is wrong with this movie? My guess is the too big an emphasis on the MTV R&B culture. In the beginning it's fun, mimicking MTV's crips, but in the end it's too obvious and it starts to annoy. For me the song in the end, too much! And please oh please don't forget the sponsors. Why oh why didn't they use the blue Coca Cola sign? sorry; Coral Coca Sign. The coffee that floats away in the see is funny, but this against the very big 10 seconds 2 times reoccurring cola sign. I know a studio has to make money but less obvious, please? In conclusion it wasn't bad and 5.8 average is quite right. The hints to other movies like (Theme song Jaws is from Spielberg, and he's owner of Dreamworks) That makes this movie fun. The weakness is that the creators watched too much MTV television, and that is bad for you! if you are above 23.",Shark Tale
199,hmpxrii,Oh my god it's full of stars!,8,13 January 2005,"""Shark Tale"" is a very entertaining movie suitable for most ages. The acting is very good and the dialog is excellent. An unusual lot of stars in the cast who seems to have had a lot of fun in their roles. Will Smith is the same as always. The movies suffers mainly from three things:* Oscar, the main character, is somewhat ugly designed, looking like a dragon fish with a Will Smith-mask pasted on. Some of the other characters are also a bit too human-like, I'm thinking about the character Lola. She is as close to sexy as a ... fish ... can get, and fish aren't supposed to be sexy.* The soundtrack contains a lot of RNB and hip-hop. While I don't like these genres very much in general, in my opinion they are especially bad as movie music and makes for a lot of the movie to feel like a stereotypical RNB music video.* What with all the chairs and seats? Fish usually don't sit and it looks very uncomfortable when they do.The setting is fun, very similar to ""Finding Nemo"", except with a lot more characters, and city-like environments, involved. ""Shark Tale"" is slightly more cartoonish and pop-ish, and with more anatomically incorrect character designs. The cinematics and animation are beautiful and imaginative.The story is a standard ""things are bad/things get good/things get worse/things get perfect/happy ending"" story, not very unpredictable but both the comic and dramatic segments work fine together.No masterpiece but definitely not a waste of time. It does not really have the kind of ""soul"" that makes some movies lovable.I rate it 8/10.",Shark Tale

Some scenes were funny while others were unnecessary. What I meant by ""the dawn of bad computer animated movies begins,"" I mean that it was the first not good animated movie (from many people's points of views). Now, we get crap like Doogal, Hoodwinked, and I'm not too sure about it, but Cars isn't looking too hot. I could go on, but I don't want to ramble. The only good animated movies that I personally like and recommend are: Ice Age (gonna see Ice Age 2), both Shreks, and all the Disney Pixar movies they've made to date. This movie is good for fun and a couple of laughs, and not so easily forgettable.

This film is the closest animation can get to having a feature length film being filmed on an iPhone 4. Actually I take that back because I wouldn't want to disrespect the iPhone 4.
This film had so much potential and the only reason it's not 1 star is because it manages to have some semblance of a plot be carried by these big names.
The best analogy I have is this: imagine you are on a large boat with some of the greatest and most popular musicians of all time. Up ahead you see a crew man panic and before you know it the ship has hit something. It appears you hit an iceberg. As the life boats lower the musicians play for your amusement and as the ship sinks you and the rest of the survivors make it away safely. That's this film. This film is the titanic.
Don't believe me? Watch it your self, but let it be remembered I tried to prevent the suffering you will endure.
Perhaps the worst crime is that this film came out at the same time as the Incredibles. Just think about that.

She thought that it was cute, but not worth six bucks.I thought it was a cute little movie and had some charms, but these really felt like silly, mass-produced, generic charms. I think I could have come up with the same jokes or even better ones, and I'm not even graduated from high school yet. However, I like the pop-cultural fizz in the story about Oscar lying about killing a shark and becoming a ""somebody"". I guess it makes fun of being famous to a certain point, but they could have done more.The story itself doesn't really clunk too much. The ""Godfather"" gags fit in well and it essentially moved along smoothly. I liked the jellyfish who spoke like Jamaicans, as well as Marty Scorsece as Sykes, Oscar's boss, and Academy Award-Winner Renee Zellwegger is perfectly cast as Angie, the ditzy yet lovable angelfish who loves Oscar.To overview: Yeah, it works as a nice little family film, but the only reason it made $100 Million as of October 23, 2004 is an awesome marketing campaign doubled over with the enmourously effective outcome of ""Shrek 2"" (it was hilarious, people loved it and the ""Shark Tale"" previews made them want more).

Also on IMDb, the movie got a 5,8 and - if I'm correct - is this the first animation movie coming from a big firm, that got a bad score !!So I didn't expect much from this movie but - maybe because of the low expectations - I really liked this movie !! I think that a lot of people make the mistake to compare this movie with Finding Nemo but you shouldn't do that... Finding Nemo is more of a family movie while Shark Tale tries to reach a more elderly public. Finding Nemo is also meant as a ""fish world"" but Shark Tale is more of a ""human like world in the sea"" as the fish have ears, walk normally, there's a real city with a TV crew,... Therefore I would plead not to compare those movies as it's a completely different setup.I laughed a lot with Shark Tale and I like the music very much in this movie.

206,peroinc5,A cold film,1,28 January 2005,"I thought that this movie was absolutely cold. It was a gangster film, and it was always on the edge of violence; for instance one character actually dies, and they kept trying to kill the Will Smith character. The audience we sat with was very quiet throughout the entire movie. Usually, when we go to an animated film such as this, the audience is more lively, and responds to what's happening on the screen, not so with this production. It also is important that the character voice overs are just that, and no one to really root for. It seemed like the film kept the audience at arms length because there was no character growth or interest. This movie was obviously an allusion to the Godfather, which was not a comedy. They kept saying you are going to sleep with the fishes. It wasn't funny in the Godfather, and it wasn't funny here. This is supposed to be a kid's movie, remember?

Don't waste your time, I don't know why DeNiro, Jolie and the rest of the cast did. I don't appreciate them for this movie.The movie contains parts of some of the Hollywood blockbusters such as The Godfather. It is put together whimsically and was not funny at all.

He makes it to the top through some trickery, goes for the goldigger. And he finally sees what is really important and returns to the down-to-earth sweetheart that loved him all the time. This is also a case of too many big names spoiling the movie. I spent half the film trying to decipher who lent their voice to what character.

215,Jawss6,Lenny was not Gay he was handicapped,10,14 September 2006,"This movie had to been my favorite of all times, why? Because the movie was finally showing someone who had a disability and was put down for his differences. Many people mistake Lenny's gayly behavior as being a homosexual, I didn't consider him gay. To me he had a disability and a warm heart, I was very giddy to when I was in H.S. and many people thought I was gay and I am not.Besides this it was a good movie played by good actresses and actors, the music was good. The movie was more cartoony looking than Finding Nemo, and was a bit like Shrek in these ways. Shrek had some jokes that mostly adults would understand, although in today's world kids are able to catch onto it quickly. Lola the trampy fish came onto Oscar too strongly, and you could see in the body language and in the eyes where it was going. When I was a kid I don't remember seeing children's movies in this way with this kind of behavior or language, and in this case I can understand why parents are complaining.Not every parent wants their children learning about the mafia or what the mafia is, although there was no violence or no blood. What touched me in this movie was how even though Frankie was embarrassed by Lenny he always tried to stand up for him and help him even when his father was trying to put down Lenny.Other comments I read was the movie copy's too many other movies. Don't all movies have music and jokes about other films, in The Godfather Luca was a killer in Shark Tale he was the right hand boss ( I think ). In this movie it was Don Lino not Don Vito, this movie may have had similar name to The Godfather but the violence and take offs were no where close to being copied.This is my opinion about the movie, take a closer look at Lenny and take a closer look at adult handicapped people, they often act childish and that's how Lenny was acting. This is why I liked it because not many movies show characters with disabilities, I am not insulting people I am just correcting people who say Lenny was gay.",Shark Tale

218,fiddlemaster3000,Meh.,3,29 April 2005,"Shark Tale is a movie which was calculated to be a success, not inspired to be one. Unfortunately, someone messed up the calculation. It has no personality of its own, hiding behind references to other movies, pop culture, and products (I saw the Coca-Cola billboard about five times before realizing it said ""Coral-Cola"". Oh, coral. Heh.) The animation feels as artificial as the story, never feeling like it's taking place underwater. Now that I think of it, why did it take place underwater? The characters don't really act like fish, they just act like whoever is voicing them, or whichever characters they would normally play. The same story could've been about mountain goats or talking staplers. Oh well, I guess the Coral-Cola joke would not have worked in a different setting. This movie is mildly entertaining at some parts, but mostly unmemorable. If you've ever watched Fresh Prince and thought: ""Man this Will Smith guy is funny... but he'd be even funnier as a fish!!!"" then this movie is for you. Then again, if you're that person, you're riding a unicorn in the forest of rainbows, because you don't exist.Dreamworks should really take a close look at what makes Pixar films so great: story, characters, and humor that anyone can relate to.

220,billthebutcherofthe5pts,As Thin as a Shark's Fin: Dreamwork's Animation has Become the Pop Culture Pixar,4,26 September 2004,"Dreamworks' animation seems to continue to rip off of Pixar (currently owned by Disney), left and right. In 1994, Jeffery Katzenberg left Disney to form Dreamworks with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen. It is rumored that he took the idea of Pixar's A Bug's Life with him, and made Antz. In my opinion, Antz is a much deeper film where the ant colony represents a communistic society that the hero must overcome. A Bug's Life had a bit more flimsy plot, with the hero ant trying to save his colony from grasshoppers.Since Antz, Dreamworks' animation has gone downhill, from Shrek and it's sequel, to their new film, Shark Tale, coming out after the success of Pixar's Finding Nemo . Full of pop culture references that don't fit in, bright glitzy eye candy for the kids, and an easy to follow, albeit flimsy plot, Shark Tale may entertain the children for 90 minutes, but it shows how much of a shoddy trend Dreamworks is setting, trying to keep up with the creativity of Pixar.***Spoilers***Set in an underwater New York City, Times Square and all, Shark Tale follows Oscar, a lowly fish who works at a Whale wash. He always seems to be down on his luck and broke. The city of fish is terrorized by sharks, who are made out to be like the mafia.Luckily, Oscar winds up in the right place at the right time, as an anchor falls on a shark who's chasing him, son of Don Lino the infamous head of the sharks, and kills him. Some other fish happen to see Oscar there, and he takes credit for killing the shark, and now becomes the infamous 'sharkslayer.'I will give Shark Tale its props for being one of the most politically correct animation films in recent memory. It attempts to display many different ethnicities through it's fish, from the Will Smith voiced Oscar representing black culture, along with his father having an afro, to the sharks representing the mafia culture-not the Italian culture, as not all Italians are in the mafia; I too wish to be politically correct, to the gay culture. Yes folks that's right, there is a gay shark in Shark Tale. Lenny the shark, voiced by Jack Black, is gay, and I beg anyone to argue.Sure, the writers don't actually come out and say it, but Lenny is a vegetarian, i.e. different from all the other sharks. When he sits in certain scenes, he crosses his fins, like a girl. And he eventually paints himself blue, to resemble a dolphin, and dresses up like one of the Village People. His main desire is to have his father, Don Lino, accept him for who he is. Again, put all that together, and you have a gay shark.What really irks me about this film is the out of place pop culture references. At one point when Oscar is on TV after he defeats Lenny, a set up, he blurts out, 'You can't handle the truth.' And right afterwards, 'You had me at hello.' Two famous movie quotes that had absolutely nothing to do within the context of the scene. They were just there to get laughs, I guess, but it surely didn't work. Besides the plot wearing thin after awhile, a lot of the writing is just so lazy. For instance, the script tries to have all these creative references, but they don't work. One is to The Godfather, with the octopus being named Luca, ala Luca Brasi. Yet the octopus is only an assistant to Don Lino, while Brasi was a cold blooded killer. They also could have made the octopus bigger, to fit the look more of Brasi. They could have done more with that reference, it's just like the lines of dialogue above that don't really fit in. Why make a reference like Luca and not go anywhere with it.The kids are sure to love the bright colors and unoriginal music, like the cover of 'Car Wash.' And the product placement in Shark Tale is disgusting, from Coke to Krispy Kreme donuts-another attempt to get kids hooked on these brands early. They were even giving out free Krispy Kreme donuts after the screening; great idea for America's overweight children today.I will admit the eyebrows on Sykes, voiced by Martin Scorsese, is pretty funny, and his character is probably one of the better aspects of Shark Tale. Overall, this feels like a dumbed-down Shrek 2, which I thought was pushing the limit between creativity and spouting off pop culture. After seeing Shark Tale, all I can say is, I can't wait for The Incredibles, the new Pixar film. I guess nothing will measure up though to the most creative animation film in the last 10 years, The Triplets of Belleville.",Shark Tale

Even that very charm of most animated movies, which is taking audience into an adorable fancy journey, was missing. Despite having it all (a team of A-list actors and an undeserved huge success of Shrek2), this one still misses the bus this time. I think commercially movie will do well and it is only because of lack of competition, but I am not too sure about it either.

I truly hope that you at least don't think you're any kind of a movie critic, if you look past that its Will Smith I believe you'd agree that Oscar was a cool character. I think the movie was really good, not as good as shrek but just as good as finding nemo.Gave it 10 even thou it was a 9 to make up for some of the fools who voted 1.

It's fast-paced and keeps you interested. The all-star cast seems to have had a real romp making this movie, and the animators did too.It will take more than one viewing to get all the jokes, both in the dialog and in the backdrops. The plot is simple, and the message, as many in Hollywood these days, is ""it's okay to be yourself"". But they don't beat you over the head with it, which is good!

I found it was cute but very predictable (***SPOILER COMING***) after the Frankie the shark had been killed. Maybe next time Dreamworks does a cartoon movie they should work on the story, be more creative, and lay off the pop culture so much. Pop Culture dates the movie and gets old after it has been done over and over in Shrek. Funny the first few times and lack for laughs this time.There were points that I enjoyed in this film. I like the morel of the story...lying gets you nowhere you want to be for long, and just because your a little fish in a big pond, you might be a big fish to someone who loves you anyway.

I say, ""Write a film for kids, make it a strong story and then add those jokes that are over the kiddies heads.""Please heed my warning. Do not go see this film! Do not buy the DVD. Do not rent it.

Pixar, with the big splash, Finding Nemo, and Dreamworks with their big hit, Shrek, have been trying to out do the other for years now. But this time, Dreamworks has crossed a line. Spinning off of one the biggest animated under the sea flicks, Dreamworks' picture Shark Tale falls short of mimicking any of the charm portrayed in the clown fish's folley. Mixed with pop culture slurs and a soundtrack with a bass beat, it is all too apparent that the creators were targeting the teens and children of today by bribing them with big star names and a popular soundtrack. While the story line is a bit miffed, the animation is something to really scoff at. Compared to the precision and quality portrayed in Nemo, the animated quality in this shark flick belongs back in the deep blue, where it should stay forever. There were some high points of entertainment, like the cliché mofia fish scenes and the shark disguised as a dolphin, but other than that.. this one was a BIG flop that should have just stayed in the seaweeds.",Shark Tale

Not that that's necessarily a bad thing, but you should know what you are buying.""Shark Tale"" takes ""The Godfather"", adds a generic pretender-to-the-throne plot, and sets it underwater. They let it roll from there, and it is painfully obvious that the most original thoughts on the movie was given to product placements -- clever aquatic names for familiar products. It is well done but utterly predictable.Even the animation is not up to Dreamworks standards. While it's still good, and there are a few great touches (the movements of Lola the angelfish are particularly impressive), the animators seem to have forgotten that these characters are supposed to be sea creatures! For the most part, they move as though they were on land.I don't expect A-grade film-making from Dreamworks, although ""Shrek"" did make (just barely) my very-good movie list (""Shrek II"" did not).

I mean, you can't make an impression just by terrific animation.The plot is ... well in one word... ridiculous. No, wait... there is no plot. Something happens and it ends. Be yourself. Don't lie. Get rich quick. Be somebody. etc. etc. Obviously DreamWorks fellas think that renaming Katie Couric into Katie Current and GAP into GUP is suppose to be the highlight of this messy ocean story.

Shark Tale does not have the precise detail that went into ""Finding Nemo"".

253,anton1492,Italian American coalition calls for National boycott,1,24 September 2004,"Italian American COALITION ALERTS PARENTS TO SHARK TALE VIOLENCE AND STEREOTYPING CALLS FOR NATIONAL BOYCOTT OF MARKETING PARTNERS Washington - September 24, 2004 - The Coalition Against Racial, Religious and Ethnic Stereotyping (CARRES) today alerted parents to the violence and ethnic stereotyping in DreamWorks' soon- to-be-released animated children's movie, Shark Tale and called for a national boycott of all products that promote the film and its characters. The movie is about a fish named Oscar, who gets involved with gangster sharks and killer whales. The gangster-fish have Italian names and are voiced by Robert DeNiro, Martin Scorsese and actors from The Sopranos. It premieres nationally Oct. 1, the first day of Italian American heritage month. Shark Tale is a production of DreamWorks SKG, owned by Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen. To promote it, DreamWorks formed partnerships with some of the nation's largest corporations, including Coca-Cola and Burger King. Since January CARRES has petitioned DreamWorks to change the names of the gangster characters and remove Italian expressions from the dialogue. It also has written to the movie's corporate sponsors asking them not to promote the film. ""Since our requests fell on deaf ears, we are calling for a boycott of Coca-Cola, Burger King, Krispy Kreme, General Mills, Hasbro Toys and Activision, the movie's principal marketing partners,"" says CARRES spokesperson Dona De Sanctis. It is the first time that the major Italian American organizations have called for a national boycott to protest the defamation of people of Italian heritage. Italian Americans represent the fifth largest ethnic group in the United States, numbering 16 million according to the U.S. Census Bureau.CARRES is composed of more than 25 ethnic organizations, including all the major national Italian American organizations: · The Order Sons of Italy in America (OSIA) · UNICO National · The National Italian American Foundation (NIAF) · The Columbus Citizens Foundation · The Italic Institute of America ""Shark Tale is a kid's version of GoodFellas,"" says CARRES member John Mancini, chairman of the Italic Institute. ""We are profoundly disappointed in Steven Spielberg who chooses to negatively influence children this way.""""Shark Tale will be translated into many languages and reproduced on DVDs,"" says OSIA National President Joseph Sciame ""The characters will be in video games, on cereal boxes and fast-food meals all over the world.""Referring to the movie's corporate partners, UNICO National President Michael Mariniello notes, ""How could these otherwise socially responsible corporations, whose businesses are sustained by American families of every racial and ethnic background, be a party to such a reactionary movie based on ethnic caricatures? It literally takes America back to the 1940s.""Lawrence Auriana, president of the Columbus Citizens Foundation, targeted Spielberg's role. ""Despite his enlightened statements about stereotyping, Spielberg has allowed DreamWorks to produce the first children's movie in at least 25 years that promotes bias. By supporting this movie, Spielberg is being hypocritical."" Auriana's foundation, which organizes New York City's annual Columbus Day Parade, banned members of the cast of The Sopranos from marching in the 2002 parade. U.S Congressman, Bill Pascrell Jr (D-NJ) contacted DreamWorks on Jan. 9 and again on Sept. 8, requesting a review copy of the film before its Oct. 1 national premiere. ""I am concerned that the character images of this film do not meet a wholesome standard and will instill societal prejudices in our children,"" he wrote.

254,TheGreatBob,This movie is better when you spend your money renting Disney's Finding Nemo,1,4 October 2004,"Now keep in mind the following is my opinion and you are allowed to disagree, however may I remind you that you are also allowed to go suck a lemon.Shark Tale (a.k.a. Shark Tale: Capitalizing on Finding Nemo) has in my opinion the humor value of a rather unfunny tuna sandwich. There are only a few redeeming values about this film, they include the fact it did not cost me more than $3.50 to watch, it eventually ended and it had many bright flashy colors. As much as I enjoy bright flashy colors (and who doesn't) the film had too many other things going against it. The humor I mentioned earlier was composed completely of bad parity, awful puns and a fart joke. Previous to this movie I was not even aware fish farted. The biggest problem that I saw was the fact that the entire movie was made up of fish (a few whales, one causation and an octopus too) where there was absolutely no need for this. Someone must of simply thought up a bad fish joke and based an entire script around it. The film could have worked at least as well with live actors or as a human cartoon. For that matter it could have been done with ring-tailed lemurs and it would not have made any difference more superficial than the movie's title.For those of you who are still reading and actually want to know a spoiler free plot summery continue as you were. The story of this film is you basic boy fish meets girl fish film where the boy fish does not grasp the fact that the girl fish loves him, and that he loves her in return, in a slimy awkward fishy kind of way of course. On the way boy fish watches the gruesome crushing death of a shark, lies, loses girl fish, tells the truth and regains girl fish. The only real difference between this fish love story and all of those countless other fish love stories are sock puppets.Much like a tuna sandwich this movie left a bad taste in my mouth, at least however I get to eat the aforementioned tuna sandwich.Spoiler Alert: This movie is better when you spend your money renting Disney's Finding Nemo",Shark Tale

However, with the cast they had assembled, the potential was there for true greatness, and this movie misses that by a mile. It has some great sight gags and jokes and some really good voice acting but the story just isn't enough to carry the movie.The sendup of ""Godfather"" is great - De Niro is great, as always, and if you can see this movie as a ""Godfather"" satire - well, it succeeded in that role, and wildly so. In most other areas it isn't quite so great, and the story suffers from one of the lamest Deus Ex Machina endings ever.Still, its moments are enough to make it worth watching once, maybe.

He continuously gave interviews, ran to the crowd to draw attention, then went back to the interviews. Fun once, OK to do twice, but after the fifth time, you wished he'd trip over his own feet, praying he would behave differently.On the stage, he tried to force the crowd into applause for him up to four times. But indeed scored on his break-beat-box capabilities.Jada Pinkett was around too, as frills.Angelina Jolie was however very attractive, with kid. De Niro had the glimmer in his eyes, still working on getting honorary citizenship from Italy. The FilmThe movie starts with Will Smith(Oscar) displaying his Fresh Prince acts all over again. And continue to rely on those, with Jack Black (Lenny) giving the true comic relief. Oscar is overactive, and has a big mouth, overrates himself and this continues straight up to the end of the movie. He gets into trouble, gets into deeper trouble, finds collaborating help from Lenny, gets even into deeper poo and then everything works out in one grand finale.Lenny (Jack Black) is very funny, and should be the true star of the film. He steals the show with his brief appearances, and the dumb mafia gang of Don Lino (Robert De Niro) has some true moments of comedy.All in all, a long time to watch Will Smith do his usual Fresh Prince tricks over and over again.

However... I went into the cinema with an open mind, armed with an eight year old (who was pretty ambivalent towards seeing it) and battled the hoads of kids present on it's third day of release. I would love to be able to say that SHARK TALE ended up being better than expected, as I really didn't have high expectations.... but it truly is one of the few films I have seen that actually managed to live down to my expectations. It reeks of being made by committee meeting film-making to simply cash in on the CGI boom. Technically it looks good, but it is just plain dull, unfunny and downright annoying... particularly Will Smith. Someone should tell Smith that he is incredibly annoying when playing himself (like he did in I, ROBOT), and that he should use some of the acting skills that he's proved in the past that he has. I think the best thing Dreamworks can possibly do is to poach the entire staff of Pixar, then their next CGI film might have some heart and an actual story that is engaging on all levels... and for all ages.I am now looking forward to seeing OPEN WATER, as I'm sure it will have a lot more laughs than SHARK TALE.",Shark Tale

And i did. The creators went wrong on some things:1) The fish get incredibly annoying. 2) The movie is almost 2 hours. 3) The animation really isn't that satisfying.Now with the fish... they weren't as visually stunning as anything Finding Nemo and I know I will get bombed for that, making comparisons and all. Though, I felt they were very imaginative in how they acted like humans.The movie is almost 2 hours. My friend and I were basically the only teens in the theater. By the hour and twenty minute mark, all the kids were up, roaming around, screaming. I mean, ahh. I even wanted the movie to end. There is so much they could have cut out.The animation reminds me of a West Side Story ghetto. Don't ask me why but it does. It in no way compares to anything before it.I was completely thrilled with the pop culture references (keep eye for where the sharks live) and it was a great follow-up to Shrek 2.The only parts in this movie I really liked were of course Martin Scorcese, Robert deNiro, and Jack Black.

Like another reviewer, I felt that after awhile, the characters got annoying and I could not wait for the film to end.

I thought this film would be as good as Finding Nemo, but was brought down to earth as soon as Will Smith (Oscar) opened his animated mouth. This is obviously aimed at people who felt left out when watching the Nemo hit. It's the usual 'White Men Can't Jump' storyline - getting laughs from white people (in this case fish) trying to do black things. Apart from Westwood (Radio 1 DJ) I don't think there are many who want to  and you can see what sort of a joke he is.""Don't worry lots of white fish can't do it"" - Oscar (will Smith) Yawn! Here we go again Whoever thought that putting some chains around the necks of fish, would make them talk like idiots for the amusement of a select group of people. The funniest characters were the ones who didn't have the main roles. Superb one-liners but whatever left Oscars mouth was pointless.In the end I felt sorry for the people who made this and the people that would think it was funny. The gay undertones throughout the film, for the youngest Shark, was done very well however.Anyway - all being politically correct and everything - I'm off to make the long awaited sequel - Black Men Can't Jump and hosting the MOWO Awards. Hmm - I doubt that will ever happen.",Shark Tale
265,hampus-naslund-larsson,It so totally rocks!,7,16 October 2004,"People,...you got to be out of your mind. Just to say this movie suck is like saying ""milk is bad for you"". Its great, thats what it is. Not only the good animations, but also the voice. Will Smith (as Oscar) makes a terrific job, and i can think of anyone that should have done it better.The dialogs are good, fast and funny. People may say that this is a total copy off Finding Nemo, but i have to disagree. After reading other comments i got very, very tired. Oh,...shark tale take place in the ocean,...then it must be a copy off Finding Nemo. Except the ocean there are no other similarities.Don't listen to the others. This is a great movie. You cant do anything else but love Lenny the shark.",Shark Tale
266,qsterling2002,If your child speaks jive...they will like it...,3,17 October 2004,"Unreal. I could barely understand half of what was spoken in this lame movie. Great animation, but my God....you have to be from the ghetto to understand what the fish say. Lot's of music...to much. To much ghetto talk/trash to understand what was going on. Just watch Finding Nemo again on DVD and appreciate a class action movie. This one is a gutter movie meant for nobody. Truly classless. If you must see it, wait for the video. If your kid gets up after the first 10 minutes, don't be offended. The audience is unknown to the director. We walked out half way through the movie...went to the park.Don't waste your money.",Shark Tale
267,rostifer,Best Disney movie that Disney never made,1,18 October 2004,"This film has all the classic Disney elements that we've all grown to loathe so much: loud, obnoxious pop-culture references, a story-line so weak that it assumes the viewer has no intelligence and the ever-so-popular product tie-in placements in your face. It doesn't matter that some of the letters have been changed to make a pun; everyone still recognizes the brand and the effect is achieved.I grant that in watching any of the animated movies you have to suspend a certain amount of belief, but do I have to pretend I'm stupid, also? The final wrapup was so contrived that it wouldn't have played any worse if Dreamworks had chosen to have sharks all come out of the water and take jobs as stockbrokers in New York.I wish I had read some reviews before going to see this movie but I was duped by the name (they made Shrek, right?) and current quality trend in animated features from Pixar and Dreamworks. A waste of a talented cast all playing caricatures of their famous roles. Often, this can be funny as a passing reference but grows really tiresome after five minutes. Is there any doubt Will Smith can voice the Fresh Prince, Robert DiNero a mobster, Angolina Jolie a golddigging temptress, etc.? Have the kids really seen these movies? Who is this aimed at? It is certainly not on an adult level.Message to Dreamworks: Lose the commercial endorsements. It's bad enough that we'll all be beleaguered with them for six month afterwards for free; we don't need to spend the ninety minutes that we paid for with them in our faces also!Message to Everyone Else: Save your money-go rent Toy Story or Nemo again!",Shark Tale
268,ukviewer94,Frustrating... Disappointing... Annoying!!!,4,17 October 2004,"Went to see it with my two children yesterday. The movie theater was packed however for the duration of the film NOBODY LAUGHED! That's how poor the jokes were!I am very disappointed - was expecting far more from the star cast, but Shark Tale is a failure. This is not ""Shrek"", this is not ""Finding Nemo"" - it is not enjoyable, not funny and just plainly annoying.Do not take your kids to see it - they will quickly lose interest in the film and will start whining ""I am bored, when are we going home?"".Several families left the cinema in the middle of the movie - probably could not stand it any longer... I should have done the same!Do not waste your money.",Shark Tale
269,anrazie,boring,1,18 October 2004,"my god, the one thing that keep sounding on my head when I sawthis ""movie"" is: when is this pain going to end? that's it. never take your children to suffer this unbearablepunishment. Slow, dark, clichés following another cliché. Thathorrible fish called Oscar is too much! you know what is going tohappen the minute the film starts. I fell asleep and my six year olddaughter asked us, my wife and I, to leave. that is enough to tellyou how bad this thing is. One thing good about it? mmmmhh, that is has and end? Really,from the creators of those pieces of art called SHRECK? I can'tbelieve it.",Shark Tale
270,swren-2,Great performances and art work; one of the best yet!,8,22 October 2004,"I'm not sure why this movie has been getting considerably lower ratings than previous, similar movies, such as Finding Meno and Ice Age. Perhaps reviewers feel it is not as original as Nemo. After seeing it's rating I was hesitant to see it. I'm glad I didn't let the ratings stop me. I thoroughly enjoyed it! The art work is incredible, perhaps the best yet, and the performances by all the actors, particularly Robert De Niro, Will Smith, Renée Zellweger, Jack Black, and Angelina Jolie, are all great. If you like animated films and want to be entertained, this is a great movie, not just a good movie! The plot isn't exactly Shawshank Redemption, but neither was Finding Nemo or Lord of the Rings. Like Lord of the Rings, there is nothing clever about this movie, except the visual experience. Unlike Lord of the Rings which, except for the side story involving Frodo, Sam, and Gollum, was devoid of any real cleverness and relied almost totally on wowing the audience into a kind of stupor through endless, meaningless, unrealistic slaughter scenes, this movie contains at least some dignity and sensitivity.When the time comes, I will definitely be adding a copy of Shark Tale to my DVD collection.",Shark Tale
271,johnwoodentop,Nice bright colours but a dull film sadly.,3,23 October 2004,"We had high hopes of this movie (My wife our four year old girl and I) but sadly it did not grip any of us. Technically brilliant animation but the leaden script badly let the movie down. The sharks had the best lines but one ""Jaws"" gag was enough. The likes of Toy Story or even Finding Nemo have much wittier scripts and more interesting stories. Even my daughter was bored during the middle reels when nothing much was happening. Somehow the fishes having humanesque faces was slightly disturbing and a little unpleasant. I longed for Dory or Nemo; not just because of how they looked but because of their comparative naivety. Still, I'm sure someone will now use the colour techniques developed for this film to make something better.3/10",Shark Tale
272,psteinl,A really bad movie...,1,27 October 2004,"Let me explain why... **** MINOR Spoiler WARNING **** The story was seen at least a 100 times before, guy is a nobody, uses a lie to get to the top, loses best friend, realises lie, confesses, gets best friend back as lover. omg... **** END SPOILER **** I've seen every ""twist"" coming at least several minutes before. Also, such a setup of cheesy characters, seen at least 100 times before too, I haven't seen in a long time. I'd rate this movie way below Finding Nemo, which at least was a funny and at places original road movie. What I liked though was Angelina Jolie as the seductive Lola, which was really as if made for her :)",Shark Tale
273,mark-j-cohen,Not original but great to look at and a lot of fun,8,29 October 2004,"Many of the reviews I've read of this movie seem to miss the point totally.I agree that it's not original, that the characterisations are paper thin and that it would not stand up to repeated viewings. What most of the reviews miss out is that this is a children's film, and as such it succeeds excellently. It's great to look at, very funny, well paced and has a great soundtrack.At times the fish looked a lot like aliens, and it was easy to forget that this was meant to be set underwater, but this didn't detract in any way. Fish, aliens, whatever - makes little difference to the target audience.My seven year old loved it, and so did all her friends.",Shark Tale
274,djvonbose,What a Shark Tale,3,28 December 2004,"While this viewer enjoys animated movies with a passion. The story line of Shark Tale could use some beefing up. There was not much to the story compared to Toy Story, Monsters Inc., even Beauty and the Beast. The animation was good. The acting of Will Smith was on target. The other characters just did not measure up to a good quality animated movie. This viewer nearly fell asleep watching it. The two people in the row right in front of me did fall asleep. Even the children in the audience didn't laugh as much as in Monster's Inc. There were no shrieks of delight or of fear. My four year old grandson and six year old granddaughter were bored. They were glue to the screen when they saw the movie The Incrediables. If you plan to see this movie, watch it at a dollar cinema. Where you will not waste your money. It's bad enough just to waste your time.",Shark Tale
275,mickymare,terrible,3,9 February 2005,"The Will Smith characters for fish is such a waste of potential this movie had. Do we really need more of WS pretentious, annoying performance? There must have been better choice. Easy-going story with predictable ending. Already seen story-development patterns. (young fellow wants to be reach and famous and getting all this without deserving it or without hard-work, he realize there are much more important and valuable things"" How many time did we see this!!!!!)Movie, that brought us nothing new to see. Except maybe Jellyfish-Jamaicans, the funniest cartoon characters in last 10 years. ""Respect""",Shark Tale
276,eleni-11,A good film but not up to Shrek standards,6,18 February 2005,"I watched Shark Tale, with not too high expectations, because critics can completely trash a good film, or give good critic to a bad film, so I watched it with open mind. It did have very good animations, beautiful colours and a good set (reef), but the plot was too simple to intrigue anyone over the age of ten. It was slightly predictable probably because it is aimed at a younger audience as well, so it couldn't be very complicated. However, I really enjoyed Robert De Niro, and his shark 'mafia' boss character, and Jack Black the ever so friendly shark. Will Smith was good, and had some funny lines, although half the time I could not understand what he was saying. All the main characters were good and their part was essential to the film. I especially enjoyed the two jellyfish.The only thing that I didn't like and put me off was the usual racial comment made by Will Smith (Oscar). I just don't understand. This film is about fish. Green, blue, red, all kinds of colours, yet there is a 'joke' about Sykes not being able to do some 'cool' handshake, because he is a white fish. Well to me it looked like he was a puffer fish. Overall, it was an average film. It did make me laugh a few times, and was quite easy and pleasant to watch. Just a break in a hectic afternoon for a coffee and a laugh.",Shark Tale
277,isaacw,"Excellent movie- one for the whole family, or just the adults",9,2 March 2005,"The foundation of this film is that it is a kid's movie and they tried to make it entertaining for the adults as well. I say they succeeded on both accounts. My little sister (12) my wife and I, my mother, and grandmother all watched this film together and found it very enjoyable. There were so many hilarious moments, the characters looked, acted, and moved like their voice counterparts.Keep you eyes open and observe the whole scene, there is often really funny things happening in the background that you may not catch unless you are looking for them.If you want complete explanations of the whole ""shark mafia"" thing, then don't go to this movie. It is not going to win some yuppie (pun not intended) indie award for changing the way you perceive life or for capturing an accurate portrayal of undersea reef survival under the oppression of gargantuan sharks with the capacity to surpass their ingrained bi-modal processes of eat and swim that have formed a structured society based on mafia conceptions etc... bla bla bla. Save over analyzing a movie for when you are drinking grandee cafe-mocho-choco-late-sans lactose and crunching on overpriced biscotti.All in all, a GREAT MOVIE! I give it thumbs up... but don't take my word for it...",Shark Tale

All you Geazers out there you know want i'm taking about. I can't think of 10 lines to say so iam going to fill the rest of the lines with the cast of shark tale.

282,f144,"Carefree mess, with a 'coming out' bonus",5,18 December 2005,"First of all, I think this movie was a mess. The constant pop-culture annoyances, the whole ghetto-culture thing, the 'white fish can't dance/jump/whatever', and the adolescent fish with spray-cans. Fish with caps and gold chains is a bit, ahem, stupid. The whole ""downtown New York but with fish"" idea that the writers sold to the studio is, well; stupid.The story is thin, and seemed like it was lifted from so much better movies. The product placement was shameless; downright nauseating (can you all say Coral-Cola?).For my money it had only one thing to offer: I was surprised to find that it handled what could be viewed as an alternate sexuality issue, very gently. Where the rest of the film was awash in heavy-handed slapstick (I mean old-guy-fart jokes, come on), Lenny's dietary and social inclinations (analogous to certain sexual preferences), was dealt with in a positive way; and accepted by a loving parent. For Hollywood, that is a somewhat gutsy and grown-up ingredient to have in a kids movie, is what I think. That I liked.5 out of 10. Two of those five is for the alternate sexuality issue alone. If you or anyone you know is dealing with this, it will be a pleasant surprise, but other than that: Move along, there is not much to see here.",Shark Tale

Robots, Love On A Leash, and The Problem Solvers. Then there's this. It's so- I can't describe it in words. This is a good movie. It starts with confirming that the boy on the moon, is part of the DWCU (DreamWorks Cinematic Universe) canon. We then see Lenny the shark, played by none other than Eminem. We then see the city, New Steve Minecraft City, our protagonist; Oscar, played by Ewan McGregor inhabits. Speaking of protagonist, he has to pay his boss: Sykes, played by Seth McFarlane. He can't pay the money back; so Sykes kills him. The end.Also sorry if I got anything wrong, last time I watched this movie was 1832.",Shark Tale
