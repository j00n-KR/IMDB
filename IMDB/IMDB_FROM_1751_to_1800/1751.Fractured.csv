0,Leofwine_draca,Surprisingly effective,8,25 October 2019,"FRACTURED is an intriguing little thriller that comes to us courtesy of Netflix, and sees Sam Worthington giving one of his best performances - intense, and fully committed to the character. The best thing about it is director Brad Anderson, whose THE MACHINIST came out and wowed a lot of us some fifteen years ago. FRACTURED isn't on the same level as THE MACHINIST, but it is a very interesting visual piece of work, a psychological mystery that truly keeps you guessing until the very end. The story is simplistic in itself, reminiscent of the excellent Kurt Russell vehicle BREAKDOWN in fact, but it's the way in which any solution can be equally feasible that keeps you watching. The real star is Anderson himself, who has put a lot of time and effort into his direction and created a highly suspenseful movie as a result.",Fractured
1,kosmasp,A mind of its own,8,3 December 2019,"When a movie decides to go places, as a viewer you have the choice to ride with it or abandon it. I do hope you are taking option A and ride with it. It really is quite engaging and you will be quite ""mindblown"" as another reviewer already rightfully stated.If you were wondering where Sam Worthington was (is) - wonder no more. This is really a nice acting piece he got to grab and make something of it. There are 2 obvious paths or choices or options, on how to view this or what it probably is telling us. So no Bonus points for guessing right. This is about the journey and it is quite an exhausting one! But very good too",Fractured
2,Sleepin_Dragon,Expect the unexpected.,7,22 November 2019,"Fractured is a mystery thriller, I'd agree with that, but the one tag that's missing, is surreal. It's a very odd film, so odd it's almost bonkers, it's like being in a nightmare, you can't wake up, all events are out of your control, and every aspect of life is spiraling out of control. I won't give a single spoiler away, because it would give the game away, all I could say is expect the unexpected. I predicted events and outcomes, I got every single sequence of events wrong, loaded with twists and crammed full of intrigue. Sam Worthington is terrific.It's trippy, it's slow to start, but great as it gets going, think The Lady vanishes. 7/10",Fractured
3,paul_haakonsen,Quite entertaining thriller...,7,8 October 2021,"As I sat down in 2021 to watch the 2019 mystery thriller, I must admit that I wasn't sure what I was getting into, as I had never heard about the movie. But with it being a movie that I hadn't already seen, of course I opted to give the movie a chance.And as it turned out, then writer Alan B. McElroy actually managed to concoct a rather wholesome and entertaining storyline and plot. And I was particularly impressed with the way that he managed to keep me guessing at what was actually going on throughout the course of the movie. And right up to the end, where the actual reveal was unveiled, I must admit that I had been trying to figure out just what was actually going on. And I did like the ending to the movie.""Fractured"" turned out to be a good movie, and the storyline have many elements to it, so chances are that there is something here for just about anyone in the audience. I was more than genuinely entertained by director Brad Anderson's movie. And I am glad that I opted to take the time to watch it.The movie has a good cast ensemble, and especially Sam Worthington manages to carry the movie quite phenomenally with his stellar performance in ""Fractured"". It was also nice to see the likes of Lily Rabe and Stephen Tobolowsky in the movie.If you enjoy thrillers that aren't driven by an easily predictable plot, then ""Fractured"" is well worth taking the time to sit down and watch.My rating of ""Fractured"" lands on a seven out of ten stars.",Fractured
4,blanche-2,very good,8,3 December 2019,"Lily Rabe and Sam Worthington star in ""Fractured"" from 2019, directed by Brad Anderson. When his daughter has an accident at a construction site, Ray Monroe (Worthington) and his wife Joanne (Rabe) take their little girl to a hospital. The doctor suggests a CT scan. Ray waits and waits - but his daughter and wife never return from the CT lab. He becomes convinced something nefarious is going on at the hospital.This is a film in the vein of ""Coma,"" that heads more into thriller territory as the story heats up. Rabe, who resembles her mother, Jill Clayburgh, and Worthington both excellent performances. Worthington has the workhorse role and acquits himself well.This is a very well done film, with the director giving us a great atmosphere , camera angles, and fish eye lenses, making everyone look suspicious. Don't pay any attention to the IMDb rating - as per usual.",Fractured
5,searchanddestroy-1,Breakdown meets Coma,7,22 October 2019,"As many viewers I guess, I thought about Jnathan Mostow's BREAKDOWN back in 1997, and of course Mike Crichton's COMA, from 1976. A terrific thriller drama which grads you from beginning. I agree that's a scheme already seen before, but the most important is that the audience feel like Sam Worthington, the lead character. But if you watch closely, at the admitance desk of the hospital, where the lady clerk asks weird questions about organs donations, you can already guess what it is going on afterwards. But you have to remember those short lines at the beginning. Good feature.",Fractured
6,Calicodreamin,"Unexpected, but slow to get going",6,17 October 2019,"The ending of this movie was definitely unexpected (at least for me) they do a good job of you around in circles and make you cast doubt every which way. I was pleasantly surprised by the emotional depth of the main character and I was definitely invested in the outcome of the story. My main criticism is the length of the movie, it takes a long time to get the plot up and rolling and the climactic scene takes up all of ten minutes of the movie. The middle of the movie feels very repetitive.",Fractured
7,deloudelouvain,Better than I expected.,8,18 October 2019,"I read that alot of reviewers were disappointed by the end but I can't agree with that. I thought the end was clever, and I'm pretty sure not alot of people will have seen that one coming. To me that's always a bonus when you watch a mystery thriller. During the entire movie you try to guess what happened and that without getting bored. The different twists and turns are the ingredients that made this movie a bit better than the usual movies in this genre. The acting wasn't bad at all so no complaint for that either. Overal Fractured delivered, a good thriller with a good cast and plot.",Fractured
8,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Pleasantly surprising suspense thriller,9,22 October 2019,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningRay Monroe (Sam Worthington) is a recovering alcoholic, on a road trip with his wife Joanne (Lily Rabe) and young daughter Peri (Lucy Capri.) After stopping by the roadside to get some charger batteries, Peri is involved in a serious fall, and is rushed to the nearest A/E. Upon checking her in, Ray waits with Joanne in the waiting area, only to awaken from a sleep with Joanne missing, and no recollection by the hospital that Peri was ever admitted, plunging Ray into a nightmarish rollercoaster of events where everything is not as it seems.In a day and age where most of the original ideas seem to have dried up like a draught in Africa, it's surprising original, effective, new ideas aren't recycled more often, especially since, as all the films which spun off from the Die Hard concept proved, you can still take an idea that's been done before and make a good thing out of it. 1997's Breakdown was one such idea, that never really got explored much more, but which director Brad Anderson seems to have set the template from with this decent, worthwhile little thriller.Anderson saturates his project throughout with dark, gloomy lighting, which suits the eerie, forboding tone he's trying to create. A hospital, especially a remote one on the outskirts of town, is a naturally unsettling place to set a dark suspense thriller such as this, and Anderson works it to great effect. Worthington has a strong presence in the lead, and his growing paranoia is magnetising to watch. The film is genuinely suspenseful, leaving you honestly unsure how events will pan out, and on the edge of your seat to find out how.Anyone who liked the film Breakdown will have a good time with this pleasantly surprising Netflix offering, an effective thriller that leaves us with a curiously ambiguous ending. ****",Fractured
9,Edvis-1997,8,8,8 February 2020,"Yeah. So from the beginning you could learn that everything is fake and created in his mind BUT it's really heartbreaking to know that there are lot of people who live with same mental issues as shown in this film like dementia,for example, it's getting scare a little. I would say this movie wasn't thrilled but it was like interesting documentary about mental problems or smth like that.",Fractured
10,UniqueParticle,So this is what happens when you spill coffee and don't pay enough attention to your daughter,8,3 June 2021,Sam Worthington and Lily Rabe are magnificent! I'm intrigued by a mystery thriller like this probably could've watched sooner I just don't use Netflix much. Brad Anderson is a great director for several wonderful films I really like The Machinst and The Call by him. Hard to tell what is happening yet but I appreciate everything so far. Tricky ending almost ruined it but I think it worked!,Fractured
11,paulclaassen,"Nothing new, but enough mystery to keep me interested.",5,28 September 2021,"The first thing I noticed about 'Fractured' was the amazing cinematography. I mean, this film looks incredible on a big screen. And then there's Sam Worthington, who is a fantastic actor, and who delivers a powerful performance.The premise itself isn't new. The film reminded me a lot of 'Flightplan', starring Jodie Foster, where her child went missing on a plane. 'Fractured' follows the same premise, where a man's daughter and wife 'disappears' in a hospital, and staff insist he came to the hospital alone.There's enough mystery here to keep the viewer glued to the screen. Worthington's powerhouse performance will make you root for his character all the way. Set mostly in a hospital, they cleverly created suspense through mystery. Prepare yourself for a shocking twist.'Fractured' was an interesting watch, but once you've seen the outcome, I'm not sure it's the type of movie you'd watch again. Its the mystery element that kept me engaged. Now I know the truth...Would I watch it again? Not sure.",Fractured
12,cruise01,"Suspense, mind blowing, and haunting.",7,16 October 2019,"Fractured (3.5 out of 5 stars).Fractured is a thriller that will keep you guessing as it goes back and forth with you predicting and twisting it elsewhere. More like a psychological thriller kind of movie which makes you think if the events happening with the character is real or not. Fractured does deliver the thrills, performance by Sam Worthington is good, and it does not stop with the suspense until the shocking end.The plot follows Ray (Sam Worthington) and his wife Joanne (Lily Rabe) and their daughter Peri (Lucy Capri) after heading home on thanksgiving. Peri accidently falls in a construction site which Ray tries to rush to the nearby hospital. Once there, Peri gets a cat scan which Joanne accompanies her. While Ray is waiting in the waiting room. Several hours later, he tries to check up on them which the doctors and staff have no idea what he is talking about. Ray tries to go above and beyond to find his family which the cops, the staff, and the psych ward tries to stop him.It's a psychological kind of plot which tries to throw the audiences into a loop with trying to believe with what they see. Without giving away any spoilers. The film is a bit predictable but it does throw you into a whirlwind spin with what is going on. Ray is a recovering alcoholic. Beginning of the movie, he was stressing and fighting with his wife. When he was in the gas station, he was struggling on avoiding alcohol. Plus, his past wife which a tragic accident left him scarred for life does not help his situation. When his current family is missing and he is acting like a maniac towards the police. It is one persons desperate search for his family. No matter what the actions are.Sam Worthington is good with the role. Have not seen him in any big movies besides Avatar. While all his supporting roles have been forgettable. He is a talented actor when he is given a proper script. Lily Rabe is also decent playing his wife. She barely has any screen time besides beginning of the movie.Brad Anderson's direction which he did a great job with the psychological The Machinist movie. Which he does the same for Fractured. Making another mind bending film which is about a man searching for his wife and daughter. While the hospital staff are living in denial possibly and trying to make him feel like he is insane.There is a shocking twist in the end which if some people may predict or be surprised. It worked. And it delivered spine chilling goosebumps in the final few minutes of the movie.Overall, Fractured is a pretty fair psychological thriller film. Sam Worthington and Lily Rabe were good. Brad Anderson direction is good. He delivered a film that puts you into a whirlwind of guessing. Plot is thin. And the film does get a bit predictable. It is still entertaining.",Fractured
13,eddie_baggins,"Take a walking tour of your local hospital, it will be about as fun as Fractured",2,27 October 2019,"Much like Bird Box last year, Netflix have struck viewer gold with Fractured, a new thriller that is finding itself talked about on the inter-webs thanks to its twisty and turny nature but just as Bird Box was over-hyped beyond all recognition for what was a film that was really quite bad, Brad Anderson's Sam Worthington starring thriller isn't any better than that diabolical effort.It's a shame, Anderson has long been a director that has delivered a mix of fantastic films like the amazing The Machinist and Session 9 and the genuinely bad The Call and Vanishing on 7th Street and a collection of noteworthy TV show episodes for the likes of Boardwalk Empire and Treme but his dropped the ball again here as he follows Worthington's clearly not fully functioning concerned father Ray Monroe, who is worried about the whereabouts of his wife and child after they are forced to visit the hospital emergency room.It's a Hitchcockian like set-up, but one that ends up as nothing more than a pale imitation of those type of unnerving thrillers as there's never that much mystery here that remains a surprise, as Monroe spends the majority of the film running around hospital rooms harassing staff members and profusely sweating as he tries to figure out exactly what is going on.In the early stages of the film it feels as though Anderson shows us too much about what has happened, reveals too much about Monroe's past, so from very early on we're made too feel a certain way about what is transpiring in front of us, which includes the fact Monroe isn't exactly the most trustworthy of narrators to tell a story.To be fair to Worthington, whose as good as his been in years as Monroe, he seems actually interested in the role unlike much of his post-Avatar career and had the film managed to feel more unpredictable and plausible, Fractured may've been able to be a fully-fledged guilty pleasure, the likes of which are few and far between on Netflix's original offering smorgasbord.What we are left with as a final product is an increasingly dull, far-fetched and frustrating experience, one that would be akin to taking a tour of your local hospital as that's exactly what it feels like as Monroe hurriedly races around the facility that he feels has dealt with his wife and child in a nefarious way.Final Say -Initial promise very quickly gives way to a very bad thriller, that seemingly thinks its fooling us all into believing its far smarter than it indeed is, making Brad Anderson's latest disappointment a missed opportunity to create a film worthy of all the talk its generated.1 get well soon balloon out of 5",Fractured
14,Fella_shibby,Such kinda thrillers only have two possibilities n hence predictable but the way the film kept me hooked till the end is a sign that it is a solid thriller.,8,14 October 2019,"The best part is the way the director managed to make it captivating, thrilling n poignant.Brad Anderson gave some solid thrillers n most of em had similar twists with a lil ambiguous endings.
Session 9 and The Machinist will always be remembered by genre fans, Transsiberian will be for its awesome cinematography, Stonehearst Asylum will be for its twisted ending, The Call for its pace n Vanishing on 7th Street for its dullness.
But this film might be compared with Flightplan, Forgotten, Shutter Island, Mememto n The Shining.
The Shining for the alcohol theme especially.
Been never a fan of Sam Washington but in this film he gave a nice performance.
Overall a solid thriller with a good performance n good direction.
I judge a movie with my cell phone. If I pause the film to fiddle with my phone then the film is not that interesting but while viewing this film, I did not check my fone at all.",Fractured

I'd give it a 4 but its got my man Tobolowsky in it and he just adds another star just being present. 'Watch that first step, it's a doozy!' 5/10.",Fractured
17,jtindahouse,A movie that I need to watch again now,9,14 October 2019,"'Fractured' has a very similar plot set up to 'Flightplan'. I've always thought what a great concept 'Flightplan' was because it left itself open to go in two entirely different directions. You could remake the final third of that movie with an entirely different ending and it would likely still be a very good movie. 'Fractured' sets itself up in a very similar way and then keeps the audience guessing right until the dying minutes of the film. And it does so expertly. I was genuinely baffled about which way this film was going to turn out, and I love that in a film.I'm not usually Sam Worthington's biggest fan, in fact I feel his performance has even ruined some good movies over the years. Here though I couldn't fault him. In fact I really enjoyed his performance. I was watching him especially closely throughout the movie too because I was trying to pick up on any clues as to which direction the movie was heading. He fully committed himself to this role and gave an excellent performance that helps to boost the movie even that little bit higher.This movie is going to be highly rewatchable for the simple reason that watching it knowing what is going on is going to offer a whole new perspective on things. Also just because it is a damn fun ride. The final twenty minutes of this movie especially are explosive and very well put together. I had a really good time with 'Fractured', and if you're worried about this being another rubbish entry in the Netflix Originals series, don't be. This is a good one.",Fractured
18,kwenchow,Another worst thriller film! Full of slow motion and confusing scene! Not intense! The rating definitely fake!,1,16 October 2019,"This film start with a couple(Ray and Joanne) arguing in a car, they stop at a gas station and their daughter ""Peri"" fell from the edge of the gas station scene! As turnout, this film is about solving the mystery of the disappearance of Joanne and Peri! Peri actually already dead at the scene! She never send to the hospital! Joanne also accidentally kill by Ray at the scene! Entire film full of overuse of Ray suffering trauma in his memory scene!(He lost his first wife in a car accident with an unborn child!) Overuse of the conversation with the receptionist scene! Super bored! Ray fighting with a guy in a elevator scene also not intense at all! They fighting but the door even not broken at all! Ray eventually choke him death! The most intense scene is only at the end of the film! Pathetic! At the end, Ray hallucinate a bunch of doctor removing his daughter organ and his wife wounded on a chair! He shot the light and accidentally causing explosion! He rescue his wife and daughter out of the hospital and along the way he shot another doctor's leg! At the very end, the scene showing us, Ray actually carry a dead body out from the hospital!

20,sauravjoshi85,Don't go by the reviews and watch this good movie,7,18 February 2021,"Fractured is a psychological thriller directed by Brad Anderson and stars Sam Worthington, Lily Rabe, Lucy Capri, Stephen Tobolowsky and Lucy Capri.Psychological thriller are the most interesting movie to watch mainly due to the mystery which is hidden inside the movie and the movie can only be made a good successful crime thriller if it succeeds to keep the mystery intact till the very end of the movie. The same is the case of this movie as the movie manages to keep the mystery intact although with a little more refined screenplay and by adding a little pace the movie could've been made a nail biting thriller.You must have read the synopsis of the movie but the movie had the ability to deliver much more what is expected from it. The best part of the movie is that the movie will keep you engaged till the very end but the worst part is the little loop holes left by the director which will only be understood after watching the movie as I am avoiding spilling any spoilers.Acting in the movie is good but Sam Worthington steals the show with his steller performance. Other characters were also good. Screenplay of the movie is good although could've been more refined and crisp and little more fast paced. Direction is good. Background music is superb and works as a fuel in the mystery.Climax of the movie is probably the best highlight of the entire movie and is a treat for typical psychological thriller lovers.

Sam Worthington's performance deserved a better screenplay, and of course, a better climax. Brad Anderson, whose filmography is a mixed bag, crafts this psychological thriller by probing into America's healthcare system (which was brimming with possibilities) in a derivative family-member-suffers-from-an-accident scenario.To writer Alan B. McElroy's credit, he did set things up neatly in the first 45 minutes. The where-why-how questions do intrigue. The conversational exchanges between husband and wife did seem ludicrous at times, but to the film's benefit, the universe around them (especially at the hospital) seemed to reflect that too.

The narration of the story is gripping to watch until the end while its mystery theme made it a worthy movie to watch and to be recommended to others.

34,NijazBaBs,perfect thriller and mystery,9,2 January 2020,"I am amazed by this movie. Similar to movies Unknown (2011) and Unsane (2018). The best recent mystery and thriller I watched. Although it looks amateur and there are boring and low quality parts like in most amaterus movies, which is the only reason I can't give it max rating, everything else is perfect. Meaning, emotions, unpredictability, psychiatric part, location, adrenaline, fear, hope, and extremely mysterious story. Story is so mysterious and realistic. It leaves us with questions: is this real, what is real, could this be real, what if. The reality is so much present, for example the same topic of abduction and organ harvesting really exist in form of crime in real life, just like do corruption and injustice. But so does head trauma, mental disorders, insanity, drugs...that all can make us the guilty one and the wrong one. There is presence of feeling of this all being some dream, or hope, or disease or consequence of medications or drugs. That magical feeling when it is difficult to know what is true and false, what is real and unreal. Perfect for genre of mystery and thriller. So many twists and unpredictable things make this movie not that boring, if at all. Presence of all people (doctors, psychiatrists, police, clerk, family) looks analogous to real life. Perfect ending, which although unfinished, brings so intense emotions of hope, sadness, calmness, relief. Also nice presence of gore, and good topic (having to deal with problems on place we are the most vulnerable - a hospital).

Coming from an experienced director; Brad Anderson, it was not much of a surprise that we would get to see some solid thrill elements in here.
Coupled with an enigmatic color palette that profoundly states isolation and stunningly showcases a mental breakdown that signifies how weirdly or excitingly our brains work. Especially at times of extreme conditions.
Though slightly predictable at times, it's filled with enough tenseful moments to hook you up till the end! The writing is very good, especially for the first two acts. Afterwards it does get sloppy and the ending seemed abrupt and underwhelming to be honest.But the most positives come from Sam Worthington's portrayal of 'Ray Monroe'
A noteworthy performance that neatly implies the sufferings & struggles; a mental health patient would probably experience!
Other characters didn't have much contributions; as the whole film is being carried solely on Mr. Worthington's shoulders! And he did manage all that pretty well.Apart from the cinematography which is simply brilliant, the sound score too does have its effects. A soothing, melancholy tonality that perfectly matches with the on screen occurrences.In conclusion, it was a promising execution that showed merit through its excellency in technical aspects and a commending performance from the main lead which made it even more worthwhile!",Fractured

Sam Worthington was great in the lead role, and really carried the whole thing himself. The snowy, barren landscape and hospital setting really helped give the sense of walls falling in around you.The ending felt a little rushed and slightly lazy in its execution which took away from the overall film.

46,apryla-58795,Sam Worthington! Find another line of work and stop annoying us!,6,2 April 2020,So as hard as it is to believe this is honestly one of Netflix's best original films. That's not to say it's good-just that it felt more like a real theater movie instead of the usual Netflix fare. I was hooked and into it from start to finish. I knew there was gonna be a twist but didn't know how it was all gonna tie up in the end.My issues:1. I've tried and given him many chances but Sam Worthington is a dud. They need to stop giving him roles. I mean this is a Netflix movie so one could say he is on his way out. Fingers crossed.2. Lily Rabe is NOT leading woman material. She has a deep voice and is hard to look at. There is nothing interesting about her.3. The little girl is sweet and cute but did anyone else notice that her hairline started practically halfway back on her head. She has the biggest forehead I've ever seen. Very distracting. I mean she's cute now cause she's little but poor lass will have to rock some serious bangs once she gets a bit older. You could used her forehead as a dry erase board. For real!4. The staff was acting way too weird and unnecessarily aggressive. The security guard looked like he walked in off the set of a 70's porn flick. Both front desk nurses were total beyotches! Who acts like that?!5. How is this dude gonna hallucinate literally EVERYTHING?! If he was treated for a head injury why was he waiting in the waiting room forever after the fact?! He should've been released or held for observation. None of this walking around and talking crazy. What kind of hospital locks someone up in a room with medications?! So stupid.I agree with the other reviewers that this could have been better for sure. A better ending would be if he had been at a smaller medical facility instead of a huge hospital. There's no way a hospital that size would be able to cover up something like that.Lastly I would submit that the best actress in this was the one female cop. She actually acted very much like cops do in real life-very logical and very methodical in her thinking. She was asking all the right questions and going through all the motions that a normal police officer would so that was the first bit of levity that the film had. She really added a realistic element to it that helped for a while BUT ultimately the film couldn't be saved. There's just too much that was ridiculous.I gave this a 6 which seems high but trust me I have seen so much worse.,Fractured

51,nitzanhavoc,"Smart writing, clever plot twists, and Sam Worthington. Excellent!",8,21 November 2020,"As all of us Netflix subscribers know only too well - as far as films are concerned, we compromise. The occasional hit series makes the myriad of mediocre-at-best original movie productions seem somewhat fair, as no one can expect a streaming service to excel at all fields, right? And when it comes to Netflix - it's obvious the ""feature product"" is not the movies. So when Netflix actually offers us the kind of experience delivered by Fractured - one must take it with both hands and live it to its fullest.The background is generic to the point of being textbook stereotypical, a means to cheat the audience into feeling deep empathy toward the main character, Ray Monroe. A struggling husband and father who obviously tries his best but never quite cuts it, who's also a recovering alcoholic and altogether displays a rather pathetic demeanor. How could anyone not feel sorry for the guy?! Cheap, Netflix. Very cheap. But it works.Following an accident in which his daughter is injured - Ray rushes with his family to the nearest hospital (in impossible traffic, of course, because it's still important to emphasize the ""poor Ray"" narrative). There, the audience receives a traumatically accurate and realistic portrayal of how it feels to be a family arriving at the emergency room when you aren't a member of parliament or a multi-millionaire celebrity. Never-ending queues, insufferable behaviour by staff members who dehumanize patients on account of their own fatigue and frustration (yes, I know, I broke the law of ""never criticize health professionals they are always the victim""), but eventually - Ray's daughter gets treated and sent down for a CAT scan, accompanied by her mother. And that would be the last normal thing to happen.During his daughter's said accident - Ray suffered a head injury, and anyone who has watched a suspense film in the past two decades knows exactly what that means: it's time to play ""keep the audience guessing"". What is really happening? Is ray suffering from head trauma induced psychosis, or is the bluntly more malevolent explanation actually possible? Is he actually an antagonist, or a victim of terrible circumstances and even more terrible people? The answers, once given, catch even the most experienced and well-prepared viewer off guard.Other than the smart story and great utilization of clever plot twists - two more features make Fractured great: first, the soundtrack, reminding us what amazing things one could do with a piano and how the right music enhances everything a scene wants to tell; second, Sam Worthington, completely forsaking his typecast from Clash of Titans, Terminator Salvation or Avatar and really proving some incredible acting skills and character range. Rest of the cast have done well too, but Worthington's performance simply put them to shame.Is fractured a masterpiece? Far from it.

54,stevenrotherforth,A solid thriller that tiptoes carefully around plausibility,7,5 November 2019,"FracturedFractured is a solid mystery thriller available on Netflix.
Starring the once bright star Sam Worthington as Ray Monroe a father desperately searching for his missing wife and child after he takes them to hospital.
Following an injury at a construction site Ray Monroe's daughter vanishes along with her mother in the confides of the hospital building.
The audience are left guessing if the sinister events did actually transpire or is it all a figment of Ray's imagination.
Suffering what seems to be a minor head injury himself after taking a fall whilst trying to protect his little girl.
'Fractured' tiptoes around the border of plausibility and the plot only just manages to shy away from being convoluted.
This is mainly down to the believable and frantic performance by Sam Worthington.
This really is his show as he conveys a range of emotions expected from a man in his predicament.
Director Brad Anderson keeps the story from flinging out of control and the 1hr 39min runtime is just enough not to allow this film from outstaying its welcome.
The audience will be fully invested from start to finish due to excellent pacing and the way the intriguing plot unfolds.Presented in Dolby Vision. This movie is another splendid offering from Netflix in terms of cinematic quality.
Sure some of the darker scenes appear a little muddy possibly down to the films depressing colour palette but there is a crisp digital image for the most part.
Sound is adequately handled with a Dolby Atmos mix.
I personally listened to this film with a pair of movie headphones. Still audio was clear and LFE was punchy.
Dialogue is steered effectively and Anton Sanko's musical score comes through with spine tingling authority.
By no means is this an effects laden mix but the soundstage does broaden when drama and action ignite.'Fractured' is a movie that can be enjoyed if expectations aren't set too highly and it's nice to see Worthington in a film that doesn't dissipate from memory as soon as credits roll.

55,TwistedContent,"Engaging Pace, Moody Atmosphere & A Flawed Mystery",6,11 October 2019,"Lots of movies from Netflix in October, the latest being ""Fractured"", directed by Brad Anderson. This was one of my more anticipated ones - based on the directors previous work, movies like ""The Machinist"" and ""Session 9"". ""Fractured"" proved to be succesful in some areas and pretty underwhelming in others.I really enjoyed the first half an hour, interesting characters were established, pacing was fast, story - engaging, atmosphere felt like that of a decent mainstream horror movie, cinematography was gloomy & editing fitting. Also, I rather enjoyed Sam Worthingtons performance all throughout the movie, perhaps it's even one of the strongest suits of ""Fractured"". A big part of it takes place in a Hospital, and it seems to me we've learned that Brad Anderson really dislikes them and knows how to make them eerie. I can compliment that. I hate hospitals.
The biggest flaws lie in the script. About 30 minutes into the movie the mystery starts to really take off & and for the next 60 minutes the writer tries to do as many twists and turns as he can, trying to throw you off constantly. Ultimately, it's kinda sad, because after some time the story feels like a try-hard - most twists can be predicted & those which I didn't see coming turned out to be, one way or another, mellow and unsurprising. The qualities which endured for the whole runtime were the cinematography, direction and performances. However, a movie like this relies a lot on a good story, a well crafted mystery. This time the mystery felt either too familiar or too ineffective.""Fractured"" is, by all means, an enjoyable and entertaining movie - a nice little atmospheric medicore mystery flick.

It certainly held my interest, and I'd rate it a 7 out of 10.Brad Anderson's directing was quite good -- this is a well visualized psychological horror film that capably builds tension with its unsettling angles and strange lighting. Sam Worthington does very well in his lead role as a man who has his family admitted to a hospital emergency room, only to see them vanish altogether.

The ending...you get a 1.Why does every movie need a twist ending? In this, the twist absolutely ruins it - it's not the first movie to ruin a great ending with a shoe-horned in ""twist"" that totally undoes all that preceded it. However, it's not as bad as 2001's Planet of the Apes or High Tension (which is a fun horror, but the twist explanation makes no logical sense).In this, we have another ""are they crazy or not,"" plot - been done to death. The first half of the movie is very entertaining. A ""fractured"" marriage, an accident which injures their daughter, and a trip to the hospital. Once there, the husband is treated like dirt by both the front desk worker and a creepy receptionist who asks all sorts of wacky, inappropriate insurance questions. Questions that only exist as Red Herrings (for now).Soon a Doctor is looking over the child and recommends a CT scan - he actually frightens the parents into having it. They, of course, agree...and mom and daughter head down a hall, into an elevator as he watches it go to ""LL"" instead of floor 3, where he was told the lab was. So far, so good.He retreats to the lobby to await the results...and of course he wakes up hours later (with a bandage on his head, which is a clue) and his family has not returned. He inquires at the front desk again, gets the rude runaround, and he panics. He's told his family isn't there...was never there and that he might be crazy. His frantic search is on.They've already telegraphed earlier that the hospital might be engaging in an illicit organ harvesting operation. So - he's either crazy or there is a conspiracy going on.The husband acts crazy, he's lost it...you're rooting for him to snap out of it and rescue the family and bring down the whole operation...and for a while, that's the direction it goes. His crying breakdowns get a little tedious and the hospital Psychologist is annoying. Telling him over and over that his memories are wrong...which is malpractice in reality.Soon, the local police show up and at first, they appear helpful...but are they part of the conspiracy or not?Eventually, he rescues his family and from our point of view, the hospital is engaged in organ harvesting (on a scale that would be impossible). As they're driving (escaping) away, they drop The Twist...taking us back through the events of the movie and showing us ""what really happened.""

Ray is confident that something sinister is occurring within the hospital and begins his own investigations to save his family.Fractured is simply an average thriller where elements of the film are done right and other elements feel like a missed opportunity.The film setup and introduction to Ray's situation is gripping and the film gets right into the plot, setting up the mystery well. Actor Sam Worthington's performance here is also fairly solid, especially when compared to some of his previous films (eg ""The Titan"").Fractured is an incredibly dark film visually. Considering this film is set mostly in a hospital, it's an incredibly dark and dull setting. After an hour into the film I could feel the film struggling, starting to become slow and extremely repetitive which will annoy most viewers. The film's ending moments just prior to the credits were also dissatisfying considering the film's duration. After watching the film's final ending and thinking about it... I realised that certain parts of the film suddenly don't make sense or ring true plot wise...Overall, Fractured is an average thriller which had the potential to be something bigger and better.

Shutter Island does a better job of backgrounding its protagonist's extreme psychosis and giving reason for it. In Fractured the psychosis is just a bit too far fetched. A concussion? Some drinking? No history of mental illness? It's just not believable enough. In Fractured there was PTSD after seeing the nazi death camps, and an ongoing denial about the protagonist's mentally ailing wife. What happened to the protagonist in Fractured is horrible, but I have a greater sense that what occurs happens because of the writers and not because of the characters, and so I feel like the movie is cheapened.This movie should've been a straightforward murder hospital plot. Why did it have to go and try to be Shutter Island? That setup is way too complicated for a film of this budget and the details just don't add up. In addition third is way too slow, the middle is decent, and last third is way too quick. Why create a complicated story if you're not going to pay attention to the writing?Fractured doesn't work, but I at least appreciate that the protagonist's psychotic break wasn't totally demeaned. Sam Worthington does a decent job of making a head case sympathetic, even if not technically believable. I feel like it wasn't his fault for having to carry an over the top storyline, and much was the fault of the script itself.6/10 for good effort but 5/10 for poor treatment of a tragic moment. This should've been a better movie for what it deals with.",Fractured

Have him walk around totally confused due to a head injury for 95% of the movie! On the way back from the in-laws the Monroe family stop at small convenience store, and as they get ready to leave, daughter Peri is confronted by a mean ol junkyard dog, and when dad, Ray tries to help, well doesn't go so great. Father and daughter go tumbling down into what looks like a rather unsafe construction site. Ray whacks is head pretty hard, daughter Peri, appears to have more serious injuries. Mom, Joanne, coming from the restroom we assume, comes to help, they all pack in the car and off to the hospital they go. As the docs go to take Peri to go get checked out, only one more person can go with, so mom heads off with her. And that's the last time Ray see's them. He dozes off in the waiting room, to see the sun setting, wakes startled heads to the check in and asks about his daughter. Who? The hospital staff seem to remember Ray coming in alone, for a head injury. What? Let the paranoia begin!

This has got to be one of the the slowest films I've seen in ages, however I must say I am glad I did because the ending 10 minutes is exactly the film I thought I was going to get for the whole runtime.The main reason for me not to stop watching the entirety of the film was because of Sam Worthington's performance. Wow this man really has turned around his career, I assume that like most people he was viewed as not that great of an actor.....I could be wrong. However in recent years he has been in projects that have really made him shine as a leading man. This is a fantastic performance of a really damaged individual, who in a weird way you really sympathise with.........that is all on Worthington's part. If anything I would recommend this film to people just to see his performance, I think its that good. I feel as if its time to give this guy another role in a larger blockbuster, because he definitely has talent.The film does do a good job of trying to make you guess who is really telling the truth.......and the pay off in the final 10 minutes is really good. Oh that ending shot with him the car is fantastic.........showing what really happened to his family. When his face changes from a smile when signing.........to this angered focused look on his face, a truly disturbed individual.Unfortunately there is a lot of just boring stuff in this film and its really important things to do with the story that I just didn't care about. Worthington's wife and daughter in the film............bizarrely I did not care about the at all, if they were real or not, I just care about Sam Worthington. So to me as an audience member there was no emotional connection attached to them..........the film desperately needs you to care about them for it to work.Another major problem is the pace of the film................My god is the film slow, and for the majority of the runtime its only Worthington's great acting keeping me from falling asleep. Nothing really happens, the film just treads water for about 50 minutes to 1 hour..........maybe its just me, nothing really eventful happens.Overall its 60% out of 100 its ok/average, its only saved in my opinion my Sam Worthington's performance and the final 10 minutes.

In this film, the child of Ray (Worthington) and Joanne (Rabe) falls down a pit and is taken to the hospital. Soon however, Ray is alone with his family nowhere to be find. Writer Alan B. McElroy and director Ben Anderson has made a good job with the atmosphere and constantly, as a viewer, you will question where or not Ray is sane, or if the hospital workers are up to something evil and gruesome. You see, no one believes Ray when he says his wife checked their daughter in, and he needs to prove nurses and cops he is speaking the truth. Of course, he is not sane and both wifey and kid died in that pit, and in hindsight, the ultimate climatic twist was perhaps not that original. Nevertheless, maybe due to the fast phase, I was thrown between believing Ray or not. That is a success when it comes to a psychological thriller and while ""Fractured"" surely could be somewhat more original, that is enough to raise the film's rating from 5 to 6.",Fractured

You've got the wife with tunnel vision who only sees things her way and she fights tooth and nail with everyone to get her way the same way whether they're a friend or foe. Then finally you've got the recovering alcoholic father(Sam Worthington) who was an alcoholic because he couldn't deal with the mistakes in his past, and he still hasn't dealt with his past so despite telling people he quit drinking he's still trying to sneak in a drink everywhere he can. Like so many American fathers he's completely given up on himself and now believes he can completely redeem his past simply by getting his daughter whatever she wants and making his wife happy, and the wife and daughter happily walk all over him for it! So they end up paying a visit to the hospital and it's your typical anything that can go wrong goes wrong type of situation!

As I was watching it, I thought, ""Either this is super predictable or they're going for a 'plot twist' and he really is making it up in his head."" But it felt like either the writer didn't know what he was doing or the director didn't get what the writer wanted to do. The fact that I saw both endings coming, but neither made sense shows the lack of structure and coherent plot.Even at the end, when they were showing what he ""saw"" and what really happened, they also gave yet another flash as to what ""could have been"", just confusing it further.To complicate things, as it was happening, I just kept thinking, ""ok, there's no way hospital employees would act like that,"" which would give credence to the ""hospital as organ harvesters"" spin, but then they involve outside police behaving in a way that police never would, making me think the writer just focused on his story and wasn't concerned w protocol or logic. Police don't arrest someone for murder just because they find blood (no body or weapon) - or threaten to arrest them just because they're annoyed, nor do nurses just inject someone w a pre-loaded sedative (that just happens to be lying around; and doesn't even knock the person out), then put them in an exam room that somehow locks from the outside and also has adrenaline/epi-pens just lying around, not even in a locked cabinet.There were just so many things throughout that made me think, ""what the...?"" or ""ok, that just wouldn't happen"", that I never got lost or caught up in the story. The fast cuts, like the aforementioned adrenaline scene, didn't help, either.It could have been a solid film; the performances were solid (except some of the Sam Worthington freak out scenes), but I think the writer or director was either just too focused on trying to keep the audience guessing/confused or the script just wasn't refined enough. Half the reason I came to imdb right after watching the movie was to see if other viewers where as dissatisfied as I was. The polarizing reviews are what lead me to give my two cents.

It's thematically derivative (Shutter Island), it's cliched (How many horror movies have been made about creepy doctors and nurses in hospitals?), and the acting is generally uninspired. Sam Worthington earns some points for trying.
The first two thirds of the movie move slowly, a horror movie technique that usually means the last third will accelerate and we'll get action, revelations, closure, etc.
Yeah, all of that happens, but the ""payoff"" is actually rather confusing. Was the guy insane? What really happened to his wife and kid? In great movies, an ambiguous ending can be tremendously effective. Here, it just seems like a gimmick.

I had my suspicions that his daughter would be seriously injuired or died.Following that, his wife found them and started pumping on his chest. But he was in a complete daze, and then pushed her to the ground. I had more of my suspicions. Why did the daughter not have more visible injuries in addition to a broken arm from such a fall? Why did the wife not have cuts or bruises from being pushed to the ground?Soon after, Ray drove his family to a nearby hospital. Due to the chaotic and busy enviornment of the hosiptal, there wasn't much progress in getting his daughter the neccessary treatment.

So the police asks the doctor where that room is, and he says it's on the 3rd floor. Sam Worthington then tells everyone that that's not true, because he watched them get in the elevator and the elevator indicator lights showed them going to a basement level. The doctor argues and says he must be confused, because the CAT scan room is on the 3rd.So then they all still go up to the 3rd floor, and to no one's surprise, his wife and daughter are not there. As soon as the little debate started about where the CAT scan room was, shouldn't Sam Worthington have said, ""ok, forget about what the *NAME* of the place is that you took my wife and daughter, because WHEREVER that place is, it's in the basement. So if that's not that CAT scan room, because you say that's on the 3rd floor, then whatever, that's fine, but the BASEMENT is where I saw them go, so let's go there.""Why would he even waste time going up to the 3rd floor? After going, why didn't he then plead with them to now let's go please check out the basement, like he mentioned earlier? I guess that's probably not a plot hole, more like bad writing.As anyone who's read my previous reviews knows, I don't care how outlandish, unbelievable, or magical a plot is as long the human beings in it make normal, human being choices and have proper reactions to what's going on around them. This is why the CAT scan thing was so frustrating to me.In general, EVERYONE'S reactions were so frustrating to watch. It's just unrealistic to think that everyone in the hospital and even the police, would act with such coldness and no sympathy. They were actually annoyed by him. Everything he would tell them is met with an attitude, ""oh geez, what now, you're disturbing me."" Here's a man looking for his lost wife and child, and ok, if you suspect he's confused because of a head injury, you wouldn't react with a, ""oh god, what do you want, you're talking crazy"" type of a demeanor, you'd be more sympathetic. The reactions of the male policeman are particularly unrealistic. At one point he actually tells him to ""pull himself together.""Overall I did like the suspenseful plot. Would've given it an 8 if not for the bad directing of the actors here. They all had the wrong emotional reactions, which had to be the fault of the director, since it's not just an actor or three doing that, but EVERYONE.",Fractured

He had an extreme level of confusion and paranoia from a devastating head injury and yet was still able to evade and out maneuver both cops and hospital staff. Secondly as someone who has worked in the medical field and in hospitals for years, the actions of the basically the whole hospital staff were painfully unrealistic. I think the filmmakers were trying to have them act through the eyes of the main character, and so would make some of their unrealistic actions more believable. But the lines were often blurred, but not in a good, ""who do we believe"" mind bending way. It was quite confusing. In the grand scheme of things those complaints are rather minor and Fractured it a very watchable and gripping thriller.",Fractured

It was as if the watcher of this movie needed every little hint about what was going on ... so it really did feel like the viewer was spoon fed - making the whole affair rather dull.In terms of acting ... it was not outstanding or very much below average .. but it would not evoke much more than a bored acknowledgement that ""acting had happened"".",Fractured

206,fewald139,Perfectly watchable thriller with a morbidly fantastic ending,7,27 October 2019,"My husband wanted to watch this movie specifically because of the outcry that the ending is terrible, since we often disagree with the general consensus. Fractured is a thriller following the hit-or-miss Sam Worthington as he takes his daughter to the hospital after an accident. After his wife goes to the testing floor with the daughter, he doesn't see them again, and the hospital claims not to know who he's talking about. Shenanigans, twists, & turns ensue.Within ten minutes, my husband and I were already sharing and comparing predictions for future twists and the eventual ending. At the same time, I found myself hoping the movie had more twists to throw at us, because figuring it out so soon would be disappointing. Without spoilers, I can say that there were multiple parts of the movie's ending that we figured out within the first twenty minutes. In this sense, I think Anderson threw a few too many clues and heavy-handed hints at the audience; this is a classic case of a thriller so uncertain of the veracity of its own twists and storyline that it feels it has to spell everything out for its viewers. A little nuance goes a long way. Additionally, there are a few red herrings thrown in to make you come to other conclusions, but none of them are developed enough to stick and lead you astray of what's really happening.In many scenes, Fractured is a beautiful movie; long wide shots of the winter-kissed countryside are mesmerizing, and the blue tints to the early hospital scenes give it an eerie glow to fit the mood. Too often the film is reduced to static shots of arguing hospital employees, however, which gets a tad irritating and repetitive. I'm not usually a fan of Sam Worthington--he tries his best, but he often picks terrible one-note roles and gives a fittingly one-note performance. Here, Worthington portrays a confused and angry father and husband quite well, though there is one scene of him crying that was worth a re-shoot. The other actors do fine, and I say that as monotone as I can through the keyboard--they neither amaze nor offend.What about this ending everyone hates? Well, I loved it. It managed to deliver above and beyond my predictions, adding a macabre layer to what I felt I already knew, making it deliciously depraved. For a movie that hit every note of a standard by-the-numbers thriller before that, this was a welcome surprise. For many, the ending ruined the movie. For me, it made it worth a watch. I'd personally rate Fractured a 6.5/10. It was mostly average with average performances and plot points, but its ending raised the bar. Many reviews have compared Fractured to Shutter Island, and I understand the comparisons. But make no mistake: there are enough differences to make this worth the watch if you liked Shutter Island.Some last minute pros/cons:
Pro: Kudos for having the cops believe Ray's story and agree to investigate rather than laugh him off like in most movies. That cliche is so overused I find it impossible to sit through.
Con: Once the whole truth is revealed in the ending, there are a lot of iffy things in the movie you can look back on in doubt. ""If ____ wasn't the case, then why did this person act so suspicious?"" is the type of question that could unravel this movie in retrospect. Also, when the cops get involved, the story goes in a different direction so early that you feel it's another red herring (since they have to leave time for another twist). Since this isn't *quite* the case, the ending did feel a little drawn out and anti-climactic. The final shot revealing the last macabre twist leaves things on a high note, however.",Fractured

Not only does she not return, but the hospital has no record of his wife or daughter ever having been there.

It's pretty obvious rather quickly what's going on. Part of the problem may be the short runtime combined with a kind of lengthy setup. The setup seems to be designed to convey the sense of waiting long times in the hospital ER waiting room (...ah hah hah social commentary...) But this lengthy first act cuts into the time that could be used to build mystery and tension. As it is, it almost seems like a long ""Twilight Zone"" episode.If you want an ""Are they crazy or not?"" film that's much better, check out ""Flightplan"" with Jodie Foster.

226,aigoalies,Meh thriller with far too many plotholes,5,29 July 2020,"I've thought about this one for a bit and I've come to the conclusion it's a meh thriller. The main problem with this thriller is it tries to play both sides. Sometimes it seems obvious that he is in the right and sometimes it seems obvious that the hospital is in the right. At the end when it is revealed that the hospital is right, all the times where it seemed he was right don't just dissapear, they are still valid. For example, multiple times in the movie the doctors mention Peri and his wife and interact with them constantly. Just because he is now crazy doesn't mean that every one of the doctors is crazy too (on top of this some of the other doctors, like the psycotherapist is supposedly 100% right, meaning what the doctors say is really happening). Yes, the movie was a thrilling ride and fun to watch, but when you go back over the movie it has to make sense knowing the ending and it doesn't make sense unless you take some huge leaps. A movie like fight club and shutter Island makes complete sense if you know the ending and watch it from the beginning again. That's why for me this is only a meh thriller and not a good or great thriller.On top of this the acting, especially the wife, is terrible and the child acting isn't great either and there were many scenes that were extremely unrealistic like him pointing the gun at the cops and not getting shot and him getting away with breaking a hospital window, injecting himself with 4 epipens and escaping the hospital grounds after suffering a head injury without the hospital calling the police.",Fractured

231,MovieNinjaGuy,Pretty good but....,8,1 November 2019,"I thought the movie was really good. Most made for Netflix movies I've watched have barely been watchable and I've often regretted even switching these on but this was a stellar production I have to say and the first good movie I've seen Sam Worthington in Since Avatar (10 years ago!).The ending however I thought wasn't good here.There were two possibilities:
1) The hospital is a massive organ transplant conspiracy
2) Ray Monroe is mad and a lot of what we saw was just in his mind.They went with 2 which I guess is ok (I was rooting for Ray so found the ending a bit sad to be honest).I think the ending they went with would have worked much better if you just saw there was no one in the backseat and he keeps talking and singing and he drives off. Showing all the ""real"" flashbacks I thought was a big mistake. So all this could have been fixed with a bit of editing and I probably would have given this a 9. I think the full ending we saw should have been an alternate ending on a Blu Ray or something (not that this will get a physical release I guess - also a shame actually). Sometimes what we don't see is just more intriguing. Shutter Island was a lot more intriguing in that respect.Other than that however I thought it was pretty good and almost that sort of Shutter Island / The Game quality.A worthy watch for sure.",Fractured

He makes movies that make you think and creep you out at the same time. Session 9 is a great, spooky earlier film of his that you should really consider watching if you haven't yet. As for Fractured, it is definitely worth checking out and Sam Worthington is really good as the main character who practically fills up most of the screen time. No the movie isn't anything new or groundbreaking but it's a tense little thinker with an ominous vibe to it. The hospital setting was a good choice for the movie as well. 7.5/10..

No such luck.But...This was perhaps the rare example of a movie which manages to entertain and keep the audience interested despite the fundamental flaw of telegraphing the ending via galore of hints.At the beginning it almost looks like our hero is alone in the car, ranting and raving like a lunatic. From there on we are presented none too veiled scenes of him interacting with his supposed family in a manner that can be described as peculiar. Is he angry with them? Frustrated? Worried? Something is going on... Next to me quite obvious clue was the interwiev with the clerc of sorts, who'd ultimately decide if the daughter would recieve treatment. Having gone through similar process with my son I knew that the woman was far too interested with status of our hero, basically nothing relevant was asked about the daughter.I could go on, but better not.

The final twist was actually a third scenario that I did not foresee, but it also falls into the nearly impossible category.

Ray and Joanne Monroe (Worthington and Rabe) are a couple whose six-year-old daughter fractures her arm in an accident near an area construction. After checking their daughter into the ER, Ray falls asleep and wakens to find his wife daughter missing. Making matters more mysterious, there is no record of the daughter ever being checked in and the nurses and doctors tell authorities that Ray had checked himself in to be treated for a head wound.
In most cases this would have been time to fall back on cliches and predictable obstacles, but Anderson takes us through a labyrinth of red herrings to keep viewers on the edge of their seats. Worthington shines as the desperate and assumed deluded father.

277,DeadeGuard98,"A Family, A Trauma and The Mind.",6,6 July 2020,"😱First Impressions:
It seemed very promising at first- from the premise, cinematography and then surreal imagery. But the moment it's termed a ""psychological thriller"", then you know things would get screwed up as they're setting themselves up to something that's been done over and over.... only previous films called dibs and did it better.Pros:
😋 Going in, you'll notice a rather odd vibe that you can't quite put your finger on it.... The absolutely creepy framing of the scenes and then accompaniment of piano-string instruments further add to that. I didn't regret watching this just because of that alone.😋 Performances as expected of Sam Worthington, playing a confused family man involved in an accident at a construction site. He gets understandably frustrated and lashes out at seemingly incompetent hospital staff over his missing wife and daughter, who he's sure were admitted just hours ago. He was able to convey just about every emotion needed- sad, angry and of course his certainty over his sanity.😋 Now I have to commend the film for its efforts because for what it's worth there was a constant conflict between how the film should have ended. Of course, there are more subtle allusions and later reveals that nudge him towards the cliche psychological ending but man was it a ride; the daughter's physical injury, the state of the family and of course the husband's grip on reality.
Cons:
😪 What we have here story-wise is very sad indeed. It's painful and sometimes the answer isn't what you want to hear. There's blame displacement, emotional projection.. It's so on point.But instead of using the psychological elements into something revolutionary- it falls into the same trap that many films of the genre did. Not kidding, I saw the film's direction the minute mr. Monroe went to sleep. I would have rather see the film into a bigger conspiracy involving organ donation.😪 The end of the film was tasteless for me. One, everything that hospital staff said was true in the end and to have it literally unfold was just an insult to intelligence,Not to mention, wow where's a mobile phone (for the protagonist and his family) when you need one? Suddenly there are none to call because that would ruin what the film was going for? How about calling his in-laws to verify?? This film is trying too hard to be mysterious. It's just mind-blowing.. Thank you movie!!
😇 Verdict 😈
I'll just give it straight- I was immensely disappointed.... You have the setup for a great expose while at the same time throwing in some psychological thriller elements, the haunting atmosphere that lingers from the construction site. It's all very amusing and the mystery starts to stir. But nope throw all that away and have it become a typical movie in the similar sub-genre that plays out the same way.Answers given to you even before the halfway point then have that be repeated until the end where you're mad at the film and it's just ""didn't we tell you so""?",Fractured
278,bachi_2805,Hitchcock meets Philip K.

But since this is quite a good portrait of a broken man, I really don't know how to think about it. Is it a thriller? Is it a bold clinical examination? As a thriller it works, however predictable. As a bold clinical examination, it works even better.I do like that there is no ""bad guy"" in the end. I'd say, however, that I'm not adhering to the ""just illness creates massacres"" words from gun producers. As if the culture they've been installing for decades (the normalization of guns in film and tv and the heroism of puppets) wasn't necessary for their market. Not saying this film has anything to do with it, but the underlying metaphor of the not guilty crazy man could easily enter the subconscious of the anonymous manipulated citizen to approve of gun production as an innocent action.Anyway, Sam was a good lead. Plot was plausible. Camera angles and movement really worked for the story. Music followed the steps of Hitchcock (stabbing in all the right places). And, most importantly, there was an atmosphere created, a little world of its own (which I think is the trademark of good art).

301,lincolnhawk-87377,Irritatingly Manipulative,1,2 July 2020,"The movie uses the format where it completely manipulates the viewer from the start to the ""reveal"" and uses the ""well, the guy's crazy and you watched it through his perspective"" rationale to justify it. If you enjoy being subjected to such cheap tricks, you'll probably enjoy this movie. If you don't, you'll be extremely irritated come the end of the movie and feel robbed of an hour and forty minutes of your life. I feel as though I have to stress that there is no ""twist"". Many reviews, good AND bad, refer to the ""twist"", the reviewers either saying they did not see it coming or that they predicted it in the first few minutes. Again, no twist. Simply telling the viewer in the last two minutes that the previous 98 did not actually happen is not a twist. It is a con. For this to be a ""twist"", the movie up until that point would have had to be filmed entirely from the perspective of the lead character in order to sell the preceding events as the delusions of a crazy person. It did not. You watch many, many scenes in the hospital from an outside perspective looking in, with some of the key scenes used to paint the hospital as something other than a regular hospital not even involving the lead character. If people want to claim that they predicted the ending - as people like to do - that is fine, but don't claim that people who didn't see the ending coming are stupid. I am not stupid, I just expect film makers to follow fundamental rules of plot delivery. I watched and listened to events play out with my eyeballs and ears that showed one reality, and at the end the perpetrators of this travesty effectively try and tell you that you were seeing it from the warped perspective of a lunatic. No. It was not filmed in a manner that could legitimize this premise. They are suggesting instead that YOU as the viewer are delusional, which is downright insulting. It is not a psychological thriller. It is not clever. It is cheap, tacky and wrong. I realise that I am belaboring this point, but again, a movie with a bad ""twist"" is one thing; this is something else entirely and I think the majority of the negative reviews miss that fact. Imagine watching Back to the Future, seeing Marty meet Doc Brown in the mall lot, watching Marty watching the doc get shot, seeing Marty then go back in time and change the past, etcetera etcetera, over the course of 90 minutes, then watch him wake up back in his own room. Now, instead of him getting out of bed, leaving his room and finding his new present altered, his family happy and successful, Doc Brown alive and well, a nice new truck in the garage, imagine the police bursting into Marty's room and telling him he is under arrest for the murder of the doc and also his entire family. Because you were watching it from the perspective of crazy, psycho Marty McFly, who went on a killing spree but in his mind time-travelled back to the Fifties in a DeLorean. Never happened, viewer, gotcha, Yeah. Hard to put into words how terribly wrong this movie is. Do not watch it.",Fractured

Usually, when my spidey-sense tingles that way, it is spot on and so it was here. I was watching with others, however, so I persevered, and I thought I did well to refrain from laughing until the last 10 minutes, at which point I was hoping the entire cast of characters would find the hidden cooler of kool-aid and drink it. All. To the last drop. Then dry it with a rag and suck the last of it from the rag.Sure there were twists, but what suspense existed was wrapped in a great big dollop of ""Who cares""?

When recounts from hospital staff don't match the man's recollections of what happened within hospital walls, we enter the scenario of ""is he insane, or is it a vast conspiracy?""

To me it was clear all the time something strange was happening and that it wasn't what we're expecting. All that is well and fine - I even praise the director and the writer for using as many ways as possible because nowadays, after having seen all possible ways a movie/plot can take, it is hard to surprise. The only thing that I found odd or almost comical was the final scene, when Ray drives off with that half sedated patient in the back he hallucinates being his daughter.

467,DmytroBaker,"The plot is ahead of time, spoilers and dead pleasure.",5,29 October 2019,"Netflix recently released either a mystical thriller, or the fearless horror «Fracture». And this is the first genre work of Brad Anderson in many years - the director, known for the critically acclaimed critics of «Session 9» and «The Machinist». Only this time, Anderson tried to sit on his favorite skate and maliciously filled the plot with the main and already not the most inventive plot twist. If you are familiar with horrors and dramas, carefully mimicking them, then you can easily predict the development of further events in the first ten minutes.And it kills absolutely any viewing pleasure. Yes, there is a good cast, and Sam Worthington even tries to play the main role, and not just walks around in the frame with a stone physiognomy. It looks like a «Fracture» not bad - within the budget. And around the middle of the film, Brad Anderson suddenly gives a real Hitchcock and inflates the tension to the limit. At certain moments, he even begins to lead the viewer by the nose and carefully hints that everything is not at all what it seems.But all these are simple tricks. In fact, the director really arrogantly tells the whole plot at the very beginning of the film. Spoilers literally in plain text! The most stupid, naive and helpless version of events that you can come up with is harsh truth and joyless reality. There really is absolutely nothing interesting in a particular thriller, but it grew out of an extremely one-sided and dumb idea, built on the final turn. The final turn, which was used and repeatedly beaten even by the most lazy and mediocre filmmakers.The most paradoxical thing is that Brad Anderson understood what he was doing. If you watch «Fracture» carefully, the director constantly throws up evidence, and even loudly declares, «Yes, I really will reduce all the rush to this stupid ending.» Therefore, even the most interesting and intense scenes and episodes of the film are completely disappointing. And even rejection. When you know that at the end they will slip a dummy to you, the process - a journey into on-screen reality - loses all meaning. Why wait for an hour and a half for a banal ending and watch the main character who has obvious headaches?Although if everything described was done intentionally, and the goal was to show the fall and transformation of the protagonist, then why all these difficulties? And why present the ending so pathos and ultimatum?The most annoying is that Anderson still has his talent and he knows how to skillfully escalate suspense. But «Fracture» clearly demonstrates that the director was completely tired of thrillers and horror. Otherwise, he would not spoil the main intrigue at the very beginning and would not palm off a banal explanation of the final twist in the first ten minutes of timing.",Fractured

Can we not have happy endings anymore? The movie was going really well. In brief, a man drives his wife and daughter to see the grandparents. They stop at a gas stop where he loses sight of her and a dog scares her. Her dad scares the dog away but she slips and they both fall. He then takes them to the hospital and the doctor orders a Cat scan for her but the dad notices they go to the lower ground floor. The father sleeps and wakes up and asks to see them but they say only he checked in with confusion. The movie from that point onwards was very tense on the lead up to the end where he storms the Lower ground with a gun he obtained from a cop and finds them just about to remove his daughters organs. He rescues them and drives them home. This is where it went terribly wrong. The movie then tells us he was hallucinating. There was in fact a dog, but his daughter actually died from the fall. He pushed his wife accidentally causing her to fall on a metal bar. And his 'family' he rescued was actually just a single terminally ill woman who appeared different to him who was getting prepared for organ donation. And in reality everyone was normal including the psychiatric, but he became mad. The last scene shows him opening his eyes in shock in realization. This ending was utter stupid and unnecessary and it left me speechless. What was the point of it? If I knew it would end with him hallucinating I would never have wasted my time. Very silly ending. I wish it just ended with him rescuing his family. The trailer was misleading. It makes you think hell rescue them and a nice ending. I can't understand why producers try so hard to be extra.

My issue was that the movie hints at two possibilities: he's hallucinating or he's uncovered an illicit organ harvesting operation. Given they let him go at the hospital, which wouldn't make sense if they were that hardcore, then it must be the hallucination. But I was hoping it wasn't. I was wrong...So essentially the movies spends it time giving hints that he's being setup with a pinch of ""he could be mad"". At the end, you realize that it was all for nothing and he's just nuts. I was in primary when I wrote a story then at the end I wrote: ""and he woke up and it was all a dream"". I got a poor review from the teacher. Same here. It's lazy.

In addition to an overabundance of clues, false clues, red herrings, and so on, there are just as many plotholes, gaps, and oversights in basic logic in order to allow for the confusion. He never once tried to call his wife's cell phone (which the hospital staff could dismiss her not answering with a number of reasons).The film also relies on what feel like unnatural gaps in communication, people not saying things that would be rather natural, talking around things rather than about them.

Do read through this review to understand. I am critical but Fair, and like you, I am a normal viewer when it comes to watching film. However, even if one enjoys a movie, it does not necessarily make it 20/10 star film. We must look at the entire film: from form to tone, diegetic to non diegetic. The issue with this movie is that it is not necessary adding. What I mean by this is that it does not contribute a necessary meaning, moral, or critical theme. One way to explain it, is that it lacks it's own identity. It feels like just another suspended movie. The acting is memorable, however other diegetic elements feel thrown together and lack meaning and symbolism.I have seen alot of reviews talking about the predictability of this film, it is predictable versus it is not. Looking technically, yes, this film is predictable. Most of the team managed to figure out the main twist within the first 10 to 15 minutes. That being said, the way we found out was more unpredictable. This was good, however, much of our team agreed that as the plot unfolded, it felt upsetting to see our original theories for the twist to be proven to be stronger and stronger. This is flaw because when watching a film of this genre, we always predict and develope theories as are excited too see them be proven wrong or altered as the plot continues. Here however, your theory will marginally get altered.
There is no such thing as a bad film, our criteria is strictly based on non bias, rather based on all aspects of visual and auditory narrative storytelling. This film is technically strong, however the plot falls slightly flat and it hurts the score vitally because of the importance of narrative in the given genre and predictability of the plot.",Fractured

This is an idea you should only use once in a movie, not make a whole genre out of it. I mean, from the moment they told the guy that he checked in alone, i knew how the movie would end. I could've made a better scenario: the shrink and all the doctors show him all the evidence that proves he's crazy and he actually killed his family. He eventually believes that trauma created another reality in his mind and he's actually imagining everything, he gets labeled crazy, murder case closed. But then he finds some pieces of the puzzle missing and follow a series of clues that unveil the true story. The doctors and police are part of a network that steal people's organs and sell them to filthy rich people. And they realized that the best way to hide their crimes is to blame it on someone else then use a shrink to call that someone crazy. Once a psychiatrist says that someone is crazy, everything that comes out of that person's mouth is irrelevant to the people around. From there they could've made a happy ending in which he saves his family and uncovers the truth to the world or a really dark one in which they tie him up and begin cutting him up but not before telling him of how his family suffered.",Fractured

Some questionable editing early in the film telegraphs a key element regarding the ending (unfortunately). Otherwise, it was reasonably well-acted and cleverly conceived.Another reviewer compared this film to ""Abandon"" which i feel is a decent comparison. I actually like the story in this film better...again just wish it had been delivered as deftly.Bottom line: decent flick; worth a one time view for 90-ish minutes; just watch as a movie fan and not a wannabe critic. It's a psychological thriller, not an Oscar contender.",Fractured
578,jft-14584,I wanted to be surprised,5,17 May 2020,"I wish the plot had a real twist at the end. Not him being either right or wrong, because it was just too predictable. The direction was way too heavy-handed for anyone to be surprised by any of those two endings. Both the possibilities were equally probable and it feels like the ending boiled down to the simple toss of a coin, and that was very disappointing to me. This kind of story has been done before with a lot more maestria with Shutter Island, for example, where we are kept on our toes until the very end. SH managed to actually be mind-blowing by leaving subtle clues. Fractured SHOUTS in your face, so there's nothing really interesting, just a 50-50 chance, really.Some of the dialogue and the action scenes seemed unnatural. It infuriates me when an action scene solely depends on a character's lack of attention to their surrounding while they're in the middle of something that should require their full focus. It's just lazy. It's so unrealistic that it's maddening. If you find your family at the hands of what looks like evil doctors ready to butcher them, you don't turn your back on said doctors, you don't take your eyes off them and you definitely wait until you're as far as possible from them to hug and stuff. So frustrating it made me want to just stop watching.I was taken out of the movie so many times by some overly heavy acting, dialogues or situations, like that very unprofessional therapist who tries to have him admit to a murder that she speculates happened by putting words in his mouth, which I'm pretty sure is illegal or at least highly unethical in her line of work. I don't appreciate having to persuade myself to suspend my belief again and again and again.The movie does manage to create a very heavy, oppressive atmosphere, where everyone seems to be the enemy. The hospital and its staff are extremely creepy, to the point that I wondered in the beginning whether it was a horror movie. The shabby colors successfully add to it. So, that was well done imo.Overall, not too bad, but definitely too heavy-handed. The lack of subtlety throughout the movie kind of ruined it for me, and the ""toss of a coin"" ending left me a little mad at the whole thing. It's also too bad the director couldn't bring out the subtle and truthful side of Sam Worthington we got to see in Cake. Not at all a mind-blowing movie, unless you're deaf, blind or have never in your life watched a single psychological thriller.",Fractured

Is Sam Worthington's character Ray really crazy or is there something dark and twisted going on at the hospital? Ray and his wife Joanne and daughter Peri Monroe have left from Ray's in-laws on thanksgiving and are on they way home. Peri needs to use the bathroom so his wife and daughter use the bathroom and the daughter comes back to the car and Ray has her get out of the car while he looks for her padd. She gets spooked by a dog that comes at her and she falls into a construction site after Ray throws a rock to try and scare away the dog from Peri. Ray also falls into the construction pit and comes to with the aid of his wife. Luckily Peri has only a broken arm so she is taken to the nearby hospital. After a clash with the check in nurse he finally is able to get Peri checked in but threw Ray's eyes you see something is amiss at this hospital. The first check in nurse makes mention of another patient with a certain blood type. She then asks for Dr. Bertharm. The second in nurse then starts asking odd questions to Peri, Ray and about his previous marriage to Rays first wife Abby. Questions like what are Peris and Rays blood types, who is Abby, his occupation etc, do they want Peri to become an organ donor and when Ray and Joanne refuse the check in nurse asks if they want to reconsider that decision about Peri s organ donation. Ray then goes past the admitting desk and sees outside organ coolers going to and from hospital helicopters and the same via from an ambulance. Peri is seen by the Dr. Bethram and Joanne and Peri are taken to where they do the Cat scans and Ray is told wait in the lobby area where he falls asleep in a chair and when he comes to it's hours later the hospital claims there is no record of Peri and that neither her nor Joanne are anywhere in the hospital but Ray doesn't believe them.

593,amithkumarshankar,A mystery in your head.,7,31 March 2020,"Ray Monroe lost Abby in an accident. He was drunk, an alcoholic, who was reckless, and did not care about anything. How many times do we all get drunk and still go about driving our cars and bikes and risk not only our lives but the lives of everyone around us? Wake up and do the right thing.
Ray did not know what was real and what wasn't ever since that accident took place. He left alcohol behind, he gave up drinking, he in fact lost everything so a little too late to give up isn't it? What was worse for Ray was that Abby was pregnant and, in that accident, he just did not lose one person, but he lost two. It will always be hard to find love again, replace people we love, to even move on in life but Ray was lucky.
Ray was able to find love again, he was lucky to have a daughter, but his mind was completely lost and that was one thing he could never recover ever since that accident. His mind played the most cruel of games, in one reality he killed his wife Joanne, and his daughter Peri, while in the other he saves his daughter and takes her to a hospital where he later believes everyone in the hospital is only trying to kill his daughter and wife. Tricky isn't.
Your mind can make anything happen, your mind is in fact the strongest and most powerful asset you have, imagine the games you could play, the good and the bad.

641,Faustas610,NOT TOO BAD,8,26 October 2019,"Recently, NETFLIX featured another of their original projects ""Fractured"" directed by Brad Anderson, director of the brilliant 2004 ""mindfuck"" project ""The Machinist"". The trailer for the movie determined that it would be a good enough thriller, and partly it did.The story of the film revolves around a worried father, Ray Monroe, whose daughter falls from a small scarp and experiences a fracture of her arm. After bringing her and his wife to a local hospital, Ray soon misses his family. The doctors and nurses know nothing, and the police are impotent on arrival, so the man decides to find out what happened to his family and why everyone around him doesn't want to help him.You know, the film's description, like the trailer for the film, made a really good impression on me, so I was expecting a sufficiently twisted and tense action from ""Fractured"", but after watching the film I only got a poorly developed and borrowed storyline from other similar bands. There is hardly any originality here, as certain moments were reminiscent of the same ""The Machinist"", ""Shutter Island"" or ""The Sixth Sense""). Of course, I'm not spoiling, just saying that some of the elements were borrowed from the bands I mentioned.The first half hour of the film is very boring, so getting into this story is quite difficult. And the oppressive and very uncomfrotable atmoshphere also damaged the beginning of the film. But even after the first tedious thirty minutes, it gets interesting because it creates intrigue that lasts to the very end. However, prediciting how this movie will end is not that difficult if you look at all the extraneous details and dialogues that unwittingly reveal the outcome of the movie. I liked some of the stunts with the storyline, though I couldn't say I was really surprised because as I wrote a little above, it was easy to predict their outcome.The characters in the film are cardboard and completely unforgettable. The protagonist Ray, shows absolutely no sympathy, though his actions seem to show his great love for the family. At times, it didn't look like his family was gone, someone snatched a burger from the table and he lifted everyone around to try to find him on his feet. Same with his family, who was in the movie for a very short time, followed by her searches. Why? Because Ray's wife and daughter were given too little time to unfold and at the same time make them worry about their fate.After the movie ended, a lot of questions arose because the tape didn't seem to be fully completed and a few storylines didn't quite work out. But the preview didn't take long, which made the movie watchable. It is important to reject high expectations as this is a typical NETFLIX middleman who will give a good time to the TV screen but will quickly forget after viewing.The technical part of the movie looked pretty good. I quite liked the color palette. It is so gloomy and gray, which is why the atmosphere in the film itself was not very positive. The cinematographer's work is neat, the music doesn't get in the way, and the audio and video montages are good. There was no great WOW effect when looking at the outside of this movie, but there was nothing to complain about.Long-sighted Sam Worthington didn't make a big impression. He played it, it looked like a tree with no emotions. Somehow lately he has been showing the same acting and facial expression which makes it quite difficult to believe the characters he plays. He played in sublime roles... I don't even know who played there. All the actors around Sam played third-rate and completely unforgettable roles.Finally, do you want a simple, completely unoriginal, yet energetic thriller? This is this movie for you. It is ideally suited for slipping into the evening and resting from a busy day.",Fractured

The color grading, chill sounds, etc. Sets the mood from the starting.While I agree that none of the cast's performance is mesmerizing, maybe apart from the lead, but the movie makes up for it through its plot and twists. I will only talk about what has been laid out in the trailer. The way the movie unfolds after the disappearance of the mother-daughter duo is mind-blowing, quite similar to other movies in the genre. But what makes it stand apart is that the makers provide two distinct narratives which are so equally likely, that any could be true.

736,ninaczeszejko,"How Brad Anderson's ""Fractured"" Pretzels The Brain",7,23 April 2020,"Have you ever driven by a car pulled over on the side of a deserted road, casting a fleeting glimpse at the person inside? Fractured snatches that gaze and jerks you along, curling a fist around your beeping heart.Brad Anderson's 2019 Netflix thriller thrives on the very discomfort that might be seen as a flashing stop sign. As you are wrenched along for the ride, your brain sinks into the story on an eerily subconscious level. You find yourself repeatedly trying to peel away from the protagonist, terrified by how naturally your mind wears his clothes. Sugar-sweet empathy and yeasty protectiveness are thrashed around in the plot's mixer, kneaded into a dough of mistrust and salty rage. And as the tip of your blade whirls around to point at anyone within sight, your skull splits open from the whiplash. Second-guessing yourself to the point of madness. Consumed by the car crash of morality you are witnessing.The thriller follows Ray Monroe (Sam Worthington) as he and his wife Joanne (Lily Rabe) rush to the hospital after their daughter Peri (Lucy Capri) gets injured by the side of a country road on their way to the in-laws. From then onwards, we delve into the characters' punctured psyches, trying to uncover the truth behind their gruesome circumstances. We squirm from the hostility of the hospital staff and try to unscrew the lies that seem evident at every turn.We are faced with a plum-skinned setting, rare glimmers of light and shadows jumping off the sterile walls to crawl over the characters' faces. This creates a tone that keeps plunging us into the dusty recesses of the mind. Oxygen fizzles out of our banks of hope. Leash-tight musical notes in the background pacify our lungs. Make us gasp for our next breath as we keep on descending the levels of the building digesting Ray.The story itself is even twisted and fast-paced enough for us to overlook the painfully coiled concentration on Sam Worthington's face, which rarely shifts from one expression to the next.If we had only known that the driver of the pulled-over car would suck us into his mind, we probably wouldn't have slowed down. We find ourselves reeling, because the movie paints a much more uncertain world than the one we had existed in before. One of slavery to the brain and its inner-workings. As we finally escape, the world erupts in color. The black and white lines of morality have been smudged and we find ourselves labeling the shades of human nature anew.",Fractured

This Netflix original brings together a story with a mix of classic thriller familiarity such as shutter island with its own unique twist. It keeps you constantly second guessing just what the outcome truly is, you'll find yourself continually changing your outcome verdict with every new twist and turn throughout it's modest run time. The movie itself is shot in a bleak colour pallete, dull and dreary which fits perfectly within it's context. You'll find yourself on edge throughout various points in the movie over studying seemingly innocuous characters as the movie makes you second guess each and every moment if the plot you've thought up, is the right one is in fact, the right one. It's a joyride from start to finish for those looking for a thriller with added suspense and psychological games. Highly recommended for those who are into the Thriller/Suspense/Horroresque style of film and for a Netflix original it certainly delivers. Will it win any awards?

It was only confirmed more with the strange and unrealistic random laughing and jokes during the scenes with his wife. It also grated on me how the characters CONSTANTLY said how he's trying his best at being a good father/protector- it was all too predictable and obvious. If they hadn't repeated those lines and made the wife so weird and obviously disjointed then I would have questioned where the story was going. I feel if they'd gone down the line of a messed up hospital harbouring people's organs (which is what we're meant to originally wonder) then I'd have actually been more engaged.I can't fault the overall wording of the script itself, the pretty cinematography and the performances of the cast and those who haven't seen films like this before will probably enjoy this and rate it higher.

798,molliieanne,Underwhelming Ending,6,3 December 2019,"This film was brilliant...until the last ten minutes.*SPOILER*
The camera angles, lighting and variety of shots were very well done - especially after the accident first happened. It was very 'trippy' and the shots indicated that not everything was okay, that maybe Ray was experiencing some sort of trauma. Even when he was first in the hospital, the shots and angles, music and lighting and just the overall atmosphere implied that not everything was as it seemed which I found effective and clever.It kept me guessing throughout. There were many instances were I guessed wrong but the whole 'Abby' thing I thought was unnecessary and my guesses were all linked to her. I understand that because he's already lost somebody that he loved, losing somebody again made him go insane but I just thought the constant mentioning of Abby for her to have minuscule to do with the ending made the whole thing feel a little underwhelming. I think if she wasn't a part of the story at all and there wasn't any mention of a previous partner who he had lost, it wouldn't have made any difference to the story.I also felt very neutral towards Ray. I wasn't exactly rooting for him nor any of the characters. I just wanted to know what happened but not in any emotive sense, just out of curiosity.I even rewatched the ending a couple of times and googled 'fractured ending explained' because I thought it was such an underwhelming ending that I surely must have missed something, but I hadn't.Overall, entertaining film but I wouldn't write home about it. Worth a watch to kill some time, acting was very good and the story was okay. I just felt that some details were unnecessary and made for an ending that had little impact.",Fractured

I was highly disturbed by some moments. Found myself nervous(excited?) a lot of times. Acting is great. The writing of the movie is great. Effects and sounds definitely add to the movie's quality. I found Sam Worthington to be very creepy so I will make sure to watch some cartoons before bed, so I prevent myself from having dreams about him.
I thought I had it all figured out. Then I didn't. Then I thought I knew what's going on. I was mistaken again but I kept thinking about all the little hints from beginning to end.As a movie and entertainment for people who enjoy thrillers, this is a good movie to watch. It will keep you on your toes.Ending:
For the ending, I did not expect a happy end obviously. That's the main reason I kept watching it!?!
I figured something was off, and I was still curious enough to finish the movie. If you want to watch happy ending, I suggest you watch a romantic comedy.I also suggest you watch this with a man if you are a woman. I'm still thinking about some parts of the movie that just didn't sit well with me and my stomach.

You'd have thought the car accident would have been the catalyst for such a change in personality but if so, when did he get together with his second wife? Before his first wife died???For me, that is the only mystery to the film, although it's more of a plot hole than a mystery I guess.It was pretty transparent from 'the fall' that the man had a head injury and was hallucinating as a result.Also, in real life, if someone suffers a head injury in an accident, you'd think they'd be 'cared for' in the hospital.

However, I found the story to be very predictable, some people like predictable films but I'm not a huge fan; takes out the suspense.This film felt to me like an amateur Shutter Island in a way, I think what made it predictive was the obvious clues (when he shuts his eyes and the music changes, therapist literally spoiling the ending (kinda)) aswell as the evidence for the hospital being a coverup fell short (tapes not showing the wife and daughter) they could've gotten around this by making the police more suspicious or someone that believed him, which would confuse the viewer in to who's to trust.Overall though I thought this was a decent film, it's worth a watch if you like short thrillers, though if you want a really good one I've got to point you towards Shutter Island.",Fractured

Most of the conversations in the hospital are with the dad only wich is a huge give away.But to us the most annoying part about the movie was that in the first half of the movie they were trying so hard to make it suspenseful that it was actually laughable. The annoying 'scary' music when nothing has really happened yet, when you don't even know the characters or storyline yet is what made me and my husband laugh at the beginning of the film.. plus one of the agents and the security guard at the hospital were acting very unprofessional, and made it quite unbelievable.

Ok so i was going to watch this movie thinking it would be a good one, but i forgot Netflix lowered their standards or something because they are regurally making bad or bland movies, and guess what, this was one of them, the music was something that you would get from a cheap mobile game (like granny), what i mean by this is that the music in the film is literally just someone playing random keys on a piano and stopping just whenever he/she/it wants, also the music tries tomake you feel scared by doing this, but it actually will be more painfull rather than scary.
Plus the movie is full of twist and twist and twist that try to make you feal dumb by making you speculate a bunch of theories then discarding those theories and making you think those theories were actually right but guess what, they weren't.

Been looking for a nice twist since Shutter Island and this was it.",Fractured
919,husnain-98132,A film that makes one too many mistakes.,5,13 March 2021,"From the very beginning of the film the director draws us to the main character of Ray - continually having the camera focus up close on him. The first 40 minutes of the film are paced very slowly - making it incredibly boring - the pacing in this film as a whole is very problematic. The main scene of the film where Ray's daughter Perry falls and Ray leaps forward to catch her show us already that maybe Ray isn't thinking straight due to the flash between what is happening (this is only 20 or so minutes into the film) - the director has practically given away the ending of the film at this point - however he/she does do a semi decent job as shifting the suspicion on to the hospital. The major fallback here is that the director then proceeds to switch this suspicion between rays insanity and or something being wrong with the hospital a good 5/6 times - as a whole though this does keep the viewer hooked - however this is only after the 40 most slow paced minutes I have ever seen in a film. Those 40 minutes most definitely could have been condensed and the majority of it does look like it has purposely been incorporated into the film as filler.
The major issue I have with this film is the constant plot holes throughout the film and its blatant unrealism. This film could be compared to Christopher Nolan's memento as both follow the protagonist on a journey in which we think they are the ones in the right and everyone else is out to get them and yet in actual fact they are the ones who are insane. I bring this up as Memento is an example of what this film could have been had It been done right.
Throughout the film Ray's first wife Abbie is mentioned - who is said to have died in a car accident. Heavy focus is put on Abbie and flashback scenes are displayed recurrently throughout the film yet her character has no significance to the plot and instead she is just a very weak excuse to explain Ray's insanity. The director does such an awful job at trying to convey this connection that he might as well not mentioned nor included her character in the film as it legitimately adds no value to the film whatsoever instead working as filler.
I previously mentioned the realism of this film - something which is very important in the film making process as it allows the viewer to be drawn into the film and relate to it. Even if the film is about something as unreal as aliens - the factor of relatability keeps the viewer drawn as something like this could happen in real life. Fractured gets this all wrong. For one two police officers casually follow a man who is portrayed to be insane into the hospital and take his word that the hospital is doing something diabolical. The actress playing the female police officer delivers her dialogue akin to a robot and the actor playing the male police officer talks as if he is from the hood - something which is very out of tone for the film and very unrealistic. They then somehow manage to call for backup to investigate where Ray's daughter fell in the span of minutes for a crime which has technically not even been filed.
This is made worse by the fact that we are randomly introduced to a therapist who seemingly works at the hospital with no context whatsoever. She then takes charge and tells the police to go to where Rays daughter fell - as that would definitely be how it would go down in real life.
All in all there is a plethora of other issues similar to the ones I have mentioned and they make the film feel mediocre and unmemorable at most.
Psychological thrillers can often get away with making multiple mistakes due to their irregular plots but this films makes one too many.",Fractured

Theeeen it's all fake and he imagined it's his family blah blah he killed his wife and stole a random guy. It's so stupid. I was so excited about the secret evil hospital and how he rescued his wife and kid. It would have been an amazing movie if they just stopped there. It was really really bad afterwards. I rated it a 5 because the rest of the movie was a 9-10 but that last few minutes was a 1. The unhelpful doctors you hated the whole time were actually just boring neutral characters? I don't care. I wanted to see bad doctors and a man escape with his family. If I could I'd like to make a copy of this movie and clip the last few minutes out to show it to friends.

921,kweechristopher,A Great Thriller,9,16 March 2021,"This movie is a great thriller, what makes this movie great is about the storyline and twist in the end of the movie. This is one of the movie that will make your brain work as you watch the movie. it makes you try to guess what is gonna happen next, it makes you create theories on how it will end and makes you change your theories as the movie keeps going on.This story centers around Ray Monroe (Sam Worthington). He, his wife and 6 year old daughter are returning home on a desolate farm road, after celebrating Thanksgiving with his wife parents. We learn early on that Ray and his wife are having difficulties in their relationship. The family stops at a rest area where a tragic accident takes place. It's apparent that Ray's mind fractures from the occurring events that have taken place. We also learn that this is Ray's second marriage. His first marriage ended tragically with the death of his wife and unborn child. As the story progresses, we watch a desperate and determined Ray do all he can to make things right for his family and himself.Sam Worthington did an amazing job, his acting was perfect, the way he speaks claiming that he is not crazy (when he actually is) is just spectacular. Also the story is told that way because we are looking at what the main character is living, we only see his perspective that's why it's so disorganised.Overall, this is a great movie but it has some messy events that will make us confused. In my opinion, I enjoy the messiness of the movie because this movie is from the main characters point of view and it should be messy because he was going insane.

And this writer should be given any projects thrown his or her way.
To let a writer this untalented take up valuable space for others that actually knows how to write decent or even good screenplays is appalling.1. This movie insults everyone that's been injured and a victim of medical negligence.
It makes out the patient to look like a lunatic.2. It creates stigma for people with illnesses and psychological issues as it by the end switches narrative completely.3. The actual storyline lacks logic. By the end when the narrative is switched, you can't backtrack logically to the events from the other point of view.
It does not make any sense and the story as it's shown by the end makes the entire movie not only a complete mess with bad writing, it changes the narrative of the entire movie and the events that happened in the beginning of the movie don't make any sense.4. The setting of this movie is extremely boring. It's 3 scenes in the entire movie, road with gas station, construction site and hospital.5. The entire movie felt like one person had written a story 90% finished, then a lazy intern that haven't watched many movies wants to ""shock"" viewers but does not have the skills to pull of that kind of writing. So it feels like someone else wrote the last 15 minutes and did it very badly as it ruins the logic for the entire movie.6. I will give the actors 1 stars because they are the only thing good in this movie, but for their careers I'm sad the associates themselves with such a bad project.7. I'm extremely disappointed in Netflix, this is the patriarchy that only hires men to do rubbish projects. It's obvious a women did not write this crappy screenplay. Only someone very immature would write this badly.
Thanks but no thanks!",Fractured

985,aristaako,I shouldn't have bothered,4,24 November 2019,"I liked the premise. The synopsis on Netflix made me interested. It wasn't really original idea, but interesting anyways. Before watching, I checked the rating here (at the time 6.3) and I thought I probably should not waste my time on this. But as it happens, I checked the user reviews. I only looked at the rating and the titles and those things said things like ""Don't believe the rating"".I was puzzled. Should I trust the rating what the ""most helpful"" user reviews said. I didn't spend any time looking through how those who had given reviews, review other films. Back in the days when wasn't as popular as today, I had the feeling that  rating was accurate. Lately I've seen really bad movies get good ratings, so there's a possibility that the rating was biased or somehow flawed. So I made the decision to watch the movie.After the first 10 minutes I couldn't believe the amount of over acting I had just witnessed. Characters felt clumsy and the supposedly clever mysteries made me face palm every other minute. But I kept watching. I shouldn't have. I mean the main idea of the plot is ok. The execution not so much. People act extremely unnaturally, especially the ones working in the hospital or with the police. Main guy is so delirious that no one should bother listen to him talk like that. But if they had done the one thing professionals should do, the movie would've been over. If anyone had talked through the situation with care, it would've been the end. Unfortunately not. I had to watch through the unbearable dialogue and even when I felt like I should stop, I didn't. It was so predictable and I simply kept hoping that it wouldn't end with the ""clever"" twist.If you haven't read any books and this is the first movie you are going to see, then fine, you'll probably enjoy it. To everyone else: stay away. This will only make you spend 100 minutes with bad acting and stupid, unbelievable plot points. Life is too short for movies like this.",Fractured

Would have loved to know what the budget was, because they spared no expense on the action scenes, and the cinematography and editing were excellent. The script was decent and the acting superb. This movie had a bit of ""Twin Peaks"" and ""Twilight Zone"" going on, which I loved. The story was a tiny bit far-fetched, but not totally implausible til the very end, when Sam Worthington's character busts out of the hospital and ""saves"" his family. It could have been sooooo much juicier to have discovered an illegal organ harvesting operation, but then there would have been no way to end the movie. Sam Worthington's facial expression during the final seconds of the film was priceless.

1050,jgilmore-53094,Plots are cool till they are not,2,21 August 2021,"I give this movie a 2 star for one reason only: the movie had a great plot going till the end. Since 95% of it was good I won't give it a 1 star.Everyone, that I see, is saying that the ending is a twist. But the movie is absolutely predictable. The movie throws smoke screens, red herrings, and others to through you off and keep you guessing. To keep you from being absolutely sure you understand what it going on. The difficulty is that this movie had only 1 of 2 ways to end it.1. He's crazy. Now this would be where it is nuanced right. Did he fabricate his wife and daughters death? Or does he truly believe that they are alive? Either way this was a possible ending.2. The hospital was in fact doing something nefarious. This also could have been nuanced different ways. We're they selling organs on the black market? (Sounds odd but Im sure it could
Happen) or were they even run by a cult? Maybe they were slave traders who took children and women and sold them? These are far fetched but could still be great plot devices.Now which sounds more difficult to write a good story on? The second, and that is why this movie missed the mark. The potential for this movie was not in a cliche twist that the main character was crazy. This was done in a shutter island, and it was a genuine twist. However, we are lead to believe from the beginning that he is crazy... now this is not bad because the movie is also trying to convince us that he is right. So which is it? That's the question the movie wants us to consider. Great. I'm on board. But unfortunate they had to pick one and they picked the one with the easiest ending.Having him be crazy is so easy to write. Yes I say this as an amateur critic but I believe this to be true. For the sake of brevity I would just say that this kind of movie has been done before, and to go back and show his fabricated perspective mixed with reality is not hard to do.But do you know what is hard? Coming up with a good and brilliantly sinister scenario in which a hospital is harvesting organs illegally. Could this have been unbelievable and ridiculous? Yes. But it could have been fascinating, and interesting to see why and how they were able to fabricate a fake narrative for Ray. It could have been incredible to see a dad and husband fight mentally, physically, emotionally, and faithfully for his family. And for him to expose this wicked nefarious institution.That's not what we got though. We got the lazy ending. I'm still not sure if the places where I saw plot holes are truly plot holes. I could be missing details that would vindicate the movies ending. Regardless, the mystery that was causing me to want to know more was not if he was crazy. I kept wondering: ""why would a hospital do this?"" The mystery was the hospital, the workers, the town, and his interactions with the workers. It was not whether or not they were real. See in shutter island the main character didn't make up his reality. It was truly fabricated. That's what gave substance to the twist. But in Fractured his reality was fake? My point is that I was not mad about the ending to shutter island and I am about his movie, but they have the same ending. So why is one good and one bad?As I said, I wanted a movie that was captivating and thrilling. One ending would have delivered on that in my opinion. The other would have felt cliche, obvious and lazy. Unfortunately the writers of the movie chose the latter.",Fractured

The viewer is led to believe that the hospital kidnapped Ray's wife Joann, his daughter ""Peri,"" and other patients to harvest their organs. This would have been a great story if they'd just stayed with it. Instead, at the end, we find out that Ray killed Joann and Peri, then just went crazy and imagined the rest. So unoriginal....boo!!!I am sick of Hollywood regurgitating this same idiotic cliche as a ""twist"" in movies. Had I known that was where the story was going, I wouldn't have wasted my time watching this steaming pile of horse manure. So don't waste yours, unless you like that trite ending of everything being in the main character's head. Now on the other hand, if you loved that ""St. Elsewhere"" was all the in the mind of an autistic boy, that ""Identity'' was all in the imagination of a crazy man, and the similar line of poppycock served up at the end of ""The Secret Window,"" then by all means, watch and enjoy this recycled rubbish.It's all in the main character's head.
