0,TheLittleSongbird,"Very bad, as an adaptation and on its own terms",3,9 May 2015,"There are worse movies out there than Doom, which despite being very bad overall has a few things that stop it from being unwatchable. The photography is more than decent, the film is shot with style and is appropriately claustrophobic in places. Clint Mansell's score does pulsate with energy and generates some tension. Richard Brake gives the best performance in the movie, he actually looked as if he was enjoying himself, while the highlight was the First Person Shooter sequence which was great fun.On the other hand, Doom to me really was as bad as its reputation. Some have said that most of the negative reviews have come from fans of the game disappointed with how Doom adapted it. That is sort of true, and as an adaptation it is easy to see why it disappointed fans, but other negative reviews have come from those who have judged Doom as a standalone and have little knowledge of the game. While Doom is one of those movies that was left wanting on its own terms, it does have far bigger problems than being a naff adaptation of an intriguing and quite compelling game.Starting with listing what's wrong with Doom, obvious starting points would be the script and the story. The script is just horrible, with dialogue so awkwardly corny that it's enough to make the toes curl and some of it sounded like the writers had no idea what they were writing because it made little sense, Rosamund Pike getting the worst of it. Doom's story is paper-thin, to the point that it can be mistaken for not having one at all, and borderline incoherent in places. Not to mention sluggishly paced, especially the first half, and lacking in any kind of originality. The main plot-line of the game, which had a far better premise, is omitted and replaced with one about viruses and mutated monsters, an interesting idea but one where nowhere near enough was done with it, so it all felt underdeveloped and the main reason for why everything wasn't as cohesive. The action is far too dimly lit which made it difficult to follow and was both chaotic and dull, with none of the taut suspense, enthusiasm and intensity that you'd expect. There's a lot of violence, and not only was it overused but it was gratuitous and cheap-looking.Photography aside, the production values while not terrible could have been better. The movie throughout is far too dimly lit, particularly bad in the action sequences, the sets could have been more imaginative and the monsters were disadvantaged by looking like cheap-looking rubber suits and not being on screen for long enough, which diminished any sense of threat they could have had. Doom is flatly directed with little sense of enthusiasm, the characters are cardboard cut-outs(John Grimm/Reaper was the closest to having anything even resembling a back-story and even that was not explored enough and felt overwrought) and the acting is poor. Razzie-nominated Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson gives a flat central performance, Karl Urban scowls his way through his role to the point it was one-dimensional and overdone and the usually dependable Rosamund Pike is by far at her blandest.In conclusion, as an adaptation and as a standalone Doom, while a long from the worst movie ever or one of the worst, was very bad. 3/10 Bethany Cox",Doom
1,Leofwine_draca,"No masterpiece, but it's quite fun",6,27 June 2016,"Neither as bad as I had feared or as good as I had hoped, DOOM is a film that veers between being pretty good and only okay. It's a darn sight better than other modern Hollywood pap like the first two RESIDENT EVIL movies, which is a plus, but the movie has plenty of clichés and is too obviously modelled on ALIENS rather than the game itself; over the past two decades, we've had about a hundred of these ""soldiers walking down corridors""-type science fiction films, and it really is enough. Still, DOOM ticks all of the right boxes, with a particular emphasis on the horror; there are zombies here (a little silly and disappointing though), monsters, bloodshed, and lots of jumpy sequences.I'm a massive fan of the game series, and I was aware that this film did stray away from the game quite a lot. Still, the inclusion of game elements like the chainsaw, the BFG, and the pink demon are fun, and the first-person shooter sequence, which lasts for about ten minutes at the end of the film, is fun, if a little cheesy. Watching as a gun goes around shooting zombies and then a chainsaw sawing up a monster is good, gruesome fun; the camera-work is far from fluid, though, and as a whole the sequence pales in comparison to a similar moment in the Thai action flick BORN TO FIGHT.The cast is one of the film's strengths. Karl Urban puts in yet another good performance; honestly, he's been great in everything he's done since LORD OF THE RINGS, and I'm looking forward to his next film, PATHFINDER. The Rock has a little deeper character than you might expect, far from being the one-dimensional marine hero that the film introduces him as; his character's twist makes for one of the film's most involving moments. Lower down the cast list, the performances are strong as well. It's great to see Dexter Fletcher in a Hollywood movie, and he makes the best of his kooky, wheelchair-bound role; he also delivers the film's best line, ""There's something behind me, isn't there!"" Richard Brake (the parent-killer in BATMAN BEGINS) also puts in a good turn as a nasty soldier. Sadly, Rosamund Pike is the film's weakest link, incredibly wooden and miscast as a scientist.The film's special effects are fantastic; the monsters look really good and gruesome and there's fun to be had from portal doorways and the BFG blasts. It's just a shame that the monsters are seen so little on screen; 90% of the action takes place in really dark corridors, so your eyes end up straining to try and make out what's going on. Still, the movie does pack plenty of incident into the running time, there are some fun twists and turns that make it stand out, and fans of the game will have fun. Not a masterpiece, but an enjoyable film all the same.",Doom
2,SnoopyStyle,action without interest,4,23 August 2015,"A research facility on Mars is placed under quarantine following a distress call from Dr. Todd Carmack. Space marines led by Asher ""Sarge"" Mahonin (Dwayne Johnson) are sent on a search-and-destroy mission tasked to recover USC property. Staff Sergeant John ""Reaper"" Grimm (Karl Urban) joins his sister Dr. Samantha Grimm (Rosamund Pike) to salvage her work. Sarge leads a group to the weapons lab. Samantha had reopened the dig that cost their parents' lives.It's an action movie without a compelling plot or interesting characters. It takes a bit too long to get to the action. The opening scenes could have been a great horror sequence. The first person shooter scene is interesting but limited. The lighting is also too dark. The all black combat gear probably added to the darkness. This movie could be a good horror or a good action thriller. It's neither.",Doom
3,Prismark10,Trouble on Mars,5,5 May 2015,"Adaptations of video games is littered with casualties from misfires. Super Mario Brothers being an early victim of a misconceived enterprise which needed more than super plumbers to fix a clogged up script.Doom may not be perfect but at least realises that you need more deliver more than a good story to adapt a hit video game. Fans demand mindless action just like the games.Set in 2026 The Rock is in charge of a heavily armed tactical unit sent to Mars via a portal to investigate what has gone wrong in a research laboratory near an archaeological dig. These Marines also has Karl Urban whose sister, Rosamund Pike also happens to be a researcher.It looks like something has infected the scientists and turned them to homicidal zombie types. There is plenty of gore, suspense, some jokes and by the end arcade type action as if the director wants to replicate a video game style.Its not a deep film, the script is paper thin. The acting is no great shakes but it still manages to be one of the better types of the genre.",Doom

A team of Marines, leaded by Sarge (The Rock), is assigned to rescue the personnel and retrieve the research data, with the support of Dr. Samantha Grimm (Rosamund Pike), the twin sister of the Marine John ""Reaper"" Grimm (Karl Urban). While in the mission, Samantha finds a dark hidden secret about the monsters and the researches.""Doom"" is another sci-fi action movie based on a famous video game, and does not disappoint. The story is forgettable, this film will never be nominated to any festival, but really entertains, with many monsters, special effects, DTS audio, shootings and blows.

5,Sleepin_Dragon,You get what you expect to.,6,3 April 2020,"Based on a game, starring The Rock, it does what it sets out to do, it entertains, and provides you with enough action to keep you drawn in.Johnson does what he needs to do, and fair play to him he's pretty good, the standout is Urban, who smoulders his way through the film, those two are good, the rest unfortunate are poor, I didn't rate anyone else here.At times you're confused if you're watching a movie or game action.You know what to expect, expect little, and you may enjoy it. 6/10.",Doom
6,jboothmillard,Doom,3,1 December 2010,"The first Resident Evil and Alien vs. Predator are the only good examples I can think of when someone mentions video game based films, and this was I suppose quite an anticipated one, from director Andrzej Bartkowiak (Romeo Must Die). Basically humanity has successfully managed to create a colony on Mars, and there is a research facility where scientists are experimenting on the planet's substances and humans like guinea pigs. But something in the experiment went wrong, and the all research has ceased with the facility being placed under level five quarantine. Dr. Samantha Grimm (Die Another Day's Rosamund Pike) has called in an elite squad of soldiers, led by Sarge (Razzie nominated Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson), with twin brother John 'Reaper' Grimm (The Lord of the Rings Trilogy's Karl Urban) as part of the team, to investigate. Starting on Earth they are able to teleport to Mars via the system called the ""Arch"", and the marines slowly go through the facilities checking for all abnormalities. Soon enough the reason for everything going wrong comes to life, the experimentation has caused any people involved to turn into hideous alien creatures and monsters hell bent on eating, killing and destroying. One by one the soldiers are being killed off, and the increasingly angered Sarge is refusing to call for back up and to do whatever it takes to kill these things, of course he is victim to it himself. It comes to the point when Reaper and his sister are the only ones left alive, and like the video game there are about five minutes of joy stick style point of view shooting at the evil by him, until they escape. Also starring Deobia Oparei as Destroyer, Ben Daniels as Goat, Razaaq Adoti as Duke, Richard Brake as Corporal Dean Portman, Al Weaver as The Kid, Dexter Fletcher as Pinky and Yao Chin as Mac. The special effects are naff, the cast, especially Johnson, are one-dimensional, and the only good bit is the joy stick style moment, which was obviously put in for the fans, but the rest is boring and silly, a pretty terrible science-fiction action horror. Adequate!",Doom

8,BA_Harrison,"Guns, mutants and gore!",6,28 June 2006,"Having never played the game, I cannot say whether the cinematic realisation of Doom remains faithful to the source material or not; the movie sure has the look and feel of a computer game, with it's claustrophobic settings, one dimensional characters, and graphic violence. It even boasts a sequence filmed in first person shooter style, the gun shooting and reloading in the foreground as the enemy leaps from the shadows.Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson plays Sarge, the leader of an elite team of marines sent to Mars to wipe out a bunch of hideous monsters that have taken over a scientific complex. These creatures are in fact the results of genetic experiments gone wrong; the boffins in the complex have added a twenty-fourth pair of chromosomes (found in the remains of a martian) to the human DNA strand with disastrous results. Instead of imbuing the recipient with amazing powers as intended (such as super strength and the rapid regeneration of tissue), the human guinea pigscriminals condemned to deathhave turned into grotesque killing machines...The 'extended' version that I saw on DVD clocked in at 108 minutes. With plot development taking up only a tiny fraction of this running time, an awful lot of wandering round dark corridors and crawling through tunnels takes place. It's a good job that the meandering of the marines through poorly lit locales is broken up with some nifty action and a fair smattering of gore; the guns the marines carry are suitably big and the nicely realised CGI crittersall teeth and clawsare sufficiently creepy.Whilst not a great film, Doom is enjoyable enough fluff to keep an undemanding action fan happy for the duration. Let's face it, for a film based on a game, it could've been a whole lot worseUwe Boll might have directed it!",Doom
9,paul_haakonsen,"Actually good, considering it's based on a computer game...",6,13 April 2020,"Granted this 2005 movie, while having an impressive cast list, is based on a computer game. And that alone already puts up a hindrance for the movie to be successful. But still, this movie warrants a viewing or two. In fact, I've seen it three times by now.While ""Doom"" is by no means a groundbreaking or innovative movie in any way, it actually provides adequate entertainment for what it turned out to be. This is an action sci-fi movie, pure and simple. Just disconnect your brain, sit back and enjoy the action and the testosterone on the screen.The special effects in the movie were good, and actually still prove to be now in 2020 - 15 years after the movie initially came out.What works for the movie, aside from the special effects and the atmosphere, is the cast ensemble, which includes the likes of Karl Urban, Rosamund Pike, Dwayne Johnson and Richard Brake.""Doom"" have been getting a lot of grief over the years, but I actually find it to be an adequately entertaining movie. Not rocket science, but entertainment as a movie is intended to provide.The segment towards the end of the movie, where you watch the things unfold from a first person point of view - just like it the ""Doom"" games - was actually entertaining. I liked that part actually.My rating of ""Doom"" is a six out of ten stars. And yeah, I enjoyed watching the movie, and I am not one of the nay-sayers that hate the movie.",Doom
10,BandSAboutMovies,Respawn this...,5,29 January 2018,"Andrzej Bartkowiak has been the cinematographer on three films that were nominated for Best Picture Academy Awards: The Verdict, Terms of Endearment and Prizzi's Honor. But he may be better known for his films that combined hip-hop and action, like Cradle 2 the Grave, Exit Wounds and Romeo Must Die. He's also been behind two video game films: Doom and Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li.That said, Time selected this as one of the top 10 worst video game movies, along with House of the Dead, Wing Commander, In the Name of the King, Hitman, BloodRayne, Resident Evil: Apocalypse, Double Dragon, Street Fighter and Super Mario Brothers. Trust me -- it's not that bad. And films like this (and a few others on the list) don't belong in the same wastebin as Uwe Boll films.After a Mars research station is attacked, Dr. Todd Carmack sends a distress call that is answered by a team of Marines, led by Asher ""Sarge"" Mahonin (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson). John ""Reaper"" Grimm (Karl Urban, Dredd) and his sister, Dr. Samantha (Rosamund Pike, star of Becca's go to DVD, Gone Girl) are there to retrieve critical info before the base is destroyed. We learn that they were born on Mars and their parents were killed here. All that remained after their accident were skeletons of genetically enhanced humans.Of course, all hell breaks loose -- literally. Demonic monsters attack, The Rock ends up being the bad guy, innocent people get killed, a long first-person sequence happens and there's plenty of action. Seriously, the movie is short on story and long on special effects and gore. It's like an Alien movie without the xenomorphs, I guess. Or much excitement. It's competently made, but an hour after it was over and I started writing this, all I could remember that I enjoyed was that the Rock played against his usual character and that Karl Urban got to be the hero.",Doom
11,Coventry,"YEAH MAN! Big guns, monsters, zombies and ... stuff!",5,16 July 2006,"Personally, I never played any type of video game in my entire life, but I can easily see why ""Doom"" is a favorite among avid fans. So, I can't really tell how great this film is compared to the game (or vice versa), but I do know that this thing has got fancy big guns, loads of gory monsters, rough zombie-action, hi-tech doors that make cool sounds when they close and dubious Martian scientists. It also has an ultra-thin storyline that isn't hard to follow at all, so this means there's even more time to focus on violent shootouts and visual tricks. The years is 2026 and Mr. The Rock is in charge of the Rapid Response Tactical Squad; a group of macho-mariners that are called to planet Mars for a dangerous secret mission. These squad-members call themselves names like ""Reaper"" or ""Destroyer"" so you just know that they're not traveling to the Red Planet to attend local poetry evenings! Mars can be reached through a portal in the Nevada Desert and basically just exists of laboratories and scientific research centers. Several of the scientists have disappeared lately and the R.R.T.S. have to investigate. They soon discover that evil Martian forces take possession of people, turn them into zombies and subsequently into hideous monsters. Nice! As a movie, ""Doom"" is obviously a weaker version of Sci-Fi/Action classics like ""Aliens"" or ""Predator"", but it's still tremendous fun and the violence is often effectively gruesome, with torn apart torsos and raw decapitations. Then, near the end, comes the infamous ""First Shooter Person Perspective"" climax and I must say I loved that! As said before, I'm not familiar with the exiting feeling you get when you're playing survival-video games like this, but ""Doom"" made me understand it more. The Rock is decent (his acting skills have clearly improved a lot since ""The Scorpion King"") and Karl Urban is surprisingly likable. The least you can say is that we owe an apology to Andrzej Bartkowiak, because we all expected this movie to be a lot worse and said skeptical things about it before we even saw it.",Doom
12,michaelRokeefe,Trouble on Mars...call in the Marines.,7,20 April 2006,"Computer gamers get your freak on. Doom explodes on the silver screen. In 2026, there is a frantic call for help from a research station in the Nevada desert on Mars. Something has gone wrong...communications have faded to white noise. A special team of mercenary Marines led by 'The Sarge'(The Rock)and John Grimm(Karl Urban), armed to the hilt, get the mission to quarantine the research station and adjoining archaeological dig. Found alive is Grimm's sister Samantha(Rosamund Pike), a researcher trying to download important info before it gets destroyed. Lurking in the dank and dark are huge creatures killing at will. After losing most of the team, the heavy artillery is brought out and DNA is splattered in every possible direction.Special effects are great. Uncensored gore, raw and stomach turning is riveting. Rapid and abundant gunfire from awesome weaponry is highly effective. Also in the cast: Ben Daniels, Richard Brake, Robert Russell, Razaaq Adoti and Yao Chin.",Doom
13,Scarecrow-88,Doom,6,23 November 2010,"Marines are sent to an alien world(where an archaeological dig had commenced)to find out what happened to a genetic research team. Sarge(Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) and his boys find themselves in a whole heap of trouble, having to contend with large monsters whose tongues leaves an infection in the necks of victims, in turn causing them to mutate as well. John Grimm(Karl Urban), one of Sarge's men, is the twin brother to an archaeologist, Samantha(Rosamund Pike, some much needed beauty to go with the brawn) who works with the team to get answers as to what happened to the scientists.Darkened corridors, steel steps, stone walls aligned with long, never ending pipes, steam, blue light, with alien creatures somewhere lurking as soldiers search for what happened to a team of scientists..sound familiar? As you would expect, the soldiers are ""doomed"" to be picked off one by one until a minor few remain. In this particular video-game inspired sci-fi actioner, when the scientists are bitten(as we soon see with the soldiers)they slowly metamorphose into something beyond human, with a voracious, unhinged appetite. What would a movie such as this be without our heroes having to go into the sewer system to seek a dangerous threat? And you have to have at least one scene where a soldier's flashlight goes out so that he becomes vulnerable to attack. Being the action adrenaline junkie that I unabashedly am, seeing the Rock enter an ""advanced weaponry"" room using a scientist's severed arm's hand in order to gain access so he could find a state-of-the-art BFG(Big F#cking Gun)was thoroughly cool..as was the mutated monster human autopsy(can someone say, THE THING)where Sam discovers that the creatures are actually the missing scientists turned hideous and unrecognizable.As we are accustomed to seeing and expecting in these types of films(seriously, there's a reason many of us keep returning to them time and again, despite the usual formula aspects and clichéd muscle-heads with potty-mouths, Kevlar suits, and multi-round machine guns), scientists, conducting ""superhuman"" genetic experiments to create the ultimate killing machines, give birth to something right out of a nightmare. It's all about an extra chromosome, uncovered when forensic archeology/anthropology found the skeletal remains of a species who had 24 chromosomes unlike humans with only 23. DOOM does get pretty wild when The Rock, as the commanding officer of the tactical team sent in to rescue the missing scientists, goes psychopathic, killing innocent people so he can quarantine the area so that nothing gets to earth. When he shoots one of his own officers due to ""mutinous insurrection"", all bets are off. When Sam realizes that not all who are infected become mutated, she may be able to save her brother when he is gut shot during a shootout with human monsters. There's a lengthly tribute to the game when the camera goes point-of-view full tilt when Karl Urban awakens, moving through halls and rooms looking for his sister. And obviously you couldn't close such a movie as DOOM without Urban and The Rock in an exchange of fisticuffs and wire-fu, hurling each other in the air and pummeling one another with intense force. Looking for brains instead of brawn, don't waste your time because DOOM is all about style, visual effects, and ultra-violence, geared towards fans of the game and sci-fi horror(just enough science to allow the plot its vicious monstrosities to run amok causing absolute mayhem). The whole ""portal to ancient city of Marscourtesy of a spot in Arizona"" angle is a bit too much, but the plot has to get our heroes from point A to B somehow..",Doom

A team member named ""Reaper"" (Karl Urban, ""Dredd"") has a personal stake in the mission since his sister Samantha (gorgeous Rosamund Pike (""Gone Girl""), appealing as always) is one of those scientists.For yet another sci-fi / horror / action picture in the mold of features like ""Aliens"" and ""Resident Evil"", ""Doom"" is not really the terrible waste of time that it's reputed to be. It's a fair example of its type, if somewhat overextended at close to two hours. It serves up violence, gore, formidable creatures, high tech sets, lots of digital FX, some atmosphere, and some moody lighting by cinematographer Tony Pierce-Roberts. The script is formulaic and predictable, with some dopey lines, but then, most people don't watch this sort of thing for the story. You can certainly tell it's based on a video game - especially towards the end, where it gets positively goofy.Much of the cast may have been better utilized in other projects before and since, but they give admirably straight-faced performances playing pretty typical characters for the genre. Richard Brake (""31"") tends to steal his scenes as the rather smarmy soldier Portman. Dexter Fletcher (director of ""Rocketman"") is amusing as a character named Pinky who has no lower half, Deobia Oparei (""Alien 3"") has a solid screen presence as a soldier with the memorable moniker of ""Destroyer""), and Dwayne Johnson (back when he was still getting billed as The Rock) is typically solid as a no-nonsense, all-business team leader.All in all, this is watchable enough. Players of the game may consider it a disappointment as an adaptation, but people simply looking for a lot of noise and violence and who aren't too demanding will probably be adequately entertained.Five out of 10.",Doom

The game was a first person shoot 'em up that was fun to play. This is a ""story"" we have to watch and is sleep inducing.I know I shouldn't have expected anything going in, but I thought, perhaps, maybe,if the planets were in alignment I would have a guilty pleasure popcorn film. Instead I got exactly what I hoped I wouldn't, the cinematic equivalent of watching some one play a video game I couldn't take part in.Its well made on a technical level, and the actors are okay, in a TV movie sort of way, but there are no characters and there is nothing in the way of plot beyond the look for monsters and shoot them before being eaten. Granted this is an exact replication of the game, but at least in the game you controlled the action, in the game you had a stake if people lived or died. Here there is nothing but passive viewing. Sure you can ooo and ahh at the visuals, but you can't control the action so you are forced to watch the actors do things which you know are stupid. Frankly I'd rather be playing the game than watching this movie.This is a movie thats all form over substance. If you like that sort of thing, try it.

It relies upon the viewer having seen some of the other movies it borrows elements from, particularly Aliens, and jumps right into the action as quickly as possible. Despite this, it actually is watchable and entertaining on a certain brainless level. The likable cast helps a lot, though their characters are all one-dimensional.

18,zardoz-13,"""Doom"" Lives Up To Its Title",7,19 June 2007,"As the latest entry in the video game inspired action movie genre, ""Doom"" (* out of ****) more than lives up to its nihilistic promise. Nothing about director Andrzej Bartkowski's tame science fiction thriller proves either original or exciting. Basically, the monsters amount to genetically mutated humanoids that not only appear ghoulish (what glimpses we catch of them) but also whose skeletal carcasses are covered with raspberry jam-like gore. In other words, the people that made ""Doom"" settled for lowest common denominator chills. Exotic alien predators don't prowl this mediocre melodrama that ranks as an all new career low for former WWE wrestling champ Dwayne 'the Rock' Johnson. Okay, these monsters might frighten those under age twelve or women dragged to this drivel on a date, but blood & terror gorehounds will yawn at these murderous, run-of-the-mill fiends. For the record, these carnivores consist of either ancient Martians or zombies. Nevertheless, ""Doom"" rightly deserved its R-rating for the amounts of blood, gore, and mayhem that saturate its occasionally atmospheric but wholly predictable plot. No, this dull, formulaic movie won't induce nightmares. Based on the popular first-person shooter video game where players assume the identity of an armed psychopath on a shooting spree, ""Doom"" recycles material from better movies, such as the ""Resident Evil"" epics, ""Alien,"" (1979) and ""Stargate""(1994). The best of the few surprises in ""Doom"" occurs as a twist near the end but it may alienate fans who revere the Rock.Noisy, rambunctious, darkly shadowed, sporadically profane, but entirely idiotic, ""Doom"" follows a squad of macho U.S. Marines dispatched to the planet Mars. Their orders call for them to contain a security breach at a privately owned research institute and retrieve top secret company records. Some exposition is required to bring non-video gamers up to speed about this intergalactic gobbledygook set in the year 2046. According to freshman scenarist David Callaham and co-writer Wesley (""Cape Fear"") Strick's cliché-riddled screenplay, archeologists uncovered a portal in the Nevada desert that enabled them to travel through space to the Red Planet with minimal ill effects. Sounds like ""Stargate,"" right? Mysteriously, super humanoid creatures have begun to kill scientists in the underground labs. The institute issues a distress call that activates a Rapid Response Team led by Sarge (the Rock), a combat-seasoned Marine with Semper Fi tattooed across his back, and his crackerjack commandos. Unlike the sexually diverse Marines in James Cameron's classic ""Aliens,"" the ""Doom"" Marines are all red-blooded males with nicknames that encapsulate their one-dimensional characters. Among Sarge's troops is a God-fearing but profane grunt who craves crosses into his forearm with a razor-sharp knife when he takes the Lord's name in vain. Another Marine appears to have been modeled on the Jesse Ventura character from ""Predator,"" because he lugs around an electric-powered Gatling gun that can turn anything into a sieve. John Grimm (Karl Urban who played Eomer in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy) constitutes the most reluctant RRT team member. It seems that he once lived on Mars with his archaeologist parents and has nightmares about the experience. The trip back to Mars gives Grim a chance to re-establish contact with his estranged twin sister Samantha (Rosamund Pike of ""Die Another Day"") who guides Sarge and his men through the treacherous confines of the facility. Although Mars serves as the setting for ""Doom,"" ""Cradle 2 the Grave"" director Bartkowski only provides us with fleeting glimpses of the planet's bleak, barren surface.Dwayne 'the Rock' Johnson gives his least charismatic performance as the hard-as-nails Sarge. He utters no clever one-liners and plays Sarge with a straight face. Meaning, the Sarge character is about as lively as a cadaver. Richard Brake of ""Death Machine"" takes top honors as one of Sarge's low-life jarheads who gets his comeuppance in the least likely place. Poor Rosamund Pike alternates between being a heady scientist and helpless damsel-in-distress. As it turns out, we learn that the researchers on Mars have discovered the 24th chromosome that endows humans with supernatural strength. About the worst that these monsters do is cough up large sausage-shaped worms that bore into the victims' neck, similar to the squirming critter in the ""Hidden"" films that entered its victims' ears and drove them psychotic. The much touted first-person shooter scene has been far over-hyped and lasts for about five minutes. This first-person shooter scene like many of the stalking scenes in the claustrophobic institute suffer from a shortage of suspense and tension. Bartkowski keeps the lights turned low on his bargain basement monstrosities and his efforts to make them intimidating rarely yield results. Altogether, ""Doom"" is filled with so much gloom that the plot generates few thrills and chills and emerges as just another standard-issue, testosterone-laced, mutant monster hunt.",Doom
19,Calicodreamin,Good action!,7,25 May 2019,"Doom is based on a video game, which you can definitely tell. I thought it was quite well done, they play into very well and at time go into first person shooter mode. The action and suspense works.

If it sounds familiar, that's because it is. ""Resident Evil"" did the exact same movie in 2002, and did it better.So why did I start my post saying ""Predator"" did it better? Because seeing the crew of alpha male Marines reminded me of ""Predator."" Even one of the characters looked exactly like the Bill Duke character from ""Predator"" down to the Gatling gun.As far as the video games go, I don't know which was first, ""Doom"" or ""Resident Evil,"" but I do know that RE made a movie first and ""Doom"" was too similar to attempt the same thing.",Doom
21,FlashCallahan,Let God sort them out.......,5,13 February 2010,"Something has gone wrong at a remote scientific research station on Mars. All research has ceased. Communication has failed. And the messages that do get through are less than comforting. It's a level 5 quarantine and the only souls allowed in or out are the Rapid Response Tactical Squad - hardened Marines armed to the teeth with enough firepower to neutralise the enemy...or so they think....Out of all the movies based on video games, this had the potential to be quite good. The cast are okay, The director knows a thing or two about action scenes and set pieces, and it had a suitably dark setting.But it has something too Alien Vs. Predator about it. One of the main problems is that the film takes itself way too seriously, and this is it's major problem. The one-liners spewed by the soldiers are clunkily delivered and not dead pan at all, and the story is pretty much Resident Evil on another planet.The special effects and editing are good, but once you've seen a creature lurking in the shadows, you've seen them all.Urban is the best thing about the film, The Rock usually quite above average, is relegated to nothing more than a shouty extended cameo, think R. Lee Ermey but with less vocabulary and your there.One of the main highlights of this film was supposed to be the first person shooter set piece, and while this is impressive for about 30 seconds, it begins to feel like watching a young kid playing the game who will not let you have a go.So it's another nail in the coffin for video game movies, Not as bad as Max Payne, not as camp as Streetfighter, but still not very interesting.Mildly diverting, at best.",Doom
22,movieman_kev,forgettable escapism,5,23 September 2006,"The Rock as Sarge leads his band of space marines on a mission to Mars in this film (some would say loosely) based on the highly influential and acclaimed video game series of the same name. And for a popcorn action flick it succeeds for the most part, in that I've seen a great many worse game adaptations than this. Hell, the mere fact that the film doesn't have either Uwe Boll nor Paul Anderson anywhere in it's credits is case enough for celebration. The film is merely an entertaining time-waster , nothing more nothing less. 2 hours of brainless escapism that you'll quickly forget. Sure some nerdy crybabies will cry about the deviations from the story, but that's just what nerdy crybabies do. Listen I'm not saying the movie s without faults, the CGI is not up to par, the story s fairly generic, and there's an anti-military bent to it that almost makes me want to puke.

23,gradyharp,For Lovers of Video Games,4,22 November 2006,"DOOM, believe it or not, is based on a video game! With all the literature of the world, all the fine screenplays that are stacked on the shelves, all the creative stories that languish in the 'not for profit probably' bins, it seems a raw commentary on today's movie audiences to spend millions of dollars on a game everyone who cares already knows. But, movies are business and box office demands take precedence.As the narrator of the film states, 'In the year 2026 archaeologists working in the Nevada desert discovered a portal to an ancient city on Mars. They call this portal the Ark. Twenty years later, we're still struggling to understand why it was built and what happened to the civilization that built it' is the apparent 'story'. What follows is a series of conflicts between killers transforming into beasts right out of Hieronymous Bosch and Francis Bacon only to bloody up the claustrophobic computer generated interiors with occasional transmogrifications into mercurial clouds only to reappear. Much slaughter, much eye dazzling color manipulation, and ever so little story line fill the screen. The participants in this real time game are The Rock (he needs a role that uses his talent), hunky Karl Urban, Dexter Fletcher, Rosamond Pike, and Richard Brake - all squashed around the set by director and head gladiator Andrej Bartkowiak.Though not meant to be, this film can actually be fun to watch as a hilarious parody of scientific world events. Visually and content-wise it wears thin after about a half hour. Grady Harp",Doom
24,The_Void,"It's not saying much, but this may be the best video game adaptation so far",6,29 November 2005,"I'll start off this review by saying that I've never been a big fan of the video game 'Doom'. In truth, I only ever played it a couple of times, years and years ago, and never really got into it because I'm not all that keen on first person shooters (with the exception of Unreal Tournament) and besides; Doom's competitor, Quake, was better. Anyway, all this basically means that I cant compare the film to the game because I can't remember enough of the latter - but as a stand alone movie, Doom massively exceeded the low expectations I had for it, and turned out to be quite a good movie! As you will probably expect going into this film; there's a lack of logic, substance and general intelligence - but Doom makes up for this with big guns, cheesy one liners and some rather nifty special effects, which all contribute to making this the action packed Sci-Fi that a film called 'Doom' and starring ex-wrestler The Rock should be. The plot, or rather excuse for lots of monster blasting, is that a research facility on Mars has run into a few problems after something murders all the scientists working there. Hence, The Rock and his team of soldiers must save the day! The Rock certainly isn't a great actor, but he has the physique and style for a movie like this, and although much of his 'acting' is cringe-worthy, seeing the big guy fire big guns into big monsters makes up for that nicely. Karl Urban stars opposite The Rock in his first starring role, and like his co-star; delivers the action well. Of course, this is an action film - and the real stars of the show are the special effects and action set pieces. The effects are really rather good, and while we never really get a good look at the monsters before the MTv-style camera gets bored and moves on to something else (usually about 0.2 seconds after every shot), what we do see is quite convincing. The props and sets look nice, and this is made even better by the dark style. The only thing wrong with the atmosphere of the film is that it's a little TOO claustrophobic, and I had a hard time buying the idea of the film being set on a different planet, in the future. The action is largely exciting, with the innovative, and really rather good, first person shooting sequence being the movie's flagship segment. My main gripe with this film is that after a pretty good first eighty minutes, it just sort of fizzles out in a familiar macho action affair, and it kinds of undoes what went before it. However, you can't expect much from video game movies; but this one blows the likes of Resident Evil and Mortal Kombat completely out of the water. Doom is perhaps the closest a video game adaptation 'genre' has got to a masterpiece.",Doom
25,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Doom,6,29 October 2005,"You are in the wrong movie if you ask for a plot in Doom. If there's any, it stays true to the game - shoot anything that breathes, which is uttered many times in the latest movie adapted from computer games, off the heels of Resident Evil and Tomb Raider.I might try - a group of RRTS troops (read: Universal Soldier type, it even plays out that way) gets sent to Mars to uncover some weird occurrences in some high tech lab dealing with genetics. Soon, the victims become mutations of various kinds and all hell breaks loose as we follow the crew into the labyrinth of an underground lab full of dark skanky corridors right off the set of Aliens.It's nothing fancy, but it works. The filmmakers try to up both the intelligence and babe factor by introducing Bond Girl Rosamund Pike (she's a distraction alright) to the plot, but her *ahem* assets fail to maximise the thin plot. With mercenary soldiers, we see the typical stereotyped characters like the rookie, the maverick, the questionable orders, and the hero with a buried past.One major gripe I had with this movie, is the language. If the scripts says to swear, then please swear using as much colourful and vulgar words. Don't have it filmed, then decide during post production to tone it down, which means to re-record the audio and dub it over. So The Rock might mouth an ""F-word"", doesn't take a genius to realize that the word finally heard - ""idiot"" is two-syllable, and makes the movie like one of the old Clint Eastwood spaghetti westerns. Plenty of moments like this. Worse, while Rosamund Pike was uttering a slew of scientific mumbo-jumbo, her mouth doesn't even move!!! The editors need to be shot up the rear by the BFG.Speaking of BFG, it's disappointing. For fans, this is THE weapon to use as you blast away anything that moves. In the film, the buildup, fanfare and respect given to the Big Fat Gun (as The Rock calls it. I know you fans have a more impolite name for it) doesn't justify its short life-span on screen. Worse, there's only ONE BFG used in the entire movie, for a total of like, 2 shots? The much touted first-person shooter (FPS) view, adapted straight from the game, turned out to be no longer than 5 minutes. So for all you viewers who are worrying that the FPS view will get you all nauseous, you might want to reconsider. I thought it could be longer, and earlier, but it wasn't. Pity.However, the special effects, for what it's worth, is pretty nifty. Well, this area isn't much of a challenge, having source material come from a computer game, you couldn't and shouldn't do much wrong here.Strictly for fans of the game to see how it's played out on screen, and for those who like a dose of some mindless action, led by The Rock. Hmm... did I just see him raise his eyebrow?",Doom
26,siderite,"Oh come on, you haven't played the game, have you?",6,26 October 2005,"This is a major disappointment to me. I like ""The Rock"", even if he is getting stuck into the whole action/comedy hero cast. I wonder why he chose to play in this movie.I've played the Doom series. I've only had a glimpse at Doom 3, but I've played Doom like games from Captain Keen and Wolfenstein to Quake. This movie is a cliché, alright, I never expected different, but compared to the game it sucks big time. The only cool action scene is at the end, where we see everything from a first person perspective like in the game, but it lacks any real connection to the character. We see a kid playing Doom rather than a person in the middle of all action.Except this particular scene you have all the regular things: monsters that can turn you into one of them, dark confined spaces with power outages (even if computers always seem to be running), big bad weapons that can't perform any better than a regular M16, screaming people after being caught by slimy growling monsters that you only see glimpses of, etc.The BFG was a complete failure, too. In the game it was a weapon that killed everything in its radius, leaving structures intact. That's why it's called Bio Force Gun (among others :) ). Here it is only good for making holes in the walls. The monsters are really zombies, with a few CGI enhanced exceptions.Come on! I know it was probably impossible to put a double barreled shotgun in a futuristic movie where all the action happens on Mars (in martian sewers. What's wrong with this picture?) but what about the plasma gun? We certainly have a chainsaw in the first person shooter scene, where did it come from on a research station? What about the rocket launcher?Conclusion: the movie is failing even as a cliché. Playing the game is way better.",Doom
27,Smells_Like_Cheese,Somewhat bad and somewhat good,5,1 November 2006,"My friend just bought Doom and was bragging about how much she loved the movie, so she lent it to me because she was so upset that I never saw it. I've seen over 1,000 movies, yet she was surprised I never saw Doom, and I loved the movie and video game Mortal Kombat, she said that if I loved those, I should enjoy Doom. Doom is such a mix of a B sci-fi flick from the 80's with video game footage starring The Rock.Basically from what I gathered it's about these aliens who have been experimented on and have escaped their hatches attacking the scientists who did the research on them. Now the whole plant is in trouble, but a group of futuristic soldiers will fight and take on these creatures, but it's a matter of finding out what they're up against and what happened to them, because these creatures are now turning them into the hideous monsters as well! I loved the action, it had some great and exciting scenes, the special effects were pretty cool. I just wished they didn't add the corny view from camera like the video game, to me it's like you're just making another video game, but this is a movie. The acting is typically pretty bad, but it's wanted in a great type of action flick like this one, so I think I'm kinda fifty fifty on deciding wither I loved this movie or hated it.5/10",Doom

29,lost-in-limbo,A multi-player option would've been great.,5,14 March 2008,"Another one bites the dust in the realm of commercially shinny video game adaptations. So ""Doom"" is what you could say was the influential beginning of first person shooter video games, and the transmission to the screen isn't perfect, but this large budget, b-movie mainly diverts. Hell, it's as formulaic as you can get, however it's a competent display. It's just too bad the mindless parade can become rather lifeless in huge empty spaces, instead of letting those viciously buoyant and bloody surges shape the whole structure. Honestly it really does leave you wanting more, because it feels like it short-changed you on the bangs. As director Andrzej Bartkowiak has obviously tried to make a gloomy and slickly metallic atmospheric horror than a shoot 'em up action joint (where towards the end it eventually comes into its own). If that was the case, he lucks out on the factor for that to work he needed to heighten the suspense, and drill an alarming intensity. The results weren't so. The threadbare material keeps the central premise close by following the easy steps of other movies like mixing James Cameron's ""Aliens (1986)"" with probably the most successful video game franchise ""Resident Evil (2002)"". It's linked together by its meandering set-pieces. There's not an ounce of originality here, but the routine script offers up one surprise involving a character's unpredictable state of mind. The token characters don't venture far from the usual one-dimensional vessels, and there are clichés in nearly every frame. Again this didn't bother me, because it's made watchable. A nagging aspect that did bug me was that the film was darkly lit and erratically shot. Sure the exciting action was well organised and fairly creative, but that's only when you're able to make it out through that pitch darkness. Get those flashlights out! If you want something memorable, out of nowhere they suddenly throw in an unhinged first person perspective mode, just like out of the video game. Suspenseful, but it did feel ridiculously odd. The special effects are well-conceived (that's the monster costumes), and never really it they go over board in that department. Even the splatter has a genuine feel. The cast featuring the likes The Rock, Karl Urban, and Rosamund Pike are tolerable in their generic parts. The Rock plays it tough as nails. Urban gets a little depth, and stays lethal and Pike offers a stubborn thorn. The support roles are even less, but Richard Brake added some live. The standard, loud electronic-metal soundtrack goes on to clutter proceedings. Low expectations are a must, as this helps equal a careless way to pass the time. It could have been worse.",Doom
30,Robert_duder,"DOOM is better than expected, but also precisely what one would expect",7,22 October 2005,"I admit I had very low expectations of DOOM. I have indeed played the game but I wouldn't call myself an enormous fan and I kind of cringe now when I think and hear about all the video game to film translations that are seeping into theaters. With the exception of the exquisite Resident Evil I and II (see my reviews) most of them are not great. They always seem to try to do something different with an already established idea. Director Andrzej Bartkowiak for better or for worse doesn't do that at all. DOOM is DOOM!! The story is in tact, a research facility on Mars that is testing experimental procedures goes wrong and the entire staff is butchered.The Rock as I have stated before is well on his way if not already at super stardom to the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger. He actually has great range as an actor from action to comedy to tough guy to gay guy, I think he really has it in him to be an actor. His role in DOOM is a little odd and although he does play the tough commanding officer ""The Sarge,"" this is isn't his best leading role. He seems to be almost made fun of with the cinematography. The constant close ups (no matter what you say about the man he's not a good looking fellow), his bulging eyes, and his rather monotone voice. He was a big presence for the film though considering everyone else was virtually a no-namer. Nonetheless hero Karl Urban playing John ""Reaper"" Grimm does a good job. He's torn and emotional and tough all at once and you want to root for him. His on screen sister played by Rosamund Pike is also a good heroine and eye candy for the boys in the audience. She's basically the only female in the film so she has a lot of testosterone to contend with. The rest of the cast are decent but very stereo typical ""victims."" They are basically there to be annihilated. DOOM follows very much the recipe of a horror film, but with the setting and plot of a sci fi action film. The characters are killed off one by one in unique and interesting ways leaving only the protagonists alive by the end.DOOM lacks heavily in the plot area. Granted they have the basic story but everything after that is mindless shooting and being chased down by aliens (which is fun!!) but loses it's appeal. It'll be mostly forgettable once you've left the theater. They try to add a sub plot with the past of the Grimm siblings but it never gets off the ground and you just don't care. Being rated 18A (thank goodness) enables gore galore. Some very cool, gory death scenes, a plethora of pointless bad language, an adult good time!! Even the setting for DOOM is quite sterile and repetitive but then so is the game. You can only do so much with a space lab on Mars. The addition of the whole portal to earth was kind of interesting and a good play on the story. The special effects, focusing mostly on the monsters of DOOM were incredible and so very cool but I thought a little under used considering how cool they were but I supposed that could be considered subtle which is a good thing!! Now onto the infamous talk of the first person scenes. It's actually only one scene situated near the end of the film and it is done almost completely as an homage to all the intense fans of the DOOM video game. I was psyched up to completely HATE this scene but I didn't. I consider it now a very unique and well done part of the film. It's campy, don't get me wrong...very very corny but it's still not so bad. House of The Dead tried this too but the rest of the film around it was SO bad that by the time you got to that you already hated it. DOOM was good enough that it could support this little oddity. Plus it's the best time you get to see the monsters in action even though they just randomly, pointlessly pop out of nowhere and are easily mowed down despite being so hauntingly creepy throughout the rest of the film. The final monster, a wheelchair bound dog like creature of sorts in which First person perspective ""Reaper"" takes him on with a chainsaw is actually one of the cooler battle scenes. Also Reaper vs the Sarge in hand to hand combat...very cool. This movie is just fun...it's not mind blowing, it's not A + material, it's just adolescent, mindless fun. Will they serialize it?? Probably...but I really don't see what else they can do with it because they didn't give it much of a story. It's worth seeing once, maybe even in the theater. A lot of people will despise it but for those of you who can just sit there, laugh a little, let go of reality...you'll like it. Fans of the game too...very much made for them in mind, and also the teenagers who aren't supposed to be old enough to see this...but it's really for their demographic. 7/10",Doom
31,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Doom and gloom...,4,9 June 2006,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits I have a problem with video games (I have a bigger problem with some video game movies but we'll go into that another time.) It's not that I don't enjoy playing them, it's just I have to rent them out the store and I have to return them a few days later without really having had enough time to master the gameplay and get far in the game. The only other option is to buy them straight from the store (which I occasionally do) but I've always marvelled at and resented people paying in the region of £45 for a piece of plastic (that, incidentally, it cost 10p to make.) And so it transpires Doom is a game I've never played but have now seen the movie of.Our story opens when a group of soldiers calling themselves RRTS (Rapid Response Tactical Squad), lead by their headstrong captain (Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson) answer a distress call from a research station on Mars. They arrive there, investigate the problem, only to be confronted by an alien force more deadly than any of them ever imagined.There's some nice dialogue (""I asked the seargent for some pussy. Then he took you on board!"" is one of a few) and former wrestling God Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson has a credible presence in an essential but undemanding lead role. But that's about as high as the movie's list of praises grows though. Other than that, it's pretty much a none stop bore-a-thon, with stereotypical characters, a piecemeal, uninvolving story you've seen a hundred times before, a dimly lit camera shot through-out and a length that's about ten minutes too long. After making such high-energy action films as Cradle 2 the Grave and Exit Wounds, one wonders how director Andrezj Bartkowiak can make a return after some time away with a film this slumberous and dull. For a much more exciting and compact film of this sort, check out the vastly under-rated Event Horizon. **",Doom

But Doom wishes that was the case. Someone took the script to Aliens, photocopied it, changed the names here and there, added a first-person shooty-shooty scene and called it Doom.I loved Aliens. And, since 1986, I've seen scores of films trying to copy the basic premise. Some are good, some are bad and some do okay. Doom is the latter. Unfortunately, it will always suffer from being a computer game-related movie tie-in. Therefore people will automatically look for things to despise about it. Yes, it's not Shakespeare, but, with a name like 'Doom,' were you expecting it to be? It's not as bad as it could have been, but, then again, it probably could have been even better. The Rock does his best and lifts it above totally mediocre, so that's a plus point. Overall, I'd say if you like action/sci-fi films, you could do worse, as long as you keep your expectations low.",Doom

I was expecting a really bad movie with cheesy effects and a bad story. But I found the story to be interesting. It was similar to Resident Evil and Aliens. I group of soldiers teleport themselves to a Mars science station after receiving a message for help. They get there to discover a bunch of dead scientists. The question is: what killed them? The soldiers are joined by a scientist who is the sister of one of the soldiers, Reaper. The Rock, plays Sarge, the leader who turns out to have an evil streak in him. To cut to the chase, they find videos that show the scientists had been experimenting on humans by giving them an extra chromosome. In someone who is good, the chromosome turns someone into a super human. But if the person is evil inside, they are turned into a monster.The middle of the film was like Aliens as the group explores the station to be picked off one by one. There was some gore, but not really that graphic. The Rock has the best line ""I'm not supposed to die."" I laughed and laughed. Because it was too early for the leader to die in a monster film. Of course, he showed up later for the final confrontation with Reaper. Both have been infected, but whose smart enough to survive.FINAL VERDICT: Decent for a movie based on a video game. The plot wasn't original, but it had an entertaining story. It's always fun to see how the monsters will get to people.",Doom

I'm kind of familiar with the ""Doom"" game. I played a flash version of it and had tons of fun with it. This movie is mostly just a ripoff of ""Alien"" with some ""Predator"" thrown in. Well, ""Alien Vs. Predator"" had recently come out. It's just people looking for monsters in a spaceship. They even directly rip off the dialogue from ""Predator"". It's safe for me to say that this is the worst movie the Rock was ever in. Well, that I've seen at least.Two thirds into the movie, the Rock just goes insane for no reason. I guess it's fine if they change the demons to aliens. Well, actually they were genetic experiments, which is probably even less plausible. I wish the Rock could have turned more into a literal monster. The characters are mostly annoying with every guy being sexist and constantly insulting one another. Then again, there is that one great five minute scene that's directly based on the games. Remember how I said some movies would have worked better as short films?

Just like any typical villains and their henchmen would in order just to take over the world!Anyways I was so happy Dwayne Johnson took part in the film. Towards the end, man himself and Karl Urban did great butt kicking each other. It really throws a flashback when 'The Rock' was involved with WWE. Although I was annoyed he changed into a bad guy, himself and Urban would've made a great team together in order to kill the other zombies. I have to say, I really didn't think Rosamund Pike acted well in her role as the doctor. The fact is she really didn't show emotion but she did have the look of one like. She looked quite confused in some scenes in my opinion. The rest of the other characters were pretty good though!I suggest horror fans who like blood and gore should watch this!",Doom
36,ironhorse_iv,Doom was doom from the start. At less it's not from Uwe Boll.,5,11 March 2013,"Making a movie based on a game is hard to pull off because video games engage the player on completely different levels and are fun because of the interaction between the player and the story environment. You can have fun playing a completely silent protagonist in a fairly plot less story if the game play is fun because your brain can fill that time with you mastering the controls or learning a fun trick in the game. Movies cannot emulate how video games make the player feel connected to the story and shouldn't even attempt to do so. Doom the game have barely any plot, but the game play was fun. It was really dumb to make a movie out of something that had little to no story. If the movie is too similar to the game. Fans would be asking what would be the point in watching it if can't play. If you change too much of the story to try to hook the people who aren't fans of the game. You might anger off the people who knows about the source material. It's lose lose idea. Video games movies are not a good idea. Maybe one day somebody will pull it off, but it was clearly not this movie. The first thing about Doom's plot is the strange over complication of it. Loosely based on the video game series of the same name created by id Software. The movie starts out with 2046 where eight Marines just got orders investigate a situation at lab on Mars. When they reach there, they meet one of the marine's sister Dr. Samantha Grimm (Rosamund Pike) whom tells the leader of the platoon Sarge (Dwayne Johnson) and her brother John Grimm (Karl Urban) that a generic scientific experiment went wrong and now mutants are overrunning the lab. It's especially moronic to have replaced demons from Hell plot from the game remove for some generic scientific experiment plot. Not to mention it actually lessens the possibilities. No supernatural origins means no fireballs, no summon and no sudden spawns which are all parts of what makes the games great. It didn't help that names of demon characters from the game are given to the names of normal people such as Hell Knight and Pinky. I heard that the demons were removed because they thought that it would offend religious people. I think they were trying to latch onto the fact that genetics and cloning were big news. The news of genetically modified foods and cloning controversies was scary people at the time. In the film if the person has some extra chromosomes that it will make them super human like very fast and strong. Not only that it helps them heals in seconds and will be makes them almost invincible. This isn't the truth sadly, as in humans having one extra chromosome causes severe mental and physical disorders. For example Dawn Syndrome is causes by trisomy of chromosome 21. There are plenty of animals out there with more than 23 chromosome pairs, but they are not stronger nor smarter. The science here in this film is sci fiction indeed. Sarge instructs his team that their mission is to eliminate the threat while securing the facility. There is a plot twist one involving the Rock's character that come out of nowhere and makes little sense. The rock is as dumb as a rock for taking this role. He gives nothing new to the role. Its seem the producer and director Andrzej Bartkowiak blew some of the budget on training the entire cast in military tactics and weapons, but the marines skills are barely being use in the film. So let's face facts here, at least this movie tries. However, I've got to give the movie credit for at least trying and even somewhat succeeding to look and feel like the games. This is more than I can say for most game to movie adaptations. It's a little enjoyable especially with the First Person Shooting scene. It's a really dumb movie, but a guilty pleasure nonetheless.",Doom
37,The-Sarkologist,Beyond Terrible,2,29 March 2019,"There were two things that just weren't right with this film, well two things other than the fact that it was incredibly lame, and apparently suffers from the curse of so called video game movies, and that is that movies based on video games inevitably turn out really, really bad (though I still thought Wing Commander was pretty good). No, the thing that just didn't sit right for me in this film is that Dwayne 'the Rock' Johnson so didn't look like that huge, hulking, but incredibly adorable Teddy Bear that he seems to be.Yeah, honestly, it doesn't matter what film Johnson appears in, and what character he plays, he always comes across as just so adorable, and incredibly likeable. Even Hobbs in Fast and the Furious is like that. Yet in this film he not only looks pretty slender, but is nowhere near the towering mass that he is in other films. Honestly, it really just didn't seem right.The other thing is that he is the bad guy. Okay, if you are familiar with Johnson's films, then you will know that he never, ever, plays the bad guy. Well, not quite because as it turns out, in this film he does. Look, it isn't like your typical film where you have a character that you know, or pretty quickly turns out to be, the bad guy - no, this is Doom, and this is based on a video game, except in the video game you are running around killing demons which have been released from hell - in this film they are basically zombies.Yeah, I would suggest that this film had potential, but in reality it didn't come close. In fact, right from the word go I could see it was going to be bad, especially with all the really bad, and quite lame, nicknames that the main characters had. The other thing is that while the setting probably works, as I mentioned, from my understanding in the game is that they basically opened a gate to hell, and all sorts of nasties came pouring through. This, as it turned out, isn't the case with this film.A portal to Mars is discovered in Nevada, and when they step through they discover the remains of an ancient civilisation. Suddenly, all these monsters start coming about and ripping people up - sort of - it turns out that there were some experiments going on and the subjects of the experiments had been turned into, well, zombies. So, that is basically the film, and in many cases it could easily be mistaken for another Alien film, though to be honest with you, Alien films tend to have a lot more suspense about them, and are somewhat more coherent.Yeah, and then there was that end sequence, which was once again pretty bad. For some really, really bizarre reason, they decided that it might be a good idea to have the film run, at least for a bit, like the computer game, which as I suggested, was pretty bad. They even have a section where he picks up a chainsaw and attacks one of the monsters with it. Oh, and of course we have the BFG, which if you have ever played Doom, you'll know what it is.In the end though, I was never a particularly big fan of the game. There were others that absolutely loved it, but me, well, I really didn't think all that much of the game, and in the end, all I can say is that the film, well, it turned out to be pretty bad.",Doom
38,Floated2,Entertaining Action,7,19 January 2017,"If you aren't a fan of the Doom video games, then one are more likely to have enjoyed this film than those fans of the game. Having not played the games, I could understand why this film has been panned by critics and fans alike. Although, this film is refreshing to see how well the director and special effects people put everything together to move everything from your living room to the theater. The security screens at each door are perfectly recreated and the guns look and sound great in all their bone-shattering glory. Doom is mainly for the pure action movie fan, the plot is simple enough to follow and enjoy. In the movie, the year is 2046 and the monsters aren't really demons, but human science experiments gone horribly awry. The good thing about this is that it allows for both fans and non- fans of the games to jump right in to the movie on the same page. Also to pay close attention in this film,as there is a secondary plot line involving John Grimm (Karl Urban) and his twin sister, Samantha Grimm (Rosamund Pike). Overall, the film really does not drag on at all compared to many monster-action films, which is a bonus and it is quite entertaining. Quite possibly an underrated film.",Doom
39,TheMovieDiorama,Doom was doomed right from the start.,3,27 February 2018,"Come on, who honestly thought this was a good idea? Of all the video games to adapt with decent storylines, Universal chose a first-person horror shooter. *sigh*...oh dear. Loosely based off the video game with the same name, a squad of 'Rapid Response Tactical Soldiers' are called to a research station on Mars after a distress call. What they find is a legion of nightmarish creatures that lurk behind every corner. Nearly everything about this film is terrible. I do admire the scene that imitates the POV of the protagonist as he goes round shredding gruesome monsters with bullets and a chainsaw. Replicating the game's famous FPS aesthetics, the Mars station was a fitting environment. Aside from those small positives...yikes! This was just bad. The whole purpose of the Doom franchise was that demonic enemies from Hell were attacking. In this atrocity, the story is altered so that these creatures were synthetically created from an additional chromosome. So yes, the enemies are actually human. Why abolish the original story? What could you possibly gain from that? If the film is bad enough for the average moviegoer, then your only target audience is the fan base. Change the story, and you've lost the fans as well! To say the acting was below average is too kind. It's terrible. Clearly The Rock was not always box office gold, as he was horrendous in this. No emotion, stiff as cardboard and constantly hoisting his giant gun up at an attempt at being a badass. Karl Urban was generic. Rosamund Pike deserves better than this. Some of the visual effects were good and I applaud the use of practical effects, particularly the costumes for the creatures. The script was tedious, the characters are constantly shouting what they are about to do or what they are thinking. The lighting was dimmer than a 12th Century gothic Transylvanian castle, could hardly see a thing. Quick cuts, bad editing...I'm done. No more. Doom should simply be titled ""Doom and Gloom"". I can think of worst films, but this is abysmal. No question.",Doom
40,Tweetienator,Let the Chaingun Speak,7,8 September 2018,"The Doom-franchise is maybe the most famous and best horror-shooter game-series of all time (thanks id!). The movie featuring Dwayne Johnson and Rosamunde Pike and some other good actors is good (for a game adaption) but it lacks a little bit of the splatter and gore level of the games (and what I call the satanic, demonic ""feel"" of the games) and, last but not least, the production value is only of good DVD/TV-scale.All in all an watchable movie for the fans of the games and with a bonus of +1 (I'm a Doom-fanboy) this gets a rate of 7.",Doom
41,pmtelefon,I liked it,8,23 December 2018,"I had put off watching ""Doom"" for quite a long time. I don't know why. I used to play the video and and I enjoy most of Dwayne Johnson's movies. I guess the reviews at the time scared me off. Well, shame on me. I should think for myself. ""Doom"" starts off like an okay SyFy network movie but after the first half hour things start to pick up at a pretty steady pace. The last 40 minutes, or so, is great. The sequence where ""Doom"" goes POV and turns into the old video game was great. It was a ballsy move by the filmmakers and I loved it. The cast was very good. The Rock plays a great all business villain (something he wouldn't do nowadays) and Rosamund Pike is very sexy. ""Doom"" gets a flag for ""Delay of Game"" but otherwise it's good stuff.",Doom
42,GOWBTW,Just like being in the game itself!,9,23 October 2005,"This based on the video game is the top of its prime. If you thought Resident Evil was a challenge, DOOM really proves its point! You bring an elite group of Marines who are trying to find the missing scientists. Unfortunately, they stumble into something deeper. The group is lead by Sarge(Dwanyne ""The Rock"" Johnson) who is more of an mad mercenary than a leader of the squadron. Anybody who has played DOOM, would get the picture. I've seen the weapons in the game. The shotguns, the chain-guns, the chainsaws, and most of all, the BFG. I remembered the BFG in the game, I didn't have a clue what it meant back then. Now I know what it means. BFG:Bio Feed Gun. When the Sarge went to get the gun he uses is own words to that weapon. When he saw how much that gun kicks, he knows he was going to love it. When John Grimm's sister Sam realized that she was working for shady people, she would do anything to help his brother and defy his insane Sarge at the same time. When all the freaks came out, it was Grimm(Karl Urban) who took out these demons. Those scenes were like being in the game, exactly. Unlike RE, MK, and other video game based movies this one has lots more intensities in every direction. I've enjoyed this movie every second. All I can say is to be armed to the teeth, it's a fight where there's hell in every way. As for the Sarge, he just got an Dishonorable Discharge! Rating 3 out of 5 stars!",Doom
43,FiendishDramaturgy,Better On The Second Viewing,8,21 March 2007,"When I saw this in the theater, I hated it. I was like...WHAT did I just SEE? For some reason, it made no sense to me. The story didn't flesh with the characters, and the creatures were just plain out of place.Upon the second viewing, however, the whole thing made sense. I can't say this was a ""good"" video game adaptation, but the movie itself is awesome as a stand alone. It's better than the norm in the way of adaptations from a video game, but it may take a viewing or two to realize it.Check out the first person sequence during the walk through. Now THAT's what we expected with Resident Evil.It rates a 7.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",Doom
44,Bezenby,It's good enough,7,9 June 2014,"When something goes wrong at a lab on Mars, the government sends the worst marine squad in the world through an ancient teleporter to sort things out. Sort things out? These lads can't even sort themselves out! Just look at the baggage this lot carry: There's Grimm, who doesn't talk to his sister who works in the lab on Mars, and Portman, the slimy perv, and then there's self harming God guy, and the drug addict young guy, and then there's The Rock, out to obey orders to the number despite what that actually entails! Plus: The top half of Dexter Fletcher! All these marines head off to Mars to find out why a lab went into lockdown and not before long they discover why. The scientist have uncovered some sort of weird substance than can turn humans into superhumans sometimes, but can also sometimes turn humans into almost indestructible creatures who can shoot their tongues and infect other people. It takes a bit of time to get there but once things get going it's all gravy.I loved Doom back in the day, but haven't played Doom 3, ever, for some reason. You don't get the 'Hell' thing here (although they allude to it slightly)and no cyberdemons, sadly, but you do get a gore filled film full of zombies and monsters, and a bit of interpersonal drama thrown in there. This is the kind of film where people split up constantly and do stupid things, but I didn't sign up for anything more than that so I'm not complaining.",Doom
45,BeneCumb,"Monster creatures, monster guns...",6,6 January 2013,"And lots of scientific labs, screaming and fighting... All this has been repeatedly seen before and after. Sometimes there are new angles present, but not here - I have not new scientific terms or new topics for moral reasoning in mind. Later introduction of fanged beings and zombie theme seems rather ridiculous - so does the ending, which is, moreover, predictable. Due to insufficient lightning and frequent flashes, the movie is difficult to watch at times.As for the cast, it is quite uneven: Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson as Sarge and Rosamund Pike as Dr. Grimm are pleasant to follow, the others are just ordinary. Doom is probably for sci-fi fans and/or teens, I am neither of them. Thus, nothing impressive to me, no pleasant entertainment, just killing time for ca 1,5 hours.",Doom
46,dee.reid,"""Doom"" isn't doomed quite yet",6,26 October 2005,"First of all, I'd like to start this out by stating I have played ""Doom."" I own ""Doom,"" and I like playing it, a lot. And if my day was not so busy, I'd probably play it after I was done writing this review, but business must come before pleasure, I'm afraid.Unlike others, however, I wasn't introduced to the sci-fi shoot'-em-up hyper-violence of ""Doom"" through the PC. No, my introduction to it was through the Sony Playstation (not that I think it really matters). That's probably the only difference between me and legions of other hardcore players. Differences abound in this latest video game adaptation, which is titled ""Doom.""In ""Doom,"" the movie, much of the action is set on Mars in the future, and after the opening credits, you can read the subtitle that says where on Mars, and that's the last mention of it anywhere in the film. There is one glorious visual effects shot of the Universal logo spinning in space, as the Red Planet, and the camera zooms its way to the rocky, dead, red, and dusty surface.At this point, it's wise to not expect anything more that is as crafty from ""Doom,"" since, logically, it's about as deep as it gets. It's a movie based on a video game; how ""deep"" can it get? Just consider the plot, which is not really anywhere close to that of the games: sometime in the next century, scientists on Earth discover a portal, called the ""Ark,"" which opens a gateway that leads to a similar device on Mars.As the film opens, a bunch of men and women in lab coats are running away from an unseen, malevolent presence that chases them all down, leaving one scientist (and part of a woman's arm that got cut off by the door) to send a distress call to Earth before he is attacked by that Unseen Force. On Earth, the distress call is picked up and RRF (Radical Response Team, or something similar - I'm not sure) is ordered to journey to Mars and figure out what's going on.Led by Sarge (The Rock, who somehow has yet to join the ranks of other big-muscle archetypes), once they arrive on the Red Planet they are met by others who have managed to quarantine certain portions of the facility, and down they go into its labyrinth of tunnels and laboratories, with blonde archaeologist Samantha (Rosamund Pike) in tow. Her brother, the appropriately named Grimm (Karl Urban), is also one of the members on Sarge's team, who include the obligatory macho veterans and at least one unseasoned young guy. But they discover that the labs are in shambles, and there is blood everywhere. Something is very wrong, yet they continue because they're soldiers, and they have a job to do. They walk in and out of dark corridors and wind up waist-high in sludge at certain points, and they soon start getting offed by hideous genetic mutations, zombies and other sci-fi/horror nasties.""Doom,"" as directed by Andrzej Bartkowiak (whose previous credits include the Jet Li action flicks ""Romeo Must Die"" and ""Cradle 2 the Crave""), gets a lot mileage from the buildup, which unfortunately never amounts to a big payoff. The opening scenes on Mars are quite tension-filled but somehow never gets around to full ""Doom""-mode. Gore is plentiful, so the hounds should be pleased, though core audience members will be understandably disappointed.As I stated earlier, I am a huge player of the video games and I try to adopt a fair approach when judging an adaptation by sticking with its merits and not making redundant comparisons to the source material. It's eventually revealed the monsters (completely discarding the titanic Cyber-demon, arrgh) are mutations and not otherworldly beasts from Hell, which would have allowed the story to make a lot more sense and be more believable. I'm not keen on genetics so I'm not getting into specifics about scientific accuracy.Also, core fans may be disappointed by the lack of actual ""Doom""-style shoot-'em-up. It's best they don't go in expecting ghouls and other Hell beings to be popping out from every corner and surprising you, and the use of firepower (especially Sarge's BFG - ""big f**king gun"") is a little light for some tastes. The dialogue is also quite ludicrous at points and highly questionable, and it often consists largely of four-letter expletives beginning with ""F."" But there is one plus: There is a genius sequence where the action shifts to FPS (first-person shooter, the style of gaming the original 1993 ""Doom"" is famous for pioneering), and the character takes on the vicious nasties, unloading clip after clip until he eventually goes toe-to-toe with one beast and even resorts to the use of that beloved chainsaw (yeah, baby). But that's about as creative as it gets, unfortunately.Is ""Doom"" a failure? That depends, mostly on who watches it - fans, or those who have no idea what the hell it is; the latter folks are the ones most likely to enjoy it a lot a more. Did I like it? Despite its deviations from the source material, yes, though quite grudgingly. If you were able to sit through the ""mild entertainment"" of ""Mortal Kombat"" (1995), which happens to be a personal favorite of mine and not its sequel, and both of the ""Resident Evil"" films, then you should have no problem watching ""Doom.""6/10",Doom
47,XweAponX,The Rock and the BFG,10,27 March 2006,"The ""effect"" of the BFG was JUST like I imagined it would be.I was hoping that this film would have more elements from Doom and Doom II in it: Possessed Humans, Brown Flame Tossing Imps, And Huge Demons with Rocket Launchers built in to hands. This flick is not seemingly a direct ""translation"" from those early versions of Doom to the screen, except for maybe the looks of a few of the Imps: As a matter of fact, when they get to Mars, the first game-related set we see (the receiving room outside of the ""Ark"") is just like it looks in Doom II. Just needed a chainsaw. But then again, I have never seen Doom 3, and so some of these sets may be copied from the design of that game.I kept looking for barrels full of gas. So far, haven't seen one. But that would be great if they used THAT little thing from the game, shooting the barrels full of gas and blowing up the sewer imps.I did not see the furry brown imps that fling fire, or the flying flaming skulls, or the giant round floating bulbous things, or the mechanical spider with the brain, or: The Gigantic Demon with the Rocket Launcher built in to his arm.No, Nope: Haven't seen that. But I didn't see Karl Urban put on a silver helmet and get on his horse either, plus his hair is too short and mousy brown: Not as kool as he was in Riddick either. But what did I see? I saw Urban go into a killin rampage and for about 5 minutes, I had a great First Person Shooter POV and a roller coaster ride o deth. Ahaha! This makes the whole film.But as far as Doom goes, NOT a direct representation of the Doom I or II, but a good moovie, nonetheless, but that's just me, I was determined to like this just for what it is. I went out and got Doom III cos of this.Know what I wish would have happened? I wish Grim would have picked up the BFG at some point and at the very end of the FPS Rampage, if he could have switched to the BFG and cleared out a room...Cos it is freakin great when The Rock uses it, but it is not used to kill any monsters. It is only used twice in the film, and we do not get to SEE the effects of the BFG 9000 - The Green plasma rays emitting from it... The imps turning into gobbets of grease! Hahaha! I'm not sure that the BFG does in D-3 but in this film, part of the effect is that it removes unsightly WALLS and such... The original BFG did not destroy any part of a level, it just cleared out a room of any sprite. In Quake II, the BFG sends out secondary ""feeler"" rays, and if Rock's BFG were designed the same way, it would have melted Urban.Well, thank G-d for THAT. But I do wish that the BFG were used on some monsters instead of parts of bathrooms.I just gotta add this: When The Rock picks up the Big F---in Gun, he's got that same smile the man in the Doom game has. Hahahaha! It is perfect and anyone who has played Doom I and Doom II to deth like I have will instantly recognise that smile.Urban got to use a kind of bomb on a timer, and well I will not tell you what it did. But I will say is that when he goes off on that spree, it really feels like you are behind that gun. And that gun.. Whereas Doom I and II has a lot of different weapons, the basic gun of Doom 3 has a lot of different uses. And you'll get to see em all: Hehe.",Doom
48,alindsay-al,Another poor video game based movie,3,27 August 2015,In anticipation for the new video game movie hit-man agent 47 I thought I would go back ten years and watch doom. And boy this movie is bad. The premise sees a group of space marines sent to Mars to contain a threat that could destroy earth. Now Karl urban is a decent actor and he does the best he can in this film. His character is just pretty bland and boring to the extent that you don't really end up caring about him even though his performance is alright. The rock was really good as sarge with some funny lines and he was actually the most interesting character in the film. But the rest of the team are just expendable and you will not care about a single one of them. Rosamund pike was really bland in this film and her character has nothing to her and her relationship with urban came across as forced. The story is incredibly simple and there really is nothing to it meaning you won't really care about anyone in the film. There is a really interesting twist with one of the characters and I did like it and was the only positive with the story. The script is just dreadful and sometimes it becomes funny but this films dialogue is horrendous. The style is bad the lighting is just so dark that you can't really see anything and don't get my started by how bad the first person shooter style was. Also the creature design wasn't very good at all. Overall this was a poor film that you don't need to see.,Doom

50,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Gory fun,6,2 August 2016,"Despite not having a whole lot to do with the video games, Doom is still a rush of schlock and awe silliness, getting more fun and ridiculous in equal amounts near it's nonsensical ending. Karl Urban and The Rock are the tough guys for the job when it comes to scoping out a Martian research base that's accidentally opened up a portal to hell, unleashing all kinds of lovely things. Rock is Sarge, stoic commander of this unit, and Urban is John Grimm (he lives up to his last name) a battle scarred badass who has personal stake in fighting these monsters. His sister (Rosamund Pike) is a scientist on the base, and is now in a great deal of danger. After a neat Google Earth type zoom in on the Martian surface (ironically the only shot in the film that suggests they're even on the red planet), it's off to dank corridors, vast bunkers and beeping control panels, an Aliens-esgue siege on horrors of the dark that quickly goes sideways on them. It's run of the mill stuff save for one stroke of brilliance: a pulse racing first person shooter sequence that showcases a POV of Urban shooting, slashing and chain-sawing his way through alien flesh. It's a bold move that pays off immensely and is quite fun. The rest of their team is forgettable except for Richard Brake as Portman, the loudmouth A Hole of the bunch, a refreshingly animated performance in a roomful of muted, grim characters. The monster from the game shows up, a hulking hell pig nicknamed Pinky that tirades it's way through everything until Urban gives it what for. This ain't no great flick, but as far as video game movies go, you could do way worse. There's definitely enough gore for the hounds, and it's adequately stylish in presentation.",Doom
51,Enchorde,"If those guys are our last line of defense, we're in deep... trouble.",4,31 August 2006,"Recap: An elite strike force are sent as a response to a distress call from a research station on Mars. Upon arrival, no one seems to know the cause of the distress, but one research team is missing. The force sweeps the abandoned station and soon body parts and dead people turns up. The problem is, dead people don't seem to stay dead. Instead they mutate heavily and go on the hunt for more flesh and bodies. The fate for the strike force quickly goes real bad, and strife and emotions emerge. Will the team be able to contain the unknown threat and save mankind? Comments: When movies are made based upon comics and amusement park rides, why not turn to a classic cult computer game? The idea is good, unfortunately it is not done very well. The most disturbing part is that this team, this supposedly elite military force, is the worst I've ever seen. Communication is bad, soldiers are unable to follow orders, are insubordinate and have no team-feeling at all (which is critical in a close-knitted elite team), don't relay key information that are critical to understanding and dealing with the problem and are in a few cases just plain stupid. Those guys can't never been recruited from within the military, my best guess is that they pick their members right from the street and give them heavy weaponry (that no one has checked since the last world war - since they malfunction suspiciously often).So unfortunately and disturbingly when we could be watching scenes with mindless action (did anyone expect anything else?), special effects and some monsters, we get to see arguing, stupid and poorly equipped soldiers.Then, when all hope of salvaging the movie has almost died with the innocent bystanders slaughtered by the monsters, the FPS-scene appears. FPS - that's First Person Shooter - and the point of view we got when we played the game (and many similar games). And this is somewhat of a critical point. If you don't know what I'm talking about, this movie is probably nothing for you. But if you do, and especially if you have played the old Doom-games, this scene is a thrill. They actually manage to create the same feeling, and you will recognize a lot, especially the favourite; the chain saw.Other than that, the movie has little to offer. Some decent action, but mostly the disturbing parts mentioned above. So, in spite of the FPS scene (although it raises the vote considerably), I can't give this movie more than a 4.4/10",Doom

At points they are all talking techno babble at each other really fast and you don't have a clue what they're saying.As a film made from a computer game it's not bad, but it's hard not to draw comparisons to films like Alien and in fact, with a few tweaks it could be another instalment of that series.I loved the first person scene recreating the game itself and wonder if it wouldn't have been better to do the whole film that way, which would at least have given it more depth and a unique feel.It was also cheapened by a soundtrack that seemed to come from a bad 90's, sci fi tv programme.It's not the worst film I've ever seen. I did make it all the way through and wouldn't have to be strapped to a chair to watch it again, but it will be a long time before I do and probably only then, because there is nothing else on at all.",Doom
54,aimless-46,"Stick to ""Aliens""",3,2 March 2009,"To be completely fair I did manage to get into the first hour of the movie ""Doom"" (2005) before the wheels fell off and the mish-mash of a script managed to contradict itself once too many times. And any film that includes close-ups of Rosamund Pike (""Pride and Prejudice""  ""Die Another Day"") more than justifies its existence and the current $.19 price tag for a used DVD.Pike not only looks good, she is an excellent actress and injects some self-parody into the film, you can almost hear her wondering if her salary was worth having to do scenes with the rest of her talent-challenged ensemble.There isn't a lot of originality to be found here. Basically it is a big budget money-losing attempt to clone ""Aliens"" while throwing in a few names and inside jokes from the video game. As in ""Deep Rising"" (another money losing ""Aliens"" clone) a squad of mercenaries/Marines/Marines go to a luxury liner/space colony/research station and find that the passengers/ colonists/scientists have been wiped out by undersea/deep space/genetically-altered creatures. They attempt to destroy the creatures but most are killed.The hero is a maverick outsider played by Treat Williams/Sigourney Weaver/Karl Urban. The main villain is a slimy businessman/corporation representative/kill-crazy NCO; who endangers everyone. Comic relief is provided by wisecracking Kevin O'Connor/Bill Paxton/Richard Blake. The group encounters a female survivor played by Famke Janssen/Carrie Hein/Rosamund Pike).Unfortunately for ""Doom"" and ""Deep Rising"" the producers did not hire the writers from ""Aliens"". This oversight will have you wondering how they could sink this much money and effort into the making this movie, and put so little thought into writing the screenplay. Too bad really-because while unoriginal, the premise does have a lot of potential. There was simply a failure to execute so that after a promising beginning things bog down completely and it just becomes an exercise in excess; with endless boring battles between mercenaries with pop guns and monsters whose properties allow them to do anything.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",Doom

It is far from perfect, it's probably a horrible Doom movie, but apart from that, this is a lot of fun.It follows most of the zombie rules for infection, but the learning curve is one of the things that keeps the movie interesting as it drip feeds information as the infection gets out of control.As great as the cast is with this one, it seems pretty clear from the beginning that the big billers, Dwayne Johnson and Karl Urban, are going to go head to head, whether it be against or back to back against monsters.The monsters are done with great practical effects, they're creepy looking, and competitive with the available technology. They're even used in creative ways.When it comes down to it, the movie is fun, and a reliably good watch.",Doom
57,Rob_Taylor,"Well, it was better than the game........",6,19 November 2005,"But not by much. As with the game, once you get past the flash graphics there really isn't a lot to entertain you and it's the same with this movie.Everything looks good, the effects are well-done and there's lots of shooting and running and general horror-type stuff. But that's where the fun really stops. Once you've seen one soldier running from a thing, or shooting a thing, then you really shouldn't expect it to get any better....because it won't.But if you like that sort of mindless entertainment then Doom is great. There is the usual laughable ""science gone bad"" plot, the usual, equally funny ""tough guy soldiers"" and the lamentable, all-round lack of real acting talent, but other than that, Doom is fairly enjoyable in its way.The Rock ""acts"" as well as can be expected. Actually, that's a little harsh. He is certainly way better at acting than a certain Austrian musclehead was at a similar point in his career, and he isn't saddled with a thick accent, either. The others are all much the same. No one really sucks, but they are hampered enough by the script and material without worrying about their acting ability.Effects are reasonable, with a heavy emphasis on gore and dimly lit scenes. Nothing really bad, although I was forced to wonder why a Martian base had a city-sized sewer underneath it, but hey, let's not go there.As for the monsters themselves.....zombies really. That pretty much sums up most of them. There's pseudo-science involved in how they come to be around in the first place, but you needn't pay much attention to that. Just as in the game, the backstory is mostly irrelevant and the beasts are simply there to provide something to shoot at. End of story.In summary then, nothing to get excited about. It's all been done, and seen, before.",Doom
58,Matt_Layden,"""At Least It's Better Then What Uwe Boll Would Have Done""",4,26 February 2006,"A group of MARINES are sent out to a space station when problems start to arise. Although, once they get there...they encounter an enemy they are not ready for.DOOM was a revolutionary game, it still has many fans today and Hollywood wants to cash in on the franchises success. Well, Doom does some things right, and that begins with not having Uwe Boll as a director, that's right, DOOM is in fact better then what Uwe Boll would have done...or probably ever will do.I'm not saying it's a good movie, it's pretty bad, but I'll give it kudos for actually trying to stay true to the source and try to be good.Doom stars the so called new action hero ""THE ROCK"" and ""I Was In Lord Of The Rings"" Karl Urban. Both are macho MARINE guys who lead a small group of macho men into some dark corridors. Their enemy lurks in the dark and attack out of nowhere. This was terrifyingly creepy in the game, but for the film is lacks anything that would constitute as a scare. It does follow what the game has mapped out and excluding one particular scene, it doesn't try anything to re-invent and add on.The Rock is horrible in this film. He's not too bad of an actor, The Rundown is a good role for him, this is not. It is actually hurtful to see the actors try to act in this film. What's even worse would be the so called evil creatures. Not at all scary, or even ""dangerous"". They do kill the MARINES one by one, but unlike in certain alien films there is no suspense when wait for these things to appear.The fight scenes are terrible. One punch and the person will go flying across the room. Even if the two who are fighting are ""pure evil"" and ""in god mode"" it doesn't fit well with the film. It also tries a little bit with a subplot of how a brother and sister apparently dis-like each other at the beginning, but near the end, they put their differences aside and pull through together....how touching and clichéd.One scene that ultimately makes or breaks this film for the fans is obviously the FPS, First Person Shooter (for those non-gamers out there) scene. It was a cheesy, but nice touch. It stays true to the source and I commend this film for actually doing that. The main character is in the ""invincible"" state and goes around shooting the creatures....that is pure DOOM CHEAT MODE and it was really neat to see.Is this the worst video game adaption? Far from it, that goes for anything BOLL can turn out, is this the best, nope. Video games that become movies have great material to extract from, but fail to capitalize on it. Until something with some concrete stuff breaks from games to film (still waiting for Metal Gear) then I'm sorry, but films like this is what we'll have to sit through.",Doom
59,winner55,ho hum,4,30 November 2008,"A number of fanboy reviews complain that this is not like the game. The trouble is, story aside, the film makers want this to look like a video game. And it does. And that's what's crappy about it.In translating a story from one medium to another - book to film, film to video game, poem to stage, whatever - the first question the producers need to ask is, how to pay respect to what the audience found satisfying in the original while also respecting new audiences for the translated story in the new medium? The effort is difficult, but hardly impossible, and we have scores of great movies drawing on sources from every other sort of media - books, comic books, Broadway, and yes, video games. The trick, of course, is to have the film avoid looking like the source medium. That's why a complaint against some films based on plays is that they are ""stagey"" - they look like recorded theater, not like a creatively produced film.Since this is well-known, it is bewildering when film makers decide to imitate their source medium. We don't want a film to look like a video game, we want a good film of the same story.And here's one reason why: In this particular movie, the decision to make it look as much like the game as possible has squelched th creative talents of all involved. As instance - some complain that The Rock can't act - well, see him in ""The Rundown"" and you'll see that he can act (at least within action-film limits) given the right direction. Here, he is directed to remain as two-dimensional as possible - as are all the actors, none of whom are allowed to develop characters richer than the 'video-game' look of the film will allow.There just has to be special weapons, zombies to shoot, there just has to be explorations of a darkened sewage tunnel, good guys turned bad by getting slimed by monster - etc., etc., etc. We've all played games like this, we could write better scripts ourselves.Occasionally good action sequences, everything else is flat, predictable and dull.",Doom
60,brando647,Faithful Enough to Satisfy this DOOM Fan,6,9 April 2009,"It's rare that I find a film based on a video game that manages to entertain. I can't remember a single video game movie that didn't bore me or wasn't completely stupid (or both). Well, oddly enough, I've found one and it's based on a first-person shooter game with minimal plot. DOOM, based on the awesome series of games from id Software, is a straight-up science fiction action film that follows a team of marine special forces to a research station on the planet Mars after they receive a distress call. Upon arriving, the team finds the station's occupants changing and a collection of hideous creatures stalking the dark corridors. While the film isn't exactly epic, I enjoy it because it delivers just what it promises and it stays true to the feel of the video games.DOOM is rated R and I wouldn't have it any other way. The games are about demons escaping from Hell to Mars and the player is a space marine slaughtering his way violently through hordes of hellspawn. If the movie had been sugar-coated to a teen-friendly PG-13, I'd have gone crazy. Fortunately, the movie has all of the graphic violence and dismemberment you'd expect from a DOOM movie. One complaint I have is that the entire movie is way too dark. While I understand it's faithful to the game in that you won't know where the next creature will attack from but I had a hard enough time just following the action on screen with so little lighting. The low lighting also made it difficult to get a good glimpse of the creature design. I've always loved the variety of demons in the games, I wanted a good view of the Hell Knight or the Imps.The cast has a few highlights but nothing to get too excited about. Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson stars in his last action role before falling in with Disney. He does a good job as Sarge, head of the tactical team who slowly seems to lose his grip. Watching him in this movie reminds me of a time when I thought he was going to be one of the next great action stars. Karl Urban is John Grimm, one of the few marines on the team with a good head on his shoulders, and the beautiful Rosamund Pike is his sister Samantha, a researcher on the station who helps them determine what has occurred. The rest of the team are a couple of familiar faces that only exists in the film so the demons have something to chew on.I've been a major fan of the games since the first was released for the PC and I felt this movie was a faithful enough of an adaptation that I managed to enjoy it's simple offerings. I was put off a bit when the screenwriters changed the demons origins from occult to scientific but I dealt with it. If you're in the mood for a decent sci-fi action and one of the Rock's last good action roles, this movie is worth the time.",Doom

I'll just paste the one on the main page right in here: Based on the hit computer game about Marines sent to investigate what went wrong on a scientific research center on Mars where they face an evil unlike any other. OK, that's what it's about. If you look at the previews for this movie, you see a lot of action and monsters but the trailers are misleading. Once I watched this movie, there is not many action scene I expected or many good monsters. The beginning have an action scene, and the end have some action scenes. What about in the middle? Some. Yep, some. Maybe a little, to be correct. I almost slept through the movie but made myself watch the whole thing. This film is OK. The plot of the movie is weak. Some good things about the film is the first shooter sequence, looking like you're playing a game but you're watching a movie. To tell you the truth, I liked the ending. That's the only thing I like. If you expect a lot of action scenes, there are little. If you are expecting huge crazy-looking monsters, you'll get some but not many. I recommend you to rent this movie. If you are a die hard fan of the game, I don't know what you should do. You may be disappointed or you'll be satisfied.",Doom
62,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Doom"" delivers on some levels, fails others...",5,26 March 2006,"I remember first hearing about ""Doom: The Movie"" a bit over 10 years ago, when I was a young kid addicted to video games. This was back in the mid nineties, when Arnold Schwarzenegger was still attached to play the main character, and it was supposed to come out around the same time as other monster hits like ""Independence Day."" It never came out, but my optimism for the movie still remained. I always wanted to see the demons and monsters of Hell on the big screen, being blasted away by a heroic Marine on remote research facilities on the moons of Mars.When I heard about the film actually being in production in 2005, I was less optimistic. My boyhood fantasy of monsters and action gave way to realizations that the story might not be that great... that the movie might be little more than pure, nonstop thrills, without suspense... That I might actually hate it.Once I saw the film, I realized that the biggest problem it probably has was that it was even made. Don't get me wrong, the film did have some strong points, but they were trivial when you look at the bigger picture.You see, in Video-Games, the story serves action. You don't play an action based game to get a memorable story, (With few exceptions) you play games to get thrills and entertainment. Whereas, in movies, the action is supposed to serve the story-- the complete polar opposite of a video game-- hence, creating a film out of a pure action-fest like ""Doom"" would be a challenge.The first thing that went was the original story. No longer does the game take place on the moons of Mars, and no longer is a portal to Hell opened, unleashing hordes of the undead demonic forces from beyond. ""Doom"" the movie deals with an alien race that lived on Mars, made up of humanoid beings whose genetic experimentation would eventually create monsters that destroyed them (As revealed in the film). Now the monsters are infecting humans and only a elite team of marines can stop them from getting to Earth.That is the basic plot, in a nutshell. It sounds promising, but the film moves too fast, too quick, and you never really connect with the characters. However, the film does capture some elements of the game rather well. You can see several classic ""Doom"" monsters, which is a joy to gamers like myself. There is also a very well executed ""first-person"" sequence that recreates the entire feeling of playing a ""Doom"" video game. But aside from these few up points, the movie is your standard zombie-'n-monster bullet-fest, with just enough originality to save it from movie oblivion.Overall, I wouldn't recommend ""Doom"" to hardcore game fans, but I would recommend it to anybody who just likes a fast, fun, sometimes cheesy but always action packed ride.",Doom

64,MartianOctocretr5,Decent sci-fi episode flawed in places,5,25 November 2006,"The plot jumps off to a pretty good start. Scientists on Mars inadvertently release something that starts killing off people. So you have the routine of a bunch of Marines with serious firepower dispatched to the scene to restore order.Many of the story lines in the movie are rehashed. The Marines echo Aliens, the Arc is styled after Stargate's transporter, and there are many other examples. The story also uses a zombie format, in that some of the humans are infected and morphed into creatures. You have the usual government conspiracy to cover things up going on, and all the tough-guy army guy cliché lines are in place. As usual, some idiot scriptwriter decided we should look at somebody puking every few minutes--completely pointless. However, one of the Marines, John Grimm (Karl Urban), and his scientist sister Samantha (Rosamund Pike) are interesting enough characters to actually care about. Sarge, played excellently by the Rock, is surprisingly a fairly complex character. He is suitably ferocious and adds to the film.As the lower status characters get predictably eliminated one by one, the film starts to falter. When the scene with a first person perspective of a video game player emerges, it detracts from what interest you still may have at that point. This (fortunately brief) sequence wreaks of Uwe Boll mentality, thinking movies and video games are the same kind of entertainment. A real dud of an ending, even though the principal actors approach it enthusiastically.If you like video games or Sci-Fi, maybe you'll like this. All others will be annoyed.",Doom
65,xredgarnetx,OK sci-fi actioner,6,4 February 2006,"For a movie derived from a video game, DOOM could have been a lot worse. It teeters into Uwe Boll territory from time to time, but it keeps moving and is reasonably entertaining as a small band of mercenaries fight an endless army of demons, ghouls and zombies under the surface of Mars. Karl Urban, best known from RIDDICK, is the big, brave hero. The Rock plays the role of the constantly grimacing Sarge, and proves once again he is no threat to Vin Diesel. The sets, obviously shot outside the U.S., are enormous and fascinating. The monsters are OK, no worse or better than the monsters from THE CAVE. The movie goes by quickly and will be forgotten 30 minutes after watching it. So what? That describes most movies. DOOM will make for a great Saturday night entertainment.

66,lambiepie-2,A whole lotta nothing.,1,22 September 2006,"I eagerly awaited watching the film version of one of my favorite video games. When I looked at this mess, I was very disappointed. This was a mess. While many of the elements of the game is there, this movie wasn't a plus for me.Nothing worked for me here - the flat story, the so-so CGI, the actors...you name it. The game is a million times better. Go out, buy or rent the game and play it - you'll have more fun, have more thrills and be more entertained.Let me start with the most obvious: The actors. The Rock sounded like a perfect cast as the Sarg...he looked the perfect cast for the Sarg...he just didn't click with me for the Sarg. ""I'm not supposed to die."" he says at one point, and I took that one of two ways: 1. They paid The Rock as an actor too much to leave the film frames early; 2. Plot points dictate that the lead never dies. Either way I was almost asleep by that point, neither mattered. Then the female lead, she was interesting to watch because everything coming out of her mouth, she seemed very surprised at. The other actors, well, to be honest they did the best they could.About the CGI - yawn, boring. The video game graphics are much better.About the story - well, I found myself not caring and counting how long it would take for the next African American to be killed (it's an unproven theory that in horror pictures, it's the African American character to go first...) Hey, I had to think of something to pay attention to keep me watching this.Also the story seemed to want to pick up the bits and pieces of stories in other films to keep it going. You name it it's all here.To conclude: for fans of the video game, very disappointing fare here - for fans of movies - save your money, nothing new to see here.",Doom
67,mstomaso,"Vacuous, and not very entertaining",1,29 October 2006,"Before I get into this, let me explain where I am coming from: 1. I played all three Doom computer games, but was never very impressed with the ""plots"" so I really don't care about how true this film was to the series.2. I like the Rock, and believe that, given the right sort of script, he is a competent actor.3. I do not expect much from video-game based movies. Occasionally, I am pleasantly surprised by these - for example, the Resident Evil series.It took me five nights to get through this film. While the film did not actually cure my insomnia, it certainly helped. The most noticeable problem is the fact that the film offers about as much character development as the average first person shooter video game does (think Doom, Quake, Unreal, even Counterstrike). Unlike these games, the audience is not offered an opportunity to interact with these characters (most of the audience will want to kill Richard Brake's character within the first 10 minutes of the film), but must sit patiently waiting for them to reveal their true depth (which never happens in Doom) or waiting for something to happen (which doesn't happen enough in Doom). So, with only Karl Urban and Rosamund Pike's characters actually established about half way through the film, the audience finds itself with a horror -suspense plot involving inexplicable genetic alterations that have turned various scientists into evil homicidal mutants on a space station on Mars, and a handful of would-be heroes lead by the Rock (playing a caricature of a military stereotype) which the audience probably could not care less about. The film does jump right back into its origins toward the end, and you will have to watch it to find out what I mean.How could this film have been improved? (1) The first 30 minutes of the film could have employed a script which really created the characters, instead of introducing several stereotypes and too-carefully setting up the incredibly simply and rather silly plot; OR (2) The film could have taken itself much less seriously, and exploited several ample opportunities for comedy. Even that classic abomination ""Battlefield Earth"" took itself less seriously than this; OR (3) The film could have relied more simply on action than character development and plot (see, for example 'Mean Guns' as a successful example of a vacuous, but good action flick.) I can see that there are a lot of people who enjoyed Doom. More power to them! However, I can't recommend it to anybody.",Doom
68,IonicBreezeMachine,Strong individual elements but as a whole falls just shy of the mark.,5,8 April 2021,"After a Union Aerospace Corporation research site, the Ark, on Mars is placed under quarantine, a unit of Marines headed by Sarge (Dwayne Johnson) travels to the site to investigate. Alongside Sarge is fellow Marine John ""Reaper"" Grim (Karl Urban) who must work with his estranged sister Sam (Rosamund Pike) in securing UAC research. As the marine's sweep the base, they discover the quarantine has been triggered by bioengineering research on Alien DNA resulting in a multitude of hellish creatures being loosed upon the facility. With Sarge's mentally stability growing more tenuous as time goes on and marines dropping like flies John tries to stop the spread and save his sister.Released in 1993, Doom alongside fellow Id Software game Wolfenstein 3D from 1992, are credited with helping to established the first person shooter genre as one of, if not the most, popular genres in video gaming. Development on a Doom movie began in 1995 with the release of the 2nd game, Doom II: Hell on Earth and was in various stages of development at studios like Universal, Columbia, and Warner Bros. Over a period of 10 years. The project was stalled for a myriad of reasons be it financial, casting, or producer mandates, but a major sticking point for the movie was the violence which along with the Satanic imagery the game is known for made potentially interested buyers shy away from the project especially in the wake of the game's undeserved association with a tragedy in 1999 with the moral panic on violent video games being reignited by the Columbine Massacre. The film regained momentum in 2004 thanks to the success of Doom 3 on PC and Xbox and a script loosely incorporated elements from the hit game and signed promising up and coming wrestling star turned action star The Rock (Dwayne Johnson). It's just a shame after a ten year journey, the movie feels so underwhelming.In the opening scenes where we see glimpses of the disaster on mars (complete with an altered Universal logo replacing Earth with Mars) it seems like we're in for some violent schlocky fun, but then we get to Earth and meet our Marine characters and it's clear that this movie has no intention of being Doom, it wants to be Aliens. While Doom 3 is a divisive entry in the series due to being less action heavy than the first two and more a survival horror, it still maintains the core of the series with one man against the forces of Hell on mars, Doom from its inception has always been something of a Rambo/Commando with Hellraiser visuals, and even though Doom 3 shifted gears to survival horror it kept the general idea. Doom the movie does away with that idea. Rather than having the movie build itself around the central point of one man vs Hell. It instead drops Hell entirely from the film and goes in more of a biopunk route as seen with Paul W. S. Anderson's Resident Evil films, because the movie makes the mistake of ""grounding"" itself by removing the fantasy elements only 3 (possibly 4) of the monsters from the Doom series make an appearance in the movie and the more elaborate and out there designs aren't even entertained.While Doom dropping the game's central concept is disappointing, it could at least be forgiven if the action were good and the horror were scary. Despite the movie's attempts to ape Aliens, it doesn't do either the action or horror elements particularly well. In the opening 50 minutes we're watching characters who's faces we can't see stumble around in the dark with flash lights, with maybe the occasional jump scare or a gun or fistfight that's overcut and filled with flashing lights so we can't see what's going on. The movie's director, Andrzej Bartkowiak, served as a cinematographer on a number of high profile action films in the 90s including Speed, Lethal Weapon 4, and Dante's Peak so theoretically Bartkowiak should be just fine handling a film like this. But to look at his filmography as a director with forgettable titles like Romeo Must Die, Exit Wounds, and Cradle 2 the Grave it's not surprising this movie isn't the best in that department.The movie does have a few positives that make it somewhat enjoyable. The creature effects are actually visually pretty faithful to the game and have a sense of weight and presence thanks to the experience hands of special effects artist Stan Winston (Terminator, Jurassic Park). While the creature work isn't ground breaking it is at least well done. Dwayne Johnson despite fronting the film in the advertising actually plays a rather dark character who starts out like a standard marine archetype, but as the film goes on becomes more violent and willing to engage in acts of evil for ""the mission"", it's actually a solid performance from Johnson and gives the rather dull first 2/3rds of the movie something with a bit more meat to chew on. Karl Urban is pretty decent as our lead, and the movie does play against expectations by having Rosamund Pike play Urban's sister rather than a tacked on love interest as typical for this kind of movie and Urban while somewhat dialed back in the opening gets to establish himself more around the hour mark where the movie becomes fun and starts resembling Doom.Doom, like many video game movies that came before it, isn't good but it comes close to being good. It falls just short of reaching the level of the first Mortal Kombat movie, but it more than exceeds most of its contemporaries. The movie makes the mistake of playing itself for horror rather than straight up action and feels like Aliens without proper build up or establishment. It had all the right pieces, it just needed someone better equipped to assemble them.",Doom
69,sarastro7,Pretty good - all things considered,7,4 November 2005,"I'd heard that those who've played the game would like this movie, while those who hadn't, wouldn't. I'm not a game player, and my reaction to the movie seems to go against the grain. I think there were some good things in here.Most B-movies start out pretty good, then deteriorate terribly as they progress. Doom was different. It started out with a lot of unexciting skulking around in dark corridors (yawn), with only a tiny hint of a cool sci-fi plot about some long-dead super-people on Mars with 24 chromosomes. I hoped they would go into that plot, but for the longest time it didn't seem as if they were.But the last 20 minutes or so are GREAT! The plot unravels, the monsters are explained as the ones that turned bad from experimental exposure to the 24th chromosome, AND we even get a guy that ""turns good"" by being injected with it! And so, this hero being super-strong, super-fast, and super-smart, he can go perfectly through ""the game"", taking out all the threats! That is totally cool. And we also get a climactic fisticuff blow-out with the formidable The Rock in the end! I was extremely satisfied with this ending, and elated to finally see a movie with a GOOD ending, when endings is usually what Hollywood sucks the most at.This is totally Karl Urban's movie. I now have the respect for him that Chronicles of Riddick failed to impart.I'm not saying this movie is an immortal classic. Far from it. And it does leave several plot holes unfilled. And has long stretches of boring corridors. But, all things considered, it wasn't bad at all. I'd definitely see it again sometime.6 stars out of 10.",Doom
70,mentalcritic,"Not as bad as originally forecast, but far from good",5,3 November 2005,"The concept of films based upon video games has had a rough history, thanks in no small part to being mostly dominated by films so bad that a viewer could be forgiven for thinking that someone brought Ed Wood back to life. Doom falls somewhere in the middle. It is not as terrible as the Wing Commander adaptation, Resident Evil: Apocalypse or House Of The Dead. But it is nowhere near as surprisingly good as the first Resident Evil film turned out to be. In order to learn why, one must consider the history of the film. Rumours and studio politics at one point had it that Doom was going to be made with the PG-13 rating in mind. Thankfully, someone at the studio took the powers that be aside and reminded them that when one studio tried to take R-rated subject material and make it PG-13 in order to make enough money to save the studio, it resulted in their bankruptcy. Unfortunately, the MPAA's attitude that every film must be suitable only for five year olds met them halfway, and the result is a film that tries so hard to capture the essence of the subject material, but falls so very short.The plot, such as it is, concerns an emergency on a Martian research station where a gateway for instant travel has been developed. The references to biblical mythology have been scaled back, but unfortunately, the worst of them rather than the best remain. Add to that some patently stupid ideas as the soul being in the part of the Human genome that hasn't been mapped in 2020-odd (which they actually finished mapping *years* ago), and you have a screenplay that utterly shoots the actors in the foot. It is a testament to the acting skills of Karl Urban and Rosamund Pike that they can keep this clunker going in spite of such ridiculousness. The rest of the film seems to borrow its ideas mainly from Doom 3, the black sheep of the series that many of us who downloaded the demo of the original through a 14.4 kilobaud connection pretend is not canon at all. ID Software lost the very thing that made them innovative when John Romero left, and nowhere does it show more than in Doom 3's annoying, boring combat. By basing itself mostly on Doom 3, Doom the film inherits most of its flaws.Fans of the real Doom who are hoping for an ensemble scene in which Human marines face off against hordes of Imps, Demons, Spectres, and the like will be sorely disappointed. As a matter of fact, references to the BFG aside, you will be hard pressed to identify any connection to the Doom we all know and love. I would not be surprised to learn that this film was originally intended to be a quick Aliens knock-off, when a film studio managed to get the rights to Doom out of ID. What little we see of the main demon creatures in this film resemble a cross between Godzilla and the creatures from Aliens. A monster from Doom 3 whose designation I could never quite remember makes an appearance late in the film, but aside from one character going all dark side on us towards the end, there is little to satisfy the true reason most of the audience would be there. Even that final fight scene was neutered by some of the worst fight scene photography I have seen in a while, with the camera either being too close or pointed in the wrong direction for the viewer to get vaguely invested. To their credit, at least they did not shake the camera in a vague effort to appease the MPAA.The most controversial segment of the film is by far the first-person sequence, and yes, it is a very poor idea. First person might work as a gimmick in video games, but it is not very pleasant to watch on a hundred-foot projection screen. Roger Ebert hit the nail on the head, at least about this sequence, when he said that Doom the film was like watching Doom 3 over the shoulder of a brother who will not let you play. Given the fact that Doom cost some ninety million to make, the on screen results are disappointing to say the least. The film feels more like an update of the 1980s clunker The Fly II, which cost a fraction of this price to make and was much more satisfying to watch. About the only reason to watch the film is Rosamund Pike, who could have a great future ahead of her if she could just get her agent to stand up and get her some decent roles. Karl Urban also manages to waste what little fame he gained from the LOTR adaptations, which some might see as poetic justice. The Rock... well, he is the Rock. Heaven help us if they decide to make a film out of Quake or Rise Of The Triad.I gave Doom a five out of ten. It is neither good enough to be memorable, nor is it bad enough to be good. It is the walking definition of a film stuck in no man's land. See it only if you want to stimulate your imagination regarding how you would do it better.",Doom
71,jeremycrimsonfox,Feel More Like A Resident Evil Film,3,21 April 2021,"Doom is one of the legendary video game franchises of all time, and this movie does not do a good job at replicating it (although I will give it credit for being tolerable compared to its reboot, Doom: Annihilation). In this film, a spec ops team led by Sarge (played by Dwayne Johnson, a.k.a. The Rock) are sent to the Olduvai research facility on Mars following a report of a level five breach. One marine,John Grimm, codename Reaper (played by Karl Urban) is told to stay behind, but he goes on the mission, as his sister, Samantha (played by. Rosamund Pike) is a scientist at the facility. However, nothing has prepared the team for the horrors awaiting them.Doom is another video game-based film that was never well received in theaters. One of the main reasons is it does not follow the source material well, as the protagonist is given a name instead of being called Doomguy, and instead of being demons like in the games, the monsters are redone to be humans mutated from being injected with a serum made from the remains of an ancient skeleton (which sounds like they basically stole some plot from the Resident Evil series). Speaking of mutants, other than select enemies like the Hell Knight and Pinky Demon, most of them are basically mostly blood-stained psychopaths and even some looking like they were taken from a generic zombie film. It gets three stars mainly because The Rock's acting and the first person sequence near the end make this more tolerable than its DTV reboot.",Doom

He was brave and professionalit was bad sarge killed doctor. Maybe they could reverse it and he could become human again.sarge was cool at first but started to be cruel. Because he was paid for getting data back. We learned it later.it was interesting scene where john would almost kill sarge but then monsters came and they united. it was like zombie kill.John is eomer from lord of the rings :)In the end before fight, reaper say ""semper fi"". It means something like ""always faithful"" and also there is a 2019 movie in that name.So main idea is ""Don't go to another planets :)""POV scene which is close to ending was cool.There is a movie in 2019, like something remake i think. I will watch it also later.",Doom
74,one9eighty,Doomed to be average,6,7 December 2020,"The 2005 film ""Doom"" is based on a popular video game of the same name which was one of the forerunners of first person-shooters. Directed by Andrzej Bartkowiak and written by Dave Callaham and Wesley Strick, this adaption had a reported budget of $60 million which afforded its official version a 105-minute runtime, and an a-list cast which included Dwayne Johnson, Karl Urban and Rosamund Pike to name but a few.Its 2046, a rapid-response UAC (Union Aerospace Corporation) tactical marine squad is sent to a scientific research facility on the one of the moons of Mars. The last transmission that came from the facility mentioned a level 5 lockdown and since then nothing has been heard. The UAC marines are to infiltrate and neutralise any threats, preserving as much of the scientific research as possible. As they scour the facility it becomes obvious that they are up against something inhuman. The marines are slowly killed off until only a few remain, it quickly becomes a battle to survive and escape.As a fan of the video game franchise since 1993, I approached this with a lot of fear. Video game to film conversions are not generally done successfully (""Super Mario Bros"", ""Street Fighter"", ""Mortal Kombat"", ""Sonic the Hedgehog"", ""Tomb Raider"", ""Double Dragon"", ""Silent Hill"", ""Rampage"", ""Hitman"", ""Warcraft"", ""Assassins Creed"", ""Prince of Persia"".... Yuk!), usually something is sacrificed that detracts from the experience that the video game gives you. It is fair to say that games are more of an immersive experience, but it is not even that that I mean - film versions seem to take the subject material and bend it into something completely different and almost unrecognisable. I am afraid that this Doom film falls into that category - the film feels like something which is inspired very loosely on small parts of the video games, rather than something that truly reflects it, or expands the franchise. It takes concepts that at least 3-5 different games have built up, and then changes them for artistic purposes. As an example, the dimensional gates that are established in the games as the reason why hordes of demons are attacking are replaced with genetical experiments and mutation. Instead of demons you are going to see sprinter zombies attacking the marines. There is even something wrong with the marines IMO; in the game it is one man against the armies of hell. Here we have a team of people against the zombies. Sure, interactions and narrative help the audience understand and comprehend, but one mans' plight to survive might just have made a more gripping film rather than dumbing it down so that kids could watch this. In reflection - it would probably have been better not calling this film ""Doom"", instead calling it anything else that reflects the generic content, such as ""Space Marines fight zombies in Space"" or ""Space Zombie Apocalypse"". Linking the film to the game franchise has not done the film, or the video game any favours. So, to be fair to it, I am going to talk about this film as a generic film for the rest of this write up, and not part of Doom canon.The characters in this film are standard and cliché to any ""space marine vs alien"" kind of film. The stars of the show are Karl Urban and Dwayne Johnson. Urban gives a gritty ""get the job done"" attitude which would later lend itself well to his role in ""Dredd"". As far as Dwayne Johnson is concerned, at this early point in his career his roles seemed to be remarkably similar: Beefed hardman who is occasionally funny, put into random situation. The best thing about Johnson in this is that despite it being relatively early in his career, we get to see him being the bad guy for a bit (it could not be any worse than what we see at the end of ""The Scorpion King"", could it?). I feel that the script let the cast down a little, it did not do any favours for Urban and Johnson either. At times it felt like the dialogue was as cliché and predictable as the characters being portrayed. As far as Rosamund Pike was concerned, I can only assume she was added to tick a box, or as a narrative vehicle to explain to the theoretical science to the dumb audience. Humour and tension did not seem to hit the mark, because it all felt too, well... it felt too scripted and forced.
There was a lot of CGI and a bit of practical effects thrown into the mix too, it generally looked decent to cheesy. Some parts could have been darker and grittier though, particularly the zombies/monsters - I did not feel that they were all that nasty looking.As far as keeping me entertained, the film just about got away with it. But as far as keeping me fully engaged/absorbed and tense, it failed there I am afraid. IMO the best part of the film comes later on for about 2-3 minutes of screen time when everything goes first-person-shooter style. By which time this is too little, too late.This is just another example of a film failing to stand up to the video game it was based on. Doom it really isn't - but what it is through a generic space-marine-fighting-zombies-that-have-been-created-from-experiments film. I expect to see this repeated on free cable channels for years to come. Nothing spectacular, not terrible, but far from great.",Doom
75,carbuff,My Everest,5,22 April 2021,"Why did I watch this ""Doom"". Basically, because it was there (and coming off Netflix streaming). I've played minimal videogames in my life, so I wanted a better idea of what they're all about, which, I think, comes across especially well near the end with a bunch of first-person shooter stuff.I'm not familiar with the whole backstory behind the story, except that I know it was made to capitalize on the popular videogame's success. At heart, it's the same thing as ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", which was made to capitalize on a popular amusement park ride. Both are fundamentally equally lame plot-wise and are not much more than special effects vehicles. (I'd definitely give the edge to ""Pirates"" on this matter).Normally, I'd rate this movie somewhere between a 2 to a 4 depending on how I was feeling that night, except that in this case, I knew exactly what I was getting myself into--meaning if you set aside the bombs and guns, ""Doom"" was predictable and underwhelming.Still the film served it's purpose for me, given that I was only after some more pop cultural knowledge--otherwise this is a total waste of time. At least I haven't spent countless hours playing these games, and now I have a better idea of what they're like after reading so many game reviews. This movie further convinces me that I'm not going to start playing games like this though.",Doom

77,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Hollywood is a mad scientist,6,22 October 2005,"One of the most controversial and most popular video games finally its shake at the big screen with mixed results.The story starts with an emergency on a research facility located on Mars. Some nasty demons are making lunch of the people there and a team of super tough marines led by The Rock are called to investigate problem. Soon some secrets that the researchers hid are uncovered and carnage ensues.Director Andzrej Bartkowiak throws in many clichés and the film overall feels uninspired. In the trailer there was a quick glimpse of the use of first person point of view, a great ode to the game, but that was tragically underused and only in one sequence. Since this movie is essentially aimed at fans of the game why only include one scene with what they remember most from the game? If the use of first person was in more than just that one scene, such as when the marines explore dark caverns and open doors, it would have made the movie: a) more exciting to watch and given it a more inspired look, b) would have been more like the game. How many times since ""Aliens"" have we seen marines exploring dark hallways? I mean seriously, start counting. Then the one movie which could have shown it in a very different way omits the idea.The other glaring point of annoyance is genetic experimentation. In the game there were mutations, but they were formed differently and the game's story cleverly omitted the mad scientist cliché which the movie somehow thought to embrace. It seems that Hollywood take all sorts of material (most notably hit foreign films) and transforms it into its own conservative creation. Maybe Hollywood is the real mad scientist, except one that is afraid to experiment with something new and just tries clockwork formulas on most material it works with.On the flip side the gore effects and production design were cool and will undoubtedly please the intended audience. Even the infamous BFG 9000 makes an appearance. Throw in bits of humor here and there, a decent climatic fight scene between two super-humans and you've got a decent action/horror film that strays just a little too far from its source. 6/10Rated R: strong violence/gore and profanity",Doom

79,tomimt,Perfectly good action film,7,1 December 2007,"Doom the movie was in the making form the moment Doom the game hit the shelves in the 90's. The game was a revolution, that kicked in the high gear for a genre, that is still one of the main genres of gaming: First Person Shooters. The game didn't have much of a plot, you just ran around, collected key cards and pressed some buttons and pulled some levers. And in the end you pressed a button to end the level. Doom 3 came about decade later and it wasn't as much of a key card hunt, it did have a kind of plot, but the main core of the game was with the shooting and staying alive.So, finally, after a long time and many rebooted attempts later, even one which was rumoured Arnold Schwarzenegger to star, Doom 3 enabled Andrzej Bartkowiak to helm the movie project. And to be honest, this probably is the best possible way to do the film based on an almost plot less game.So Sarge (The Rock) is leading his party of marines in a research center located in Mars. John Grimm (Karl Urban) is one of his men, who happens to have a sister (Rosamund Pike) in that same center, now over-run by monsters. So first we see some thrills and spooks and then in the end we get some action to the final duel.Of what little plot there actually was in the Doom games, the partition containing hell was removed, which was a good thing in my opinion, as it never was fully functional part of series in my opinion. Hell levels always did flatten the games atmosphere, as they were quite annoying, or at least that is my opinion. The plot of the movie now revolves more tightly around archaeological dig in Mars and remains of an alien race found from there. Scinetist, those silly little buggers, have been playing god again, which causes the problems in the base, when a chromosome extract created from the DNA map of the aliens starts to kick it, mutating the poor saps.The special effect were okay and the atmosphere was good. The script, even though it wasn't a by any means greatest thing ever written worked pretty well despite of the clichés. Only thing, that didn't feel right for the film was the infamous FPS scene, which broke down the tension and at least I found it hilarious and out of context. But it wasn't a bad scene. Just in the wrong film.I'm happy to give this film 7 stars, as it did entertain me. Couldn't have asked more.",Doom
80,DonFishies,"Silly, but silly on purpose.",5,21 February 2006,"The crew clearly knew they had to have fun with this movie, and it shows in the way it was made. There are homages to the game series all over the place, and the over-acting is just hilarious. A few good one-liners here and there too.The First-Person-Shooter sequence is a trip, and is something everyone should watch, even if it is just for kicks. It clearly can't be taken seriously, but it makes for a great laugh when watching. It's probably the most authentically true thing to the game, in the entire movie.But the film is not all fun and games. The entire plot is cliché-ridden (to the point that I was rhyming off lines, and knowing exactly what was coming mere seconds before it showed), and is totally not truthful with the original storyline. Instead, it seems like it just rips from other movies, and attempts to make it sound a little more plausible than the game's plot-line.And while The Rock is a great character actor, he overshadows main character Karl Urban a bit too much for his own good. The supporting cast are most throwaway characters, and its a shame because there were more than a few times they could have pulled off some clever sub-plots to make up for the silliness.I can't deny that it didn't entertain me for 2 hours though.5/10.",Doom

You earn your place on any specialized team. The team members are invariably (1) smarter than the average civilian, (2) more mature than the average civilian, and (3) more motivated and disciplined than the average civilian.It really burns me when I see these teams (imaginary though they may be) depicted as ad-hoc assemblages of near-lunatic military personnel...griping about doing their job, showing little respect or concern for fellow team member, and usually staying just this side of openly rebelling against their immediate superiors.OK, so the efficiency and professionalism of military teams isn't supposed to be a major theme in this type of movie, but it is still very jarring and a very poor way to introduce you to the plot. I'd have been much more comfortable if the team going into the facility had just been a team of civilian hunters or whatever.3 out of 10 stars because the movie ""goes dumb"" from the start.",Doom

There's nothing else to recommend about this dreary little movie. It's not exciting, it's not scary, the SFX aren't impressive and the screenplay is entirely derivative of Aliens and Resident Evil. But is it a good adaptation of the classic ""first-person shooter"" game, you ask? Well...yes and no. Like the game Doom, the movie Doom is dark and claustrophobic and deeply disturbing. Like the game, the movie is crass and gross and perhaps on the wrong side of good taste. But, you know, I enjoyed playing the game, excessive as it was. I didn't really enjoy the movie.What went wrong? I'll tell you what. There's not enough creatures in the movie. The game is packed, wall-to-wall, with cool demons - pig demons, minotaur demons, flaming skull demons. The movie basically features only one creature, a lumbering thing barely glimpsed in the shadows.Where's the fireball-lobbing Imps? The floating, one-eyed Cacodemons? Hollywood wimped out completely with this one. All we get in this lame-o adaptation are the same boring zombies that've been cluttering up the silver screen for about five years now. It's the creatures, stupid! I wanted more creatures.The movie also should take place partially in Hell...y'know, like the game does. Turning the villains into genetic mutations is a pointless dulling of the original Doom concept.All that aside, I did enjoy a few key scenes - diamonds in the gloomy rough. The interplay between Pike and Karl Urban is genuinely warm and believable. It's an interesting twist that the hero and heroine are brother and sister instead of - ho-hom - a romantic item. I also appreciate the Rock's slow descent into ruthlessness. His moral debates with the other soldiers are decent drama.But for every good scene, there's at least three scenes of a pointless, lousy character like Portman taking drugs or going to the bathroom. Tacky stuff, man.Did I expect a masterpiece? Nah. But I expected to be more entertained than I was. Ultimately, all I got outta Doom was a headache, and a desire to see its charismatic leads in another movie.",Doom
84,Antagonisten,Lacking all the aspects that make a good action movie,2,30 November 2005,"Movies based on video games seem to be a hopeless thought. And it's not so strange really. Considering that most successful games are heavily influenced by movies in different ways it becomes almost a contradiction when movies are then being based on games...""Doom"" is like some sort of mixture between on one hand ""Aliens"" and on the other movies like ""Resident Evil"". The ""Resident Evil""-similarities are striking in many cases, which is perhaps not so strange considering that they are both video games, although games of a very different nature. When it comes to the ""Aliens"" part it always seem to me that action movies that put a lot of horror in the mix and places the protagonists on a desolate place try to emulate ""Aliens"". And why not, i hold ""Aliens"" to be among the best action movies ever made and one of my favorite movies regardless of genres.""Doom"" tries to lighten things up with a few small tricks. Like for instance the nod to game-players where they name a few characters after the game's developers, and of course the by now (in)famous ""first-person-view""-scene. What i don't understand though is why they have chosen to leave so much else from the games out. If i remember correctly the monsters in the original ""Doom"" came from a portal to hell that was opened by mistake. Here it's rather some sort of zombie-thing and ancient martians running around. Why they would change things in this way is beyond me.In the end this is just another sad action movie lacking all the aspects that make a GOOD action movie. There is no pulse-raising action, there is no true excitement. Rather ""Doom"" barely has a pulse at all. It's one of those movies where they think it's enough to have guys with huge biceps running around with huge weapons talking like military caricatures. This is simply a movie that would never have been made at all if it weren't for the fact that thousands of gaming fans will be at least a little bit intrigued - perhaps enough to actually pay for a ticket or a rental.2/10",Doom
85,departed07,Skip the movie and play the games.,5,22 April 2008,"""Doom"" is one of the many movies from a video game that needs to come to life. It worked once or twice with Mortal Kombat in 1995 followed by Lara Croft: Tomb Raider in 2001 and maybe Resident Evil in 2002 while others from Street Fighter to Double Dragon have failed to live up to fans expectations. Here's another movie.Based on the popular computer software game, the movie Doom is about a group of marines being called on once a base has been attacked by gruesome things that can't be described. The team is led by Sarge (played by the Rock) a bad ass soldier who doesn't take crap from anybody and Karl Urban from the Lord of the Rings trilogy plays John Grimm who refuses to ditch the assignment. Once they get on to another planet, all hell breaks loose where the marines realize that they are dealing with human monsters followed by a creature that can't be stopped.I remember hearing back in the nineties that a movie was to be made with George Clooney as the hero in the film; whatever happened to that? I would've liked it seeing that George had already sliced and diced his way in ""From Dusk Till Dawn"".

This likes somewhere in the middle. The special effects were really well done and the acting was spot on. The is packed full of suspense, gore and emotion. You can see the emotions from each character, and the actions of The Rock's character can really affect you. Seeing him stay to his orders and kill the innocent soldier and others can really turn you against him.About 3 3/4 into the movie, the story can take a strange twist, which caused much confusion within me. A character passing out or dieing (still don't know), and reappearing in another room fully equipped with ammo explained nothing to me. I still don't understand why Rosamund Pike's character decided to leave and was suddenly found again later when leaving.The scene which was designed as part of the game was cleverly created and was amazing to watch, but i felt that it went on too long, and had too much movement and added more confusion.If you want a fun blood and guts movie to watch, this will do, but be prepared to be puzzled.",Doom
87,Al_The_Strange,Doom review,5,2 October 2013,"In 1993, the video game Doom was released with resounding success and extreme controversy. Its legacy is massive: the game presented the dawn of a new style and genre of gaming, pushing the envelope of graphics, technology, and gameplay. Adapting this classic game for the big screen would have been a promising opportunity on many levels.I was thoroughly surprised when this film was released in 2005 with shockingly little fanfare; perhaps it was under-marketed for a reason. As it is, the Doom film is a tragically missed opportunity; the filmmakers could have drawn upon many aspects from the games to make something really scary and really badass. Instead, it looks like the filmmakers took the surface-level aspects of the games and slapped them together in a passionless and generic fashion. The film has all the dark and high-tech settings of Doom 3, plus one BFG (gamers will know what this is), a handful of ""demons,"" and a smattering of shootouts and fights (including one scene shot entirely FPS-style). The film, however, lumbers along haphazardly, stringing together random encounters and action scenes with the bare minimum plot development and an entire cast of shallow characters who serve as little more than monster-fodder. Even if you look at it on its own merits, the story is not that interesting.The biggest crime I see about this film is that it omits so much that would have been cinematically awe-inspiring. Hell does not exist in the film, so all the demons on-screen are explained away with a totally different (and rather inane) explanation. The premise of a transporter accident causing one of Mars' moons to disappear is not used. That also means that none of the characters actually go to Hell to fight the onslaught of demons, the way it happens in the games. That also means that all the signature demons (the big fleshy ball of teeth, the fire-throwing imps, and the gargantuan cyberdemon) are absent. Any of the horror or thrills from all these aspects are gone with them; the games crafted an unnerving and adrenaline-inducing experience with their use of combat, lighting, level design, and aesthetics; the movie never strives to do the same on any level.Despite all that is stripped away from the film, it does have its moments. It is loaded with loud action and gnarly blood and gore; it may satisfy if you approach it as an action-packed B-movie. There are actually three specific things I find most redeeming about the film: the opening title and logo screens (with the Universal logo flying around Mars, and the Doom title filling up the screen, it all looks and sounds fairly cool), the music (an awesome score by Clint Mansell, and one decent NIN song), and the last 13 minutes. Within the last act, the film contains one of the awesomest action scenes I know of; a six-minute sequence filmed entirely as a POV shot, made to replicate the exact look and style of an FPS game. Those six minutes crams in more awesome stuff than the rest of the movie, and is worth a look on its own. Afterward, the film pulls out an interesting plot twist that really challenges the moral stances of the characters, and digs up a few key themes regarding the ""demon"" within the human spirit. Unfortunately, such themes are buried knee-deep in the bodies of so many other ideas that have been brutally shot up and mutated beyond recognition.Aside from the ever-awesome FPS scene, the film looks bland and ugly, with standard (rarely great) photography and editing. Most scenes appear dark and drab. Acting is pretty mixed: I generally enjoyed Dwayne Johnson and Karl Urban in their roles, but I didn't care for the others (not even Rosamund Pike, who also contributed to the blandness of the entire cast). All the soldier characters do their best to add some serious machismo to the mix, but it can be quite over-the-top at times. Writing is pretty bad, especially with so many lame game-related lines thrown in (I seriously don't need The Rock to shout out ""Game on!"" and ""BFG, big f***ing gun!"" to understand that this movie was based on a game. Ugh). This production uses some okay-looking sets, props, costumes, special effects, and make-up effects, but the designs bear little in common with the original games, further obliterating any connection to the source material. As mentioned before, the music is really great.Doom, the film, is passable as a glorified B-movie, on a level not too far off from an Uwe Boll picture (would probably make an okay double-feature with the god-awful Alone in the Dark). Unfortunately, for a game series that had such a deep impact on the gaming industry and on our culture, this is not the movie that Doom deserves.Not recommended. Look up the movie's FPS scene on youtube, and play the games, instead.2.5/5 (Entertainment: Average | Story: Poor | Film: Poor)",Doom
88,emperor_bender,awful awful awful,1,27 September 2007,"Just when I thought movies couldn't get any lower, they drop this bomb on us. First of all, the Rock's character was laughable. He was some sadistic guy, who killed his own teammates whom everyone was supposed to follow? Come on! He killed ""The Kid"" for finding a group of survivors and wanting to save them, was that terrible or is it just me?. Then to make matters worse he kills the survivors later, nice job doing your mission there Dwayne. and I just love the saying ""I'm not supposed to die!"" when hes being dragged away, the hell you aren't Rock. He even returns later as the bad guy, what a real soldier. He doesn't deserve to have ""Semper Fi"" tattooed on his back, hes a disgrace. Portman was a sad knock-off of Quagmire or something. ALl movie hes being a pervert but sucks at doing it. He gets killed while taking a dump. Also there's ""Goat"", the overly god-fearing person whom cuts himself if he uses the lords name in vein. The guy blows their cover when they're in a cave by making noise, but has time to holster his weapon, pull out his knife and cut himself. Forgive me for asking but isn't cutting yourself more of a sin than saying ""God dammit""? If Im wrong I'll shut up. Then there's ""Mac"" who's in the movie a total of 2 seconds. There's ""Pinky"", the wheel-chaired guy who, when he finally takes a stand, gets killed and turned into some freak. The ONLY good character was the main character, John Grimm (Karl Urban). He seems to be the only one with personality. And the whole 1st person scene wasn't bad. Im glad he kicked the Rock's ass at the end. Over all, god awful movie.

89,daniel-mannouch,boring Alien rip off with only one good set piece to it's name.,3,30 March 2020,"2005's Doom is yet another derivative of 1979's Alien, perhaps the most unofficially remade film of all time. Space marine stereotypes are abound as well as alien parasites and cramped, dark spaces. The Doom movie for the most part does not look anything at all like the video game and instead looks like your average, bland as hell sci-actioner from the early 2000's.The cast is also quite bad with Rocky looking unsure of himself as well as Rosamund Pike being utterly terrible in this. At least her performance was noticeable. Everyone else seemed to be just there. The only good thing about Doom is it's first person shooter sequence which is rightfully so the most famous set piece of this film. Perhaps a little too bold for 2005 to have the entire film look like this, but it would be an improvement for sure. Though not capturing the full atmosphere of the video game, it was surely unique and i would take that over another Alien rip off any day of the goddamn week. Doom the movie is not at all good. Catch the first person sequence on Youtube, then forget about it. You're not missing out.",Doom
90,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,Don't DOOM yourself to sitting through this,2,24 October 2005,"First of all, I don't know WHY this movie is called DOOM. It has absolutely ZERO of the elements that make the game great, and that make the game DOOM. The elements of HELL are not existent. None of the signature creature appear in the film. And the movie does not even pull of a DARK or SERIOUS vibe, unlike the game.Now talking about it as a film... Well, let's see. All the characters are completely unappealing, uninteresting, and have nothing to offer to the audience. No reason to care what happens to them, etc etc etc. The acting is just as bad as the script. Which is absolutely HORRIBLE. These are those kind of one-liners where you don't laugh, you just want to hunt down the screenwriter and throw a noose around his neck and let him hang every time one of those one-liners gets spit out.The sets are cheap, boring, and cliché. You feel like you are watching a bunch of dudes at a laser tag place the whole time. Nothing REALLY happens throughout the entire movie. You will feel like men in spacesuits are just walking around this laser tag base with guns for 2 hours...for no reason. None of the big events occurring matter, and you won't care. The plot is so bad it feels like there isn't a plot at all.I didn't even like Resident Evil when that came out. It was a huge disappointment. Well...this movie feels like a cheap take on THAT film... Except lowered THREE grades.The special FX are for the most part...bullcrap. Some terrible terrible CGI. There is some decent gore throughout but not enough to make the viewing worthwhile whatsoever. It doesn't come close to making up for the attempts at ""acting"" and ""entertaining"" you will be witnessing on the screen.Most of the creatures in the movie...which don't appear till well after half way through... Aren't interesting, aren't that intimidating, aren't that creative, and don't compare whatsoever to the original game creatures, which were more like something that a genius like Clive Barker would think up.Basically i could pull a better movie out of my behind. Most TROMA films are better then this... I mean c'mon...that MEANS something. Take a hint, you guys.I say go out and get HELLRAISER...and SIN CITY or some other action movie like it. Mix the two together and you get what DOOM should have been.Instead, it's a just a TITLE used to make some money by a film crew who obviously have no real passion, care, or creativity whatsoever.This film is a complete waste of time. One of the worst movies i've ever seen in the theatres. No overexaggeration folks.",Doom
91,xamtaro,Doomed Disappointment,6,8 January 2010,"How do you adapt a game's storyline that involves one guy going around killing hell-spawned freaks on a martian base? THe answer is: you do not, which is exactly what the creators of this movie adaptation of the famous First person shooter video game ""DOOM"" did. First time movie writer Dave Callaham threw out the original Doom's back-story about a Demon invasion from hell and replaced it with a ""Resident Evil"" knockoff plot complete with weird alien chromosome that makes a evil people mutate into scary creatures (normally an extra chromosome would give you Down Syndrome, but this is a movie after all). Whatever elements they kept were only the flaws of each game. Like the original Doom, this movie has cardboard thin characters, no original plot whatsoever and took place on Mars. However instead of intense non-stop action, we have the ""sneaking around in the dark"" game-play style of Doom 3 which, in this movie, is more boring than scary and a ""first person"" shooting sequence that looks painfully fake and badly choreographed.So here is what happened. S Something monstrous is loose on a secret research facility deep underground.....i mean, on Mars owned by The Umbrella Cor......erm....Union Aerospace Corporation. Scientists are either missing or presumed dead and the entire facility is in lock-down. Enter the ""Rapid Response Tactical Squad led by ""Sarge""(Dwayne ""the rock"" Johnson) and comprising of the usual generic stock commando characters all trying their damnedest to act bad-ass. There is the strong silent guy, Reaper, our main character. There is the pervert ""Portman"", the rookie ""Kid"", strong guy ""Destroyer"", mandatory Asian man ""Mac"", ""Duke"" the African American who talks to much and ""Goat"" the self punishing religious fanatic. Sent through an ancient teleportation device called ""the ark"" deep into the isolated base on Mars, the squad encounters a threat unlike anything they have ever faced. Along the way they meet up with the token female plus brainiac Dr Samantha Grimm who shares a past connection to Reaper. Together they must uncover the secret of the UAC base, eliminate the sinister creatures roaming the dark corridors and prevent any of them from making it back to earth before They meet their ""DOOM"".A huge disappointment for fans of the game, DOOM has nothing else going for it other than a couple of cool squad tactical movement sequences, some monsters getting shot at in the dark, two fist fights between a squad member and a monster and one pretty dramatic scene between Sarge and Reaper as they are debating whether to strictly follow orders or to ""do the right thing"". Having only done ""down to earth"" urban crime movies and Jet Li star vehicles like Romeo Must Die and Cradle 2 the Grave, Director Andzej Bartkowiak is way out of his league tackling a science fiction horror game adaptation. His inexperience with the genre clearly shows when all that was good about this movie was the Man Vs Creature mêlée duels even though the original games never focused on fist fights.Even the fans of the more technical stuff like Doom's mean array of weapons would be let down. The chainsaw was undeniably cool but besides that, only the automatic rifle is used to kill the creatures. The only things that the shotgun, Chaingun and even the signature ""BFG"" cannon get to hit are walls. The much talked about ""first person shooter"" sequence is only 10 minutes long and felt very fake. Badly rendered CGI gun aside, there was no sense of peril for the character of Reaper. The action was not intense, nor do you get that same adrenaline pumping satisfaction at the end of it that you would get from other action movie sequences.Compared to the games, the Doom movie is a dismal disaster, failing to capture neither the look nor the feel of the original source material or its sequels. On its own, it is a passable but generic action horror movie that might satisfy some viewers on a largely superficial level. A few enjoyable action scenes, lots of swearing, lots of gore and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson trying to be cool. That more or less sums up this show that was doomed from the start thanks to an inexperienced creative team.",Doom

If you get extremely wasted on multiple drugs and watch it on widescreen at a party it should be OK to watch, but if you actually pay attention to this movie you will be in awe at the retarded movie you are watching. DOOM the game(this movie is based on that) is a rich environment with a lot of wildly different and awe inspiring fearsome monsters. In this movie I think I counted a total of FOUR monsters, which is a RIPOFF. This movie wasted it's money in paying for The Rock. What it should have done instead is hire a no name dude and take the money they saved on that and put the money into some killer CGI to accurately re-create the monsters in the incredible world of Doom. This movie was skimpy, lame and retarded. Some of the action is watchable but there is nothing that incredible going on. The final fight is kind of fun, but still- the movie is just DUMB and bland.",Doom
93,LivingDog,Weak Flick,8,25 March 2006,"I just saw this wide and unedited on cable. I was really taken by the story, but I found it lacking emotion. All the actors were completely unconvincing - as if emotionally detached from what was going on around them. Were they trying?As I said the story was good and it kept me in my seat. But when it came to expressing some angst or any human emotion it failed miserably. Was it the editing or the directing?The bottom line is a mix of flat unemotional detached but great story... you decide if you want - I gave it an 8/10.-ZafoidPS: I played the demo and it was great. Then I realized that it would be repetitive (like the horrible HL2 - HL was awesome, HL2 was a complete disappointment.) and decided not to buy the game.Also, the movie had the look of Resident Evil but none of the ""drama."" It just didn't cut it.They introduced the BFG - a gamer's favorite - and played it down! wow... maybe gamers should have made this movie.Finally, I use to think that anyone with a strong personality could be a movie star. Take for example Arnold Schwazenegger and Tom Cruise. Both are big stars but only one has the personality and even some talent. Along comes The Rock - personality all over the place, (I've seen him on talk shows and he is totally charming.) but unfortunately he is still a little stiff. Then again if you remember Jack Nicholson was absolutely horrible in his earliest movies. (See e.g. ""The Raven"" 1963.) And yet with time he turned into a superstar. So give Rock a chance and I am sure he willbe turning out blockbusters with some more experience.-Z",Doom
94,nobbytatoes,whoa.....was it meant to laugh?,5,30 October 2005,"When a research facility is compromised and the scientist's are killed, a group of marines are sent in to control the situation. We find out that the scientists were doing experiments on chromo-mutation, giving subjects and extra chromosome. They have found that people with an extra chromosome become super humanoid; they become stronger, faster, super healing rate and are super intelligent; buts that only if the subject excepts this extra chromosome. Rejecting it results in genetic mutation, creating a race of monsters.What ever happened to the original idea of the doom game. The idea of opening a portal to hell and letting in all these demons and monsters was a much better concept than this genetic mutation. Instead the writers have taken their cue from Resident Evil, but have twisted abit so its not a complete rip off. The monsters presented here though are all alike. The first time you see the monster its quite a sight to see, but seeing that all the monsters are basically the same, it gets very boring real fast.The acting here is so bad. The actors are either wooden or limber. But they are all culprits of over acting. But how can they take the script seriously. The dialog is cheesy and the plotting is so thin. The jokes aren't funny and they fall flat on their faces. You cringe more than you do laugh. But thats not to say you don't laugh at all. I was laughing so much more when someone died with the over the top violence. Also when The Rock was trying to act serious; even more when he was swearing, you cant take a profanity from him seriously. At least you are entertained in this respect.But the upside of this tripe. The atmosphere is very dark and claustrophobic; it does have that real suffocating feel, which does help the scares, even if they are minimal. The first person perspective; though it does seem there for the fans, works quite well and it serves it purpose. For the few minutes we're in this mode, its constant and relentless action. The fight with the white monster was very fast paced and your right in it. One of the high points of the film. Also we are treated to a man-o-man fight. It comes out of nowhere, but who really cares, it was a great fight. We are also given a name to the BFG; Bio Force Gun. Whatever, its still the Big F***in' Gun to me.This is not great, its so far away from being great, but i had so much fun laughing myself silly.

95,Cinema_Fan,Disaster spells Doom for Doom the Movie.,3,22 October 2006,"Doom, based very loosely on the video game Doom 3, in retrospect it's your average bug hunt space movie, low on Sci-Fi but high on itself, but for what it's worth, just consider it another quick fix teen B-movie of shallow expectations. A high production cost cannot hide the immensely poor story line and dreary acting.This should, on paper it was, have been a hit; only there was just one tiny detail that this movies team had neglected, that the following of any cult DVD game turned movie has to, at least, abide; replication. There were so many differences between both video game and movie that any parallels seemed few and far between, by the second week of its release, in the USA, it plummeted. The games boys seemed unimpressed. This game is over.This movie seems very familiar, we've been here before, Aliens (1986), as a matter of fact, to such an extent, that Doom could very well pass as its doppelgänger. This is the punishment for the crime for not sticking toward its original DVD game concept as closely as possible. The extreme lack of brainstorming in the right direction has given this movie a complete lack of individuality; this parody has a team of marine's, again, ordered to Mars, to the Union Aerospace Corporation Olduvai Research Facility, substituted for LV-426 in Aliens. To investigate and retrieve any survivors that have reported a deadly presence that are killing them off one by one, and that's about it.We have the typically obnoxious clichéd marines, of the movie variety, hollow and uninviting; their charisma bypass is only perpetuated every time their mouths are open. We cannot unite with these over egotistical members of the lowest line of command. We have, though no fault of our own, no pity nor remorse when one eventually meets his demise, we are simply put out of our relief, as they are theirs.The build up at first is interesting, but after the first one minute and fifteen seconds, due to the wonderful opening logo sequence, we are shanghaied into this awful concept and forced against our will to accompany these staid space warriors. While the sets are impressive, and the overall cinematography interesting, the Razzie Awards, for 2006, nominated The Rock worst actor. This is its biggest drawback, the overacting by under-actors, so to speak, shame really that there was nothing new to add to this concept, no refreshing script, no character development and no new frontier to explore.

It definitely recreates the dark, cramped and ""sweaty"" atmosphere of the military/research complex from the game. The plot diverges a bit from the game. Apparently, force powers come from midi-chlorians and the devil-made-me-do-it (a.k.a. demonic possession) is based on an ""Alien""-like tongue propagating with your neck.The Rock leads a tactical rescue squad to Mars to investigate a disturbance and quarantine mission. Before we can go, we have to suit up and give each other code names like we did back in the 3rd grade. Yo Joe !! At this point the movie tries to pull off a bit of Predator (a.k.a- tactical squad takes on alien), but thankfully fails and stops trying. No way they can pull if off without Sonny Landham or a decent alien. They do have the Predator-like sweaty, bald black marine though.This movie is pure homage to the FPS (first-person shooter), from the BFG (too bad they got that acronym wrong) weapon to the trip to the bathroom and to the inclusion of Carmack (a.k.a - John Carmack being the founder of ID Software, the maker of Doom and other fine products). The most lucrative of these is the FPS mode. First person mode (a.k.a - if you can stomach becoming Karl Urban) is quite gimmicky. It is far more interesting as a concept than actual execution. In a game it is part of the immerse nature of the environment, however, in a movie theater it seems a bit odd. I mean I would expect that if I went to Disney World, Epcot Center or somewhere in Las Vegas. My chair didn't move. My ass didn't get shocked. Did yours?? It came off more like something Uwe Boll (a.k.a - the Teutonic Terror) would do or of the caliber of the director of Romeo Must Die or Cradle 2 the Grave. The monsters seem an odd collection of zombie, xeno-human and variation of xeno-human mutations. None are overly memorable and quite easily forgettable after their mutated gray matter gets splattered all over the walls. I mean we don't really even get a good ""Boss"" character. We get a re-hash. On a personal note, someone really needs to stop using Rosamund Pike as an actress. I haven't seen a decent, nor a different performance from her yet. I believe she is playing the same character she did in the Libertine, albeit without an overt English accent. At least the director got one thing right about Doom; the crappy ending. This leads us to the type of director we have. Based on the fact that this was the worst movie the Rock has been in (don't get me wrong, he has been in some terrible movies, however, and his personality has managed to elevate the whole picture into enjoyable distractions). Instead of raising this movie up, the character and characterization of the ""Sarge"" just adds guano to the whole movie. In true FPS fashion, hit F7, restore another save point (preferably before you started watching this movie), say the magic word (Katsuhiko Kumanosuke Takaashi) and watch something else .... maybe like Crank.

Naturally, it is compared to ""Resident Evil"", which I do prefer. But ""Doom"" moves at a good pace, the monsters look savage and the cast are more than your normal wooden variety that usually occupy films like this. It is far from pedestrian, and you can tell that Dwayne Johnson really led the cast and he provides a good performance in a role that could have easily turned into a lobotomised action man. The special effects don't look cheap, and there is a lot of slow-moving down dark tunnels, which can make it hard to see the action when it breaks out, but it does build suspense.

99,ExpendableMan,"Stupid, but entertaining action romp",6,29 December 2005,"If you're a fan of the popular Doom 3 video game, chances are you will be disappointed with this movie. The notion of demons being sent to Mars after scientists inadvertently open a portal to hell has been jettisoned and the monsters are now a result of genetic tampering gone awry. Plus, the number of monsters from the game to actually make an appearance on screen is quite small, so it isn't that much of a surprise fans of the franchise have had rather negative reactions to it.However, if you've got a crate of beer in the fridge, a Domino's pizza delivery van heading your way and a small group of mates round, this movie is a great choice for delivering a solid hour and forty minutes entertainment. Focusing on a squad of marines sent to a research facility on Mars to look for some missing scientists who find themselves mixed up in a chaotic battle for survival against several bloodthirsty creatures hiding in the shadows, it tackles the subject matter with about as much subtlety as a twenty ton concrete gorilla being thrown out of a Chinook helicopter onto a Nitro-glycerin plant. The marines are by and large muscle-bound knuckle heads equipped with a ridiculous amount of heavy firepower and the script is filled with lines like ""You know you could of spent your life looking through a microscope rather than a sniper scope."" But when you're making a video game adaptation, intelligence is not going to be that high on the agenda.Sure, there are plot holes a plenty (Sarge's reasoning for not sending a request for reinforcements is pathetically flimsy), but when you've got a film this fun, you'd have to be a po-faced Conservative voter not to enjoy yourself. And after some surprisingly tense and atmospheric scenes of the idiots, sorry, soldiers searching the deserted labs, we get treated to a non-stop barrel of carnage with gore-a-plenty (check out the scene where one luckless character is dragged through a metal grille near the end) which climaxes in spectacular fashion with the most obvious homage to the game; the ten minute first person sequence. Zooming into the eyes of Karl Urban, we see a highly stylised and very, very violent passage of total mayhem as our hero blows away anything and everything in his path. It's not high art by any stretch of the imagination, but as far as video game adaptations go, Doom isn't a bad one. Given the celluloid abominations that are Resident Evil, Wing Commander, Super Mario Bros et al, the fact that Doom is merely an entertaining but empty slice of entertainment rather than a complete disaster is an achievement in itself. Plus, in this era of pretty boy action heroes, it's almost refreshing to see the over-bloated sense of machismo returning to the genre in the hulking forms of Karl Urban and The Rock, two guys who could certainly have given Arnie and Carl Weathers a run for their money back before politics and obscurity took them from us.",Doom

Doom 2005,2,4 December 2005,"We'll it's certainly not worse than ""House of the Dead"" a video game to movie release, and I'll admit there are certain parts of Doom that I liked in a cheesy way also unlike ""House"" there is some better acting. The Rock plays it straight for the most part sensing he took this seriously which I am surprised since the movie is obviously geared for laughs using the video game fan audience who'll practically buy anything. Doom is of course based on the classic game by ID Software which took the game industry and parents by storm. Despite being outdated the game made thousands of dollars and the game Doom went into history as one of the more nostalgic games ever. The Rock as the marine sent down to investigate the going ons at a scientific facility is pretty good. I know critics panned the movie but it has some brights spots, at least the gore and some scenes were done with some effort, the other parts are not, but even then you can laugh your butt about them. It was kinda funny to see the scientist in the beginning use keycards (like the game) to escape, it looks much cooler in the game than in the movie. Andrzej Bartkowiak does a fair job but I probably wouldn't be excited about his next movie. Rosamund Pike who is Samantha Grimm , another scientist in the movie is pretty darn watchable though like the role for the most part takes the role seriously. The special effects were average but I guess enough for some people. Maybe they could have used more gore or instead of using the computer effects for some creatures done more prosthetic work.

I didn't expect it to be a piece of high art on celluloid, but I DID expect good, dumb fun. At times, Doom delivers thismost of the time, it doesn'tat all. With the exception of Karl Urban, Dexter Fletcher, and Rosamund Pike, the acting is pretty poor. The characters are mostly one-dimensional throw-aways who we don't care for. The writing also suffers from mucho flawsthe science in this film is pretty terrible (check IMDb's trivia section), and while I can forgive that (after all, it is just a movie), I can't forgive the major sense of déjà vu I had with the painfully long scenes of soldiers running down pipe-infested, mesh-grate-floored, darkly light halls aiming guns at mysterious off-screen sounds. This is a genre convention that is long, long overdue for retirement. Director Andrzej Bartkowiak, a former cinematographer, should've stayed out of the director's chair. The film certainly isn't without visual flair (the much-hyped first-person sequence was a blast), but he relies too heavily on action (the final ""showdown"" sequence is a real eye-roller) and loud explosions, over suspense or well thought-out scares. The creature effects from Stan Winston studios were great, but we see so little of them that I felt horribly cheated by how little screen-time the monsters got (after all, Doom WAS all about the monsters!!!). In staying with the graphic nature of its source material, the film is very violent, with a slick beheading, lots of severed limbs, a nasty autopsy scene, and even an exploding head (during the first-person sequence no less). Gore hounds won't be disappointed in the red stuff cooked up in Doom. I also applaud the filmmakers for their sparse use of CG; it's great to see films going back to good old realistic-looking puppets, prosthetics, and make-up over soulless, lifeless CG creatures like in Van Helsing or the recent Star Wars films. The only computer generated creature in the film is the briefly-seen Pinky monster, which I found more endearing than frightening. I found Clint Mansell's score to be a huge disappointment. It has a very rock-like edge to it, which didn't work well here at all. How 'bout a REAL score next time around?Doom wasn't a complete waste but it was a big, big let-down.

I rather liked it for some reason. Of course it didn't add much to the film's plot, but it definitely worked as a nice build-up for the final fight.My only regrets regarding this film. Firstly, the amount of gore was just too much. Secondly, I really didn't like the fact that the movie tried to model itself more along the lines of Doom 3 than the original which I felt had a more personified look. Mars is red, and it would have been nice to see a little more of it.If you're looking for a film adaption of the game, look somewhere else.

Basically, each and every one of his moves ended up badly. But, better him to direct ""Doom"", than Uwe Boll. The ridiculous script and completely different and dumb story was written by Dave Callahan and Wesley Strick. Did these guys (including Andrzej himself) ever played ""Doom""? Did they even try to do a research of the old, original games and their plot? Guess not. The movie just doesn't have any relations to the first two video games. Yes, I admit that the story of the first games was pretty much ridiculous, about hell breaking out in space and one man army has to fight it, all alone. I think this film has appeared only because the Doom 3 game was out year before and the fans were loud. In a positive way, perhaps, I liked the game, but I think that the old ones are the best. And we can all notice that director and writers were borrowing heavily from Doom 3, but of course with dumb changes about genetically designed monsters, whilst the third game still had that hell breaks loose in the space only with less levels about hell, while the first two games were done just so Let's just say that you just can't tell when you are in hell, and when you are not.So, there was an incident on a space station and a group of marines were sent to help. Lead by Sarge (The Rock). Yep, that is his name because Muscle Man, or Cypher Rage were already taken. OK, The Rock was somewhat fun, and because of his physique and no acting talent, he played the role of Sarge well. Next, we have our hero, the Doom guy, if you will, played by Karl Urban (although his name was John Grimm). I think that Urban knew how bad this film is going to be, so he decided not to give a flying damn about it. You can clearly see that in his performance. Our leading lady is Samantha Grimm (played by Rosamund Pike), well, she was OK, but nothing that engaging, or interesting or developed. The entire marine team is basically your everyday cliché team. We have the crazy one, the horny one, the quiet one, the drugged one, the religious one and the Japanese one with the hard name to pronounce So, you don't care for any of them. The movie itself is just wrong and silly, but it has a solid pace, good action and some decent special effects and make up The plot is very, very simple, which makes the stuff easier if you want to watch it again, it's no brainer, actually!Imagine that they filmed a movie based upon old games, it would take more budget, but also more imagination and simple plot. So, it's up to you if you are interested for this one.",Doom
106,rparham,Quality is Doomed,4,27 October 2005,"Ah, the video game movie. Not the most successful genre of film introduced, but it seemed really only a matter of time before a version of Doom was brought to the screen. Doom is one of the original ""first-person shooter"" games, where the game unfolds almost entirely from the perspective of the player, not a ""God's eye"" view as in most other games. Doom was a phenomenon for the most part, and Hollywood never lets a successful franchise property remain in it's original form if there is a film to be made, so we are offered Doom, a mediocre at best, abysmal at worst, adaptation of the game that is far less entertaining than several hours burned off at the computer monitor.Doom unfolds mostly at a research facility located on Mars. Humans have discovered an ancient device that allows travel between Earth and Mars in the Nevada desert and have used this device, dubbed ""The Ark"", to travel back and forth at will. Various types of scientific research is being carried out on Mars at the facilities, but something has gone wrong in the genetic research division, leading to a lock-down. A group of Marines have been called in, led by Sarge (The Rock), to contain the problem. Among the Marines is a man named John Grimm (Karl Urban), whose parents died on Mars during the construction of the research facilities, and his sister Sam (Rosamund Pike) is a research scientist there. Once the Marines arrive, they discover the genetics lab overrun by rather unpleasant creatures which leads to questions about the nature of the research at the facility and the need to contain the problem.To call Doom uninspired would be understatement. There is little here that hasn't been ripped-off from countless other science fiction movies, especially Aliens. The characters are mostly one-dimensional ciphers, with the standard types of the hard-ass, the pervert, the borderline religious fanatic, the rookie, etc. None of them are really characters, we don't care what happens to any of them for the most part, they are just fodder for the monsters. The film attempts to be suspenseful, but for the most part fails miserably. There is little in Doom to raise your adrenaline, and for a film filled with advanced weaponry, little action to speak of. Oh, there is a gunfight or two, but nothing that can really get you excited. This film is just going through the motions.To call the film low-budget would be generous. Almost the entire running time of Doom unfolds in repetitive, generic hallways and rooms with little visual flair whatsoever. We are watching a bunch of guys running around in the dark with nothing interesting heaping. Good times for all. Acting wise, Doom is a mixed bag. The Rock is more than up to the limited task presented him by the role of Sarge. He acquits himself fairly well, not really tainting his reputation at all. Karl Urban gets the job done, but he is hardly supremely memorable. Rosamund Pike turns in a rather terrible performance as Sam Grimm. She is stilted and wooden, not really showing much emotion at all. The rest of the cast is just there to fill the screen, nobody is worth mentioning.The big marketing blitz about this film was surrounded by a five-minute sequence where we are treated to a first-person perspective of one of the characters, a la the original video game. It's and interesting experiment, but nothing much to write home about. Hardly a reason to see this movie alone.So, in the pantheon of video game movies, chalk Doom up as one more failure in a long string of them. The only thing Doomed from watching this movie is the money and time wasted.",Doom
107,dakjets,No way!,2,20 May 2018,"Encouraged by the reviews here, I gave this movie a chance a late tv night. I love all the Aliens films, and thought that something good is going on here. But unfortunately no way. This was very bad. Very thin story, and with so-called monsters more or less absent. A lot of shouting and hiding but no content. And if such a movie works, it must actually be both exciting and creepy. This one are none of the parts. Steer away.",Doom

I will admit I went into this movie expecting to completely trash it on IMDb, but I was pleasantly surprised by how good it really was. That's not to say it was a great movie. It was a push-button horror with very few surprises ****spoiler******Although, I must admit I was shocked when Rock didn't turn out to be the hero in it. The best line out of the movie was him saying ""But I'm not supposed to die!"" as he is being dragged off.The special effects were good, although you could tell what was CGI and what was real far too often for my taste. Oh, and it did slip into ""how many ways can a human be killed off"", but that's not surprising considering the game it was derived from.One final comment for the gamers out there: there is a 15-20 minute stretch where it is shot in first person (the view you have in the game). That scene is done just right, it wasn't too long, and it was filled with touches that fans of the game are going to love.",Doom
109,g-hbe,I'd like my money back.,1,20 August 2006,"I'm a video game fan with a liking for first-person shooters and I've played doom from its first appearance in the 1990's, but this film, and all it's prints and negatives, plus all VHS copies and DVD's should be hunted down and burnt. And then burnt again for good measure. Is there a story? I think there is, but it was too vague to bother with, and as for the characters, just who was who and what were their names? They all looked the same and they all spouted the same action/buddy clichés, when I could hear what they were muttering, which wasn't often. A good film director spends the first third of their film setting up the people you need to know about, their personalities, their lives, their families. This film just sort of began and after a couple of hours it finished, much to my relief. Complete and utter tripe, hogwash, rubbish and twaddle - and they are the good points. Of course there will be some people who will say I should have known what to expect, with the film based on a video game, but I don't agree - I play games on my XBOX360 and when I go to the cinema I expect to watch a FILM. If the moderators will let me, I'd like to finish by saying that the director of this sub-turkey should be held to account for his waste and ill-treatment of celluloid or video tape or whatever.",Doom
110,pinkliz41,A complete mess of a film,1,27 April 2008,"This film was a complete mess. Acting, directing, scripted and visually. The cast were completely shambled with an awful setting and backdrop. The acting choices are also unbelievably stupid. I, mean the Rock. That is a mistake so bad it could just screw up the movie in a hole. The MPAA rating is complete insanity. A 15 FOR DOOM!!!!!!!! ARE YOU NUTS. I'm not denying that it wasn't at least half violent, but the horror part of it was pathetic. The monsters were some of the worst FX i have seen. The acting is corny and pointless, as if every character carries no feeling for anyone.Sorry people, but this is just not good enough to even be put onto film.",Doom
111,freaky_dave,Doom was a mistake,3,4 July 2006,"Doom was an overblown mess of a movie that goes on way too long. The story is a rehash of every single creatures run amok movie. It's part Alien and part Night Of The Living Dead all rolled into one. It was also a lot like Resident Evil. In fact it could've been Resident Evil with just the name changed.The Rock stars as Sarge. Him and his troops have to go to an alien planet, (Mars I think. I never was sure.) and clean up a mess that some scientists made. I don't have to go on with the plot because if you've seen the countless ripoffs of Alien and Night Of The Living Dead, you already know what's going to happen here.The acting in the film wasn't anything to write about, but it was better than some of those other creature feature films that keep being released as movies. Still, it wasn't good enough to be anything better than average.The visuals were just average as well. Nothing amazing to look at, but you do see a lot of things get blown up. This movie also contains its fair share of gore, but I'm sure everybody suspects that already.There is also a twist at the end of the movie that nobody will see coming, but it's really not enough to help this film. I of course will abstain from giving that surprise away though.I saw Doom on DVD, and I was glad I did because I would never pay full price to see a movie like Doom in the theaters.",Doom
112,TCurtis9192,DOOM,6,17 March 2020,"""DOOM"" (2005, Bartkowiak) is a decent enough film. While having a certain amount of originality it predictably borrows from ""ALIEN"" (1979, Scott) and ""THE THING"" (1982, Carpenter) despite having good source material in the video game franchise on which it is loosely based. The real-world/hell crossover is not in this film, instead ""hell"" is used figuratively in the script and one character is a religious nut, and the setting is closer to DOOM3 (released in 2004) although, again, there is nothing of hell in this film.I wonder whether the decision to expunge hell from the storyline was made because of the 1997 film ""EVENT HORIZON"" (Anderson) and its plot similarities with the DOOM games. It is also possible that the more generic sets in this film were cheaper to make. Whatever the reason it obviously wasn't a part of their vision.Instead we have a more AREA 51 (PS2, 2005) kind of thing where people are mutating into hideous creatures due to a virus that has been unleashed due to silly experimentation conducted by PHDs. I would say ""DOOM"" (2005) was more like AREA 51 than any of the DOOM games. The same old characters are wheeled out by someone who watched ""ALIEN"" and decided they liked those people sitting around the dinner table, and that it would be ""clever"" to take those characters and make them elite soldiers without changing anything about them. So you have a bunch of silly wise-cracking ""elite"" soldiers (basically without the humanity of the crew in ""ALIEN"") and, true to form, the writers show us exactly why they're elite despite their lazy and dumb personalities by occasionally pitting them against some serious enemies and having them pull off some crackingly implausible stunts... But it's not convincing and it never was and it still isn't.The heavy metal soundtrack does nothing for the film. In the original game the soundtrack pushed you on. It wasn't blatant heavy metal, more just your typical action and horror scores dressed up in heavy metal, but the filmmakers totally missed the point and went with mood-killing guitar-scrapes whenever the mood took them. And again, because the hell stuff has been removed, this music makes no sense. The game was about killing demons and possessed gun toters, not making up with your sister after all those years.Dwayne Johnson and Karl Urban are the best of the cast. They do well. The soldiers are forgettable, except maybe Richard Brake (but his character is rubbish). Rosamund Pike fails as she begins playing her character as a dead-eyed, sharp-tongued strong scientist (badly) and progresses to a rabbit caught in the headlights (or an adult-movie star who makes you feel more guilty for watching them than aroused). She spends the whole film bra-less and heavy footed.The monsters are well done, as are the zombies, and the gore doesn't stop glopping down throughout. This is where the film shines. Well, that and the first person segment near the end which was brilliant.I don't want to sound smug but as soon as Dwayne Johnson was revealed to be militaristically evil I just knew the final battle would be a throw-your-guns-away fist-fight between him and Urban. It's like watching a couple of kids in an adventure playground.Still. It's a good film. I avoided it for fifteen years because I was somehow under the impression that it was full of flat CGI but it isn't.",Doom

After some quick research on the film I immediately went to Itunes to purchase it. I was not disappointed. Sure this not award winning material, but it attributes more than make up for that. For the most part the film moved along briskly, but towards the end is when all the good stuff starts happening. The first-person scene was incredible, I laughed numerous times, and the FPS song playing during that scene was great. The fight scene was very amusing. I love movies with monsters in them, and this film did not skimp on them. This is a great action movie filled with tough guys and loads of great gore. The fps scene in my opinion is one of the best action scenes I have ever seen. Recommended if your looking for a good time.",Doom
115,Rathko,How NOT to make an action movie,2,24 October 2005,"Back in the eighties, 'Doom' would have been one of those cheap, straight-to-video Alien rip-offs that made happy viewing after a few pints on a Friday night. But in an era of increasingly poor quality control, this kind of tripe is being bankrolled to the tune of $60million and making it into cinemas.Everything about this movie is terrible. The story is confused at best; the characterization is non-existent; the dialogue as bad as the acting; the production design is boring and generic post-Alien industrial chic; the monsters rarely step out of the shadows, and when they do, the CGI is decidedly second rate; the music is wildly inconsistent; the action scenes are incoherent and amateurishly edited.Bartkowiak and Callaham are really quite gifted in managing to screw up the seemingly unscrewupable. They turn creatures that were terrifying in the game into tedious slimy monsters in the dark, and heart-pumping chase sequences become unforgivably leisurely strolls in the park. These two manage to make running for your life along dark corridors, pursued by some nameless creature from hell, boring. It really is quite an achievement to take such good quality raw material and turn it into such a pathetic excuse for a finished product.Twenty Years ago, with 'Aliens', James Cameron established a benchmark for SF-action-horror. He not only knew how to plan, shoot, and edit a jaw-dropping action sequence, but inherently understood the importance of character development  it doesn't matter how good the chase sequence is if you don't care if the character gets caught. 'Doom' could very well become a new teaching aid in filmschools around the nation as a textbook example of how NOT to make an action movie.",Doom
116,mirwais-orbit,Attention: just watch the bonus.,3,24 June 2007,"For just one moment I thought that this movie could be good. For just one moment I thought that this movie would be frighten. Just for one moment.The potentials this movie had to be some kind of ""the new Alien of 21st century"" was thrown away with no care. I still asking myself when Hollywood will make a great adaptation of a video-game? You know, something as ""X-Men"" was for the comic books adaptations. Every single video-game adaptation is a MESS!!! ""Tomb Raider"", ""Resident Evil"", ""Alone In The Dark"", ""The House Of Dead"", a lot more... and now, completing the present list: ""DOOM"".I was waiting for entire movie to see the everyone's-talking-about-FPS (first personal shooting), and when it happens, it's just for 5 minutes. Come on... when they made something really innovative and interesting in Hollywood, it's just for 5 minutes? So, instead of FPS, you got Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson yelling to the camera all the time and shutting eyebrows to everyone. I love The Rock, he's hot, and have great potentials as an actor (if you have watched Be Cool, you know what I'm talking about). I like a lot the fact of Serge starts as a good guy and then becomes the bad guy, but not that way.First of all, the movie is nonsense claustrophobic just because nothing happen. The close shots and the dark places are with no purposes because everything delays a lot to happen and all the tensions are for nothing.Then, the monsters. You don't know if the movie is about zombies or monsters, or zombie-monsters, or super-zombie-monsters. It's some kind of ""The Night Of Living Dead On Mars"". It would be so easier if they just explained that the spacial base was invaded by aliens than explaining that horrible thing about mutation and blah blah blah, it doesn't fit on the game and neither on the screen. That thing about the 24th chromosome is HORRIBLE!!! It was just a very sad explanation to make the good guy become a super human and the bad guy become the final boss. That's very-very sad. The final battle is so sad as the 24th chromosome.And then, the great gems of entire movie: the impacting dialogs. Together with the all-the-time-""what the hell is going on"" the dialogs are weakly terrible. It's supposed to make you laugh but it never gets even a half smile of your face. It's boring, terrible boring. The portal is also something very strange because it's so easy to travel from a world to another that they make this all the time during entire movie and at the end you just don't know where they are anymore... At that point the place doesn't matter anymore as everything just became a car accident. Oh, and of course, the soundtrack. Hey, I just HATE that hard electric rock as soundtrack of movies, hard rock and futuristic movies just don't match! The movie should be quiet to elevates the tension and not that horrible guitar playing all the time trying to say ""HEY, BABY, ACTION IS BACK! or we're just trying to...""But there are good things here... like the characters using the term ""game"" in place of ""action"". The nanowall was great, and, of course, the FPS because it's intense and gives you the exactly video-game feeling. If you rent this movie, just go directly to the bonus and watch only the FPS, that's all that matters of entire movie as The Rock's nude back at the beginning.",Doom

It delivered. Lots of action, a bit too much gore for my tastes, but then it is a sort of horror movie, so okay, makes sense.

118,BrickNash,Stands head and shoulders over most of it's genre.,8,10 July 2014,"OK so this film is about as far from the DooM game as you can get which is a shame because there is much in the game that could be translated to film with a bit of padding.So is it a bad film? Absolutely not! In fact DooM: The Film stands head and shoulders above other movies of this genre. It is a slick, well made, well produced action sci-fi film with some genuinely claustrophobic moments and one or two likable characters.OK it's pretty much an Aliens rip-off but in saying that it's done extremely well and should be commended for quality rather than originality. t's sort of in the same league as Demolition man but without the big Star but it has all the trimmings present, tough (and humorously sleazy) marines, moody lighting, great sets and some excellent monsters.There's also some really nice sci-fi ideas that are thrown in t the mix as well with things like the Ark and the Nanowall and that's the stuff I like to see in films such as this.Now I'm not some weekend warrior when it comes to games. I lived and breathed computer & video games in the 80's & 90's and Doom was no exception but I guess I went in to this film knowing that things would probably be changed but what I didn't expect was a very decent and highly re-watchable sci-fi film.To be fair the film probably would have done a bit better ad gotten less hate had it been renamed and was released as a stand alone sci-fi film but then again the excellent first person bit of the film wouldn't have made much sense. It was never going to win any awards but it is what t is and it's good at it.Don't listen to little fat angry gamers, DooM is a solid action sci-fi that is great to dig out if you're in the mood for such a film and has plenty to satisfy fans of this genre.",Doom

The 'blunder buster"" in use towards the end was great. Entertaining in my 2nd viewing after all these years.",Doom
120,noizyme,I loved the game...what happened to it?,2,27 October 2005,"I really wanted to see how this movie played out for an audience who may or may not know the origins of the story let alone the fact that this was a classic video game from the 90's. What I got should have been expected, especially because everything about the story and the visual elements of the game were completely scrapped except for a few key moments. The movie's name really lives up to the expectation because it really was Doomed to fail.The Rock should really have never been a part of this film. He's just an obvious choice for a guy who has huge shoulder muscles and the desperation (as an actor now) to write ""Semper Fi"" across his back. The other C-list actors played the typical action-movie-genre roles of being bumbling Marines with their own problems with life let alone this new portal gateway to Mars. The funniest part of the film (and also the part of the film where I stare at my ticket-stub and ponder how much I paid to get in to see this film) is when one of the ""Marines"" kicks a can down a few stairs, while trying to be stalking around in the dark looking for these creatures, and he exclaims, ""Goddammit."" Without flinching, he puts his gun down, grabs a knife out of his leg pocket, raises his sleeve of his shirt (exposing many cross-shaped scars), and he begins to crave another cross in his arm, explaining, ""I said your name in vain,"" directing his thoughts towards God. It's moments like this that make the movie horrible.The saving moments were the pieces of a thrilling score by Clint Mansell (which were horribly dubbed into the film, used only to mark up to 10 seconds of action on screen), and the awesome recreation of the Doom game first-person POV shots during one Marine's freak-out sequence. I should note that they did a good job making a sequence in the credits with 3D effects to reflect the game again, but there was something disturbing about a misplaced song by Nine Inch Nails (""You Know What You Are?"") during the end credits as people walked out of the movie and having the movie scream at them, ""Don't you *bleeping* know what you are?"" about 10 times. Very disturbing, and I actually like Nine Inch Nails, but it was completely misplaced.So to summarize, the movie would've been a bit better had it been released earlier, when the game was still a major draw to computer game stores, and anything is better without the Rock involved. The movie almost makes fun of Marines by telling you that these guys are supposed to be Marines. There's nothing brave about these guys, and to make them bumbling goonish characters who are peddling drugs and all that just cheapens the solidity of this team sent in to take care of this new breed of human. Very bad director, as well. It seemed that this film only had visuals to go off of, and then the director sort of threw actors in various dark settings and CGI walls that morphed (badly) from solid to passable states.Overall, save your money and never even rent it when it comes to video. I was a fan of Doom , and I couldn't follow the story let alone the point the screenplay writer had in mind. I would've been happier if they did the entire film in the first-person POV that the game is known for. After all, it was the only saving part of the film.",Doom
121,kergillian,Worst film of the year!!,2,10 November 2005,"I thought Alone in the Dark was awful. Well, it was, but this just surpassed it in terms of ultra-horribility. I know that's not a word but it's all I can summon up to describe the experience that it Doom.Watching Doom is like watching someone play the video game, but without being able to crack jokes or talk to the player about the game. It's filled with characters who are completely unrealistic as marines - and there are references to it being a game from the beginning of the film - from the Rock telling the to get ready to enter the game right down to each of them picking up their guns and gaining a 'handle'The effects were somewhat impressive - I liked the sealing door that shut right onto the attacking monster. BUt that's all it was - a CGI-plated quagmire. The scene where it turns into 1st-person shooter POV was completely contrived - it made no sense and was just there for the sake of being there. As well, there was pretty much zero story - they were thrust into it from the very beginning with no back story or explanation as to what was going on and when they kinda sorta filled us in the details were few and ridiculously dim.Finally, the ending drags on endlessly - just when you think the penultimate fight scene is over, it picks up again until it seemingly ends only to pick up again. And when it DOES end, if you're still awake, it's horridly anti-climactic.My advice: STAY AWAY! Don't even bother renting. Just play the damn game and rent something worth watching. I'd give it a bomb if they'd let me but I'm stuck with the one star. 2/10 (with a 4/10 for effects, if you're still in the theater to see 'em...).",Doom

Granted, it doesn't take a DeNiro to play the part, but he does it well and very convincingly. Cudos for that, I am even thinking about checking some of his new films out as well not.Of course, I have to find something that annoyed me, and it was called ""Rosamund Pike""....my god, how can an actress this boring and express less ever get a part in a film? I grabbed myself several times wondering this question. He seriously stinks.But - to be honest, I think she was the only downer in this film. I didn't expect Oscar material and obviously that's not what I got either, but I got a lot of action and enjoyed all of it, especially the game-inspired shoot'em down/up scene, quite awesome carried out.Cudos to everything...apart from Rosamund Pike 7/10",Doom

In fact, I thought all the actors were pretty good, considering what kind of movie this is. Th effects were phenomenal, more proof that when used well, CGI looks amazing. I loved the combination of practical and computer effects, the monsters looked great. I was rather annoyed by the fight in the end, looked really stupid and out of place.

I have read that the movie changed the storyline of the game around a bit and instead of Mars being infested by Demons from hell, well Mars gets infested by a bunch of genetical experiments gone wrong. But Ill just stick to reviewing the movie and thats it, no comparisons to the game.A group of scientist are conducting an archaeological dig on the surface of Mars when they stumble across a skeleton that has 24 chromosomes. Thats one more chromosome then the rest of humanity has and according to their research, this 24th chromosome can make humans gain super strength and healing abilities. So they begin to experiment with the 24th chromosome and in doing so they unwillingly create a race of creatures that slowly but surely begins to eliminate the whole colony. Thats when The Rock and his team of rock em sock em Marine soldiers gets called up to fix things in Mars.I honestly expected this movie to be a huge pile of crap. The Rock? In Space? I thought, ""Boy, how the mighty have fallen"". But guess what, I actually found myself enjoying this flick. Well, part of it anyway.You see, for its first half, this film is essentially, step by step, a remake of Aliens. You know, the drill. Marines come down to complex, they start investigating the poorly lit corridors, something moves in the shadows...what is it? They find a survivor! Anyhows, its a by the numbers marines investigating spooky abandoned scientific complex type of thing. You get the picture.Cool thing about this movie though, is that once it gets past all that crap we have already seen before in a million other Aliens/Stargate rip offs, we get to the good stuff. And this is when I got up and actually said ""this movies just turned cool!"". The monsters, action and gore quotent get turned up pretty high and I loved that! Stan Winston Studios were in charge of creating the creature effects for this film and the did a great job. The monsters are a nice mix of ""man in suit"" effects and some cgi. But for the most part, they don't use that much CGI which made things feel more real and organic which was great in my book. The monsters are kept in the shadows for a lot of the movie, but I guess this works in a positive way since this is a horror/action film.There's one sequence that really stood out as incredibly cool. Its the ""first person shooter"" sequence. Basically what this sequence tries to achieve is duplicate the gaming experience of walking along dark hallways with a huge guns blowing away monsters, demons and zombies. And its all done in one fluid continuous shot. You feel like you really get up close and personal with the creatures that pop out of every corner and when one of those creatures is holding a huge chainsaw in one of its hands..well, you know you are in for some fun.I'm happy to inform that The Rock actually did a good job with his acting here. He has a mean streak to him and a bad ass attitude with this role. And the ending has a nice twist to it that I loved. Once I saw The Rock was going to have a ""mano a mano"" with somebody else I said ""oh no, were gonna have us a WWF match here"". But happily, the fight had almost no wrestling inspired moves, thank god. The fight at the end was actually very very entertaining.So all in all, what we have here is a pretty entertaining flick that delivers what it promises. Hey its a Doom movie, its got lots of guns, lots of creatures/monsters and gore. Whats not to like? Remember, once you get past the boring ""been there done that"" first half, the good stuff comes in.Rating: 3 1/2 out of 5",Doom
126,TheMovieDoctorful,The Last of a Dying Breed,7,18 October 2018,"I hate to impart an overused phrase, but they just don't make action movies like they used too. It's so rare to see a modern dumb action movie that really commits to its own stupidity, that really believes in it. Action movies these days have to be done with constant winks and nods at the camera, they can never get away with over-the-top nonsense without the defense of ""irony"" or ""self awareness."" Let me be clear; Doom is a stupid movie. It's a stupid movie with a stupid plot, stupid action and stupid dialogue all spoken by a cast that overacts so bloody hard that they'd make 90s Nicolas Cage proud...And I love it for that. This film is no different to me than the overblown likes of Commando or Face/Off and it's just as entertaining. The overacting is absolutely glorious. The Rock is at a stage in his career where he's either playing his roles entirely too seriously or deeply in on the joke. Doom gives us a chance to watch The Rock at an early stage in his acting career where he bulges his eyes out of their sockets, over-enunciates all his dialogue (I'm 60% sure he's going for an accent at points here, who knows what specifically) and sharply jerks his head around to show how out of control his character is. And, I'll be honest, it makes for a pretty cool villain. God bless him. How the 2010s desperately need more scenery chewing, over the top, cartoon bad guys like this.Karl Urban is equally entertaining. If The Rock is trying too hard to be villainous, Urban is trying too hard to be heroic. With his growly and commanding voice, uber-brooding demeanor and hysterical ""hoo-rah"" military man delivery (""IT WAS HIS FIRST MISSIOOOOON!""), Urban is an absolute delight to watch. If any actor has embodied the likes of 80s action machismo, it's Urban in this film. The practical effects are unironically amazing. Doom is an all around cheesefest, but the team behind the monster makeup here should seriously be commended. In an age where nearly every Hollywood blockbuster is a CGI cartoon, the fact that this film was able to go so practical effects heavy is something that should be commended. On top of that, the way that they made the movement, strength and power of the monsters seem so natural without said CGI is also a massive achievement. Borderline groundbreaking. I genuinely think the makeup work here is Oscar worthy. (That's the closest this glazed ham should ever come to an Academy Award, however.)The action scenes are incredible, and I'm not just talking about the famed First Person Shooter sequence either. The various shootouts really capture the tone of a fast paced, blood & guts video game and the dark lighting actually helps significantly to bring a genuine aura of dread for its various monsters. This is a film that has a clear respect and awe for its beasts and I can honestly say that I share that sentiment as a viewer. Also, for as much praise as the FPS fight gets, the bare knuckle beatdown between Urban and The Rock is easily the best action scene in the movie for me. The plot is beyond convoluted and ridiculous, involving a magic virus that turns good people into superheroes and bad people into monsters. It's literally just an excuse to watch Superhero Karl Urban and The Monster Rock beat the crap out of each other. While the actors may not be in on the joke, I have a very strong feeling the screenwriters were.And this review couldn't possibly be complete without me mentioning all the beautiful one liners;""We kill 'em all! Let God sort them out!""""Like The Kid said...Go to Hell.""""Carmack's condition...Is irreversible. Because his condition is that...He's DEAD!""""We ARE the reinforcements!""""We need to find something with a bit more kick!""""I don't need anybody else but soldiers!""""I'm not supposed to die!""Art.Doom is magically stupid, but not in the same way as The Room or Dark Moon Rising. It's an oddly competent level of stupidity where the absolute absurdity of the experience is almost what makes the film earn its own existence. Its absurdity is what MAKES it good. God bless you, Doom. You ridiculously entertaining and entertainingly ridiculous movie.",Doom

129,ksj870,"I Don't Know About the Game, but Doom is a Killer Movie",6,10 July 2009,"I finally picked this movie up at Blockbuster after passing it over countless times in the past, and I didn't regret it for a minute. Maybe my opinion would be a little different if I were a fan of the video game, but I'm not and don't care to become one. As a sci-fi shoot-em-up, Doom surpasses all expectations. The set-up is similar to Aliens: in the future, a platoon of space marines is sent to investigate an outpost on Mars where something has gone terribly wrong. As in Aliens, the monstrous threat with which the Marines will soon be engaged in deadly combat takes its time in revealing itself, and the script takes advantage of the ""downtime"" to introduce us to the Marines with some care. The soldiers are surprisingly well-developed, and each of them has a distinct personality and collectively they behave in generally realistic fashion. Though some of the soldiers aren't particularly likable, at least they are basically believable, and so when some of them inevitably die horrible deaths it means something to the viewer and the story itself. The cast is very effective, with Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson in his element as the tough-as-nails Sarge. It's one of the best performances of his career, and the evolution of his character is dead-on. Karl Urban is equally good as Reaper, a troubled soldier with a history on Mars. Reaper's internal conflict is the heart of the script, and adds an unexpected depth to the mayhem. Rosamund Pike is gorgeous and brainy as a female scientist who knows more about the unfolding nightmare than she wants to admit, and the rest of the cast is without exception solid. And when the build-up is over and the action breaks loose, the fun gets jacked up to a whole new level. The carnage is brutal and bloody, and the monsters are not only viscerally terrifying but represent a threat to both body and soul. The famous ""First Person Shooter"" scene is well-planned and fits naturally into both plot and character, and is one of the most thrilling sequences in the movie. Everything builds up to a hard-hitting climax, and when it's over you can finally breathe a sigh of relief. Though not a classic by any means--Doom is certainly not the equal of the aforementioned Aliens, for instance--it is a fine actioner with plenty of suspense and more brains than its given credit for.",Doom
130,jamhorner,Horrible Genetic Garbage,1,12 July 2007,"This is always the case with movies that are based off of video games. The prelude was excellent and pretty scary. In fact, if I could rate the prelude it would be a 9 or 10 start, but that's not the case. The movie overall sucked. The plot line is completely different from the game. The movie is about a research facility that somehow, accidentally, created these mutations and monsters, whereas, in the game, the research facility actually opened the gates of hell and released demons. What an unnecessary change. They could have done some great things with this new plot but instead they just screwed it over.The acting was poor and wooden. At times the acting was not necessary or overdone. The Rock's appearance was sort of on the line of bragging. ""Hey look who we casted for this movie."" His acting was better in ""Be Cool"" (2005).I am even more disappointed in the fact that they did not include some of the more disturbing characters from the game into the movie. Some of the demons that were, by far, the most creepiest and weirdest thing I have ever seen. There was only one mutation that was noticeable and that was Pinky.The writers could have had a lot of fun writing this movie and they chose not to. The only best scene in the whole movie is the ""first-person shooter"" POV, which came out of nowhere but very well done. The movie was a big disappointment and overall waste of 2 hours.",Doom

132,Derek237,"A bad movie that, admittedly, had a pretty good ending",4,28 October 2005,"I couldn't believe that while watching Doom I actually found myself thinking, ""well, it's no Resident Evil."" Never a good sign. This is a bad movie! It's boring for one thing, and is generally uninteresting. Okay, we have some research facility...something goes wrong...there's a virus...there's monsters...soldiers come in...pointless action ensues. I really defy anyone to explain just what the hell is going on in Doom. It's one of those ""explain-as-you-go"" movies, where in between the action and gore, a scientist tells the characters (and the audience, of course) what is happening. It was in one ear and out the other for me. We've all seen umpteen movies like this. It didn't really remind me of the game at all (though I've only played 1 and 2) but I really think the game had a good look and feel and had potential. It would have been decent if they would have dropped the virus shtick and made the creatures demons from hell. And while they're at it, why not just skip the dull introduction of the soldiers getting the mission brief, which fills up 20 minutes, with another 20 minutes of walking around until something actually happens? Why not jump right into it, like the game does? That would be interesting, I think. I at least would never expect something like that. But, whatever, the movie is what it is. Which isn't good.I have to say though, it isn't completely hopeless. I thought the last 20 minutes or so was pretty good. We get that neat First Person Shooter sequence (that was one thing I'm glad the movie did), and a good fight scene, that even gets a tense build-up. I'll confess, when I saw that BFG (if you know the games or saw the movie you know what it stands for) I did get excited.Doom was not horrible, but it was just boring and by-the-numbers. I would probably even buy it one day on DVD if it finds its way to a bargain bin for $6.99. My rating: 4.5/10",Doom
133,ukproject,Aaaaaaaaaaagh!!! (Doom Guy Scream),7,29 November 2019,"This is a pretty decent movie. Well directed, decent FX, good actors. It's fun.The big problem with this movie is it's called ""Doom"" and is pitched primarily at fans of the game. Those of us who experienced Doom as their first first person shooter were literally blown away and sucked into another world. Even now I can distinctly remember hallways, passages and secret locations. I can remember my heartbeat going up and my palms getting sweaty hearing the heavy footsteps of the Cyberdemon chasing me while rockets swooshed past. Doom was more than just a game. It was an experience and is for me a cultural icon of the nineties.This movie simply isn't Doom. It's a decent zombie flick peppered with Doom references and characters. What annoys me above all is that instead of going for the supernatural outlandish backstory of the game and creating a movie as unique as the game, the makers instead played it safe with a genre that's been done to death a zillion times already.This isn't Doom.",Doom
134,garethvk,Film Review,6,21 October 2005,"Not my best, had to hack it out between meetings and deadlines.In a remote section of Mars, something has gone horribly wrong for the scientists of the Union Aerospace Corporation's research facility. Scientists run screaming for their lives from a deadly threat. Trapped on a barren world against forces unknown, the call goes out for an elite team of specialists to contain the situation, and neutralize the threat at any cost. In the new game to film adaptation ""Doom"" which is based on the phenomenally popular game series of the same name, International Action Star The Rock stars as Sarge, a by the book, no nonsense leader Of a rapid response team who have been tasked with quelling the situation on Mars.His #2 is John (Reaper) Grimm (Karl Urban), the son of two scientists who were killed years earlier in a move that drove John from the Red Planet and into the corps. Unsure about where his head is Sarge suggests John take leave and skip the mission less he provide an unstable factor. Driven by his concern for his sister on the planet, and his devotion to duty, John accompanies his team to Mars via a teleportation device know as the Arc. In no time the team has arrived and begun sweeping the affected areas of the base, and working to ensure that nothing can return to Earth without permission. As the team surveys the dark and isolated lab areas, John is also reunited with his sister Sam (Rosamund Pike), which brings up the memories of their dead parents and repressed hostility over his departure and emotional distance. Of course this is a movie based on monsters and violence, so in no time, there are some strange things lurking in the darkened corridors of the lab and the team finds themselves locked in a series of deadly confrontations against enemies of unimaginable horror. In short order the team is picked off by the deadly opposition which causes strain amongst the survivors, as it becomes clear that the work being conducted at the base was far from the simple excavations that they had been claiming for years. The truth is far more dangerous and soon has the very safety of Earth in the balance. The changing dynamic soon divides Sarge and John and they find themselves at odds with not only the creatures but themselves as they battle for survival and the safety of the Earth.As a fan of the game series I had followed the long development of the film with interest. As production began there were reports that the film would deviate from the game in not being set on Mars and following Zombies more than demons from hell. While the film is set on Mars there is some deviation that may upset fans of the game. Hell does not serve as the source of the enemies; rather it is something that is not present in any of the games. Another deviation is that the film unlike the game is not nonstop action. ""Doom"" moves at a very deliberate pace and when the action comes, it tends to be against a solitary foe. Only for a brief segment near the conclusion of the film do we get a battle against a large mass, and then it is very short. The novel first person perspective shown late in the film was great fun as the audience howled with delight during this segment.The Rock shows once again that he is a rising Star as his charisma and commanding presence propels the film even though he is a supporting character. No matter the cheese factor, or stiff lines, The Rock is such a compelling presence, he makes the film viewable. Urban is good in the lead role, though he is overshadowed by The Rock, as his strong soft spoken mannerisms seem out of place in a macho action setting.All of this said, while it is by no means a landmark piece of cinema, ""Doom"" is fun, and is easily the best game adaptation to film yet.3 stars out of 5 Gareth Von Kallenbach",Doom
135,moviemaniac008,"You need to like Doom for what it is, not for what it should have been!",9,28 April 2008,"Doom is not the best movie. You see, terrible lack of story, small cast of unknown actors (except for The Rock, of course), and the annoying scenes of ''I'll kill this Motherf-'' can get on our nerves a lot. But why am I giving it a 9? Because, even with those flaws, it does rock! But here are my large complaints. First, the movie doesn't have a story except for possibly the first 15 minutes. Next, the cast of actors. They were all unknown except for Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, and possibly Karl Urban, but I think some of them were ten times better than Urban (who was pretty bad in this movie. He should have been nominated for the Razzie The Rock almost won). And seriously, I've been told that Alpha Dog, a movie I want to see so badly, says the F word about 350 times, but I think that the 40 f words in this movie weren't that necessary. And last but not least, the ending. Why did every single character have to die except Karl Urban, the one who really got on my nerves? That is a really bad ending, especially when Destroyer, The Kid and Sarge (my favorites from the cast, without forgetting Duke) all die. Overall, Doom has it's flaws. It isn't, and will never be the best movie ever made, but it is enjoyable. Lots of action, extremely good special effects and a small (but still good cast) are really worth. it. The reason I guess why Doom received bad reviews is that critics took the movie for what it could have been, not what it actually is.",Doom
136,Lando_Hass,"There's blood, gore, guns, action, explosions, chainsaws, what more could you ask for? WHAT MORE?!?!",10,22 October 2005,"This movie, Doom, is based off a the video game of the same name. Most of it's story is taken from Doom 3. Now, I didn't like Doom 3 because it was a boring, repetitive, and mediocre piece of rotten Caesar salad with ranch dressing and a dash of parmesan cheese. It was mediocre. Now, this movie, is basically based off of Doom 3, and let me tell you, bruh, it's probably the most bad-ass video game adaptation I've ever seen. You have everything you need in an action/horror movie: Blood (there's lot's of it), gore (lot's of it), guns (lot's of em'), disgusting monsters (lot's of em'), explosions, fight scenes, and a really Big F****** Gun that'll make you mess yourself if you got shot by it.The movie is about a group of soldiers who are taken to this weird facility because something's gone terribly wrong. When they get there, they find everyone there, but they're all crazy monsters. So, what are soldiers to do in this situation? That's right. Shoot and blow s*** up as much as you canand that's what they do in this movie.Now, The Rock isn't really a main character, but he might as well be since he's the most noticeable. He plays Sarge, the leader of the group of soldiers, and as the movie goes along, he starts to get crazy and psychotic, which is a huge surprise since it's The Rock. Luckily, he's armed with the BFG (Big F****** Gun), but sadly, he only shoots it about five times. Instead, he shoot have shot it about a thousand. What did disappoint me is that he barely shot any monsters with it. Instead, all the monsters are killed by these machine guns, and that's cool, but seriously, there needed to be more weapon variety. I wanna see monsters getting killed by a whole plethora of different weapons.One thing they changed from the game is this: The monsters aren't from Hell like in the game, instead, they're caused by this virus thing, which is cool, because they still get shot up, but having the monsters come from hell would have a bit cooler. But it's forgiven.The movie follows the game's main storyline pretty well, and, get this, it even has a bad-ass first-person perspective scene, where the main character, John Grimm, grabs a gun, and shoots every damn thing in sight, all in first person perspective, just like in the game. I thought that the first person thing would be throughout the movie, but it's only in the end, and when it happens, you feel like you're watching the first game just with really good graphics. Believe it, b****es, believe it.In one scene, one of the soldiers is going head to head with one of the huge monsters in a holding cell that has electrified walls. He has no guns, so get this, he kicks the s*** out of the monster with his bare hands and a computer monitor with a thick wire sticking out the back. He swings this monitor by the wire and slams it against that damn monster. Of course, it doesn't hurt it, but this fight is so ridiculously bad-ass you'll wonder if you just died in the theater and are just watching a movie in heaven. I don't wanna spoil the end of this fight, it's so kick-ass I'd be DOOMED if I spoiled it...you get it?One last thing: There's even a damn chainsaw in the movie. A CHAINSAW! That's all I have to say about that.The only few beefs I had with this movie were this: Not enough action. Even though there's a lot, they could have cut down on the talking and amped up the action. Second, even though I complain about this in every single movie, this movie seriously needed some Gwar tunes. Honestly, when you're shooting the s*** out of ugly demon monsters, the only tunes that come to mind are, you guessed it, Gwar tunes. This movie seriously needed some.

Well apart from a scene shot in the first person. In fact this appears to be a clone of the first Resident Evil movie. Except nowhere near as good. The movie is mostly in the dark, so why it needed a $70 million budget is beyond me. The Rock is fine as the SGT. And Rosamund Pike is an appealing scientist. But Karl Urban lacks any kind of charisma, to be effective in the main role. Maybe thats due to The Rock being just about the most charismatic action star around. However the movie is full of zombies disposed of in the usual way. So the movie is full of clichés and has no identity of it's own. Maybe it would be better to make original films, instead of from computer games. Doom was never anything more than a shoot em up in hell. Hell does not appear, which is very strange.

138,JimD73,Doomed until the last 20 minutes,4,27 October 2005,"Video game movies. As much as I hate them, I still can't help watching them. I don't care how bad movies like Alone in the Dark and Resident Evil were (the latter of which wasted incredible material), I still have hope that eventually, someone is going to get it right. Doom itself was a game I remembered very little of, one of many FPS games I played the first level of and then went on to something else. Too bad I did, as apparently it was one of the best FPS games ever made. Even if it was, movies have a tendency to ruin good plots in video games. Doom didn't look like an exception, but it looked like it would at least get a lot of things blown up. The sad fact is that, until the last half hour, Doom just blows.Apparently, the plot for Doom (if you want to call it that) is based somewhat off of the video game Doom 3. Basically, a portal to Mars has been found, and the red planet is now a used for laboratory testing and apparently nothing else. Some lab experiments have gotten loose and have attacked the scientists. The Rapid Response Tactical Squad (which might be the worst name since The Mighty Morphing Power Rangers), led by a no-nonsense Sergeant named (you guessed it) Sarge (The Rock), is sent in to quarantine the area and take care of the monsters, as well as retrieve the property of the corporation.Eventually, as we all know, the squad is slowly picked off by these creatures. The key word here is eventually. While I do appreciate when a movie builds up to something, this one gets to a point where when someone finally gets killed, I had been playing with my eyelids for twenty minutes. It tries to do something similar to Predator in this sense but fails as the first part has little to no important events, just shadows teasing you someone might get killed in the near future.Once it gets past the first death, it's blatantly obvious who's going to die and when. This is about forty minutes in, so odds are you've been considering this for a while. How exactly they are going to die would be more interesting if there was more variety. All that's left to figure out is how much gore is going to be shown.The RRTS itself is a little bit odd. For starters, just about every character is part of a cliché. There's a religious masochist (Daniels), a drug-addict date rapist (Brake), a ghetto womanizer (Adoti), a first-time rookie (Weaver), a silent bald guy (Operai), one guy who can't speak English (Chin) and the balls-over-brains Sarge. Sound familiar? All that leaves is John ""Reaper"" Grimm (Urban), possibly the only one besides the bald guy and Sarge who actually fits into the picture. Let's just face it, any real elite squadron wouldn't contain a kid who would be better suited to a clerk's job or a 40 year old with a passion for transvestites. Hardly seems like the alpha and the omega.The only thing really worse than the unqualified space marines is the incredibly dumb science behind their mission. Some movies are annoying for using way too many scientific terms. This one is extremely annoying for using none. This is the kind of terminology a six year old could understand. We're talking lots of ""super"", ""hyper"" and ""very"". Let's not forget the cause of mutation: an extra chromosome. Of course, this would normally result in something closer to Down's Syndrome than something with six eyes, but for the sake of the movie, let's forget everything that we really know about science.Forgetting everything you know is pretty much what you need to do for any part of this movie. This movie starts many different subplots that never really go anywhere. The best example would be that between Reaper and his scientist sister, Samantha (Pike). They start something about them having issues, but it's never really explored at all. Then there's the tranny-loving hophead broadcasting their mission and a couple other little sidesteps from the plot that never go anywhere, but are either left in the open or ended way too quickly. It's annoying, to say the least.After suffering through all that, it seems that nothing could save Doom from, well, doom. Lo and behold, the last 20 minutes are pure adrenaline. While I would never want to have the whole movie in first-person, the ten-minute sequence at the end of the movie is the highlight as we see the action from the shooter's perspective. If you hold your hands just right, it's almost like actually playing the game. The final part of this involving a chainsaw and that weird demon thing is just amazing. It is somewhat dizzying, but it ends at just the right time before it becomes sickening.The final fight returns to the normal movie perspective, and while it is in normal video game movie physics, it is still very entertaining. It can be said without a doubt that this movie is saved from being a complete trainwreck solely by the last twenty minutes.The wait for these twenty minutes is pretty much hell on earth, even more so than the movie. A single good action scene is seen in the first hour of the film, and that's not nearly enough to make this recommendable. If you really are an action junkie, be prepared to get your fill, but you're better off going in an hour after the start time. Just get to the good stuff, or else you'll be yelling that same phrase at the screen for a solid block of time.Overall Rating  38%",Doom

When you make a movie based off of a First Person Shooter video game the only way to do it is by not taking yourself seriously. This film has ridiculous over the top action, bad macho cliches, and tongue-in-cheek one liners. These could easily deter many people from this film but for me it made it exactly what it needed to be.DOOM still holds up with rewatchibility because of all the mentioned things the way movies like Starship Troopers does and in my opinion it is an overlooked cult classic.",Doom

142,SimonHeide,Aliens revisited.,6,7 April 2006,"Aliens revisited.The plot is this: In the future, man has discovered a portal to Mars (in Nevada!) and has therefore been able to inhabit the planet where various kinds of research has been undertaken. There is a distress call from the planet and a small group of space marines are sent through the portal to investigate (very similar to Camerons ""Aliens""). One of the space marines sister is working on the planet as a archaeological scientist. She has discovered that the planet once has been inhabited by a special breed of humans with an extra chromosome which made them super-humans. The marines are being briefed by her before they make their ""going-in"" through a nano-wall to some sort of compound. They make contact with zombie-like scientist plus some sort of super-monster.From here on the story intensifies with encounters between marines and this unknown species leading to the inevitable show-down between the good and the bad.I didn't set my expectations to high before watching the movie. It is probably widely known that ""The Rock"" isn't a very good actor and it is easy to get the thought, that the producers simply want to exploit the game by making a movie without artistic aspirations just to make some bucks.But I was surprised. The movie is a thrill to watch, you get involved in the plot and are curious as to what has really happened on Mars. It also has a wonderful twist near the end although, as before mentioned, the inevitable showdown is too obvious. The sequence in the film with the ""first-person shooter"" perspective works well and gives you a little idea about how the game works without becoming to strange in the film. The biggest let-down in the movie probably is, that the characters are presented in a very stereotype way which makes involvement in them very difficult.I know that a lot of complaints about this film is, that it is not true to the game but I don't think that this has to be a qualifying/disqualifying criteria. Think about other movies that doesn't follow the book on which it is built but still works really well /Simon",Doom

144,nodlimax,This is one of my guilty pleasures,6,15 May 2021,Would I call Doom a good movie? Not really. Do I still enjoy it? Yes!For me the interaction between the actors is working pretty well and the movie delivers something resembling the game Doom in terms of scenario. We have some of the monsters that can be found in the game even though they're not really demons but something else.In addition the action scenes are pretty entertaining and especially the first person shooter style scene is very well done.Does the movie still have problems? Definitely. The characters themselves are rather stupid in their behavior and overall pretty flat. The story writing as well is not great.Still watching Karl Urban and The Rock going at each other is pretty fun.,Doom

All the time I was watching it I did not understand WHERE the main characters were or WHAT they were trying to do. I never had the impression that the team of soldiers were so isolated that they were the only hope to stop the danger. The action scenes with the monsters were so predictable that the movie lacked both suspense and excitement. I'm glad I saw this movie on TV instead of in the cinema. Only one scene stood out: the one in which you watch through the eyes of the main character at the end of the movie like a real first person shooter. A perfect ode to the video game. Very well done. For the rest, well, maybe we can only hope that a Sam Raimi or Danny Boyle will one day turn the video game Half-Life into a great horror movie.

A team of grumpy, combat-weary marines (led by The Rock) are sent to a research station on Mars where a homicidal something is eating scientists. The squad includes the scared rookie, the pervert, the religious fanatic and the emotionally disturbed twin brother of the ludicrously pretty forensic archaeologist (Rosamund Pike), who is trying to make sense of the mayhem. The first half is quite tense and scary as the guys search through a series of corridors that look a bit like the basement in my Aunt Sylvia's block of flats.

He's a very charismatic person and certainly not the worst actor I've ever seen. All in all, movies like ""Doom"", ""The Scorpion King"" and the remake of ""Walking Tall"" don't stretch his acting limits too far.Without giving too much away, ""Doom"" (I never played the game, although I liked Quake), is pretty much your atypical shoot-em-up action flick. If you combine ""Resident Evil"" and ""Aliens"" then you've got the whole premise for this movie.First, don't expect too much from the actors. Every line is mostly throwaway material with explosions and mutants thrown in for good measure. The extra(s) part of the DVD highlighted all the great monsters created by Stan Winston Studios, but the set was so dark you couldn't see much of them anyway. I won't go all out and say this was the worst movie ever made, as I recently rented the horrible remake of ""The Fog"", but if you rent this (or watch it on pay-per-view), check your brain at the door.",Doom

150,Mr_PCM,Nothing new to see here,6,13 December 2005,"Standard, formulaic, average, unoriginal  take your pick for a word to describe Doom, for that is what this latest movie adaptation of a computer game is. Admittedly it takes a bit of work to flesh out the paper-thin plot of a computer game, but this effort makes Resident Evil look like an Oscar-winning screenplay.This is a join-the-dots modern teen sci-fi horror; all you need to see is the first 10, maybe 15, minutes and you won't need to see the rest to know how it will end  to the letter. The most fun about this movie is guessing in which order the characters will be killed off by the monsters and who will survive, and even this is not exactly a challenge. All that is needed for this is to see how much character development each soldier has  which is directly proportional to their survival time. All the stereotypes are there  they even manage to crowbar in the standard hot chick/scientist, who also serves to explain all the science-y stuff for the teens in the audience who mostly won't give a damn.So anyway, the basic (and it certainly is) premise is: Sometime in the future, something has gone wrong with a science experiment on a base on Mars, and contact is lost, but not before a message gets back to Earth filled with a gasping warning and screams. Obviously a squad of, in this case, marines are sent in, led by The Rock's Sarge and Karl Urban's Reaper (don't you just love those army call-signs?), to 'assess the situation'  which means 'to shoot stuff'. After a pretty slow start the action kicks in and the monsters appear to start rapidly killing off our squad of heroes in a variety of gruesome ways. Then, following the rather predictable revealing of where these monsters came from and the thinning out of the squad, comes the final confrontation.The saving grace for the film is it's semi-innovative use of first-person camera angle  so it is as if you're simply watching someone else play the video game. What could have been an extremely irritating feature if used excessively proved rather entertaining. At only 5 minutes in length in just one segment, perhaps using it more could have made this movie more than just the by-the-numbers sci-fi horror. If they were dead, Ridley Scott and James Cameron would be spinning in their graves. Director Andrzej Bartkowiak has determinedly ticked off each check-box when it came to Doom; thrashing heavy metal soundtrack? Check. Liberal spraying of the claret? Check. Hot female scientist? Check. Large guns and explosions? Check. Plenty of muscle at various stages of character development in accordance with how long they have to live? Check. Family issue to be resolved before end credits? Check. There's even room for a few extra cultures  including a pair of black marines and one of Asian origin, and even a sardonic Englishman.Probably the biggest surprise about the film is The Rock playing slightly against type as muscular lead with a definite dark side, rather than the muscular lead with the noble agenda. So far in his career he appears to be following in Arnie's footsteps in making a series of forgettable action pictures, and his acting ability is on about the same level. All he needs to do is find a genuine break-out mega-hit like Arnie did with the Terminator, and maybe find a catch phrase that will catch on  maybe even one from his days as a massively popular wrestling superstar? If he does this then he really will be in prime position to assume the now-vacant mantle of number one Hollywood generic action hero.But back to the film. Those who enjoyed Resident Evil or are fans of The Rock will find this film mildly diverting, but most will find it too formulaic and predictable, even by this genre's standards. However, with brain disengaged and good sense set to neutral, it could provide 2 hours of mindless entertainment.",Doom
151,alanhowden-86367,I really wanted to like this,3,24 March 2021,"I love Doom. I played the original games to death and still enjoy the franchise 25 years later. There was a really, really low bar to me enjoying this movie but it still fell well short.The film feels like it was made on a really small budget. Apparently it cost $60-70 million to make but I've no idea where that went as the special effects are cheap, the sets are bare, dialogue is often painful and cinematography/lighting really barebones. I actually like most of the actors in this but I don't think it was exactly any of their best work (I can't believe Rosamund Pike went from this to being an Oscar nominated actress now). The action scenes were not exciting, it was never scary and honestly it all felt a bit panto (google it if your not from the UK).For me though, the worst thing about the movie was the story. The games have a very simple premise: There is a gateway to Hell on Mars. There is a lot of scary stuff you could do with that. Changing it to some garbage about experimenting with extra chromosomes which leads to the scientists becoming the monsters doesn't just mess with the lore it's a much less interesting plot (and the less said about the brother/sister plot thread, or the idea that only bad people are susceptible to infection the better).",Doom
152,actionmoviestar,"""Doom"" is living proof that most action films need to be rated ""R""",7,21 October 2005,"Before I begin to give my review, I know that my one sentence summary my sound kind of strange. I do in fact know that ""Doom"" is all ready Rated ""R""(for strong violence/gore and language). What I'm trying to say is action movies of this caliber(that deals with heavy subject matter) need to continue receiving ""R"" ratings, which in my opinion brings a sense of realism to the things being presented on screen. Well enough about that.""Doom"" based of the video game of the same name, is finally here. Though it has taken a long time, it has finally made it to the big screen. If I must say, this is a very good movie. As with what most individuals already said, the action really doesn't pick up until the second half of the movie. The action sequences were pretty good and was above average for a video game-based movie. The acting was a little hokey but I hate to admit that the Rock stole every scene he was in. This movie was indeed a good part for him. Though I've probably wanted to see more character development out of most of the characters, they did good with the material they were given.I know many people are going to be comparing this to the video game but I, for one, cannot since I've never played it. I can only critique it from an Action Movie Guru's standpoint. I felt like it suceeded on all levels as an action movie and did a good job by keeping the viewers entertained throughout the movie. As one individual already said on another comment, ""Doom"" is one of the best video game movies as of right now, well next to ""Mortal Kombat"" in my opinion. One thing I very much like about ""Doom"" is what I already said before, which is, that it is Rated ""R"" so that means their not trying to censor out everything so they can cater to the little kiddies. It is definitely an ""Unapologetic R"" as The Rock said in many magazines.Whether if you're a fan or not of the video game, this movie is sure to entertain you for it's 100 min. runtime.",Doom
153,EchoMaRinE,a good movie and an OK game adaptation,8,6 September 2009,"This is clearly the best movie based on a game until now but that does not mean it is a master piece. There are good parts and not so good parts and I will try to talk about both. The acting and directing is quite good. The movie is as serious as it should be. No silly jokes or what so ever. Action scenes are nice and the character development is good. They took their time to make a coherent and complete story. These were the good parts. Now, if you know the game, the first thing you would say after the movie is, what was all that about. Although there are some common things going on, the stories are quite different. The bad news is, the story of the game is much better. You don't see the stress, horror and the action in the movie. While I was playing the game, my adrenalin level was increasing to very high levels. Doom is a game where you shoot everything that moves. So keep this in mind if you don't know the game.

A couple of reviews mentioned Predator and Alien in comparison. This film is not in the same ballpark unfortunately. The sets and effects, outside of some of the lame monsters were pretty good and this was a pretty good cast for the type of film. The problem was the monsters, in addition to, being kind of funny looking, just weren't that scary. Both the Alien and the Predator were hardly shown in their films, yet the monster's pursuit of the humans built the excitement. In Alien and Predator over half the films were the monster stalking the characters. The results were intense, and the revealing of the creatures in the end was climactic. A simple formula that would have fit in well here, but alas, too complex for the director to figure out. A bit of editing and maybe ten minutes of new footage and this one could have been a surprise hit. As it is DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY SEEING THIS ON IN THE THEATRE! Rental only!",Doom
157,mockturtle,Romero-ized B-movie,7,22 October 2005,"Call me crazy, but this movie made me think. Yes, it is a B-movie, but as George Romero has shown us there are some subjects that can only be addressed by B-movies. These films are usuallybelieve it or notallegories. Yes, ""Doom"" is a layman's allegory. In the abstract it is considering collective unconscious questions about the young men our country is sending out to kill for us right now under the banner of ""Good"" and, further, about the killings committed by our entire race. Can psychotics do ""Good""? Can good men murder and remain essentially good? Is it a moot point whether humans are responsible for being individually psychotic or not? Believe it or friggin' not, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson appears in a film that not only addresses these questions, but addresses them in the abstract. Not to rag on the Rock, who I like. He isn't, however, in top form presence-wise (in playing his first real not-animated villain he glowers and barks when it would be more creepy and effective if he were just reasonable). Nobody really is. Despite the above paragraph ""Doom"" still wasn't a good movie, or even as fun as another similar vid-game movie ""Resident Evil"" (the first one, the second was excrement). The question then is: Where does this stuff come from? I believe the answer is co-screenwriter Wesley Strick. Strick has written other movies that approach high-concept, such as ""Wolf"" (a B-movie in A-movie clothingof course then it would have been called ""Manimal"") andtellingly""True Believer."" Also the recent, wretched ""The Glass House"" which, obviously, has somewhat to do with privacy issues. If it be thought this should merit flagellation, at least he co-wrote the Scorcese ""Cape Fear"" too. Far be it from me to suggest the auteur theory for Andrej Bartkowiak, whose ""Romeo Must Die"" and ""Cradle 2 the Grave"" did technically deal with issues of race and class. He is really best known as a cinematographer and for his multicamera shooting technique. In ""Cradle 2 the Grave"" he would have 3-5 cameras running at once. Of course, that makes it so that is looks like the dancing in Chicago: cut up legs and arms so it looks like you are hiding that they can't really do it, which is just as ridiculous in the case of Jet Li as it was in the case of Catherine Zeta-Jones; if they can do the stuff, show them doing it!David Callaham?Note that these movies are all fair to middling or worse. ""Doom"" doesn't transcend anything at all, but the point is that all of the cut-out characters don't merely serve a purpose functionally, they all eventually are revealed to serve a purpose thematically. It is not for nothing that Mars and Olduvai (named for the alleged place of origin of humanity in Africa) are often referred to as ""hell"" or that one of the soldiers carves crosses into his skin when he takes the lord's name in vain, but not when he kills. The plot is eventually revealed to be a cross between ""Resident Evil"" and the recent ""Serenity"": trapped in underground compound with genetic mutations based on predisposition to psychosis. This is when you realize that the different traits we've seen in the different characters have been leading up to this, what better sample than soldiers to have about a 50% psychosis rate? The psychosis in a few of the soldiers is obvious, very obvious, as is the lack of psychosis inwellone of the soldiers, The Kid. There is an interesting split with two of the soldiers: ""Destroyer"" is a killing machine (ah, video game talk) but as you observe from his behavior he is not psychotic, whereas ""Duke,"" while not being so violent, is still psychotic as you can glean by his inappropriate behavior concerning women. Another character's psychosis is revealed by his selfish cowardice, he's willing to let hundreds of people get torn apart to save himself. Resting exactly on the divide, intentionally, is Karl Urban as ""Reaper"", he's sort of the video-game-movie version of Harvey Keitel in ""Fingers"" or Joe in ""Golden Boy."" We eventually arrive at the old ""kill those Vietnamese villagers, soldier!/No Sarge!"" moment, where the dialogue seems to have been chosen carefully. Not that I can remember it (remember, it's not actually a good movie). It has something to do with Sarge (Rock) ordering the soldiers not to think (explicitly) and telling them that all he wants are soldiers, just soldiers. Well, ""JUST SOLDIERS!!!!!!!"" anyway. That's when you might start to think about what the powers that be (in this case again a military/industrial complex that basically runs the government with its influence) want in their police force and populace: they want (to draft the Matrix) ordinary average Joe Smith to be able to turn into an Agent Smith murdering machine in a second that will do anything they say, then wash his hands with GSK Antibacterial soap and return to shopping, he can deal with his PTSD on his own time. Of course, the Kid should have thought about how when you join the army you are forfeiting your autonomy and if your commanding officer tells you to kill prisoners, civilians or, say, Jews, you can't say no. Well, you can, but watch what happens. It gives the lie to the Army's ""Soldier. Citizen."" recruiting campaign. Let's not forget, getting that out of a movie like ""Doom"" is like finding out ""Twinkies"" prevent heart-disease. It was a good thing I had the rest of that to think about, because the movie itself wasundistinguished. I once had an English teacher who said that reading too much into something makes it like petting a dissected cat. Meow. In the end, ""Good"" saves the planet, but ""Evil"" owns the planet.",Doom
158,Bungle-9,Some interesting moments flanked by reams of rubbish,5,26 January 2006,"These days (hopefully not forever) game movies suck. That's stating the obvious of course, but I feel it still has to be said. This movie isn't really much different. I didn't think it was as bad as it was made out to be by a lot of people, but still hardly worth paying to see. The simple fact of the matter is that they fiddle too much with the source material which in most cases is very good, as with Doom 3. Here, rather than the demons of hell being unleashed on Mars, we have a convoluted ""Resident Evil"" style plot focusing on people changing into things rather than demons that already existed.There were some interesting moments in the movie however, such as the C-24 based beings choosing the bad people to infect - I think this could have been expanded on a bit - as well as The Rock having some pretty cool lines to deliver and Richard Brake putting in a good performance as Portman. Unfortunately the crap seems to outweigh the good stuff. Rosamund Pike had the same wide eyed po-faced expression throughout and delivered her lines with no expression whatsoever, Karl Urban's accent was a little dodgy, a big pseudo- Matrix style fight at the end which made zero sense...the list goes on.Overall I'd say it's not awful, but I can't recommend it for anyone other than those looking for a cheap gory thrill that is instantly forgettable. I could say that it's ""Aliens"" done wrong, but I wouldn't want to disgrace the good name of Cameron's great piece of work by making any sort of comparison - positive or negative - to this movie.",Doom

If friends of yours tell you this is a decent film, then they are just trying to make up an excuse to not say anything bad about the film. This film ""wreaks"" of a lame ALIEN/PREDATOR rip-off and you just might be catching it on late-night HBO cable. It wreaks of ""B-movie"" potential, but this should inspire the term ""F-movie"" where it will properly rank in my book. The actors sink with the material, there's hardly any action scenes for a movie in this genre and you'll only keep watching it to see how worse it gets as opposed to it keeping your interest. Andres Bartoziak, the director of the ""craptacular"" trilogy of crappy, Urban Martial-Arts thrillers, ""ROMEO MUST DIE,"" EXIT WOUNDS"" and ""CRADLE 2 THE GRAVE,"" is no stranger to bad movie-making and it shows in this film. The special effects are used for ""over-the-top"" significance as opposed to telling a story. The characters are given little-to-none background/development so you do not care if they die or survive. The monsters are close to their video game counterparts, but they are hardly seen because the movie revolves mostly in the dark where it turns out that it's just another ""gore-fest"" where you see all the characters die in icky, gross ways & it's only interesting to people who have an obsession with that sort of thing. ( If they and the film-makers do, then they should have their sanity checked because this is not quality film.)The movie & it's characters have no intelligence whatsoever and doesn't plan on it. The movie, as a whole, can only be enjoyed if you like seeing everyone looking around for something to kill, look around some more, someone gets killed, they look around and heavy metal music plays in the already unpleasant background while another person get killed in a vicious way.

162,A_Roode,"Tense and, although flawed, not just for 'Doom' fans.",6,19 May 2006,"*** This review applies to the unrated Director's Cut and not the theatrical release version of the film. ***'Doom' finds it's greatest strength and weakness from the same place: It is very well shot and tense in the first half of the film before sliding off into more mediocre territory in the second half. The director does an very good job of slowly revealing clues to the mystery of what happened to a research team of scientists on Mars and what their connection to an ancient civilization was. The first half of the film is very effective because there are a number of cheap and clichéd scares that you'll find well telegraphed in many, many other films. Because you've seen them before though, you can't help but cringe and wait for the inevitable results. Much credit to the director for teasing the audience with an expectation of bad things to come. It is a suspense filled film that delivers right up until the bad things DO begin to happen.It is in the second half of the film where the action really picks up. Unfortunately there is a very fine line between knowing how much tension to build up and when to deliver the payoff. 'Doom' is less successful in this regard. 'Doom' runs a very long two hours and spends so much time building tension that the film develops pacing issues. Of course there are many exceptions, and good exceptions, but films with horror elements don't tend to do very well over the ninety minute mark. The script starts to stall a bit and instead of becoming nervous about what might jump out of the shadows, you kind of wish the shadows would just hurry up and get on with it. I think that because it drags so much, empathy for the marines who are the main characters starts to wane. Once that starts to go, it can be very difficult to get it back.The performances in 'Doom' are better than I would have expected for a movie of this nature. The Rock is as charismatic as he usually is and Karl Urban turns in a performance that gets stronger as the film goes on. 'Doom' has been accused of being a bad 'Aliens' rip-off and of course from a plot perspective the two movies have much in common. 'Doom' steals heavily from 'Aliens' but doesn't hold a candle to it.Although the script is weak, the direction and the performances mostly make up for it. A great final fight sequence is a high point, and fans of gore shouldn't be too disappointed as some of the sets look to have been decorated with buckets of blood. 'Doom' is no brilliant gem of cinema but it is diverting. If you can get past a second half which spirals away into a convoluted mess, you may find yourself pleasantly surprised.",Doom
163,schubej-1,Alien Rip Off,3,21 September 2018,"Not even the talented Rosamund Pike could save this mess. The Rock showed that he is pathetic as an actor screaming incoherently over nonsense. As a squad leader he failed to be effective as a leader. And, Karl Urban spent most of the film brooding, apparently because of his sister (Pike), although it seemed like childish attitudes displayed by both. This is just another rip off of the Alien francise only with what appeared on the surface, at least, a more elaborate set. As the film progressed it became just another blood bath film with dead people reanimating zombie like. Not a lot of originality shown in the script and marginal acting makes this one to skip. Even the set began to look amateurish. I couldn't get past the halfway mark.",Doom
164,pressboard,"Some flaws, but not bad - I Give it a 7 out of 10",7,26 October 2005,"I was not going to see this and went in with a very negative attitude. The trailer I had seen several times already was not inspiring and the IMDb reviews (the first few) were not glowing. I went anyway and was pleasantly surprised. The low points: The Rock acted in (BE COOL) but was just The Rock in this one. Fortunately, the remaining actors took up the slack. I was afraid they would use game footage as part of the movie - they did. Did it add to the movie - no. Did it subtract from the movie - a little. It is a short sequence from when a character awakes until he reaches a certain corridor. I still shudder from the use of same in ""House of The Dead"". On the positive side, the movie maintains suspense from beginning to end and actually has a little character development in the male lead (not The Rock). There is detailed exposition of what the Corporation is doing and how the creatures are created. It seemed to be generally true to the computer game story line and I would go to see Doom 2, if it were done at least as well. Above average action movie. Enjoy.",Doom

167,marimbadaddy,"Eh, not to good, not too bad.",5,27 April 2008,"I love some of the other reviews which complain that the movie is too unlike the video game. In contrast consider how playing video game baseball is far far different from playing actual baseball. Both experiences are far different, and at this point in time impossible to be made to feel the same.Such is the case with this film. It has elements of the game, but is only as faithful as it can be to serve the plot. I too have played a fair share of all three Doom games, and I got a kick out of the first person shooter sequence, though it was far too long.The film is somewhat engaging, it contains some elements and scenes from other films like Aliens, and Resident Evil. The plot is pretty thin, the introduction of the sister character gives it far more depth than the video game. The lack of the ""hell theme"" from the game doesn't detract from the film, nor makes it less scary. (The game itself is engaging because you are playing it, and the sound FX, the dark scenes.) The film doesn't quite get to this level of engagement because it doesn't well establish the brother sister relationship, so we don't feel with the characters.The special FX are quite good. The team did an excellent job of creating the look of the video game, with regards to set design and lighting. The actors in the lead are all excellent actors, but were going off of a thin action movie script, and that led to disappointing performances.In comparison to other ""video game movies"" it falls short because of a lack of a great script. I think that movies like Tomb Raider and Resident Evil, are better overall films. Doom comes closer to these than the gooey thick cheese of Mortal Kombat or Mario Brothers however.",Doom

I did like this movie, but it wasn't the best movie that i've seen. There's a part in the movie, near the middle, where it switches to first-person shooter (like the game) and it's awesome. It was probably the best part in the movie. A lot of people were commenting on The Rock's acting performance in the movie, and well, it's not the greatest, but he did okay! I personally would've liked to see action-superstar Vin Diesel in the role, but hey, I had to put up with The Rock. Don't get me wrong Rock is a great action-superstar/wrestler, but I think Vin would've been a little bit better. The stunts in this movie are amazing, and yes like the game has awesome special effects. I have played the game, and yes it did scare the bejezzus out of me, but I did like it, and therefore I liked the movie. I'm going to give it a 6 out of 10, because it was a pretty good movie, I just think it's for die-hard fans of the game only, really.

That's right -- none. The only ""original"" twist is that the main good guy turns bad guy, but that's only after we have some of the dumbest close-up staring we have ever seen from Dwayne Johnson, as if we needed a reminder that he does not have sound theatrical training (no, the WWF doesn't count as bonafide acting lessons). Let's count the clichés: Bad corporation exploiting a planet and disregarding consequences of finding something dangerous to all humankind on earth; dark corridors, some with underfoot and overhead grates from which team members can be snatched by a creature; most everyone dies; some creatures in black rubber suits, others cg; toward the end an unexplained variant monster with a head and mouth as we know we've seen in other movies; and also near the end let's throw into the blender what else? Zombies! But of course the zombies are necessary to insert the video game gimmick where the viewer is the game player (as we move and follow the gun barrel) trying to kill them all. Then with the 2 main and only surviving characters at the end (gee, only 2 of the troops make it, imagine that!), a mano-a-mano (I'm throwing my gun down to fight you -- me, to!) fisticuffs showdown fight-to-the-death.

171,NewDivide1701,Hell on Mars,4,23 October 2005,"***All details will be from the trailers, and spoilers are for other movies mentioned in this review*** The gateway to Hell is only figurative in this movie since the premise of the movie is the tampering of genetics. One of the things Star Trek has been warning us about for years. In a lot of ways, its warnings of genetic tampering is more effective here than it was on Resident Evil. A genetic experiment creating demons over the T-virus reanimating the dead.Doom is a high pace, traditional horror/sci-fi movie with good character development and character revelations, and with an ending that isn't totally expected from the beginning. Some of the scenes might make you jump out of your seats, so you had better check your fibre count first. In some cases it still uses traditional scare tactics to nail the viewers. Although its language usage is unsettling.Some scenes of the movie, as shown on the trailers, has first person point of views, reminding everyone that this movie was based upon the video game, and were quite effective for the whole mood of the movie. Its first person shooter views where a lot better than those that were from another video game based movie, House of the Dead, where it only took footage from the game itself.There are some missing elements, but they took all they needed from the game that allows the movie to unleash Hell.",Doom
172,sullibrandon,A good mindless gory movie,5,24 March 2006,"I know what many of you are thinking. WHAT? He gave THIS piece of trash a 5/10? What a lunatic? And I would tend to agree with you. I believe Doom is, quite frankly, a piece of crap. However, I am rating it based on its entertainment value as an action flick. The 5/10 is a combination of its rating as an action flick (9/10) and its rating as a good movie at all (0/10). There are some movies where if you turn off your brain, you will enjoy it. Some movies do not work even then, but fortunately Doom is not one of them.To summarize the plot, a group of the Rapid Response Tactical Squad is summoned to a remote research base on the planet Mars, named Olduvai. They are able to get through Mars through something called the Arc, a highly advanced alien technology discovered deep underground in the American desert that transports anyone instantly to Mars. As you can probably guess, something has gone horribly wrong at the Olduvai Research Station. While researching archeology the scientists accidentally released some deadly virus that turns people into horrifying, mutilated zombies. Doom definitely earns its R rating.The action in Doom is, honestly, very well pulled off. The horror element, involving the zombies, is neither over-played nor under-played...they scare us just enough to mutter to ourselves, ""ew"" and interest us just enough to openly admire, ""wow, that IS gross!"" The makeup on the zombies is very well done. There are barely any CGI creations in the movie, purposefully to give the zombies a more ""real"" look. And it works. The RRTS, led by the Rock, take on these creatures with mega fire-power, and eventually, the Big F***ing Gun, whose technical name is the Big Force Gun. Honestly, didn't whatever scientist invent that gun realize that the ""F"" in that acronym would be taken to its most extreme point? In any case, the special effects in Doom should be admired....the filmmakers pulled no punches and cut no corners when it came to this department. There is a sequence, in homage of the first person shooter video game off of which the movie is based, that is particularly interesting. Approximately 5 minutes (in the Extended Unrated Edition) are shown from Karl Urban (Reaper's) point of view. It is a very interesting technique, and I thought it was an appropriate way to pay respects the video game that has virtually become a cult classic. The action in Doom is, overall, admiringly well-pulled off, with blood and gore flying everywhere, and if you have turned off your brain, you can enjoy it. This brings me, however, to what happens when you leave your brain on.The characters in the movie are one-dimensional, flat, and basically uninteresting. The only thing they have going for them is that they're human. I'll cringe when I see a guy's arm ripped off, but I'm not actually feeling anything for the character. Since, in Doom, basically everyone dies, the characters serve no other purpose than as a buffet for the zombies. Karl Urban and the woman who plays his sister are vaguely interesting, but both their talents as actors are wasted on cliché, predictable lines. The Rock is just a yelling, screaming, every-day average marine sergeant. I was surprise, though, at the turn his character took near the end of the movie, so the Rock is not entirely at fault for creating a one-dimensional character. Everyone else in the script, and in the RRTS, has signs hanging around their necks, that flash neon lights at the camera, saying, ""I'm going to die."" None of the actors are given a chance to elicit emotion from the audience in any way, they just, like robots, read their lines, and then calmly get slaughtered.The plot is also nothing to brag about. A four sentence summary of Doom: Something goes wrong at the research station. The Marines go in. A bunch of people are killed. Only one or two people survive. With that, you have basically missed nothing of Doom's plot. Even the ""twist"" that the filmmakers put in the movie is highly predictable. It would have been much more interesting if the zombies had somehow escaped the research station, and if maybe a cure could have been found, or less of an emphasis on all the killing and gore and more of an emphasis on the whole back story of the research station and also what was going on back on Earth. Near the end of the movie, Karl Urban's character becomes superhuman, but it's really nothing more than he's stronger. And you never really have a chance to notice his superior strength, as he goes up against one other person who is just as strong as he is. Highly anti-climactic.Doom is gory. Doom is action-filled. Doom is poorly written. Doom is poorly acted out. Like I said, though, I kind of enjoyed the movie. Picking it up off the Hollywood shelf, I knew its reputation. I knew everyone hated it. Which is why I was ready for it. Believe me, the criticism against Doom is well-earned. But if you go into it expecting ONLY good action, not good characters, and not good story, you'll be highly rewarded.",Doom

The opening sequence, the zombies, the monsters, the zombie dogs, the character who ""double-crosses"" everyone at the end..waaayy too similar to Resident Evil! Also, too much of the movie was spent with the characters walking down dark hallways and tunnels, waving around flashlights. Enough already! But I admit that I'm a complete sucker for this stuff. I LOVE zombies, I LOVE monsters, I love gore, and I love huge guns and cheesy science fiction. So I'm going to concede that I enjoyed the hell out of this thing--I'm always in the mood for a movie with monsters and zombies. I just can't help it!

175,Mr_Mirage,A sad waste of the acting talents of The Rock...,2,24 October 2005,"That, in and of itself, should be more than enough to explain just how sad this film truly is. The Rock, IMHO, has what it takes, given the right role, in the right film, to show off acting chops as good as if not better than Stallone or Diesel. This is not it.While there is much in this film that is entertaining, in the Jerry Bruckheimer ""Things blow up real good"" fashion, there is simply far too much that just lays there like a festering gob of infectious human waste.The simple fact is that there are roughly two dozen scenes (I quit counting after a while) where the script reads as follows: we see two Marines enter a dark corridor where... there is nothing, then they rush forward into another dark corridor where... there is nothing, then they enter into another dark corridor where... there is nothing. (Repeat, over and again.) Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) does have several moments that allow him to shine. He may well have done all of his own fighting/stunts, as I have seen (suffered) through enough of his WWF or WWE performances to believe that he did. I kept thinking of watching Unleashed, which was a wretched movie, but Jet Li wasn't bad.If there is one moment that stands out, it is a brief 4-5 minute sequence near the end which looks as if it was taken from a screen capture, and when played on the big screen, and played loud as thunder called from the skies, it leaps off the screen, grabbing you by the throat and refusing to let go. Then, it goes back into a dark corridor...I would give it 10 out of 10 for screenwriters looking for a great example of what NOT to do, and 8 of 10 for fans of The Rock. Otherwise... 2.",Doom

177,Hellrazr360,Coming From A Gamer Who's Never Played Doom,6,22 January 2006,"I'm a big gamers, I love games, they're a big part of my life. Yet, I've missed my chance at some classics such as the game this movie is based on ,Doom. I went into the movie theater ready to watch this movie and I wasn't expecting more than a pointless, violent sci-fi movie, and that's what I got pretty much. From start to finish, Doom does its job in delivering a fair share of memorable moments. But some of these moments in this film are better than others. For instance, the scenes involving Dr. Grimm seem to generally have a sort of uncredible and ""this isn't good stuff"" feeling. This is more or less due to how mediocre of a job Dr. Grimm does with her role, she just doesn't do anything worth noting that's good and hurts the score of this movie more than it should. The marines in this film aren't memorable, with the exception of the Rock playing Sarge, but it's more of their lines that they say that are memorable. Such lines uttered in Doom are typical lines involving the F-word and S-word, lines like ""I'm taking a s**t you dumba**"" and the Rock very slowly saying ""big, f**king, gun!"". These lines aren't much more than what some people that play GTA all day would be used to, but it's always a nice chuckle and laugh to hear some swearing to spice some lines up a notch. Doom's action sequences aren't many, it seems the movie tries to develop a sense of being not-so mindless but does a pretty bad job doing so, and the action doesn't do too much to improve the entertainment from the movie. The one action scene that people said would make or break most of the film is the FPS (first person shooter for those of you that don't know) sequence in the movie, and in the case with my experience during the movie, didn't do much to affect my opinion of the movie. While the idea is pretty dumb on paper, the end result isn't bad, but it's not worthy of being considered a good scene in my books, it's just a bonus intended to make the movie more enjoyable that winds up doing nothing good or bad for it. Doom is a fun movie to watch, it'll be perfect for your typical Saturday night movie that provides the senseless horror/action/sci-fi genre mix to keep you eating your popcorn, otherwise it's not much more than an above-average attempt to bring the hit game to the big-screen.",Doom

I would not describe doom as scary but the special effects were very good and the story believable. While there was a woman in the film we were not palmed off with the obligatory love interest. Doom ran to the tried and approved formula, you had a pretty good idea who was going to survive. There was a scene reminiscent of Aliens which is of course the granddaddy of all alien shoot em up films. And someone always does what any right thinking person would not do. i.e there is one guy guarding when he hears a sound and moves off to investigate. Well excuse me but if I am in a place where there are nasty monsters on the loose I am not about to venture into the dark unknown and give whatever is out there the element of surprise.

180,jpkwolf,One of the better game movies,5,3 November 2005,It was better than I expected it to be. The actors weren't bad at all and The Rock was great as Sarge throwing great one liners. The environments and weapons were all Doom and Doom 3 which was good but what was the deal of only having two demons from the game in the movie? Although they aren't really demons anymore as they decided to skip the cool element of hell and make it just another Resident Evil. Fortunately it was better than Resident Evil 2.The first person perspective scene was the climax of the movie. Great scene that fortunately kicked ass. I was afraid would it work out right. After that scene was the final battle that was quite anti-climatic. Then the movie just kind of ends suddenly which is weird. So it's a somewhat entertaining action movie but so much more could have been done with the Doom license. As an action movie it's decent. Worth watching once but as a Doom movie it's very disappointing.,Doom
181,MosHr,"The writer only played Doom 3 half-way? And, where are the creatures from hell?",7,3 December 2005,"As I remember from my teenage years of playing Doom I & II, it wasn't about zombieish mutated monsters but rather creatures from Hell. There were those brown furry imps, muscular pink quadrupeds and mutilated marines. Doom3 revamped the whole thing and added a zombieish feel to it. This movie feels like Doom3 and the storyline greatly expands on the zombie aspect.The original doom storyline was non-existent mostly due to the fact that a detailed storyline would be impossible to pull off with the technology of that time. The whole game fit in less than 4MB (that's less than 1 average MP3 song). The new Doom3 had characters' PDAs lying around who you could look into and that partly threaded a more detailed storyline.However, what's missing most from the movie is Hell. The original Doom storyline was that scientists open a portal to Hell. Half of the original Doom is actually played in Hell itself; I think the movie would have been better had they dispensed with the countless roaming around the dark scenes and added an actual Hell itself like the game.But, what's great about the movie is that it captures the first person shooter feel inside the Mars base pretty well. It does fall into the trap of looking like every other movie of the genre. This was probably to not alienate the regular movie fans. The gray slimy walls, the weird lighting and the BFG gives it a feel of Doom3 (the original Doom didn't have any lighting so everything was very well lit).The Rock as Sarge does his thing and Urban as Reaper acts well. The girls' acting to me was very strange - it looked like she was trying hard to suppress a giggle at the grim moments. The detailed character description of the unit feels like something out of Aliens but is totally redundant here.That 5 minutes of FPS style action is remarkable in it's visuals, ambiance and wit. Worth the ticket price just for that.",Doom

183,JamesMitchell451,Please Hollywood... just stop,5,12 August 2013,"What happens when you take a first person shooter and turn it into a movie? You get well... this.... One of the most popular and influential video games ever makes its way to the big screen in this sci-fi thriller. A coalition of Earth's scientific and military interests have established a research colony called Olduvai on the planet Mars, but one day all communication from the outpost stops and no one can tell what has happened -- though the final messages suggest it's not good. Believing foul play may have overtaken Olduvai's crew, the Rapid Response Tactical Squad, a team of specially trained military personnel, are deployed to investigate the situation and, if necessary, eliminate the invaders. But Sarge (Dwayne Johnson, aka The Rock) and Reaper (Karl Urban), leaders of the RRTS team, soon discover the situation is far more grim than they could have imagined. An experiment on Olduvai has very literally opened a portal to Hades, and a variety of savage and demonic creatures have overtaken the colony. Now the RRTS must seal off Olduvai, close off any access to Earth, and exterminate the satanic beasts before they can kill again. Doom also stars Rosamund Pike (as Dr. Grimm), Dexter Fletcher, Ben Daniels, and Deobia Oparei. ~ (Mark Deming, Rovi) The monsters look really cool, the make-up and look and feel of the monsters is captured perfectly here. Keep in mind, this is more based on Doom 3 than the other two Doom games. Some of the action scenes are kind of fun, like the final shootout that is shot entirely from a first person perspective. Now everything else about the movie is a complete and utterr failure. The script is a mess, with characters that are flat, dull, and uninteresting. The story is all over the place, and in the end it tries to pull some philosophical crap at the end and utterly fails. The acting is awful across the board, and the dialogue is just as bad. The idea of trying to make movies based on video games is one of the most stupid ideas Hollywood has ever come up with. It just doesn't work!!!!",Doom
184,Strider_1978,It's Doom Jim but not as we know it.,3,30 November 2006,"Well, the first time I saw this film and wrote an IMDb review, when it was at the cinema, or movie theater I came out thinking how much I enjoyed it. I enjoyed it because I had zero expectations, which I went in with for that very purpose.This time I got it from the library and watched with a bit more of a critical eye. Probably a mistake.The film, which to be honest does not have to try hard to be anything other than what it says on the tin is just sometimes a far cry from what it could have/should have been.I do not want to simply trash this movie because of the respect I have for the owners of ID software who were involved with the project. I just have a few 'issues'.The movie does not really 'play' like Doom. It is less involved with the idea of hell spawn and more involved with the idea of genetics. Nobody asks why Jason Vorehees and Feddy Kruger keep coming back for more, and the idea of the parasite that turns humans into monsters, I'm sorry, but the doom monsters wipe you out viciously without taking the time out to leave a message; It doesn't help when they turn and run away from the soldiers. Does it not defeat the object of a dark brooding filthy atmosphere when what jumps out to say hi suddenly turns and runs away?There are some nice scripting and visual nods to the franchise as seen early in the game. There are some nice props and makeup effects that keep the atmosphere running when there is nothing to peek a boo. I know that the film is a Doom adaptation and based more on the Doom 3 game than anything else, but there are perhaps a few too many liberties taken when dealing with a fan base of billions.Hollywood, or who's input or idea it was to change things so severely might have considered that it could, with a bit of thought made a lot of money had it had stayed a bit more authentic to the game. There are geeks out there who would wallow in such an experience, and the rest of the popcorn munchers who spend the money just to be entertained, would be just that.There are positives to this movie. It is held up for the most part by the two main actors in a cast of relative unknowns, The Rock and Urban who contribute strongly. The rest of the cast for me are just a motley crew waiting to be butchered, bar perhaps 'Goat' who for me earns the name 'marine'. Grimm, is quite the face of that marine we are so familiar with on the first person shooter, Carl Urban getting his acting down here, without falling into the Eomer trap. .and moving onto that shooter sequence.It is, for me the best part of the entire film, because it is one for the fans. One of the great things, admittedly about the doom games is the ability to go one on one or one on many with a chainsaw, and we are allowed to indulge our inner geek with that for a short time. There is a nod to house of the dead, some scientists going down in rather silly ways and some shots purely designed to be laughed at in appreciation of silly horror. But God mode, IDKFA, IDDQD . ha har! :) is a good deal of fun to watch and get into your inner geek with.It's not all that bad a film, it's just let down by a few liberties and some acting which could have been better directed. So three out of ten for the props, geek nods, and wise choice of leading actors. Horror makeup ain't bad either.It *is* worthy of a few smiles It is *not* an express elevator to hell.",Doom

I knew exactly what I was getting into and going to get. I was right in that I didn't get a sensible plot, and I got marines blasting at baddies. However I also got humorously bad acting, poor dialogue, unconvincing sets, weapons that look like toys, stupid decisions by the characters (ie. when the rock refuses to call for reinforcements - not to mention the various ""you'll be OK alone right?"" moments), clichés up the ass as mentioned by another poster on this bored (ie. the dark brooding character who's inner torment keeps him alive).

186,bastiaan0740,First good game to movie conversion because...,8,21 September 2008,"As the title says, this might very well be the first good game/movie conversion. And that is...because it really isn't one. Doom (the game) doesn't really have a story to it. So, most of the story of Doom (the movie) is just the regular tried-and-true sci-fi monster script. The kind of script that works. The movie itself reminded me of aliens, with a bunch of high-tech marines in a closed, dark environment fighting powerful, unknown aliens. So what we do get, is a main character named after the doom hero, and the same monsters. This movie has gotten a lot of heat for not being 'Doom'. Frankly, I'm wondering what those critics expected. There was just no other way to make this movie. This movie should therefore be seen as a standard movie, with some recognizable elements from the doom-universe put in, like the BFG. Also, the Rock got nominated for a Raspberry award. I wonder why. Perhaps it's fashionable to nominate WWF stars, or video game conversions. The Rock nailed the part.",Doom
187,larry.launders,What'd you expect?,7,3 November 2005,"I don't get it. How much can you expect of a movie made from a computer game that is a FPS (First Person Shooter) which deals primarily in poking around the inside of a building and blasting anything that moves? With a realistic expectation of what one could get from a movie made from such a game, popular as it was, this movie does just fine.We can lay a lot of that blame on the fact that Uve Boll had nothing to do with this movie whatsoever. The actors were good at giving their characters distinction and some depth, there was a story and a couple of subplots put on top, and that's it. Uncomplicated, stuck to the basic principle of the game, and a slick production. The pacing moves it along fairly well, the soundtrack reminds you it is inspired by a shoot'em up video game, and the primary plot lines are too big to miss.Don't be afraid to see this movie, particularly if you enjoyed Doom (or almost any other FPS) even a little bit.",Doom
188,TensersFloatingDisk,Not even funny bad.,2,18 April 2006,"This was an unfortunate movie.It is a slap in the face of one of the most influential media franchises in history. The Doom games created whole genres of gaming, and influenced music, film, and art-direction besides.But frankly, who cares? I'll dig up my own grandmother and turn her bones into a chandelier if I think art merits it. The problem here is not that Doom: the Movie is a disgrace to Doom: the video game. It's that Doom: the Movie is simply a disgrace. Period.The plot is hackneyed, but that's par for the course. The dialog is shoddy, but nobody expected Shakespeare. The acting is atrocious, highlighted by the strained, over-the-top performance of The Rock, who manages to look severely constipated throughout the movie. Between his grunting and grimacing and muscle-spasming, I kept expecting him to call for clean shorts at any moment.But the real disaster here is that, for an action-horror flick, this movie isn't exciting, and isn't scary. The camera work is beyond substandard, reproducing all the flaws of the survival-horror genre (tight over-the-shoulder shots, reactive jump-cuts, strobe-lighting during fight scenes to make the clunky action seem faster). The bad guys are laughable - rubber monster suits that wouldn't look out of place in a 1960's Godzilla rip-off. And the central set-piece of the movie, the first-person sequence reproducing the Doom franchise's signature gun-cam look, is downright boring. Apparently afraid that the camera perspective would nauseate the audience (ala' Blair Witch Project), the filmmakers instead smoothed out the camera jounce, making the sequence about as scary as a carnival dark ride. To add to the fairground illusion, they over-lit the sequence in cartoonishly bright colors (primarily orange and, for some reason, pink!). It's ridiculous. After that, the final fight sequence is cliché and anticlimactic.And then there's the end-credits, which earn this film its sole additional star.Not worth the price of admission. Pure junk.",Doom
189,nowonmai42,"Sigh. Deep, exasperated sigh.",1,27 November 2005,"Genetic engineering never seems to go well in movies. Rather than curing diseases or upgrading the human body, genome tinkering more often results in lock downs, quarantines, people gravely intoning ""we don't know what we're dealing with here,"" and attacks in dark hallways by monsters that are mostly teeth. ""Doom"" is as muddled and stupid as any of its genre-mates, though is openly dismissive of any pretense of making any sense whatsoever.So there's a lab, of course. It's on Mars, by the way, which means that the Rock and his platoon get to jump into a floating ball of CGI and fall out the other side to get there. These science types have dug up some Martian bones, and notice that they have a 24th pair of chromosomes. They've determined that this extra pair made the Martians pretty much totally sweet in every conceivable way: super smart, quick healing, etc. They clearly must be tried out on humans. According to ""Doom,"" genetic material can not only be simply injected into the arm with a normal syringe, but will cause immediate physical mutations, like claws and lots of teeth. It turns out that, darn it, ""C-24,"" as it's known, actually turns some people into video game monsters. Enter the Rock.The rest of the movie consists mainly of ""bang bang bang!"" and ""aaaaaagggghhhh!"" I'm left to rely on sound effects for descriptors, as ""Doom"" is yet another movie in which you can see or follow almost none of the action due to thick darkness. Could someone PLEASE take a meeting with James Cameron - director of the only good ""Team of Scientists/Marines/Monsters/Dark Hallways"" movie (""Aliens"") - before making another one of these things, to learn that ""dark"" doesn't have to mean ""invisible?"" Cameron proved the feasibility of using low lighting while keeping action visible, so I'm left to conclude that the makers of ""Doom"" and its ilk know their movies are turkeys, and deliberately obscure large parts of their films in the hopes that they'll be mistaken for ""stylish."" ""Doom"" does include one sequence that sets it apart. In its final minutes, it reverts to a First Person Shooter perspective made famous by its game counterpart. I suppose it may strike some as original, but to me it reeks of ultimate laziness. This film has gone beyond being ""inspired by"" a video game, and has actually just reproduced its demo sequence. If ""Doom"" truly wanted to break new ground, it could have provided for distribution of controllers to the audience, allowing us to play along. At least that way we could turn it off.",Doom
190,Cube_TX,Exactly what I expected,4,18 October 2005,"I just saw an advance screening of this movie promoted by the radio station I work for. While this wasn't a total waste of a movie I was glad I didn't have to pay for it. While the Rock looks the part of a real action hero he has a long way to go as an actor. During scenes in which they tried to feature some frail attempt at a plot I found the Rock to be the 2nd least believable character behind only the laughably blank female doctor. The special effects were the star and they should have stuck to that. This was a mindless shoot-'em-up and that's fine, but don't try to turn it into anything more.The space marines were your typical characters in any sci-fi or action movie featuring a group. We had the handsome rogue, the jerk, the preacher, the psycho leader and the interchangeable deadmeat characters who are only there to die in a loud and grotesque manner. The makers of this movie watched Aliens and the remake of Night of the Living Dead then made their movie out of a mixture of the two. I was waiting for Sigourney Weaver to make a cameo. The plot was a total ripoff! I wondered if this was done on purpose after awhile. There was a character named Patricia Tallman, who was the lead actress in the Night of the Living Dead remake. Perhaps this was done on purpose.The most interesting character aside from the leads was Goat, the preacher -- unfortunately he was killed off about 30 minutes into the movie. They left the deadmeat cannon-fodder guys for last which led to some blank scenes.Again, I wasn't expecting the next Gone With the Wind. This movie will entertain you if you don't put any thought into the plot whatsoever -- since the writers obviously didn't either. I was very surprised to see so many parents bringing their small children to this flick. This is NOT a movie for kids AT ALL. The R rating is rightfully earned and parents should take heed. The advance screening I went to actually had parents walk out due to their children being scared or even nauseated by all of the gore. The radio station even received calls of complaint about the violence. Parents should research what they let their kids watch.If you're looking for a good movie, go see something else. If you like braindead bulletfests then this is the movie for you. Good sound and special effects make this at least worth watching on DVD.",Doom
191,Xploitedyouth,DOOMed from Day 1,1,11 March 2006,"DOOM is the most faithful video game to movie adaptation yet. The smash hit game was about a nameless and faceless Marine on Mars who walks through dark corridors shooting monsters. The film is about a group of Marines who might as well be nameless and faceless who walk around dark corridors and, eventually, shoot monsters. Of course, the monster shooting doesn't really begin until about three-fourths of the movie is over, and a damn near endless amount of time is spent on genuinely pointless and stupid exposition. But there certainly are corridors. Dark corridors. So dark that you almost can't tell that it's the same twenty-foot stretch of corridor shot at a different angle each time a character walks down one. So dark that you almost can't tell that the monsters are nothing more than actors in cheap rubber suits. So dark that you can't even see where the estimated $70 million budget went.

192,hoversj,DOOM is not PARC spelled backwards.,8,22 October 2005,"Good plot. Good twists. Good characters. Good action. And the Rock with no shirt. Who could ask for more?The reviews raked this movie over the coals, so I almost didn't go and see it. I am so glad I decided to ignore them!!! Where I'm coming from: I don't play these video games. I LOVED the movie Resident Evil, but the sequel was lacking. The movie House of the Dead was only missing the robots in the front row to be a MST3K episode.DOOM is not only cool-looking, but it is stunningly well written (for a video game-turned-movie).The plot: Something bad has happened on Olduvai outpost and marines are sent in to kick patoot. They find that there are some kind of creepy monsters up there, and the dead are returning to life to fight the living. Turns out the outpost was home to some genetic experiments, and the monsters may not have come from outer space at all.The main ""marines go shoot monsters on space outpost"" storyline was intriguingly woven with various other conflicts and personality disorders. Each of the marines was a distinct character (which was even lacking somewhat in Resident E), and was interesting, though not always likable.I particularly liked the fact that for once we didn't have to watch another ""oh, no, my EX works here - and we had a really bad breakup!"" and then a reconciliation scene (most likely under water, just before someone dies). Instead, the tension came from an estranged brother-sister dichotomy, which was very well handled (including a cleverly downplayed audio-only flashback sequence, WOW!).I suspect that people who haven't played the game will object to the ""first-person shooter"" sequence that occurs near the end of the movie (similar ""video game view"" sequences were almost unwatchable in House of the Dead), but it's not only a sly nod at the game/players, but it also works as showing the change of perspective of the character it's portraying - he's just gone through a drastic attitude adjustment, and this shows it very well. It's also just long enough to never quite get annoying.",Doom

I just have to wonder: Why in the world are this kind of movies made? This may not be a deep or professional thought about the money world, but: Couldn't these moneys be put in something more useful purposes in this world? For example given as grants to some young, unknown movie directors? I haven't seen any other video game movies that are done recently. Many people/reviewers say that this might be the best of them so far. I rented this because of the cover, and I thought this would be at least an average/mediocre action/hero movie, with some interesting ""mythical"" plot with labyrints and tunnels and monsters. But it wasn't. It was so bad that it was almost impossible to watch. There was nothing interesting in this movie. It wasn't scary, it wasn't exciting, it wasn't sexy, it wasn't good looking or good-sounding. It was like there would be no script in the movie: Nothing happened. It was as close to being nothing as anything gets.The Rock will never be an interesting action actor: He isn't believable person. He looks stupid. The Rock could never save the world. (Anyway, a better movie with him starring was The Scorpion King.) The other lead actor (Karl Urban) is much better, but he doesn't have a role in this movie. The movie is so shallow, it's like watching someone play some medium shoot-up game in some crowded game hall. Nobody remembers after two years from now that these movies even excisted.

We are do not care who these marines are. We want to see them killing monsters or get killed by monsters. Now this movie does have that, but there are too many talk-filled plot scenes in between. There are also too many scenes where they are looking for the monsters. In doom we to find the monsters, and we want to find lots and lots of them. We also want to see lots of different weapons used.

If this film was renamed and removed a few minor elements from Doom to make a whole different movie, I'd give it a higher rating. It's very similar to Aliens, except worse.The problems I had were the awful lighting, slow pace, and trying to figure out what's going on. I didn't remember any of the character's names and the plot because of how slow it was. There were no demons, I think. It was more of a zombie/monster film. The score was odd, when they put metal music in... It was pretty hilarious. The soldiers would walk down a hall for ten seconds with epic music in the background and just cut to them doing boring things. The movie probably got it's inspiration from Doom 3. Doom 3 was a very different from doom 1 and 2 because it was a horror/survival game. The film and the game came out in the same year, so I find that a coincidence.I would recommend this film to anyone who is into sci-fi and horror.

The beginning to middle of the movie isn't nearly as good as the final FPS (First person shooter) sequence and the final battle. The beginning to middle wasn't horrible, but it lacked accuracy from the game (Of course. Do these directors even PLAY these games? Ever? Do they just look at the back of the box and say ""hey, there's a movie here!"" FOOLS!) Like the shot of the BFG (Big f'ing gun) in the game was Green. Why the hell was it blue in the movie? WHY? The goods news is, the end definitely saves the movie from being trash. The first person shooter is intense and fantastic. And the final fight between the two big players was the same way. The metamorphisis (sp?) on the Rock's character was fantastic and he acted through it perfectly.So it gets a respectful 6 out of 10, mostly for the ending. It definitely saved the movie.",Doom

If your looking for a movie with a great plot then don't watch this but if you just want to see an enjoyable action movie then watch this. The acting was done well.The monsters looked like they do in the game but there was only a limited amount of monsters,we usually get to see the same ones so for the next movie (if there will be one) I believe they should add some variation to the monsters.

199,trancejeremy,"Almost Doom, but changing the premise was disappointing",5,10 March 2006,"While Doom wasn't the first popular first person shooter for the PC, it was the first one that was a phenomenon, the followup to id's Castle Wolfenstein.Basically, you played a marine on Mars sent to investigate why a base had suddenly gone quiet. All the other Marines went ahead and never came back so it was up to you. Eventually you discovered that somehow a gateway to hell had been opened, and the base invaded by demons and devils The recent remake of the game, Doom III, actually put you (the player) inside the bad while all hell was breaking lose.This movie follows the original game's plot, a team sent to investigate, but changes the demons from hell to pretty much just zombies. I had to say it, but if you've seen any zombie movie, you've pretty much seen this.That said, it has a lot going for it. The characterization is actually well done, the acting is good, the special effects are slick. Just driven down by a clichéd plot.Someone else commented that the plot of demons from Hell was changed to zombies so as to not offend Christians, but the opposite is far more likely. If they didn't want to offend Chrisians, they wouldn't have added a crazy Christian character who likes to cut himself whenever he takes God's name in vain (gee, that's not offensive or anything). I suspect they changed it from Hell and demons to zombies to be more secular, as the screenwriters view of what a Chrisian is like is obviously the crazy guy, even though I don't think any Christian is actually like that.It's a shame that Hollywood let it's anti-Christian bias ruin an otherwise pretty good movie.

200,axopnk,Interesting spin but ultimately unfulfilling,3,29 January 2008,"Video game movies are very difficult to make because gamers have their vision of what the movie should be like, while the audience has their expectations. Unfortunately in this movie both groups needs end up being unfulfilled. The 1st major problem with doom i would say is the story. Granted it was a video game, so creating a story around a game could be difficult...but NOT that difficult. 1. The pace of the movie is a problem. Let's face it, watching a bunch of guys around dark environments with guns drawn is pretty boring for an hour and 50 minutes when the environments to dark, can't really see any enemies and when you seem them their already dead. (see Aliens for correctness). 2. The plot was completely misadvertising. From the first initial moments you think that mars base is completely under monster infested control. WRONG. Really awkward to see other people there and going about their business when there is a major threat that's happening literally down the door way. Plot holesa. The mission. There supposed to go there to find out what happened to 6 scientist. You would think after finding some deranged mad man and a severed arm that a special ops force would set up a perimeter plan, ultimate object, gather data information etc. WRONG. (see Aliens for correctness). b. Speaking of threats, it seemed VERY pointless for the rock to continue to ask Sam what is going on. Finally after an hour and a half of killing she gives him the information. One of those ""idiot"" moments. You would think a scientist would have told them the situation right up front and what they were working on instead of having a special ops team walk into a trap. c. Why would you keep other people around the complex when there is a major threat that just occurred? Why not just send them through the arc initially? d. Why did sarge never want back up? He wasn't trying to ""steal"" a monster's blood/research. e. OK so there's this whole 24 chromosome thing. So what? It's never explained how one becomes a ""super human"" and a ""monster"". f. How did Sam know her brother wouldn't be a monster? Oh right, i guess saying ""your my brother i know you"" is enough. Yeesh. g. Why have a open top area containment field for an experiment? h. A duh moment is when the rock says ""they weren't trying to stop something from getting in, they were killed trying to get out"" DUH.i. Why did sarge want to kill non monsters? A soldiers knows that protection of civilians is first priority. Unrealstic. j. Why didn't rock become a zombie monster? why didn't john become a monster? no explanation k. Never solved issue of whether condition was ""reversible"" so why even leave the audience wondering? ex. ""it may be reversible"" ""it's irreversible"" then rock shoots monster dead. l. Why shoot a team member when you could just do it yourself? 2nd problem is cast1. The rock-every movie needs a wild card in the group to add that needed ""he needs to die/ creep"" aspect, but it shouldn't have been the rock. Asking a lead character/ actor to play the bad guy while leaving a supporting actor to take the glory is terrible. The audience naturally wants to follow and side with the lead and not a support. Having the rock become a double cross makes the audience feel they've been cheated of a good character. A double cross needs to a supporting actor. NEVER the lead. 2. Sam-for some reason she didn't seem right for this movie. The most irritating thing of this movie is she doesn't accomplish anything with her research. The only thing that solves the ""mystery"" is the data she downloaded, which makes her research pointless. 3. Duke-the ""I'm hitting on your sister"" angle died very quick. Especially the flirt scene. Yeesh4. Portman/Frontman-is it just me or does this guy look creepy and too much like a drugged up junkie then a special ops soldier? Another idiot scene is the reaching for the clip scene in the bathroom. Wouldn't a soldier be prepared at all times? I would think reloading your gun would be first priority before being put in a position of vulnerability. 5. Mac-terrible character who could have been much more. He was put in there for 5 minutes total. Here i am at the arc. Here i am dead later.6. Pinky-this guy is strange. He looked and sounded weird, whiny and irritating through the entire movie. Nuff said. 7. John/ Karl urban-probably the only solid character in the movie but not really that much star quality power to be a lead. 8. The kid-I'm going to use the line front man said ""i asked sarge for some pussy. Then you showed up"". That sums up his character in a nutshell. 3rd-was all the cussing/ profanity really necessary? I guess the director wanted to show they were ""bad ass"" grunts or something but actions speak louder then words. Secondly, a special ops marine soldier use of profanity would be almost none. Overall this movie does not do justice to Doom with the exception of the first person shooter view point. One can only hope Halo doesn't end up like this....",Doom

Well, in some ways it did. It gave a realistic spin on the game itself, instead of releasing the monsters from hell as it is in the games, they are Bo-engineered. However, this idea has already been done to death in other movies such as Resident Evil and its sequel.The movie takes place around a base operating under the auspices of the biggest corporation in the world who years before discovered a portal they call ""The Ark,"" which can transport anything between Earth and Mars. On Mars they have a base called Olduvai, after the plateau on Mars. At this facility the scientists and doctors have been performing Bo-genetic experiments which, sadly, have gone awry.Enter The Rock in perhaps his best performance to date aside from Walking Tall. I have to admit this was a role he was perfect for. Called ""Sarge"" he leads a contingent of Marines to the facility to seek and destroy all threats and obtain the data of the experiments. In that vein I will say like Van Damme that Dwayne Johnson has gotten better as time goes by when it comes to acting. Anyone who doubts me on that comment about VD just watch In Hell and you'll see what I mean.Anyway....To me the biggest similarities between the movie and the games is the monsters. That's it. As for the movie itself, I would have given it a 9, because despite it being a beat-up concept I felt that the story was quite good, but I had to take away some points because of the insane FPS view during the movie. It seemed too much like a video game instead of real life, and the character doing it didn't even take damage during it, even though he takes a beating like no other from some of the creatures in it. Nice try though, just came off as very cheesy.All in all, the movie is worth seeing. I give it a 7 out of 10.",Doom

Given the fact Dwayne Johnson AKA ""The Rock"" gives some fun look to the film but minor.This film became a disappointed view of what should have been an in your face experience that fans grew and loved on the video game.

A great lead character and intriguing enemies won't matter if the story and writing are poor. That is Doom in a nutshell.Now hold on to your fists- I did enjoy parts of the film. Taking place on Mars is coolif it actually had anything to do with it! The whole film is set in a tubular sector beneath the surface of the red planet. Basically, Doom could've been set in Lino Lakes and we wouldn't have noticed. While none of the killing scenes are done as well as those in the Alien series (which Doom has been compared tosomehow), there are still a few good monster-kills-idiot scenes.The Rock does yet another killer job in a movie, playing a Sarge. He delivers all his lines with great enthusiasm, and is the only actor who is noticeable, either due to bland actors/actresses or just bad character development (which there was none of, except for The Rock!) Overall, I'd watch Doom if you enjoy movies that are meant to be kick-ass scary, but aren't. Heavy metal music during so-called ""scary"" scenes doesn't work.

It will be really fun to see this in company of a theater full of aficionados.The film is actually LESS violent than the game (but not by much) and there are more zombies (sorta) and there is no evil guy who throws skulls at you... but the sense of moving through portals, and navigating through the maze of tunnels and various rooms is flawless... dead on, and at every moment I was surrounded by the team, felt like I was in the middle of the action, the crescendo of which is when you assume the first person shooter view which was fantastic - I was THERE, it's so well done, you are inside the game - I mean MOVIE - like I've never experienced with any other film. The effect is brilliant and renders one into a state of complete immersion in the moment.I had my nails dug into my boyfriend's arm for a lot of the action, it's very gory and graphic, and the evil tongue is ultra icky. When you see this you'll know what I mean. The imp. The baron. The evil gnashing teeth (as seen in the trailer)... it's all convincing, there script is good, there's no cheese factor, I was so absolutely there.You will be too.

You see, in an FPS game, the player automatically has an emotional investment in surviving or completing the game-- but watching an FPS sequence in a movie is about as exciting as watching another person play an FPS game.Which finally made me realize the difference between an FPS game and a movie-- a movie, since I was only watching and not actually ""playing"" it, first needs to get me interested in its characters, plots, and all the other things that movies are made of. But in this movie, there was never really enough focus or depth to the characters, the plots or even the action or cinematography-- so I was never really interested in ""what happens next?""I guess that's the difference between a so-so movie/ script/ director/ etc., and a really good one. The trivia says they spent 12 days filming the FPS sequence-- now if they spent more sharpening up the script and filming the other 100 minutes of the movie, this movie might be something special.",Doom
207,kasserine,Entertaining,8,23 December 2005,"Doom is the latest video game to make it to the big screen and also the latest effort by Dwayne Johnson, aka The Rock. When a film-goer thinks of The Rock and a video game turned movie, they probably have certain expectations. In the case of the actor known as The Rock, a fan would expect a certain level of action where Mr. Rock could flex his action hero muscles. In the case of Doom the video game, a gamester would hope to find all his favorite game elements reach the screen.I think that DOOM delivers on both these fronts. How satisfying the results, I suppose, is up to the individual viewer. For me, with fairly low expectations, I was quite entertained with what DOOM delivered. I mean, I wasn't expecting the GODFATHER. My expectations were as follows; well paced action, a reasonably compelling plot, decent acting, and top-notch special effects.As far as pacing and action, DOOM held my attention. The film opens with a mysterious call for help from a space station that results in a plucky band of Marines being sent in. After the initial frame of reference is established; problem at space station, Marines need to help, the film moves at a fairly decent clip. A nice job is done with building up the suspense of ""what's out therewhat happened..?"" and a judicious use of ""monster attacks"" in the first part of DOOM allowed me, as a viewer, to engage the film with more interest. When the monsters really do attack in full force, I was much less jaded by the onslaught of special effects.I'm not a huge fan of video games and am less familiar with how well the game was adapted to the big screen, so I can't really comment on how successful the film captured the experience. My understanding is that it didn't deliver for fans of the game and that the general premise, a demon break out from Hell was clearly not present. However, as a stand-alone plot, sans video game expectations, I thought DOOM was perfectly adequate plot-wise. Again, this isn't CITIZEN KANE, so I really only expect it to be fairly reasonable. While not the premise of the game, it's a perfectly serviceable storyline. It's your typical secret government plot to design and create a super being. By using violent convicts, the evil government types figure out a way to harvest these violent tendencies. Of course, something goes horribly wrong, hence the Marines being sent. I've seen this plot before in various incarnations and didn't find it a problem as a storyline for DOOM.As for the acting, well, I think The Rock phoned it in a bit, not enough to destroy the film, but I expected a little more from Duane. I know he can do better. The rest of the cast performs decently to varying degrees, with some performing better then others. Standouts included, Karl Urban as John Grimm, and Al Weaver as The Kid. However, overall, the Marine unit didn't feel much like a Marine unit. I think some actors were miscast, and their characters poorly written, in particular, Richard Brake's character Portman. Portman is a drug addicted medic and seemed out of place throughout the film. The acting was fine, but the character just didn't make sense to me. This is supposed to be a super elite Marine squad and they keep a divisive, unstable wacko? Makes for some nice conflict, but I found it a little hard to swallow.What succeeded the most were the special effects. I have seen so many different incarnations of various monsters in movies that I'm a bit jaded. I thought the transformed creatures in DOOM looked pretty cool. The filmmakers clearly put some money into them. One of my favorites's had to be the transformed wheelchair bound scientist. The transformation of having a wheelchair bound monster slogging about, was both humorous and inventive. The best, however, and what made the film for me, was the scene that had John Grimm killing monsters from the viewer's point of view. It was sort of a ""game-cam"" and fit perfectly within context of the film. It was a gimmick, but I hadn't seen it done before, and it was entertaining enough to provide some momentum to DOOM's closing scenes.DOOM is an entertaining film. Filmgoers wanting a close adaptation of the video game, will be disappointed. Those wanting a striking horror/sci-fi film ala' ALIENS will be disappointed, too. But, for those of you less familiar with the game version and more forgiving with this genre, in general, DOOM is just the film for you. Buy some popcorn, sit back and enjoy.",Doom
208,jwtrox08706,Have low expectations for this one so you won't be too disappointed,5,17 December 2006,"When I found out they were going to make a movie based on DOOM, I was skeptical. The original DOOM and the sequels that followed it, before Doom 3, were simply stress relievers, classic early '90s stuff. No plot to get in the way of you kicking some major ass, hence my skepticism. Apparently, Doom 3 is where Doom actually has a plot. That is what I don't like about Doom 3. However, I decided to get Doom on DVD. With low expectations, I watched it in my dorm room at Western Kentucky University. I was quite surprised. Yes, the acting is substandard and so is the plot, to an extent. But the horror, while sometimes predictable, is pretty good and the monsters are just vile. They copied off of Resident Evil with the idea of people mutating into the monsters. The best segment is the subjective camera segment that is an homage to the game itself. It somewhat duplicates the first-person shooter game that Doom is, and I found that to be pretty cool. This is a guy's movie, unless you are a woman and you like this sort of stuff. But it is certainly not one of the best movies I've ever seen.",Doom
209,tomq5p,Nothing like the computer game,1,4 August 2006,"This movie does the classic computer game no justice. The game was exciting and action-packed. The movie is neither. The game had great looking monsters. The monsters in the movie, when you actually see them, are ridiculous. Maybe, since I am older, the game wouldn't appeal to me anymore either, but I doubt it. The movie stars The Rock; that's really all you need to know. The dialogue is terrible and long-winded and there really isn't that much good action. The only part that was kind of cool was the sequence shot to look like a ""first person shooter"" computer game. That was entertaining. I was actually bored to tears during parts of the movie, and there is no reason for that to happen during an action movie. I don't think fans of the game or sci-fi fans will like this movie. Avoid this movie at all cost. And I say that as someone who usually likes action, sci-fi, and horror films. I rarely give a movie this rating, but...1 out of 10",Doom
210,DexX,Why so much hatred for a reasonably competent film?,6,24 May 2009,"I wasn't expecting much when I popped Doom into my DVD player. I got it for free in a cheap boxed set with a couple of other movies I actually wanted to own, and out of curiosity I threw it on the other night and gave it a go.As a film that tops many ""worst of the year"" and ""worst video game movie"" lists, and often compared to the celluloid excretions of hack's hack Uwe Boll, I was expecting something very bad indeed.Half an hour in, I was wondering when it was going to get bad. An hour in, I was wondering if all the bad stuff was in the finale. Then the final credits rolled, and I was left wondering if I had seen the same movie as everyone else.I am not going to heap glowing praise on Doom, by any means, but it really isn't that bad. In most ways it is perfectly competent, if not outstanding. The script is no better or worse than most action films, and the cast, while admittedly B-list or lower, are fairly good for the most part, especially Karl Urban and Rosamund Pike (though as a Kiwi and a Brit, their fake American accents grate a little). The Rock brings modest but surprising depth and complexity to a shallow role, initially the action hero role, but gradually becoming more sinister. A few of the bit players are poorly written and performed, but most of the cast do a fairly good job.Physically, the film is also competent - nice-looking sets, cool weaponry, decent costuming. The monsters are mostly from the man-in-a-rubber-suit school of makeup, but they are wisely left in dim light and shot in quick cuts that don't reveal too much. The special effects, important in a science-fiction film, are used sparingly and are quite good overall, including one well-done all-CGI monster.Of course, it has some big flaws. Many of the cast fall into the standard horror movie trap of being too stupid to be allowed to live - walking off alone, putting down their weapons, that kind of thing. The script also just doesn't have a great idea of where it's going or what it's doing - the whole thing is a bit fuzzy and lacks a clear narrative focus.The film's biggest problem, and the source of its most intense criticism, is that it almost completely ignores the established story from the Doom video games upon which it is loosely based. The source of the monstrous invasion is completely different - a bio-engineered virus instead of a portal to hell. I agree that this makes Doom a poor adaptation, but it doesn't make it a bad movie on its own terms.Much derision was also piled upon the first-person-shooter sequence, and some critics claimed that most of the movie looked like a computer game. Well, those critics are idiots - the first-person section is less than five minutes long and occurs at the film's climax. Not only that, but it's even justified by context.Look, Doom isn't great cinema. It isn't even GOOD cinema. It's reasonable, though, and is leagues ahead of Uwe Boll's unwatchable tripe. I am baffled as to why it was almost universally hated.",Doom
211,Filmcritic624,Doomed to Die,3,26 December 2005,"Here's a hint for the what this movie was. Dreadful, Disgusting, Disturbing, Dreck, and as mentioned, Doomed.This movie certainly was a movie that was never meant to be made. The Rock, who spews out the venomous words that parents hate to hear their children speak of, as well as some crude humor, and less entertaining effects for a more unenjoyable. Actors are used incoherently, and the plot is pretty stupid and basic, as more blood and guts spatter the screen for everlasting effect.Now, why would I give it 3 stars? I could have easily given it 1, but the the extra 2 points are for the effect that it receives in the superhero effect. You be the hero, and its not that bad, as your killing people, and getting the firsthand view.Its not a video game anymore. Its dead.",Doom
212,kaj.lb,For the gamers,6,6 April 2006,"Who came first? The egg or the hen? When it comes to movies, what came first? The movie or the game? It doesn't seem like Hollywood has quite figured that one out yet. The statistics are still in favour of the movie first and then the game. Here we have lot's of examples; X-files, Star Wars, 007 and Starship Troopers just to name a few. But when it comes to the opposite the track isn't so clear.Sure, 'SIMS' have been on most soaps so far. But setting that aside, Lara Croft and her excavation missions was one of the first intertwined results from one the virtual game world into the silver screen I came across.We have all seen the migration waves from the comics into movies and vice versa. Superman, The Phantom, X-men, Sin City etc. The list is very long. In this area the intersection to cartoons are natural.But who rips a classical FPS (First Person Shooter) game straight off from the computer screen and makes the trouble to make this into cinematic movie scenes? And, on top of this, integrates these into the movie plot? DOOM does! It even includes the 'BFG'-gun ! This sounds like music to all those computer gamers out there. And, to those ears, I can vouch for it! You won't believe your eyes. Welcome to step into DOOM 'real' world! DOOM is a very old classic FPS computer game running under DOS.Originally released by ID Software back in the 1993 ('DOOM Clones'). A reasonably adequate history of the game can be found at:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOOMBut how does this DVD play out as a movie then? For non-believers and non-gamers this production will most probably be a disappointment. Ironically, this movie stumbles on one giant obstacle: the producers love for the game. Most likely there will be two 'non-gamers' categories that will love/hate this movie. Lovers will be the group that liked Allien movies. The rest will probably trash it.In the twilight zone between two genres like this a balance must be found. So far, in my opinion, Sin City is the only one that does the trick. The story is the magical word here, as always, when it comes to movies and books.In the computer game the plot was more extensive than in the movie. Albeit more adapted for the task at hand: to create a crescendo to the ever escalating intensity of the game leading up to the summit.In my opinion the script is gravely flawed. It seems to lack any input to 'how to' write a story that can appeal to the genre without being a believer in the game DOOM. The sad thing about it all is that it could have been done! Even I could have done better! That really tells it, does it not? So close yet so far away is my verdict.Spoilers section below.SPOILER SECTION  REALLY!!!- <<<<< SPOILERS >>>>> The producers of the movie DOOM saw the need to scale down the plot of the game since it was too 'off the scale' for any realistic plot.It is my assumption this movie was based on the DOOM 3 version. There our hero (you) only interacts with a few other companions in the start of the game. Later, when you have been sent to find the lost scientist (alone) the game commences with just this one character. At stations, in the game, the interactions with others are sporadic and non lasting.In the movie, on the other hand, the 'you' are part of a group, USMC with comrades. A 'must' for a movie storyline since the 'one man mission' will soon hit the dust unless the idea is a marooned man on an isolated island with a football.With the team interaction is now possible. And, now the bad happenings are cut down to an extra set of DNA strings (door to hell is out of the story) that turns ordinary people into the enemies. This is a classical Hollywood theme. The opening to the gate of hell was scrapped.The end fighting scenes have good merits even though they are based on a previous rather uncomfortable happening (Sarges 'punishable by death'-act).The end scene in the elevator is very close to a scene in 'Gladiator'.WHERE??? I'm dumbfounded! Where is the human interaction threader-end? Where is the 'punch line'? What was the boiled down point? Where is the after-taste? Where did we have the 'moments', with it's camera view. And the music for those?Where is the 'unseen fear'. Where is....... the movie this film COULD HAVE BEEN ???I don't know!",Doom
213,suprez,Fanboy?No.. Respect of someone work?Yes,2,4 September 2007,"No one can expect much of a movie based of a popular video game.Everyone remember the flop of Marios Bros,Tomb Raider.It's was now the time to make the Fan and the producter of the real doom (The most popular horror games ever made) look like a bunch of retarded spoiled idiot that can't create or love a good story.It's not about Fanboyrism.I never played doom III , which the movie is mostly based.By mostly i mean there's only a few thing that share similarities of the reel doom 3 story.The Monster , Where the action happens(Mars) , and some of the character name (Sarge) , etc .Anyway , the plot has nothing to do with the reel thing.The only similarities it's the name the place and the appearance of the monster.This movie actually it's more a rip-off than actually a praise of the legendary video games.Take the name the place and the monster and copy paste it into a mediocre movie and BOOM we got a sci-fiction movie .It's not about Fanboyrism.It's about respecting the material of someone else.The real writter and producter of the games probably cried the entire time seeing this piece of junk.I see them yelling - That what we deserve? THANKS YOU Hollywood FOR THE RIPP_OFF.They probably blackmailed the director and burned the other project.It's all a big RIP-OFF sharing almost no similarities of the video games For people who never played the video game.Sure it can be an average movie.But the reel plot is just superior of the one they used here.It's a shame that the producting team of DOOM the movie never played doom3.They probably watched a trailer and took 3 name the place and the monster appearance , called Warner Bros , asked them 40 millions and started the production.This movie could have been so much better.They used a Minimum of doom and put their retarded idea into it.Why put some of your idea when the original idea are what make this game so successful?What would have happened if PETER JACKSON just used the name and the place of LOTR but made a completely different story?Video game has sometime great story but they never use them.When it's will happens maybe we will have our first great transition of a video game to the big screen.Until than , enjoy the ripp-off",Doom

215,Montaya_111,I think I hear a Fog Horn... AW-FUL,3,23 October 2005,"Well... Where to start, yea... Not very good, I played Doom when the first one was out, then when Doom 2: Hell on Earth came out, I played that one too. Then ID did a bunch of stuff, and it started everything really, like Return To the Castle of Wolfenstein (Awsome Game) also the Half Life Series (Which also Rocked) Then Doom 3 came out, it was a lot like Wolfenstein, but it was better graphics, better plot etc. The game was awesome, and I guess my hopes were too high for the movie. I was hoping that some of the plot would fit the game somewhat, but it didn't at all. They left so much from the game out, for Example in the Game they have to go to Mars using a phantom class freighter, in the movie they somehow find this device called the Arc. Oh come on, CHEESY, why didn't they just call it a transporter and then finish for the day. The marines started on Mars for the Union Aerospace Corporation (UAC) and then one marine makes it at the end of the game and is rescued some time later. Another thing that got me was compound C24. Oh for the love of god, for those of you that have played the game, this has absolutely no bearing on anything, as a matter of fact this was concocted out of thin air... something so that the marine in the end could use it in the end and still save the day for life on earth. There were so many plot holes, and they rewrote too much to make it all add up in the end, and it was put together very poorly.However the acting was very good, by The Rock and also by Karl Urban. There were a couple of places in there that I wish some of the actors had died earlier, some of the acting was very bad. And then the best couple minutes of the movie is when they changed the point of view, to see it through the first person, it looked like how you play the game Doom. I didn't bottom it out because there were some parts that were good, but that's the only thing that really saved face was the view through the first person.I would recommend this movie if you haven't played Doom the computer games, if you have, I would highly recommend that you save your money and wait till it comes on DVD and either becomes cheap or just wait till someone else rents it and you just happen to be there.",Doom
216,Jacobi1,The Movie Has A Tendency To Be AWFUL!,1,11 December 2006,"Doom *I still remember waiting in line for this movie. How I got stuck going to a movie that I knew I wasn't going to like? Well, your guess is as good as mine. I remember playing the game on computer. Besides thinking that the graphics were horrible, I found the game entertaining. Great looking monsters, good effects and surroundings, and O.K. choice of weapons. Doom was like this video game. No, literally, this movie was like a video game.After an experiment fails on Mars, a group of Marines go to investigate. Why the Marines, because the Army, Air Force, and Navy where smart enough not to violate the laws of space. This team of what are suppose to be smart and trained Marines are lead by The Rock. There's a surprise! The movie is filled with cheesy special effects and duologue that we had heard a bunch of times in a million other movies like this. Fortunitly the acting is so bad in this movie that, the you don't feel sorry, you just laugh at these people who are suppose to be serious. This is the biggest flaw in this movie, the characters are so serious even though the plot, (and how it turns to the direction of ridiculousness), is ridicules.The worst part of this movie is when we discover that there is a liquid in which if you are injected with it, (or eat, or drink it, I don't know, I really, really didn't care, heck, I'm not even sure if it's liquid), you succumb to super strength which is the only way to defeat the dreadful monsters. The problem is that when this scene occurs, it's a video game. Literally, a video game. The only difference is that you don't get to control the characters, you just sit there and watch. This has to be the biggest tease since, well, since this movie I guess.Doom is nothing but a video game movie. Not a movie based on a video game, a video game movie. The Screenwriters obviously didn't know what to write and came up with this cheesy effect which proves that millions and millions of dollars can go to waste. They should have taken the money and given it to charity. At least there, it would have not gone to waste.",Doom
217,imajestr,Looking for substance? Look elsewhere.,3,22 January 2007,"As a casual gamer, I have played the Doom games a bit and I am familiar with the story. Essentially, the games deal with a portal to hell on another planet, bad things come through, blood, guts, gore, and scary times ensue. The movie does not follow this same path, yet for some reason still bares the same name as the games. It should probably be called something like, ""Alien genetic mutation movie, with a lot of clichés and bad writing."" The characters are cliché and unbelievable from the beginning. We have the inexperienced rookie who is practically crapping his pants before his first mission, so everybody teases him. But don't you think a marine would look older than 17, and maybe, you know, be trained to deal with stress even before the mission starts? We have the jerk who instantly wants to have sex with every woman he sees, is terribly ugly, and of course messes with the other marines just for his own amusement. We even get to see him taking a crap! Great, I know! And what's this? A black guy that wants to have sex with the female lead right off the bat?! Oh, and he also has a good heart underneath it all?! Wow! I've never seen anything like this! The Rock just runs around swearing at people and looking mad for the majority of the film. I'm pretty sure 95% of his lines involved the F word. Maybe the writers thought swearing implies intensity, but it fails, as The Rock's character comes off as terribly two dimensional and fake.Karl Urban plays the only decent character in the movie, but he's not exactly deep either. I'll hand it to him though, he did a good job with what he was given.The entire movie is a B action/horror. It's all very cheesy and not atmospheric at all. If you're looking for something scary, look somewhere else. There's a bit of gore, but nothing special. The occasional head getting ripped off, etc, but the first 40 minutes of the movie is the marines walking around being ""startled"" by loud things such as pipes falling from the ceiling. These false starts are a poor attempt at building tension, when all they do is waste time and get old very quick.I've seen both the theatrical release and the uncut version, and both are equivalent. There's nothing special in the uncut version, other than a naked woman, but if that's what you're after then maybe you're at the wrong kind of video store.This movie could have actually been something worth watching, but the writers butchered what substance could have been included. There's even a fistfight in which two obvious wrestling moves are used. It's just bad, people. If you really want a good horror movie worth watching, with believable characters and dialogue, rent 28 Days Later or something similar. Don't waste your time with this movie, unless you're deliberately looking for something to make fun of, as they make it pretty easy to rip this one apart.The only sequence that was actually well done was the first-person scene, but this lasted a whole five minutes. That scene was like a diamond in a pile of dog feces, to tell you the truth, but it was literally like watching a scene from a first-person shooter. If you don't like first-person shooters you'll probably find the scene unnecessary and a little oddly placed, as the same effect could have been used a thousand times to build up suspense during certain other scenes.The special effects are pretty good as well, and I really enjoyed the fact that the monsters were not CGI, but puppets. The monsters looked really good for the most part, but it doesn't matter since the rest of the movie is practically unbearable.Anyway, I'm giving the film three out of ten stars only because the effects were nice and the first person scene was pretty well done. Otherwise it wouldn't even deserve one star.",Doom
218,cujo2,Not as fun as resident evil,8,2 November 2005,"It is always hard to make a decent movie based on a game. When it translates to screen one realizes how pointless and plot less the games are we spent so many hours on.. perhaps the best reason to go outside more before our lives are over.Ahhh well before I get really philosophical.. lets go on to Doom which comes with the Rock and some monsters and guns. Let me start by saying that I like the resident evil franchise a lot and even house of the dead was watchable for me. Just to prove that I have a dim idea what I am viewing. Doom gives you exactly what the trailer and the nostalgia lets you feel. However the question is if that is enough for you. This movie has the fun stuff like the very big guns , that give you in the last part of the movie a ""guncam""..only thing missing is the heads up display of the game. It gives you the monsters you know and the dark corridors and a lot of running.... and that is it.It sure tries with 1 or 2 smart ish ideas but very quickly goes back to ..well what the trailer shows you. And it is hard to believe but the first 30 mins nothing actually happens.. it is like a longer version from the intro of Aliens where the marines enter the compound and start looking for survivors.Normally I would bash the film for not offering more but with movies like this one knows what to expect and this film delivers with some mindless extra fun to throw in ..so mildly recommended with a large coke and popcorn.",Doom
219,nethlyn,Friday/Saturday night plot less garbage - I loved it!,6,3 December 2005,"***Extra Warning - there isn't much plot to actually spoil*** Whoever went to see this film for the plot after knowing for the past 13 years that none of the four Doom games really have one, was setting themselves up for disappointment. This film was frankly less dull to watch than Doom 3 was to play - although not quite as good looking in spite of a cinematographer by trade in the director's chair.Good job of ripping off Aliens for its base (20 years old next year and still the best SF/horror/action hybrid) which lent the film a more solid buildup than I would have expected. I also didn't expect to see further steals from The Thing with the multiple references to infection and the fact that there was human conflict mixed in with the Alien invasions, Alien (for many attacks were one on one until the end), AVP and in the mass rush attack scenes, elements of Dawn Of The Dead 2004. The final battle was more like Universal Soldier meets Event Horizon after giving us a few minutes to be reminded of the game the film was based on.Leaving the Firstperson-shooter-on-film scene until very near the end was a good idea, since it was as corny a gimmick as Freddy 6 or any film with a 3D glasses scene. Thankfully it didn't go on for long enough to get annoying. The very end just screamed ""we ran out of cash"" but it was quite 1970s to just end a film on the big finish and leave any other subplots or sequel strands in the air (In other words, any creatures you didn't see getting killed, will probably form the basis for the sequel).You need not have played or even heard of the games to treat this as a good lads' night out or when it hits DVD, the ideal drunken rental. So, Friday/Saturday night brain-off action is exactly what I wanted (especially after watching The Constant Gardener) and exactly what I got. When the DVD is released they may not bother with extras, I'm sure they'll just say go and buy the game like fans of Passion of the Christ were directed to The Bible...I'll say one thing though, it's rare to watch a modern day film where the product placement is for something that's already been around for 18 months and there's none in the film that I noticed - that made suspension of disbelief, even for this enjoyable hokum, a lot easier.Otherwise, if you must have a good storyline to go with your action, pull out Aliens from the collection before returning to the PC to play Quake 4 instead.",Doom
220,rdbrown-zeteo,Deserves better recognition! AWESOME MOVIE!,9,22 February 2011,"What else do you want me to say? I don't care if Hollywood is infatuated with turning video games into movies... in honest... most creators take the basic concept of the video game and takes creative liberties with it. Sometimes they don't do so well, sometimes an OK job - in this case... they did an awesome job. I've heard all the complaints from those who play the game... but... get over it. This movie does not deserve to stand in the shadow of any video game!!!! PERIOD! What killed the movie was not the movie itself... it was all the video game lovers who were disappointed that the movie didn't showcase what they wanted it to showcase... for everyone else who could care less that it was based (ever how loosely) on a video - it was either more enjoyable than they thought or it was a lot of fun.I like video games... but I also could care less if the movie on the game doesn't carry the same story as the games... or doesn't follow some of the favorite traditions of the game(s).This movie also follows in the footsteps of a genre we've all seen quite a few times. But, this movies seems to freshen up the genre in my opinion - it gives the genre what it deserves... a better and brighter spotlight that was somehow dimmed by bad reviews and critiques and disappointed fans of a video game who don't know how to enjoy a movie.The acting was actually really good. The rock did a surprisingly good job - at first his acting seems typical but when you near the end of the movie he surprises you. The characters were all engaging and well developed. The action was incredible. The effects were really good as well. And the whole movie feels like a sci-fi, first person shooter game.I've wasted time trying to find a movie like this... fun... exciting... scary... suspenseful... I'm pumped with excitement right now because I literally just finished watching the movie for the first time.The story was someone unique... it follows a used concept and adds a little originality to it. Its like Aliens... but with video game style. It was a fresh take on sci-fi creatures... not simply a parasite taking over the hosts' body.I did say it was suspenseful and scary... maybe not the jumpy type... but scary because of how suspenseful it was. There's a specific scene near the end... and I won't give anything away... but it puts you behind the gun of the shooter as if you were the one going around killing everything. AWESOME! Before I get carried away... I'll just stop and say... this is worth the time and rental. I actually just bought the movie after I watched it to.If you love the video game... put aside any expectations that the movie will highlight the video game. I never played the game... so I can't tell you for sure... just from what I've read... but. If you look at this movie as a movie separate from the games and let it establish its own light - you might like it.Its hard to find the best one word to describe this movie. I can't believe it wasn't very popular! It ranks up there with the matrix in my opinion... even though it doesn't have quite the elaborate storyline and plot.Just give it a watch.",Doom
221,iamsam103,"Better than the Resident Evil films, which ain't saying much!",4,2 December 2005,"I'll start off with the positive things first, as this film does have themThe Special effects were nicely done, not groundbreaking in anyway, but I feel were used well, the creatures were kept mysteriously in the dark and the film didn't dwell on the SFX, therefore making the creatures more believable. - The concept of the FPS scene was good, even though it became quite boring (imagine watching a friend playing doom...and you get the idea). - The gore and violence was up to scratch, unlike in the Resi films. This film, although could have done more, knew the audience was expecting violence, and so they delivered. - Rosamund Pike :)OK now the negative bits...The ending turned into a Mortal Kombat rip-off, 2 people, super powers = crappy fight sequence. - The story pretty much taking the setting of Doom and the enemies, but changing round the reasons. Instead of hell being unleashes, it is now an extra chromosome reacting negatively to test subjects, and then those subjects infecting others. - The film, although had some suspense, can't really qualify as a horror anymore than Resident Evil can classify as a classic alongside the original Night Of The Living Dead. It would have been nice if the suspense was taken a step further instead of the film seeming almost rushed to kill off its characters. - It has a very abrupt ending, it would have been nice if the ending would have been extended and fleshed out so it left the audience thinking ""ok its finished"" instead of ""is it over?""Overall, I was disappointed. I'll admit I am not a fan of the game, but I am a huge film and game fan..although it was better than the Resident Evil films, that still isn't saying much and I am just hoping there isn't going to be a sequel in the pipe-line.",Doom
222,stephen7272,Where did the money go?,5,19 April 2015,"Doom starts off like a B- movie and ends up as a B+ movie. My first question is where did $60 million dollars go. That's a big budget for 2005.Visually for a horror flick there is very little CGI. The audience have to make do with monsters in rubber suits and zombies in covered plenty of fake blood gel.The set falls short of an Aliens movie and so does the cast. With budget foreign actors such as Karl Urban, Deobia Oparei, Dexter Fletcher and Rosamund Pike carrying the movie as best they can, it just leaves Dwayne Johnson to do his wrestling style theatrics in front of camera.Yes it's target audience are 14 year old kids wanting to level up but the movie does have a few things in its favour. Firstly, the science in it is well researched. The inclusion of nano walls, an Ark molecular transporter to Mars and a 24th chromosome are intriguing scientific concepts.The best action scene in the movie is by far the first person shooter camera angle. This imitates the experience of the computer game perfectly. And the finale of this montage is a chainsaw fight against a wheelchair bound dog type creature (mutated Pinky).I felt this movie deserves a remake with modern CGI and a better script. But keep the science.",Doom
223,james.p.taylor,Not the worst movie I've seen.,6,5 December 2005,"Doom, based loosely on the computer games of the same name, sees a band of gun toting Marines beamed to Mars to investigate what has happened to scientists carrying out research on an ancient civilisation found on the red planet.For the next ninety minutes switch off your brain and go along for the ride. As a game-to-movie plot is thin on the ground. The premise is a lot like Aliens or Predator with nasty surprises around every corner. What does let the film down is a lack of suspense. If the makers had followed the Alien idea of not revealing the monsters so quickly and amping up the tension then this could have been brilliant. Instead it was a bang-for-your-buck movie, plenty of gunfire to cover up bad directing and poor script. The gore contents is also high but at times not really needed. A lot of people have mentioned some poor CGI, but I never saw anything to complain about.**SPOILERS** What would have made this better for me would be to see Sarge transform totally at the end, just to see what the special effects guys could come up with. Instead it seemed like the makers had given up a bit and wanted to end it as quickly and brutally as possible.The acting is good given the clichéd writing. No-one stands out, most of the performances being similar. The usual suspects character-wise are all there.Despite a panning from critics and another film based around a wizard taking all the money at the cinema currently I hope this does well.",Doom
224,thrix,Mainstream action off DooM video game,7,6 March 2006,"Yes, after a long wait, DOOM: the movie finally hit the big screen. What would you expect? Another Aliens? Or another Resident Evil? The thing is that I find Hollywood action movies to be either radical or very mainstream. For the setting off-world, alien/creature fighting, space travelling, it seems we just can't get a ground-breaking film. Influences from Aliens and Resident Evil are quite obvious. Still, DooM is an entertaining action movie featuring decent actors Karl Urban and The Rock, who actually can act and look cool. It's nothing new about this film, but it does its job. Action entertainment for the Saturday evening.7/10",Doom
225,masschaos,The rating should be higher.,7,12 March 2006,"I just watched this movie and was pleasantly surprised by it. Granted, this movie's more of a compliment to the video game of the same name, but it extends the back story of the game and gives a different look at the scenarios. This movie'd probably be more liked by fans of the game than to most other people, but it can be all but assured to be a fun, entertaining flick for just about anybody.Parents, if it wasn't obvious by the trailer, this is not a kids movie, but I feel it'd be fine to let older kids watch this film. Great effects good writing without a lot of gratuity and nice cast earn this movie at least a 7 for me.",Doom
226,arahman,Read this review and save yourself 2 hours of regret,2,15 February 2007,"Doom is another video game movie conversion. Transition in this direction has only really seen success with the Resident Evil franchise. So does Doom attempt to focus on doing something different and create a movie that is able to stand on its own two feet and generate interest with individuals who are unfamiliar with the legendary video game? No. Doom appears to just be a variation on Resident Evil but with less impressive special effects, weaker acting, a less interesting plot and minus any tension or fear. The plot is confusing and loosely relates to scientific experiments gone wrong on mars and the resultant zombie population. It attempts to link in some genetic mutation angles and an ancient civilisation but does not tie any of these threads together successfully whilst the film is not interesting enough to make you care any way. So is Doom successful in creating a mindless adrenaline pumped action feast? No, not really. The movie pays some tribute to the array of weapons (the primary foundation of the game) but there are no real fun action sequences and the super duper advanced weapon is just used twice to shoot a toilet ceiling and a wall (great, try using it against the zombies you fools). The conflict between marines is also of little interest and Karl Urban (very good in Bourne Supremacy and Chronicles of Riddick) should probably choose his action movies a little more carefully. The connection with the game is loose and other than a couple of sequences that pay respect to the video game action style this film bears no resemblance to the games eerie, often frightening visuals and gameplay. The connection with a portal to hell is also left out but the plot is so confusing and uninteresting that any further analysis is a waste of my time and yours. Save yourself a couple of hours and watch a few repeat episodes of Roseanne, (which contain much more action and terror)",Doom
227,harsawa,DooM has one thing in common with the game: The name,2,26 November 2005,"DOOM is a 2 hour run of idiocy set on Mars. It starts off promising, showing scientists going mad and dieing. Then the actual movie starts the rest of the movie is unwatchable. The story proves the writers know about as much science as a 2nd grader, and then the monsters look very fake. The monsters behave nothing like they do int he games- and they aren't even demons. They're mutants, and there is like 3 of them. Then there are zombies. Lots of zombies. Things get shot, yes. Things get sliced, yes. But is it entertaining? NO! The only scenes you should bother watching are the opening and the first person sequence. Those scenes were worthwhile.The rest is a boring film that drags you through dark halls with nothing in them.",Doom
228,marialiiva,My fave movie!,10,13 November 2020,"This movie is absolutely perfect! Horror, monsters, jokes, great actors, virus, first-person moments, guns CHECK! The movie was interesting all the time, never boring. Everything was explained not like most movies nowadays when nobody understands anything and ending is just... meh. Even tho the movie is pretty old now it had some awesome effects that are still good and watchable even in 2020. Best movie for me!",Doom
229,kevintempel,Nope this is not Doom,3,17 December 2005,"Well the film was really bad. Some stuff great mostly bad. I could not get a Doom feeling. It was just not made as it should have been. To quick to make it without developing a good enough screenplay from the PC games. Could have been much better. Not worth wasting money on. and The Rock should never have signed a contract with such a bad script. It is going to be bad for his acting reputation. Had many good movies before this waste. To bad, if only made with more effort and better script it could really have been something. But as it is made now it is just waste. I hope someone else long into the future makes something better of it, but this was not Doom, it was a wanna be, nothing more. It is too bad. I really was looking forward to it, but even as I saw the trailers I knew this was going to be a waste of money, but saw just to see it, hope no one else do that, they will just walk angry and feeling cheated out of the cinema.",Doom
230,Danny-Rodriguez,This is the video game adaption I have been waiting for!,10,30 April 2006,"Same with Resident Evil this movie made me believe in a good adaption of the video game Half-Life. Let's pray it gets made some day. This movie however entertained me to the limit! I can only thank God that Uwe Boll didn't direct it.Apparently some portal has been established between earth and Mars and they've set up a research lab on Mars. of course they find something and everybody there dies...well maybe not everybody. And then they of course send on only a small military team of ""the best of the best"" to go and deal with the problem. They do and they...well they die.Now I don't hate The Rock but I don't love him either. But he was actually quite good in this one. granted it's not a Double Indemnity level performance but he got the job done. And the character of Portman, played by Richard Brake (who?), reminded me so much of a friend I have. He's a bit insane to. As for the effects in the movie? I don't see how they could have been better. it wasn't all CGI so there were a few puppets. which is quite a relief from all this CGI crap all the time.What really made the movie for me was the POV sequence in the film. That is also one of the main reasons it made me believe in a very good Half-Life movie adaption. For a period of time in this film the camera is the eyes of a character and it's just like playing a video game. only in live action. the credits were done like that to so i sat through the whole thing just to see it.Definitely recommended for you who wants to be entertained and who's not just looking for Shakespeare material. But it's not just for the average action junkie either.",Doom
231,Clay-17,Hey! This movie didn't suck!,7,21 October 2005,"Wow, what a surprise. I played the first version of DOOM when it first came out and had to see this movie. They did a good job of creating a story around it and putting in elements of the game, like the different zones, card-key doors, various weapons from the game and even some first-person action.The Rock was his usual self, and the other characters added enough spice to make it interesting. To avoid spoiling the movie I won't give any details, but they really did do a good job. I wasn't really scared so much as anxious to see what would happen next.If you liked the game, then you should enjoy this movie.",Doom
232,TJ1380,Not as bad as people say.,6,11 February 2006,"Maybe it's because I went into Doom with lowered expectations after hearing nothing but complaints and criticisms from everyone I know who has seen it, but I actually found myself liking this movie. Yes, the characters are underdeveloped and largely uninteresting, and yes, the monsters that the heroes fight are no longer demons from Hell, but no one goes into a movie based on a game like Doom looking for interesting characters or a deep storyline. They go to see gruesome and exciting action scenes and cool special effects, and that's what the film delivered.It's been years since I really played a Doom game (I think I've played Doom 3 for a total of 45 minutes in my entire life, and I don't think that counts as real gaming), but all I remember about the storyline from the games is that a marine is stuck on a station on Mars surrounded by demons who want to kill him. Since that isn't much of a story, I really don't blame the writers of this film for coming up with a new story from the ground up. The important thing is that the spirit of the game is there, although that doesn't mean that there aren't some missed opportunities. The movie is never really as scary as the game that inspired it, although there are moments where it comes close. The whole movie has an almost claustrophobic feeling that good horror films should have, and one does get the feeling that there is always something around the corner waiting to rip our heroes to pieces. Unfortunately, since the characters are, as I have said above, largely underdeveloped and uninteresting, we really don't care that much when something does tear them apart. There are moments, however, when this movie really does work well; one character undergoes a rather chilling transformation that I really didn't expect, and there is an inventive sequence that will look familiar to anyone who has ever played the game (you will know it when you see it).Overall, while I won't recommend this movie to anyone who wants fine art every time they watch a movie, I will say that it was a rather fun and brainless action movie that is worth a rental to those who like fun and brainless action.",Doom
233,wrudd,How could they have blown this one? As disappointing as the Hulk,3,7 November 2005,"I didn't have real high expectations for the movie going in but I like the Rock and thought if nothing else there would be plenty of action. I have played Doom since the original. It starts out okay, gets going on Mars and the Marines go through tunnels, and hallways, and into rooms, ....for what seems like 60 minutes without much happening. I think they were trying for an Alien (original movie) like suspense. That's okay but I kept waiting for the monsters. They came but I wasn't all that impressed. They 1. weren't particularly ""good"" monsters, 2. they got killed very easily. I thought there would be some that were easy some that were harder, the deeper they went the tougher the monsters, but no. What really killed it for me was the the whole bit at the end where the Rock turns bad and the guy who started out to be a sidekick becomes the hero and goes off into the sunset...with his own sister! I guess they were trying for a ""twist"" ending but I didn't care for that twist. Why have the Rock turn bad? Why not fight monsters instead of another Marine? Why have the person who ends up being the hero be paired up with his sister? I don't get it. How could they make a dull movie out of Doom?",Doom
234,dogsrus-1,I thought it would be watchable...I was wrong...,2,26 February 2006,"I knew DOOM was not gonna be the best movie in the world. I thought it would at least be a entertaining rental. I like the Rock and his brand of acting. I like guns, blood, monsters and gore. I like to play DOOM. But the movie was really too long with not a lot to offer in any category of entertainment. Special effects were very ""ho hum"", scares were not scary, the plot was very thin(even for this type of movie). We wondered half way through if we should stop, go to sleep and finish the next evening. But that felt like a bad chore left undone, hanging over our heads. So we finished it by propping our heads in our hands and waiting it out. Blah! Two stars at the very most.",Doom
235,evilresident097,So-so game adaption.,5,14 July 2009,"Doom follows a group of Marines called the Rapid Response Tactical Squad(RRTS) who are sent to the Olduvai Research Facility on Mars to respond to a threat that has six people missing on the facility. The team is led by Sarge(Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) and Reaper(Karl Urban), who has joined along since his sister Samantha(Rosamund Pike) is also at Olduvai. Things get bad when nightmarish creatures begin stalking the Marines and picking them off one by one.Doom was a fun game, and with The Rock starring, I thought this movie would kick tail. Well that task wasn't quite accomplished. For the positives, the movie is just as violent as the game, with lots of blood and gore. It's also dark like the series, literally. Half of the movie is incredibly dark and I thought night vision goggles would be needed. On the negatives, the film screws up the plot from the games. It's not demon hell spawn, but a virus that's causing the creatures? Are you serious?!! And the acting is pathetic, especially on Rocky's part(he got rightfully nominated for a Worst Actor Razzie). The film does pay tribute by popping in a FPS sequence, but that only lasts like 5 minutes(it's a little bit longer in the Unrated cut).Overall, I give it a 5 out of 10. More FPS and a better plot, please.",Doom
236,lagunaedm,Not accurate,5,2 July 2020,"Most people aren't aware of the awesome story behind Doom. This movie in pretty much no way, shape or form is doom nor does it follow basically any of the story.It's too bad they even called this movie doom after the game because it is so inaccurate.That being said it was still a watchable movie, but knowing what I now know about the doom story, I'm super disappointed In the movie.",Doom

What are the good parts then? Well, the good things I can say about it wouldn't take too long time to tell you. As he always do, Karl Urban makes a good job acting in this movie. But a movie like this could have gone far. Point 1: It should contain more characters. I don't know how to describe it, but there are practically no characters outside the research team and the marine soldiers. Well, except for those there are a few more, but this movie should have more characters. Point 2: Why does it have a name from a video game when it don't have the same story? I mean, I'm a huge fan of the game, but the story's are different. In the game, there are a company who opens a gateway to darkness, and in this movie, its just about a silly research project who happens to go wrong. I got very disappointed about this. Point 3: It ain't humane! The decisions some of the characters make, just make you lose faith on the future. If the persons are going to think like this in 140 years, why don't we just start a nuclear war at once and destroy the earth?As I told you on the summary: Take my word for it: don't waste your time on this movie.",Doom
238,Crazyfarts,Just a movie about guys running around with guns.,6,3 June 2006,"Based on the hit computer game about Marines sent to investigate what went wrong on a space station. They never expected the scientists to still be there, turning into creatures and driven by a need to kill whoever they choose! Anyone who's ever played a game has most likely played ""Doom"" at one point or another. It's no surprise that at some point, the game would turn into a movie. This film is exactly what I thought it would be. It's a mediocre action movie with lots of effects that crush any hope you had of enjoying a decent horror flick.If I had to tell you a similar movie that would sum up ""Doom"", I'd tell you to combine ""Alien vs Predator"" and ""Resident Evil"" together and you'd have ""Doom"" in a nutshell. Keep in mind, the creature effects in both ""AvP"" and ""Resident Evil"" are far superior to those in ""Doom"".""The Rock"" (Dwayne Johnson) is one of those actors that I always enjoy watching on screen. Whether or not the movie he's starring in is good or not, I'm always pleased with his performance. While his efforts in ""Doom"" seem a little tedious, he's still gives the best performance out of any cast member in the film. What is with the cast anyways? It's the most generic bunch of guys I've seen. You got your macho leader, your hero, your nervous dork, your hard-ass, your tough guy and your... Asian. Wow, I see they've really been following the cliché book mighty closely.Special effects are as good as you can expect for a movie based on a video game, though I was not very impressed with the creature effects. Granted, they don't show the creatures much or at all but isn't that half the reason you wanted to see this film anyways? To see a whole bunch of creatures come on screen and put up a fight? Errr, I did. Also take note that the movie is extremely dark, so when something actually goes down, you're going to miss half of it because it's so damn hard to see the interesting fight between one of the creatures and that black guy ""Destroyer"".The game view near the end contains some impressive visuals but grows tiresome quickly. I really enjoyed the shots of guys getting heads exploded but once we get to the chainsaw, it just became tacky.The movie did seem to gain interest in the last 10 minutes or so but by that time, you're probably to depressed to care. This is a movie for guys, full of testosterone. It's filled with guns and when they don't have guns, they've got even bigger guns to fill in the absence. You get the idea... just a movie about guys running around with guns.",Doom
239,CIMC,Dumb,4,25 October 2005,"In theory one could make a film this year about what Martians are like. It could be a well- shot and directed, finely acted story. It would still feel out of place though because we known that Martians do not exist. It's kind of like when a Doom character, and a scientist no less, states that, ""the final ten percent of the human genome"" has yet to be mapped. That's simply not true and hasn't been since April 14, 2003. ""Some say it's the soul."" Really? Who? Anachronisms can be cute sometimes but here, and in sci-fi generally, they're just stupid.Something terrible has happened in the Union Aerospace Corporation's research facility on Mars. Now Sarge (The Rock) has received orders to prepare his team of mercenaries, known as the Rapid Response Tactical Squad, to go through ""the Ark"" and retrieve data and any remaining members of the research team. The last message received was from Dr. Carmack who called for a total quarantine. It seems that something was hunting his team. Something that alternately came out of the Aliens prop library or George Romero's stash of zombies.Instead of having any personality each of the characters has a quirk or two. Goat (Ben Daniels) for example is a guy who prays and mutters religious verses. Unsurprisingly, he does not look highly upon Portman (Richard Brake) who is a porn or sex addict of some sort and has bad teeth. Duke (Razaaq Adoti) is a playful fun guy while The Kid's (Al Weaver) defining characteristic is that he is youngish looking. John Grimm (Karl Urban) comes along too despite having an unpleasant personal history of sorts with the place they are going to. Unbeknownst to him, his sister Dr. Samantha Grimm (Rosamund Pike) is going to be a guide for the group. This is the ""drama"" of the film. Will they reconcile their differences? Will they come to terms with their parents' deaths? Will their accents remain the same throughout the film? Is the audience likely to care? 'No' to the last two questions and the others aren't worth the time to investigate.For those readers who thought the first paragraph contained an analogy, sorry to say that it doesn't. Martians do figure prominently in Doom. They apparently are the source of human life on Earth as well, an origin story only slightly more plausible than creationism. With all the nonsense going in the film it's hard to notice the dialogue, which is probably for the best. Any film that says stuff like, ""Semper fi motherf*****!"" is likely to seem a little off. It would have been humorous at least if Sarge had instead used all English words, ""Always faithful motherf*****!"" Alas comedy is largely beyond the collective abilities of the filmmakers. Doom does have it's moments, as when Destroyer (Deobia Oparei) uses a computer monitor as a flail, but it needs a lot more of them.",Doom

It was filled with mindless shooting and demons... Which amazingly enough is what we get with this movie.No, it doesn't really follow the storyline, but I never realized that any game had 90 minutes worth of script to deliver for a movie ( Maybe why no games gone movie follow the central plot to a T? ) and this movie kicks ass for what it is.What we get is a short and sweet action film in space... Throw in some solid effects ( Thank god some producers still feel that prosthetics are still useful in the world of cinema. The CG wasn't overdone in this film like it has been in just about every other film utilizing CG in recent history ) decent gore, some demons, The Rock and Karl Urban, and a BFG and you've got yourself a good action flick reminiscent of the 80's action flicks of yore.A great action film, and I'm very pleased to own it. 9/10",Doom

If you are a good person, then you'll be better. If you are bad, then welcome the monster. If you are into an action-horror genre, this is the right movie for you. You will be pleased with the action scene and the martial arts also.

Nothing really Earth... uh, Mars-shattering, for better or worse.I still kind of liked it a lot. The story holds nicely together. The pacing is pretty decent. It's clearly a decent enough as a ""turn your IQ knob to the zero and watch people kill some baddies"" movie. I watched it through, saw monsters getting killed, and it didn't leave too many plot threads hanging in my mind. Must be good enough then.As a Doom game movie, I give them extra points for incorporating game stuff pretty decently - not *extremely* faithfully, but still much better than what I expected from the news before. Definitely among the best video game movies I've seen. And whatever isn't there, the DVD extras almost make up for.In summary, decent enough action movie, may be worth even buying.

243,knight110tim,Sucks like the vacuum of space!,1,2 February 2006,"Let's not beat around the bush here: Doom is awful. One of the worst films I've seen in ages. It's basically men in dark outfits running around in dark corridors fighting dodgy monsters for the better part of two hours. It's incredible that director Andrzej Bartkowiak was able to stretch the atom-thin story, by first-time writer David Callaham and Wesley Strick, to that length; but it's just another factor that makes the whole experience so painful.Not only can you not really see what's going on for most of the time, but as the story takes place underground (both on Mars and Earth) it just looks like a big film set the whole time and any attempts to suspend disbelief are shattered.What story there is comes across as a half-hearted attempt to remake Aliens in the style of Resident Evil, but lacking the quality of the former and the sexiness of the latter. Doom is as sterile as the surface of Mars, devoid of charm and atmosphere, with its gun-totting cast running around on autopilot.Protagonist Karl Urban doesn't seem that bothered with acting in this one - crashing back down to earth after playing Eomer in Lord of The Rings - and Rosamund Pike (fresh from Pride & Prejudice) looks positively embarrassed to be there at all.Bizarrely only ex-wrestler The Rock turns in even a vaguely convincing performance, as Sarge, the leader of the marines sent in to clear the Martian research centre of the lethal aliens ... or something like that.And Dexter Fletcher is in it. Possibly the worst actor of all time, putting on some annoying accent. But, at least he comes to a grizzly end! A fortune probably went on the special effects, but you'd never know. Not only is the lighting too bad to see a lot of the monsters, but most of the bigger ones just appear to be blokes in rubber suits.I'll admit that I loathed Doom the video game and was bored to tears the few times I played it, having no time for first-person shoot-'em-ups because of their linear plots, complicated control systems and lack of peripheral vision. Naively I hoped that the film would be better.

245,Miasmakoala,"Zero expectations for the rewatch, still disappointed",1,1 April 2019,"I saw this movie about 10 years ago and I've been playing the brilliant new DOOM game recently and I thought that the first person scene in the end was OK enough to justify a late night rewatch.The Rock plays the Rock, like he pretty much always does. I like the idea of making him the villain and Karl Urban the protagonist for the end, but it happens so late in the movie that everything leading up to that single good idea doesn't save this movie. I can't remember anyone else in the main team except for the Rock, Urban and the rookie stoner. Karl Urban does an ok job playing the serious face, but I'll watch Dredd if I want to see a good action movie led by him.Poor Rosamund Pike. In one point she does her best to do the science explanation mumbo jumbo for the audiences but then she has to scream when a monster appears. Pike looks so awkward in that one scene, but I'll ""blame"" the script and the director rather than her.Music was forgettable and after playing the 2016 game it made this even worse, since the game has such an awesome soundtrack. There's so much wasted potential here.The movie looked bad even 10 years ago and even though the effects of scenes looked prettier back then, the movie utilizes the classic shaky camera too much and there are way too many cuts to make the movie enjoyable. It's too dark, shaky and bland to be enjoyed. Even the first person shooter scene in the end wasn't that special.Watch the game walkthrough rather than this waste of time.",Doom

Following the trend to make films of computer games, this one is the latest. The cast are OK, and do what they are meant to ie get shot, maimed, but the film is pointless, the flimsy story stumbles along and at the end the production team seemingly get bored and decide to finish the film. I'm not sure what it is about this film I dislike so much, in comparison it's not that different from Resident Evil, but i found that vastly superior. The dialogue isn't exactly Shakespeare but then again you don't expect that in a film like this, the set designs are a rip of from the game, although the guys who built the sets certainly did a great job and the subjective camera angles I found bloody annoying. The best thing about a first person video game is being able to destroy something and shoot aliens, in this you can't even enjoy that pleasure. God help us if there is another because this one should be renamed Doomed. The only saving grace is the thumping soundtrack, and if you're not into that sort of music this will annoy you even more.",Doom

The reality is that the military personnel were Marines. Yet, ""Sarge"" (The Rock), seemed to be seriously confused about that. He kept yelling at his men about being ""Soldiers"", or needing ""real Soldiers."" Soldier this, soldier that. He might have made it out, and saved more lives, if he could have only figured out who he was, and who his men were. They WEREN'T SOLDIERS! They were MARINES! Once again, there IS a difference. Army boot camp is 9 weeks long. Marine boot camp is 12 weeks. Army personnel are called Soldiers, personnel in the Marine Corps are called Marines (NOT Soldiers). A recruit in Marine boot camp cannot be called Marines until they graduate from boot camp, proving that they have earned the right to bear the name of their organization. You're probably thinking, what about those that don't make through boot camp? Well, unless they left for reasons other than medical (like failing!), they cannot be called a Marine. In fact, recruits are called by a lot of things during boot camp, but it isn't until the actual graduation ceremony that they are actually welcomed as Marines.",Doom
249,Chicky5150,Ambitious Failure (Reviewer has not played game),6,9 March 2006,"First of all, I don't know why this movie was called Doom. The game is about people shooting up hell or something, and this is a sci-fi movie where under-written Marines fight mutated scientists and the re-animated dead.It starts nicely self-referential, and builds nicely. A few Marines are sent to investigate a scientific experiment gone wrong (and how!)and they get picked off one by one by rubbery monsters. There are a few interesting stabs at establishing characters, but you're not going to remember more than two people when this movie is done.Then the script gets ambitious, and that's when this movie both succeeds and sets itself up to fail. The Rock's character goes bad, and becomes infected. Its a great moment, right when the movie is in overdrive, and suddenly Karl Urban is the lead. Really clever, never saw it coming and totally liked it. Then there is the great first person POV action scenes, including the best monster in the film in a chainsaw battle.It sets up for an epic hand-to-hand battle with the Rock...that completely lets you down. The combat is bad wire-fu, and the Rock is changing into something - that we never actually see. Are you kidding? In a movie about monsters, the Rock never turns into a end boss monster? You got a horrible fight out of a professional wrestler? And then the movie ends, and you realize that end was anti-climatic, there were only a couple monsters, and you still don't care about Karl Urban or his scientist sister.

Particularly! if you're a fan of the genre. This wasn't made to be an action movie appealing to the average action-movie fan. Quite the opposite, it was made to appeal to the Doom fan. Unfortunately they (iD Software) have no understanding of Classic and Legacy. They just tossed out everything that made the franchise great when they made Doom 3 and they continue that now. Mind you, the creatures in Doom 3 weren't too bad (except the Cyberdemon) but that little bit of goodness doesn't play through.It doesn't really matter though. If you're a fan of Doom, you'll have to see Doom: The Movie anyway.

Rapid Assault Tactical Squad gives you RATS, and it has a better ring to it.Other than those points, Doom was better than I thought it would be. The writing wasn't perfect by any means but it did the job, and actually gave us some pretty decent one-liners from certain characters. The opening sequence was fantastic, delivering some well thought out suspense and it drew parallels with, dare I say, the Alien films. But only Alien Resurrection, the rubbish one. Not great, but again, better than I thought it would be. In fact, that they went for a Doom 3 effect rather than the effect in 1 or 2 actually served this film well. The way it delivered suspense throughout was of a high quality, and there were scenes in the film that made me think ""wow, that was actually pretty cool"". And the monsters? Sweet Jesus the robotics were just great. I can honestly say they are some of the best that I've seen in recent cinema. Oh and the first person sequence was fantastic. A great homage to the earlier doom games with wave after wave of zombies, but done in the same style as Doom 3? That isn't anything other than absolute genius.So who cares that The Rock can't act? Not me. This film is, and forever will be, one of cinema's greatest guilty pleasures.",Doom

A Saturday after 7pm got to the rental place after it had already been combed over twice kind of thing. Being a movie based on a game, I anticipated a criminally bad film. Typically these kinds of films are flawed to start with. So with this level of expectation, I found myself actually enjoying the movie and only hit fast forward once. I like that there are inside jokes from the game, like the ""BFG"" and a few others. The biggest flaw with this film is that it takes itself just a tad too seriously. It could have done with a bit more self effacing humor and tongue in cheek bits. Bottom line: this is a 20 something guy film. A gun loven, brain dead, straight with nothing to do but play paint-ball kind of guy film. If you watch it with that kind of expectation, you will enjoy it. Trust me, you could do much worse like Frankenstein Unbound. The creature FX were very good and the doom like game sequence was worth the watch, but don't go wanting a story line that makes any sense or has any depth to it.

He, Portman, The Kid, Destroyer, Mac, Duke, Goat and Reaper are to go down to the Mars Station and destroy Hell's forces, but they underestimate the creatures and soon end up falling to their foes, one by one.

256,vladthelad8666,"A movie with potential, yet failing on almost all levels.",6,29 March 2020,"The perfect way to describe Doom is a B-movie schlock. The only redeaming quality of this movie is the goofiness of Dwayne Johnson, and that can't be a good thing for a horror movie. Karl Urban and Rosamund Pike really do try with what they are given, but ultimately this movie falls apart on its own. The viewer is left scratching their head and waiting for something to happen. The story just drags through the whole movie, and there is never time for almost any action.Maybe the biggest problem that viewers and fans of the Doom franchise have with this movie, is that there aren't any actual demons or Hell dimension. It's all just a phylosophical thing for Reaper (Karl Urban), so he can face his demons, that have kept him away from his sister all his life. The threat of the movie is a generic sci-fi horror trope, that sees a deadly virus go around and kill (mostly) anyone on the UAC facility, or basically an extra chromosome. Yes, it's stupid. No, it's not Doom.There isn't much to say about this movie, other than that if you insist on seeing it, don't have any expectations or forget that the title of the movie is ""Doom"".

Okaaaaay. Talk about piling nonsense on top of nonsense.If I'm not being clear enough about this movie, let me summarise by imploring you to watch a good sci-fi horror hybrid instead.

The highlight of the movie had the main protagonist soloing a mob of zombies, badass style; except it was completely unbadass. In comparison to the rest of the movie, where these enemies appear to be intelligent, catch people off guard, and are brutal fighters, when the protagonist goes on a killing spree, he kills zombies that pop up in front of him and freeze for an entire second, allowing him leisurely pop bullets into them. The enemies became idiotic and braindead zombies that he could kill however he wanted. This part alone completely killed the whole movie.Following that mess of a scene, the protagonist goes on to have a ridiculous 1 on 1 brawl with the final enemy, for no reason except to show off the effects this mutagen had on them... and for this fight, newbie mode was deactivated. Aside from having super strength, their prowess wasn't really any better than a normal soldiers'.

Guys, of course it's gonna tank at the box office! Have you even read the bloody thing? Or did you decide that the audience was dumb enough to enjoy that drivel??I haven't played Doom, so I wasn't expecting much more than a mindless action movie - I mean come on, The Rock is in it - with some monsters and gore, perfect for a lazy Friday evening. Well that's exactly what I got in a sense. The Rock? Check. Some monsters? Check. Gore? Check. Now let's have a closer look: The Rock usually stinks but here he's outdone himself. Even his fans agree that he sucks in this. This is sub-zero acting. The next Schwarzy my arse! Zero personality, zero charisma, nothing in fact. Oh yeah muscles. But that was to be expected.NextSome monsters. Well there are a few zombie-like thingies, I mean 3, which you see for a few ridiculous seconds every 45 mins or so. They look about as scary as the Muppet Show, which is probably why you see so little of them, in the dark if possible. I suspect they used Gonzo.Gore. This is so lame it could be a PG movie. With the exception of the opening scene which is OK but fools you into expecting more.So this could be a so-bad-it's-funny flick, but it just gets SO boring I kept hoping for something to happen, ANYTHING! The characters just walk around the same corridors back and forth for the whole movie, with lame ""boo"" effects. When a monster finally pops in to say hello, he's destroyed immediately, then they walk around for another half hour, filling the time with boring dialogue about genetic manipulations blah blah blah. Apparently this has nothing to do with the game's story. I'm glad because after seeing that piece of junk, I was wondering how the game could be so popular.I fell asleep half an hour into the film during my first attempt at watching this. The next day I decided to give it another go, thinking there was still an hour and 10 mins left, and that finally all hell would break loose at some point, which was - it seemed - the premise of the story. I was shocked to discover that nothing happened until the end, with the stupid FPS scene etc.I had to skip a few chapters because it was too boring and painful to watch. My friend who had finished watching the film while I fell asleep the night before was filling in the ""plot"" details... I don't think I missed anything of interest.

""The Rock"" has a mechanized acting, what certainly doesn't cooperate to raise the level of the movie. Rosamund Pike was not into the movie. The best actor, was, with no doubt, Richard Brake. He guarantees some fun situations and it seems like he is the only one who took it seriously.Overall, I recommend it to have some fun and action with no commitments.

The introduction to the squad was promising with names with 'Reaper' & 'Destroyer'. But the film manages to go directly to the dumper. We are immediately subjected to low budget corridor creeping with the actors ineffectually sweeping their guns around and waiting to be carried off by monsters unknown and uninteresting. The beginning is thus sort of a low budget Aliens sequel. The film goes from bad to worse as the producers decide to add a plot twist to a movie with little plot. The set design is either ugly, uninteresting, or (practically) non-existent as little creative effort was put into it or the writing. The actors try their best but the whole film is a failure. This is definitely one film which should not have taken itself seriously.

I thought this movie would completely lack any kind of story,would be filled with stupid 3D-sequences, a lot of shooting and gore. I thought that Sarge would end up to be the hero, while the rest where just there to be killed in gruesome deaths. I thought this movie was just made to please those die-hard computer nerds out there... I was fortunately very wrong.The team-mates of Sarges platoon had surprisingly very different characters and you will be surprised to end up liking most of the crew and wish them the best. The story is not anything groundbreaking, but what do you wait from a horror-action movie? The movie manages to build up the suspense very well, has very good action scenes and there are some false scares and monsters showing up when you least expect it. There are also some surprising twists in the story, and also an ending that I did not see coming. There are some 3d-sequences for perhaps 2 minutes at the end to please the computer nerds, however I was surprised that these sequences end up suiting the movie very well even though it had a little ""watching-somebody-play-computer"" game feel.If you like action-horror movies with suspense, then this is a movie you definitely not want to miss.",Doom

By things, I mean monsters with mucus. I was also charmed because the big moral moment in the movie is not the cliché I was expecting. I was expecting The Rock to be A Space Marine Who Doesn't Play By The Rules, and save the universe. But as it turns out, everyone was trying to obey the rules. Just some of our space marines thought that meant stepping between the monsters and the darkness, and some thought that meant pulling a Lt. Calley on the innocent victims huddling in the darkness.

I've spent many an hour playing the video game so there was some interest in this one for me right from the start. That and some trepidation as the history of movies adapted from video games is rife with failure. Not so in this case. Oh, they made some changes to the premise. In this case it's not a gateway to Hell which causes the problems but is, instead, some bio-genetics experiment which goes awry. Still though, they kept everything else pretty much the same. The effort the creators of this film went to in order to keep the ""look and feel"" of the game has paid off handsomely. This is especially true of their ""first person shooter's perspective"" sequence which was an excellent recreation of what we've gone through in playing the original game.Yet this film's attraction is hardly limited to those folks who are fans of the video game. The movie holds up on its own and you don't have to be a Doom aficionado to enjoy the picture. The action is intense and well paced. The actors are well cast and deliver sold, believable performances. The premise of the plot is good and holds together quite well. Other folks have dismissively compared this flick to the ""Resident Evil"" films of a couple of years back. This simply isn't the case. Doom is a far better flick, is far better acted, and far more enjoyable than those films. The Rock, Dwayne Johnson, delivers another one of his standout performances and was a real treat to watch go through his paces on screen. The rest of the cast well played their parts and the ensemble worked together quite well. One thing which I liked about this film was that it had none of the typical monster / alien threat movie stupidness on the part of its characters. The squad of Marines sent to the Mars base were depicted as being smart, experienced, well trained and well armed. Their actions on the screen lived up that. This made the movie all that more realistic to watch as their numbers kept getting whittled down despite all their hard fighting.I enjoyed this film and am glad to see such an adaptation finally get done so right and be so successful.

Interesting direction, and if you've played the game before you can't help but laugh at how well cast the main character is, the resemblance is undeniable. Whatever, any excuse to look at The Rock for awhile will do.

I was shocked to learn the budget was 60-80 million dollars. Where was that money spent? The look of the move was drab and the precious little monster shots were few and far between. The first 45 minutes of the movie consists of the marines stalking around what looks like the same corridor shining their flashlights at dark corners. The pace picks up a little but every thing is kept in the dark so often you don't even know what you are looking at on the screen. The point of view sequence is the highlight of the movie.

Over half of the movie is nothing but a group of soldiers running around to a rock-and-roll soundtrack, with very few discernible monsters and dialog that is so bad that it was painful.

The monsters were not a lot, at least not like in the video game, but they looked and acted good, so I had no problem with that.The Rock is casted great as Sarge. Probably his best role in a movie ever. The shooting isn't much, but when there is something going on, it looks respectable. Mainly I was just waiting for the action to break out, and it finally did. Especially at the ending, were all 'hell' breaks lose. The first-person sequense created a smile on my face, and later on in that sequense it had a really good fight which made this movie really innovative, and I do hope that other movies do a FPS-sequense as well.The fighting-scene between The Rock and Karl Urban also looked awesome. The creators of this movie clearly pulled off every bit of action at the end of the movie.Since it is a video game-conversion, I didn't expect much from it, but it turned out to be a real nice adrenaline-shot.

I was watching this film when suddenly my parents came in. They immediately sat down and watched the last 50 minutes with me. Surely that's an indication that the film itself wasn't too bad. My favourite part of the movie was the FPS scene. It showed a level of originality which has been absent in other Video game movies, such as the Resident Evil franchise. Another Pro was the casting of the Rock as Sarge and Karl Urban as Reaper. Both made decent performances in the movie.The level of action was decent and I was happy that the film branched out a bit further than the 90 minute restriction. Furthermore I particularly enjoyed the fact that the makers decided to use models and suits, similar to Alien rather than rely on CGI. It again shows a level of originality that implies the makers wanted the film to stand out and was not there just to make money.The cons were that overall the acting was not great. The other marines for example, other than The Rock and Urban, did not put in great performances and Rosamund Pike, I think was particularly bad. They seemed an ordinary group of guys thrust into battle. They just didn't seem to act like a group of elite, disciplined soldiers. It just didn't feel realistic. Another con is that the film was not particularly scary. The actual game is deemed to be one of the scariest games out there to play. So it feels an opportunity missed that the film was not a terrifying roller-coaster ride filled with suspense and was more like a variety of action sequences containing grim monsters.All in all Doom is a movie which is by no means perfect, is a decent film for what it is. A video game.",Doom
273,lajospn,More or less what you expect,8,21 October 2005,"OK, I'm biased. I played with the computer games Doom I, II and III. I sat in the cinema with low expectations for a hi-fi video game experience. And that's more or less what this movie is about. The marines are tough, the weapons are cool, the monsters are nasty, the girl is pretty, and the music is metal. What else a doom fan needs? Well, better special effects. Really. The monsters are few and far between, and they are *lame*. I got more scared of the PC versions of the very same monsters. On the flipside, the movie correctly captures the UAC feeling. A monopolostic corporation doing whatever it feels doing on the remote planet mars. The UAC facility looked real and atmospheric. The story, well, it is pretty standard and predictable. But! I liked the marines and I could even sympathize with the Rock ('Sarge') in the end. All in all it is a must see for Doom fans and it is mildly amusing (though bit gory at points) for lay men.",Doom
274,AshenGrey,Just plain terrible,2,2 September 2006,"This movie was gloomy, dark, and generally unpleasant. Now, I realize that it's a horror movie, but can we have some actual horror please? Although the movie was allegedly based on the video game, the only thing the move and the game had in common was that the setting was a research station on Mars.This movie is basically a badly-done zombie flick. The acting is wooden (it stars The Rock, so what can one expect?) The hero was instantly forgettable.""Doom"" had potential, but it failed on almost every front. The costumes were bland, the guns were unremarkable, the ""futuristic"" technology didn't look all that futuristic, the lighting was bad, and the acting was terrible. Oh, and The Rock isn't even the main character!",Doom
275,WheelerClown,Doom it's not (but it could have been much worse),8,30 October 2005,"If you want to see a Night of the Living Dead Clone, this movie is for you. If you came to see a movie resembling the video game Doom, skip all but the first half of the last 30 minutes of the film. If you came to see the Rock play a stereotypical egomaniac military leader with no ability to put morality above orders (in short to see him play an almost totally UNLIKEABLE character), again this movie is for you.Harry Potter being the exception, movies based on other mediums (in the case a popular video game) rarely if ever even remotely resemble that which they are supposed to be based on. That said, there are a few good Doom images in the film, although the storyline does not resemble the game at all. I was pleasantly surprised to see several images in the first part of the film that I, as a Doom enthusiast, recognized. Rising platforms, elevators, the circular stairways going down, etc. And like I said the first fifteen minutes of the films last half hour or so definitely fit, the scene being seen from the same prospective as the game, namely with the viewer looking over a massive gun as if the person behind the gun. The final ""monster"" (of the non-human variety) resembled a creature found in the game as well. Other than that, this was not a movie based on Doom but, as I said, on the old zombie eating people who then turn into zombies themselves scenario. And the only acting job worth remembering is that of Karl Urban, playing John Grimm. I loved Urbn as one of the best villains in the old Xena series (as Julius Caesar), and he was great here as a tortured soldier of mayhem with a tortured past, an estranged sister, and a conscience. When he becomes super soldier is when the movie really gets good. Unfortunately, that happens too late in what is otherwise a slasher/alien/zombie film. This is not to say I didn't enjoy it as a movie on its own merits rather than as a Doom remake...I did, mostly. There was way too much gore and vomiting for my tastes, but the gore wasn't much worse than that in the actual game. But as a low budget action monster flick, it ain't bad. Go to it to see good sets. Go to it to see a fine acting performance turned in by Karl Urban. Don't go to it to see a fine acting performance by anyone else (including the Rock) because you'll be disappointed. And come to see a movie based on its own merits rather than on how closely it resembles what it claims to be based on. If you don't, again you'll be disappointed. If you do, you'll see a fairly entertaining gore film.",Doom
276,DizzyDitz,SO ridiculous,3,8 November 2005,"Utterly implausible at every turn, the MST3K robots would have a field day with this movie. I don't know what I find the silliest, that in the future we still send in troops without helmets and armor, the lack of intranet, that every military man doesn't know ""big words"" but does know how to perform resuscitation...really there is too much that is stupid about this movie to go into all of it. Of course, if you're in it for laughs, have a blast. But this is low even as action movies are concerned. Nothing really neat to look at goes on - half the time is spent in ""tension"" while you simply hear nasty noises. Oh, and good luck trying to find a reason to care about your ""characters"".There is only one redeeming factor: the last scene where the Rock fights Karl Urban while they're both souped-up on the special chromosome is awesome.

But I waited for the rental and when it finally came out I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this film.I mean the film itself is just awesome. You got blood, guns, and mutated zombie creatures... I mean the premise is basically the same as the first Resident Evil, with there being some science experiment gone wrong and a lock down, throw in some people in black with guns, and let the onslaught begin. But this movie was just handled so much better than RE. one of the best video game based films I've seen... thus far. (We'll see how they handle HALO)And the FPS sequence freaking rocked... genius... The behind the scenes stuff was pretty fun too. Nice to see all the guys training so that they would look like believable Marines. If you really want to get the most out of this film. Don't set up high expectations. Just go in ready to watch a fun sci-fi film...",Doom
278,AlecWingerd,The 24th Chromosome,4,5 November 2005,"I am sorry to report that the Doom movie, after finally having come out, was a pretty large disappointment. They have taken a terrible amount of freedom with this conversion to the big screen and most of them bestow the movie with an even more negative charge. The first thing I should therefore say is that this movie's problem isn't the acting. The acting was above average, especially from Karl Urban and Rosamund Pike. Al Weaver's few moments deserve a positive connotation as well. Even the Rock himself seems to suddenly develop some talent.I enjoy playing FPS games. I adored DOOM, rarely played DOOM2, but loved DOOM³, although the quintessential unmountable flashlight 'annoyed the hell out of me'. Now, what these guys did is an insult to the games. The story about having found the 'genetic blueprint for the soul' is utter tosh, so is the selective pathogen attached thereto. My other major beefs with this film is the available technology, the lack of suspense, the failed attempt at character building and the scenery, which despite many positive comments is quite dreadful.As far as the technology is concerned, the 'Arcing device' and the opacity walls are rubbish and I hated them. They are an insult to the Doom games and as far as the Arc could be considered a teleportation device, I wonder where Hell is to be found. There is no Hell, there is no Doom, there is only the 24th Chromosome Pair and all the nonsense it spawned, which is why I substituted the title 'Doom' and called this comment 'the 24th Chromosome' instead. Because that is what it is about. Everything that made Doom 3 a worthwhile gaming experience was destroyed by this movie. You want to see the slow decay of the mind, the escalation as the Mars facility slowly changes into a Hell on Mars. And I bet I speak for every Doom fanatic out there that we wanted to see what Hell looked like in this movie.Part of this brings me to the lack of suspense, which was created by two major mitigating factors. Part of the kick from Doom 3 was the desolation you felt from being a hundred million clicks from Earth. The Arc took that away by inducing a mean of instantaneous travel back Home. Like this, one could have simply thrown a small tactical nuke through that gravity defying globule in the first place and get things over with. Secondly, making Reaper superhuman robbed the movie of whatever suspense it had left, as suspense is built around the fear that something terrible might happen to a vulnerable person. This could be partially solved by having miss Grimm NOT disappear and tag along as that ridiculously long and superfluous FPS scene ensues (I rather play the real thing).Then there is the one chance for the two main characters of the movie to develop, but that goes even more awry than the genetic experiments. The two always refer to some kind of incident, which is accompanied by a musical tune, but never is actually elaborated on what this plot point is really about. That already tells it. There's no plot point. It's all about these genetic misfits and slaughtering them. A good thing I can say about this movie though is how it doesn't try and integrate some love interest here or there. Maybe the filmmakers tried - and God knows Hollywood's famous for killing movies with these things - but couldn't find any live, non-related marine to hook up with miss Grimm. If not, bless the movie, if so, bless the circumstances.Now about the scenery; the corridors were Doomy, I won't argue about that, but the set pieces could've been better and more detailed. Now maybe I should thank the quality of the screener for it, but I could make it out fine enough to make the observation. The electric parameter holding pen was stupid, be honest, but the Sewers on the mars facility made me laugh. Who would ever build a research facility on Mars and let so much space go to waste for the soul purpose of putting in a medieval system of catacombs as a poor excuse for plumbing?! I have done my say. To conclude things: I found the movie quite bad. I found it almost horrid. Horrid from a cinematographic standard, horrid in the choices made for the plot, the scenery and the characters. But, I rather have a bad movie that's exciting and enjoyable....... than a good movie that isn't. And Doom wás at least mildly exciting and enjoyable enough for me to bare. And it had a couple of charms; I loved the BFG (although they should have made the effects green).4 out of 10",Doom
279,inc-10,Failed but fun,4,13 October 2007,"This movie is a bunch of wasted ideas and material. In some places it really-really tries to be something, just to be ruined a second later.The movie provides moderate amount of action, a functional story and some pretty actors. Directors totally failed with choosing the Rock though, even though he's supposed to be evil, he ends up being only annoying....And of course a first-person scene, which captures the real magic of first-person-shooter games quite well and is the best part of the whole movie. Even though enemies often just stand there to offer shooting practice and there's only 2 weapons used throughout that magnificent scene. It's still, very well done. And for people who don't play games or haven't tried yet, it should give a nice idea how immense and thrilling could playing one be. Just for the sake of the scene, go and see the movie. It's really interesting to see something like that.The story could be functional if it was more sci-fi. I mean, these boring tongue-licking zombies could have been something more interesting, like demons from original game? If experiments were done to create superhumans, why not experiment with mechanics too, like crossing human and bull PLUS arm the result with mechanical legs and rocket launcher? It would hit the nail with appealing GAME fans, even when whole hell thing was skipped. There's only 3 types of enemy in the movie and that's probably the major letdown. Same goes to guns, all the cool weaponry wasn't simply used and to be honest, dizzy humanlike zombies weren't excuse enough to have more firepower anyway.So whole thing goes like this: First half of the movie group of marines simply wander around in darkness, other half they cap some boring zombies, then the CGI scene and then - wtf? - a final FIGHTING scene. Fighting. Like it was low-budget van Damme or Steven Seagal action movie.It's fun at times and there were some nice parts, but I would never ever waste another hour at this again. As I said, promising thing that has failed, but is still fun at times.",Doom
280,Samus Aran,An average action film,5,2 February 2006,"This movie is an average action film, with no relation to the Doom series of video games other than having a corporation called UAC being stationed on Mars and running into some monstrous problems.The video game was heavy on violence, but more importantly it was heavy on frantic, despair-laced fight for life while being oppressed by the forces of hell. In this movie, there is no portal which is opened to Hell. There are no demons. There is no brave soldier out to save the Earth. There are no bodies found skewered, crucified or tortured. There are no rocket launchers, plasma or chain guns.The five minute scene of the movie wherein it is in first-person was poorly done. The combination of musical selection and the way the camera moved quickly but without any up/down movement (even the original Doom game had the screen bob up and down to make it feel like you were walking) made the first-person scene seem to be a guy at a carnival shooting gallery, or on a trip through the Fun House. It felt entirely fake, pre-scripted, set on a path and dull. I was looking forward to the first-person scene, and was completely disappointed, except for the last scene with the robotic demon (from Doom III, which I was not a fan of at all).All the writers/directors have done here is to take the name ""UAC"", the planet ""Mars"", and write themselves a generic humans-turning-into-zombies action flick ... and as an action flick, it wasn't entirely bad. Some of the characters were interesting, bits and pieces of the action were fun to watch, so I give it a 5 out of 10.However, in the field of a video game adaptation, it fails completely. There is none of the heart and soul of Doom in here at all.",Doom
281,Richies50435,An above par Aliens clone.,7,22 October 2005,"Weaknesses: Varies from the game storyline in as much that there are no teleportals leading to hell and no demons as enemies but ""mutants"" which reduces this film to a generic sci-fi/action/horror movie.Strengths: Despite being by the book, the movie is executed well, there are no scenes that make the viewer cringe at being so corny. The atmosphere is excellent and Doom has enough action to keep the casual action movie fan and die hard Doom fans happy, that is if the Doom fan boys can get over the ""no hell"" premise. Also an excellent hand-to-hand scene between a burly marine and a Baron of Hell (Doom 3 version)is fantastic and in all probability the best scene in the movie. Other highlights include scenes with the BFG 9000 including a tribute to the gun's name. The movie includes an interesting role-reversal between the two main characters at the end. Furthermore the FPS perspective at the climax is actually very innovative. The inclusion of the Rock in the cast keeps a ""wire-fu"" fight scene from descending into mediocrity.Final thought: definitely not Shakespeare, but again it is executed well and is much better than it's fellow Aliens clones like Resident Evil, Underworld or Ghosts of Mars, etc. Definitely worth the $5.50 ticket.6.5/10 aka thumbs up.",Doom
282,joberfeld113,Should have been better.,3,13 January 2012,"Doom is one of the best, if not the best first person shooter video game of all time. Many video games have tried to copy its success to various degrees. Since Doom is a very important contribution to video game history, seems as though a movie would be inevitable.I like that Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Karl Urban, and Rosamund Pike, all of who had already done action before in films such as The Mummy Returns, The Lord of the Rings, and 007 were signed on. An action film based on a video game franchise loved as much as Doom needs a cast that has experience with action. There is also fan service in the film. The first scene features a scientist named Dr. Carmack, an obvious nod to the game's creators John and Adrian Carmack. Fans will also be pleased that the film has elements from not only Doom 3, but also Doom 2: Hell on Earth in a scene late in the film that has all of the chaos finding its way to Earth. The Rock also gets a super badass gun called the BFG. This is easily one of the best looking props in the film. The film also tries to replicate the visual look of the games with the lighting, cool looking creature designs, and first person shooter scene that is easily the best scene in the movie.Despite all of the fan service, there is still nothing that can hide the major flaws. While it was stated that the film would be based on Doom 3, it really is not. The plot follows a group of space marines sent to investigate strange things that are happening at a research facility on Mars, but they find themselves at the mercy of genetically enhanced killing machines, while Doom 3 is about an unnamed silent space marine who takes on Satan's army. In the film, the way that these killing machines multiply is basically through infecting someone. But this infection thing does not stop there. It only does that based on what kind of person you are. If you are Charles Manson, you turn into one these things, but if you are a sweet little old lady, you gain some sort of super power through a twenty-fourth chromosome.I know what you are about to ask me. You are wondering if I could try explaining all that to you again, only in an easier way to understand. Truth is I cannot. The plot in Doom 3 is simple and has little to no science, the plot and science in the movie are more complicated than it needs to be. That is a major problem that this movie has. It does not know how to keep the story and science from getting too complicated.The acting is also a problem. Despite the fact that it is a movie that is based on Doom, no one in the cast looks very interested. It is like Urban thought to himself, ""I was in Lord of the Rings. What am I doing here?"" With everyone looking bored, I started to feel my boredom growing with them.The fact that the film tries to replicate the look of the video games kills the lighting. A lot of times you cannot see what is going on. While films such as Alien and Jaws are proof that what scares you the most is what you cannot see, Alien and Jaws still had the visuals lit so that you can see what is going on.The characters are also joke. Every one of them is a horror or action movie cliché. There is the laid back black guy, the rookie, the guy with no personality, the one who is obviously going to live, and the asshole. The biggest problem with these is that none have anything likable about them.Doom is just like other video game movies. It should have been better. While it does have excellent fan service, I cannot give Doom any higher than a three out of ten because of its confusing plot and science, boring acting, clichéd and unlikable characters, and awful lighting.",Doom
283,sias-programming,A Resident Evil side-kick,8,27 December 2006,"This was a great movie! Why does everyone rate this badly? Some friends told me they hated it since it didn't follow the game. So what? I don't care if it does or doesn't. It's got blood, action, shooting, The Rock, and a Resident Evil-style plot. I remember watching this and thinking it was pretty good. I rated it eight out of ten since it was a mock-up of Resident Evil in many ways, but also it had some pretty awesome action! It wasn't all that bad. Some parts I didn't exactly like, but other parts made up for it. The ending was also different from what I thought it would be. Whether or not you played the game, you have to watch this movie. It's a must!",Doom
284,Mr_Pink05,In the name of all things sacred!,2,17 May 2006,"As a fan of the original Doom game for PC and a hater of most (if not all) video game to movie conversions, I was not expecting much.But, nothing in the world could prepare me for the cinematic catastrophe I was about to witness. When a game is turned into a film, one can only expect the story to be changed a little, but surely not to such a degree that the title is the only thing linking the two. Let me give you a little run down on the storyline differences.Game:- A secret research base on the moon accidentally creates a rift between the moon's surface and the shores of hell, people become possessed, satanic rituals take place, demons run riot and soon the base begins to merge with hell itself, the player (you) is the last surviving member of a team of marines sent to investigate (pretty basic stuff) Movie:- A research facility on Mars try to make a serum to make people into super humans. But it does not work on everyone, some people when infected mutate into large monsters that have detachable tongues which pass the infection onto others. Confused yet? There's more. Using what seems to be floating liquid mercury, The Rock and his team of equally talentless actors travel to mars to investigate a distress call. While there they discover what has happened and are all killed except for The Rock and some white guy who's name I can't remember, both of which become super humans and have to battle it out.Now that I'm done bitching about the differences between the film and the game, permit me to explain to you the other reasons why this seizure of a film is not worth your time.The dialogue is, how should i put it?, very structured, by this I mean that when the characters interact with one another, you are very aware that it has been scripted and there is no ad-libbing.The cinematography is clumsy. The camera angle never quite knows what it wants to do, and the lighting (where there is any) is just irritating.The filters are not subtle, they use lots of red (probably because it's set on Mars) and a fair bit of everyone's favourite green (because it's ""post-Matrix"") But the most laughable part has to be the five minute long first person sequence, which looks exactly like ""Doom 3"" on Xbox, the CGI in this scene is laughable (although possibly deliberate) and it ingeniously shows the big hulking monsters attacking the main character with a chainsaw which he later uses against what can only be described as a ""boss"" All in all, this film is terrible. Less of a film, more of a Labotomy on celluloid. Spend your £3.75 renting price on something more worthwhile, like paying Lenox Lewis to punch you in the face, it would be more fun I assure you!",Doom

Not because it's good, but because you will laugh your ass off at at this movie. It tries hard at points to be a gritty version of the DOOM games, like DOOM 3, but it also gets the fun tone of DOOM 1 and 2, and it uses that in some scenes too. the Rock is in this film, WHY?!?!?!?!?

286,vol2,Doom is a fun movie. It isn't like the game of is namesake but...,6,26 September 2009,"But it is like watching a video game. There are a few complaints that I have about the movie, but none of them is big enough to have distracted from my enjoyment. Doom is essentially a visceral experience, very bloody and fast paced. There is actually a story to the movie, perhaps more of a story than the game itself? I will let the fans be the judge of that themselves. However, many fans will undoubtedly take off points for Doom's total lack of consistency with the source material. This did not bother me at all. I liked the game, but I was never personally hoping for a realistic adaptation of the story in a movie. Furthermore, I never expected Doom to be turned into a movie because it doesn't exactly cry out for an adaptation. I have read other comments saying that the name was poorly chosen, but we all know the power of franchising in advertising. The name Doom gave this movie a bigger budget and payed for the cool special effects and the good action movie actors. (at least i think so)That being said, I didn't like the ending much. I thought it was too abrupt and left a lot of unexplained things in a bad way. Tying up loose ends and possibly delving into the pseudo-scientific aspects that where introduced could have given the story a bigger universe to exist within and increased the likelihood of a sequel.I also didn't much like what I saw as an unexplained change in the Rock's personality at the end of the movie. I could see all of the little foreshadowing of his ultimate transformation, but it did not make any sense. The leader of an elite marines team can be a crazy evil sociopath, but there should be a bit more of an indication of it earlier on in the movie. Seriously, if he was so evil, why did he offer to let Urban stay behind on the mission because he was feeling emotional. It doesn't make sense that a sociopath would have such a warm and fuzzy moment. I am not really that picky, but I wanted an explanation of some kind.However, like i said, these problems did not really stop me from enjoying the movie. Doom never felt slow to me, and the action and gun fight scenes were all exciting to me. It also has a middle of the road quality story that only suffers from being abandoned before the movie ends.I rated this movie a 6.5 out of 10 because I feel I have to fairly compare it to other, better action sci-fi movies. Basically, I took points off for lack of a good ending, and I also took points off for abandoning the plot too early in the movie.BOTTOM LINE... Doom is fun. See Doom if you like bloody movies with guns that don't slow down. Stay away from Doom if you can't handle mindless violence or if you can't handle the fact that the movie completely ignores the story from the game.",Doom

The story line of the game changed a bit so it would be more ""Movie"" like, there for a movie was probably already in the works. The movie was similar to the game in that anticipation is what drove me(and my car) to the theater. I expected a crappy movie. What I got was Awesome. The action was great and it reminded me of ALiens in fact I think they took some stuff from Aliens, but I don't care it was sweet. The movie got your Adrenaline going and gets you all excited. The acting was decent, the sets and SFX were great.Dislikes: Some of the scenes were too fast, in a couple scenes they used too much shadow and darkness. (Spoiler) One of the Marines seemed too strong vs the Death Knight.Strong Likes: Even though the movie Seemed mindless, they were leading some place with explanation of what was going on, Unfortunalty the movie hit on the action more then the story which is being strongly developed through subtle clues.(spoiler) Through these little clues of what is happen and the Ending sequence the movie is wide open at the end.

288,alpha128,U.A.C. - Unoriginal Although Clever,7,27 October 2005,"I have played the DOOM, DOOM II, DOOM 3, and DOOM 3: Resurrection of Evil games. So I simply *had* to see the DOOM film, despite the bad reviews.For me, the last critically assailed, but still must-see, film was Alien vs. Predator (AVP). Like AVP, DOOM the film is unoriginal, but enthusiastic. And in my opinion, like AVP, DOOM the movie succeeds at what it sets out to accomplish.Sure enough, the DOOM movie, like the games, shamelessly rips off Alien and Aliens. Certainly, DOOM the movie is not in the same league as those two classics. But that doesn't make it a bad film. Frankly, I'd rather see a new story that recycles some familiar elements than another pointless remake.Furthermore, considering its video game source material, DOOM is surprisingly well-written and well-acted. The marines aren't as memorable as those in Aliens, but Karl Urban, Rosamund Pike, and even The Rock give performances that are quite good.The movie isn't completely faithful to the plot of the game, but in my opinion, the plot changes work. Furthermore, IMHO, the brief, but much discussed, First Person Shooter sequence works - both as cinema and as a homage to the games.As well versed in DOOM lore as I am, I can't predict how a viewer who has never played the games will react to the movie. However, I predict that all but the most demanding fans of the games will enjoy the film.7/10",Doom

Much to my surprise the film was a very enjoyably sci-fi/action romp.Centering pretty much around the latest game in the Doom saga. A group of UAC (the name of the company) marines are sent to Mars to quarantine a base. Upon arrival they find the place empty with the main scientists they are looking for missing.A few people have run this movie down for lack of plot or substance. These people have obviously never played Doom 1, 2 or 3? The games only ever had thread bare story lines.

290,laserdude,Could Have been Better Than it Was.,4,23 October 2005,"I won't spend the time giving away any of the story-line since it seems everyone has done that already. I marked this review as having spoilers however, since if you have played the Doom 3 version from Xbox, then you already know what this movie is about. My complaint is that the producers had an opportunity to do a really good movie, and blew it. But the real problem is in Doom 3 game itself. So much had been dropped from the original story of Doom's other game episodes. I mean really, how many dark hallways do you need to walk down before it gets boring. And I was bored. In the tag line of the movie it mentions ""all hell breaking loose"". In the movie, hell seemed pretty tame. The monsters are very limited and the locations of where a marine might go to find these creatures had lacked imagination. Too much was explained and I didn't like the idea of people becoming monsters through a ""zombie process"". It was lame and has become a Hollywood gimmick. The original Doom games (though I suppose the best ones were those developed by fans) had you in environments that were so scary and unusual, that part of the fear was trying to figure out where you were as you searched for clues and fought off a variety of hideous creatures. The creatures in the movie were weak by comparison (but in some ways, they are weak in Doom 3). I did like some aspects of the film (the arc was kinda cool) and found the characters with some depth - though this too could have been explored further. I like Doom as a game series. The movie, instead of being a copy of the game experience, could have gone much further and would have been more scary and exciting if the producers had been more creative. Those loving the game series may be disappointed. Going just to see a monster flick, the movie might pass on these merits.",Doom

Enough of them to make quite an enjoyable film. I'm saddened at the low IMDb rating this film has. The acting of the lead actors is decent. The supporting actors are the usual military grunt types, with parallels to the marines in the Aliens 2 movie.With mutants, fun tech, and plenty of gore, there's not much not to love about this movie.The only thing that felt out of place to me is the FPS scene. It reminded me too much of the Uwe Bols' 'house of the dead' travesty.Definitely a popcorn flick to enjoy with your friends.Game over man, Game over! errr.. I mean Semper Fi Mo..........",Doom
292,Reyak,Tribute To Nintedo Generation,10,29 March 2006,"Alright, so I'm a vid freak. I grew up in a world of bits and bytes, and it's effected me. Back in the day, when Macintosh had just ripened from Apple, I was running a Mac LCII, and thought it was the end all be all of the computer world. Not counting my Nintendo, or Atari 2600, My video game collection amounted to a subtle 3000 games, some of which I was beta testing for certain companies.One of my favorite games was Doom. I would play that game for hours on end, and loved every minute of it.This movie did not impress me in the beginning. I must admit I intended to watch simply out of loyalty to the game from ID software. I was not, however looking forward to what I had seen in the trailer, which was The Rock blasting away at anything that moves, and being bored to death by unrealistic graphics in an unrealistic setting.While watching this film, I was reminded over and over how this is a testosterone based movie that was otherwise pointless. This, however was until a certain scene that blew me away. I cannot give the details of this scene, but if you have ever played Doom or any other first person shooter like Wolfenstein, or Duke Nukem, you will come to the same conclusion I did. I yelled, and laughed, and slammed fist on the chair I was sitting in. ""Yeah! now this is awesome!"" I cannot tell you anymore, go out, and rent this movie, or if you really liked the game, buy the movie. You will absolutely love it.Reyak Post Script: you'll love the end title as well.",Doom
293,Bocklocke,"It's Doom, but it's Not Doom",3,24 August 2008,"The movie takes it's characters and enemies straight from the game Doom 3, but the movie takes a completely different storyline. The game's story begins after a demonic portal opens up and it releases the legion of hellish creatures, but the movie takes a Resident Evil-esquire approach by simply dubbing the whole accident a ""virus"". As a Doom fan I find this major change an insult; it completely alters the storyline AND essentially what Doom is all about. These are the reasons I chose the odd title to this review: the movie is Doom to a degree, but as a whole it is not Doom. It's a fine sci-fi flick but if you are a Doom fan then do not watch this movie.",Doom

Being a fan of all of these categories, I went and saw it the night it came out. (Seeing The Rock bring the BFG on The Daily Show sealed the deal.) Though the movie doesn't follow the plot line of the game (if you're like me, you're asking, ""The game had a plot?""), it ends up being pretty good and easy to follow.I had been hearing all the negative reviews when the film came out, but if you're not into this kind of film, then why would you go and see it?

295,ThrowntoReality,Even more claustrophobic than the games...,3,2 September 2009,"...Well, at least more claustrophobic than ""Doom 3""!I didn't really expect anything that good, since I've played all three of the ""Doom"" video games and I love them all. The reason for my low expectations is that in the games you are an alone survivor trying to make it back to Earth. In the movie there is a group of soldiers just killing zombies. It is a perfect example of a film that became famous because of the title, but it is actually so different from the games that they could easily have called it something completely different - ""Operation Mars"" or ""Code Red"" for example. The concept for the games just wasn't made to be put into movies, and you can smell that from a mile away.Rosamund Pike delivers her most stale role so far, just laughing, improvising and talking about some rubbish that isn't important. She might be trying to deliver a solid performance - but without any luck. Dwayne Johnson is the worst thing about the movie, but to describe his role I'd have to reveal much of the film, and that I'm not going to do.So if you're in for some sick, twisted, zombie-mashing mayhem, then this is the movie for you. If you're not, don't bother.",Doom
296,rkoch1,"Underrated movie for what it is, ACTION SCI FI!",9,28 January 2017,"This movie was actually exceptionally good in my opinion. For what it is supposed to be (action sci-fi horror) it hit every requirement on par.Amazing special effects and practical effects, great costume, great budget production (amazing scenery) and a decent plot which was well fleshed out with interesting characters. On top of the awesome practical effects, it had good camera angles during the action scenes which give you a good view of the creature which weren't OVERLY SHAKY and don't give you nausea like most modern movies.I think this movie gets a bad rap just because of a couple stupid decisions by the characters and characters which were frustrating or making stupid decisions. ALSO SOME POOR ACTING but only by part of the cast. I thought the woman Sam played a horrible role, she kept making the audience feel like she was secretly hiding something with that evil, blank, and cold look on her face. Plus, she wanted to take time to try to heal everybody or do autopsies in the middle of a massive gunfight/evacuation.Perhaps the reason why this movie got low ratings were the stupid decisions made by the characters (i.e. the main character's decision to FIGHT THE ROCK hand to hand instead of just shoot him with his bullets), or the overly-dramatic scene when the movie turns into a first-person shooter (I LOVED that part and thought it was done very well) even though this appeals highly to anybody who has ever played a first person shooter. This movie held true to gamer's hearts, including things such as the gravity gun (which is shown to us early on but doesn't become available until you unlock it later on in the game, just like in movie) and a bunch of other easter eggs for gamers.All in all, this movie deserves AT LEAST a 7/10 for its genre and artistic intent. If you watch this expecting for a challenging mystery filled with surprises and plot turns, don't come here as you will be disappointed and will rightly give the movie a 5/10 as it is currently rated. However, go here for the right things and you will not be let down!Highly underrated movie!",Doom
297,keithw1975,Go see it if you like Sci-Fi,8,24 October 2005,I went to this expecting a decent flick and was impressed. I thought it was quite good and lacked the cheesiness of some Sci-Fi films. The Rock gave his best performance yet and everything seemed well done. Granted if I wasn't a big Sci-Fi fan I would probably have only given it a 7. At one point they have the camera shoot in first person and I was worried they would over do that but they didn't and knew when enough was enough. The last flick I saw was Serenity and I will have to say that was better but mainly because the characters in it were more interesting. Doom could have actually been a longer movie with more character development in my opinion. I wouldn't have minded another 30 minutes of film if it was able to be put to good use.Keith,Doom

Brave Space Marines have to stop this invasion, which ultimately leads to the final confrontation against some Boss Demon (Mastermind in Doom 1, Spawning Wall in Doom 2 and CyberDemon in Doom 3).The Doom movie is not bad. It contains humor (although mainly in the beginning), it contains fresh new ideas (demon half-stuck in wall), it contains cool action sequences (be it the containment cell fight or the final death-match), it has that ""clock-is-ticking-hurry-up"" stimulant...But it's more like another Resident Evil: Scientists are experimenting with human genome, cross-species genetic implants etc., and all of a sudden they have monsters breathing down their necks.Doom is about something else, and this movie seems to be willingly ignoring it. Where's the Hell? Where are DEMONS that actually spit fire, cast fireballs and plasma balls, where are Cacodemons or Lost Souls? Producers may be satisfied - this will make a lot of money for them. But unfortunately, it at the same time confirms the public knowledge that action games are ""un-film-able"". What a waste...",Doom
300,tj19,It was pretty good,8,21 October 2005,"I really liked Doom, but it could've been better. It wasn't completely different from the game (Doom 3). It was actually pretty close. Doom had a first person view for a little while, which was one of the best parts of the movie. Doom 3 the game, and Doom the movie rock. Speaking of rock, The Rock did very good as Sarge, he is a pretty good actor. Karl Urban was good, too, and so was his twin sister, Rosamund Pike. This movie was a little scary, and very gory. Doom even had some jaw-droppers, one was in the first 5 minutes! I know why the critics did not like this movie because this was actually a movie you watch for fun, not those boring movies that have a real deep meaning. Doom is recommended for people who like movies for what they are, and that is to entertain. And Doom definitely did. I give this movie 8.0 out of 10.",Doom

I didn't go into this movie with much hope, which was good, because I wasn't disappointed when it sucked. For the first 1 1/2 hours, I was bored half to death. I thought this was an action film? Or a science fiction film? Or a horror film? You get the idea. Doom is none of these things. It's a way to grab $8 from zit-faced, pre-pubescent little Bobby, who has grown up playing the video games. The whole mess turns into a poor zombie flick about halfway through. How did they blow $70 million making this thing? Give me that kind of money, and the action will be so intense your bowels will explode! The performances were beyond terrible (and not even in a good 80's way). Every character is a dumb cliché, with the cocky leader, the tough black guy, the suave flirting black guy, the quiet guy with a mysterious past, blah blah blah... The CGI in the film is the same stuff from Resident Evil, Queen Of The Damned, Underworld, etc. There is a novelty bit, where the film switches to first person and people were screaming ""Oh my god, it's just like the video game!"" Naturally, I wanted to slap them. I find absolutely no redeeming features in this wretched, pathetic excuse for an action movie, and I recommend you stay well clear of it!",Doom

I have ***never*** regretted spending money on a film as I did this one.There were four things I enjoyed: 1) sitting in the dark exchanging cheat codes with my son at the appropriate moments; 2) the BFG; 3) something Sarge said (actually, the Rock (there being a slight difference in my head at the instant he said it)) near the end; and 4) the genesis of one of the monsters (virtually the only one that wasn't an Imp) that showed up at the end.....the only genuine homage to the original game...",Doom
304,FatChino,"Doom, Doom, Doom",4,1 January 2006,"Dear Doom game creators,Andrzej Bartkowiak, director of US Marshalls, Lethal Weapon 4, Speed and Species here. Recently my thirteen year old son son has been playing more and more of your 'retro' first person shooter Doom. I've been discussing it with him and basically we both agree that it would be a great project for the future. We really think former WWE superstar The Rock would be perfect for the starring role. Basically we worked out a character that is muscular, tough, mean and without any other human emotions - that guy is gonna be in charge.Anyway, we really like the possibilities presented by the violence of the game, the potential for dark corridors as well as the vagueness of the story of the game had at the time of making. So far my son has written an opening sequence. He wrote it after he watched Aliens, in about ten minutes!! I was so proud ... but that's another matter altogether.I have some other ideas. We'll keep the idea of the evil corporation (audiences can't get enough of those evil corporations these days). There was something in the game about mutations too, right(?) those will go in too (hey if resident evil can mutations and evil corporations, we can too). Those weapons you had in the game were pretty impressive as well ... BFG ; Big F**king Gun haha ... me and my son had a good laugh about that. Well we'll keep all those too.Other than that I haven't got an exact plan of the rest of the film. One thing's for sure though is that we'll get rid of that thing you guys had about hell in their. WHAT WERE YOU THINKING??? People want mutations and evil corporations on Mars, and maybe just maybe something about teleportation ... Hell is just to out there for a movie like this. This is about art, not game-play. Anyway we'll keep the die-hards off our backs by making the characters mention hell every few minutes ... ah well sort something better out. I'll get the writers to mail you a copy when its done. Expect it within, say, the next few hours. Needless to say there'll be a sexy female scientist, plenty of cool mutation fx and of course a showpiece end battle with The Rock included.Well all that's left to do is get your final approval, which I'm sure you'll agree to after reading the notes my son has prepared for you. Other than that all that's left is to get The Rock on board and everything's set.Peace out, Your buddy, Andrzej Bartkowiak*P.S. just had a flash of inspiration; it'll seal the deal for you; basically in the middle of the film we have say 10 minutes solid fighting by our hero ... and wait, wait ... get this, its from his perspective; those gamers will just go bananas for it ...*This comment has nothing to do with Mr. Bartkowiak or any of his associates who I am sure would never sink to the levels of banality and childishness displayed above.",Doom

306,SdwOne,A Bit Of A Wasted Opportunity,6,15 December 2005,"I've been a Doom fan since the early 90's and having played and enjoyed the latest incarnation of Doom on the PC, Doom 3, which was released last year, I was very excited when I heard this film was coming out.Doom the film is based on the Doom 3 PC game, where you get to play a tough nameless marine, who battles for his life against extra-dimensional entities (demons to you and me) as an experiment in 'matter teleportation' on Mars goes awry.To be honest, this film as a game cross-over doesn't quite fit the scenario of the original game, which I believe, had an excellent plot. I understand that films don't necessarily have to correspond 100% with the book or game it's based upon, but the way I see it, if you have a great book or game, then why change its format when it comes to the film? Sure, perhaps film budgets are a factor, but when you get excellent cross-over films like Lord Of The Rings, then as far as I'm concerned, cross-over films should try and mimic the original art as much as possible.This is my main, focal gripe with Doom the film. The PC game, on which it's based, had an excellent plot. With interesting characters, lots and LOTS of intense tension and action, coupled with a constant fear of dread as one battled demonic entities. Only to be faced with even more terrifying ones. As for the film, sure, you got your typical wacky characters, so no problem there. There were some tense moments too (only at the beginning) but as for the rest of it, (SPOILER ALERT!!!) the so called demons.??? There weren't any!!! As a player of the game, the demons were the REAL stars of the show. They scared the living s**t out of you. So, naturally, as someone who knows quite a bit about the game, I was tense in the first hour or so, simply because I thought the demons were coming. However, as time passes, and the true nature of the threat on Mars is revealed, that tension dissipates, the excitement wanes and you're left with nothing but a mindless action film.I think this is a real shame. Doom the film has no real sense of depth despite the excellent game series, whose sole purpose was the scare the heck out of you. However, on a positive note, the action sequences are good, the CGI (which could have been a LOT better in places) is adequate, the characters are passable and the tension level at the beginning was intense But I'm guessing it was only intense because of the anticipation of facing some truly terrifying CGI demons later on in the film.However, thanks to that failing Hollywood machine, that always seems to put dollars way above art, Doom failed on those expectations. I'm pretty sure a lot of game enthusiasts will also be disappointed with the films much deviated plot and those who are unfamiliar with the game, will probably see this film as merely an exercise in mindless CGI driven action.A real shame really. But perhaps given the current and disturbing evangelical movement in America, as well as Hollywood's obsession with money and indifference to art, a dark, truly terrifying film about battling demons on Mars, really had NO chance of being brought to our screens, hence this much dumbed down version.",Doom
307,Kefka_8203,"*Warning, spoilers ahead* How can one fail with this?",1,16 January 2006,"Oh by the old gods this was bad...Where to begin? I'm a fan of the original Doom 1+2, and I've never touched part three which I've heard this movie borrows most heavily from. And after this movie I doubt I'll touch it anyway. Doom the movie is the standard ""elite soldiers goes into routine mission, everything goes straigth to h*ll"", a genre of movies that reached the peak with Predator, part one or Aliens. And due to the difficulty of making a movie worthwhile the makers of Doom decides to make another crap fest. Where to begin? First; The cast. I usually like The Rock, he's got a kind of humorous charm(watch Welcome to the Jungle), in this movie he's horrible though. His character is the usual rough officer that yells a lot, then suddenly in the last twenty minutes or so he goes from caring to psychopathic. The rest of the cast goes from OK(the lead role) to horribly bad( Sam and Portman). The monsters of the movie seem mostly boring, give me the old Doom fiends back and I'll be happy. Though it isn't the crappy action, boring dialogue or pathetic monsters that I feel finally kill this movie off. It's the horrible First-person view that you're forced to endure at the very end of the movie. I'm sure that it sounded cool on paper ""Wow, let's do ten minutes of FPV mode and let the viewers think they're part of the movie"", problem is; It doesn't work, not one bit. Uh uh. Nope. That sequence felt so dull and slow that I almost fell asleep. Then there's some kind of back story about ancient martians/superthingies, a mode of transportation that is totally left unexplained and a personal story for the lead role that is too cliché to bother with. 1/10 stars.",Doom

If you have never played the game and don't know exactly what's going on in there, you will be able to enjoy the film. As I noticed, a lot of bad reviews are from people comparing the game to its film adaptation but as we all know, film adaptations are often slightly different. Doom is no exception. The film follows John Grimm, called Reaper and played by extremely talented Karl Urban. There is no hell like in the game and in my opinion, the film is made to be more 'realistic' than the game is.As someone who hasn't played the game, I thoroughly enjoyed the film.The actors delivered a great show, the script was written very well and you will not be able to take your eyes off the screen.The only bad thing that I disliked was the moment J.

A good SF action film all in all.BUT: IT'S NOT REALLY DOOM !!!I have played the 3 Doom PC games and I miss so much of it in the film. The biggest difference to the game is that there is a team now to fight the monsters, whereas the games were single hero based. OK, it might be difficult to make film with one here to fight them all, but I'd still prefer that. Also, there is no hell-gate/ spawning like in the games in the Doom movie. The reason for the monster mutations is genetical enhancement now. Why don't they stick to the good original reason? Finally I must say that I missed the Doom monsters in the film very much.

As a result there is now Revelations for 2011 and another sequel in the mix...so everyone happy....but when I read an interview in which Gans slammed Doom and its' director as among other things lazy, I thought that he was speaking out of turn as the history of video game adaptations is littered with casualties of corporate greed and inept fan-service. I had seen Doom on release and thought little of it which was unusual for me as I have a near photographic memory for film so I thought it was time to revisit this oddity. So in theory I was approaching the movie for the first time and presumed that such a simple premise (big guns, demons, hell-gates, more demons, chainsaws, gore and doors) should be a recipe for success or at least enjoyable popcorn fodder fun. I was surprised to find that the reason I had forgotten Doom was due to having clearly erased the horror (unintentional) of this travesty from my memory for good reason. Even uncut, extended, unrated the film is another Super Mario The Movie, with all the hallmarks of a beloved franchise but little to no resemblance upon closer inspection. On the surface just because it looks and sounds like Doom doesn't equal the familiar feel of the game many know and love. Near the films predictable finale a first person perspective view rescues the film from obscurity harking back to the good old days of chainsaw madness in dimly lit corridors but it is too little too late and unlikely to convert non-fans to the franchise. The film deviates heavily from the source material and fails epically to replicate the superior films it continually emulates (Alien,Aliens, Event Horizon, every sci-fi film ever made cliché heaven) unless another resident evil is what you are looking for as it almost convinced me I was watching another Paul WS Anderson cash-in. Mr Gans was correct in his diagnosis that the patient is indeed sick and should be put out of its misery before it infects other victims but if you have had the misfortune to see the latest video game films which are now in all in wonderful 3d you will know that the insidious virus from the films weak plot has not only escaped the Red Planets useless quarantine but is currently spreading to a screen near you.Watch in the background or re-watch Aliens..again.",Doom

And it didn't make me jump as much as the game. The movie is dark, but that's okay, since it was patterned after the video game, which is also dark (although the game was much more ""playable""...with darkness...than the movie was ""watchable""). The game was scarier too. This says a lot about the game creators (very well done), and the movie directors (poor effort). I'm not sure why Hollywood couldn't hack it.

This movie could have been so much more.They dropped any and all references to Hell. Why? No one in the bible belt was going to watch it anyway...the horror was minimized by making the movie centered around a group rather than one or a few characters (see Silent Hill if you don't think that would work for a movie, it does) The ""genetic mutant"" angle was just, well, retarded. Even if they had stripped Doom from the title and all references to it (which, lets face it, there were few), that subject just doesn't work.The acting wasn't great, but then again, I wasn't expecting much there. I like most of the actors, the ones i was familiar with anyway. The Rock is just fun to watch, and Karl Urban has never disappointed me.My final complaint is actually one i read in a magazine. They ended a movie based on the mother of all first person shooters with a damn fist fight? Come on.The bad aside, there was some good in this movie. It still succeeds as a cheesy Sci-fi action horror movie. It was fun, there were good kills, the monster costumes looked like the creatures in Doom 3, and we get to see the Bfg in action. Not much action, but at least it was there.All in all, if you are a Doom fan, forget the title of the movie and just watch it as a movie in the vein of running man and total recall: cheesy futuristic action.If you know nothing of the game, watch it as cheesy sci-fi action. Then play the game and marvel on how they could have made something much better if they had bigger balls and had stuck to the game story.In the future, only people with a deep passion for a game should make a movie about it.

As the team surveys the dark and isolated lab areas, John is also reunited with his sister Sam (Rosamund Pike), which brings up the memories of their dead parents and repressed hostility over his departure and emotional distance. Of course this is a movie based on monsters and violence, so in no time, there are some strange things lurking in the darkened corridors of the lab and the team finds themselves locked in a series of deadly confrontations against enemies of unimaginable horror. In short order the team is picked off by the deadly opposition which causes strain amongst the survivors, as it becomes clear that the work being conducted at the base was far from the simple excavations that they had been claiming for years. The truth is far more dangerous and soon has the very safety of Earth in the balance. The changing dynamic soon divides Sarge and John and they find themselves at odds with not only the creatures but themselves as they battle for survival and the safety of the Earth.As a fan of the game series I had followed the long development of the film with interest. As production began there were reports that the film would deviate from the game in not being set on Mars and following Zombies more than demons from hell. While the film is set on Mars there is some deviation that may upset fans of the game. Hell does not serve as the source of the enemies; rather it is something that is not present in any of the games. Another deviation is that the film unlike the game is not nonstop action. ""Doom"" moves at a very deliberate pace and when the action comes, it tends to be against a solitary foe. Only for a brief segment near the conclusion of the film do we get a battle against a large mass, and then it is very short. The novel first person perspective shown late in the film was great fun as the audience howled with delight during this segment.The Rock shows once again that he is a rising Star as his charisma and commanding presence propels the film even though he is a supporting character. No matter the cheese factor, or stiff lines, The Rock is such a compelling presence, he makes the film viewable. Urban is good in the lead role, though he is overshadowed by The Rock, as his strong soft spoken mannerisms seem out of place in a macho action setting.All of this said, while it is by no means a landmark piece of cinema, ""Doom"" is fun, and is easily the best game adaptation to film yet.3 stars out of 5 Gareth Von Kallenbach",Doom
316,coolmod,A gamers review,5,17 July 2007,"Doom is the film adaption of one of the best video game series of all time. The video game series are some of my favorites games but my personal favorites is Doom 3 for the Xbox. it is more like the movie than the other games. in this game you are an rrts ( rapid response tactical squad ) member and the only surviver of your team who was sent in to a secret facility to investigate the strange goings on. the game had some of the most gruesome scary monsters ever to appear on any game system and the monsters appearing from every were ( through vents,bursting through walls ) makes it a very scary game. the film in a way was disappointing. i thought that it was going to be a copy of Doom 3 with intense horror edge of your seat thrills and beyond reckoning violence. well the film had violence but it just didn't live up to its gaming charm. the cast was well draw up though. i mean they aren't Oscar worthy performances but they do look good holding those over-sized guns. the monsters are the films saving grace. they are basically derived-from the games and are huge and grotesque and their strength and speed do make them very domineering. but to be honest the first person aspect donned during the film are astoundingly identical to the first person shooter genre that the games are renowned for. it conclusion some good references to the games moderate action and big monsters make this film a must have for the followers of the game and for people seeking an evening filled with a decent sci fi action thriller",Doom
317,guust8919,Not that bad,6,4 April 2018,"Over the years this movie is holding up better and better to other movies from its generation. The Rock is really cool in one of his first lead roles and Carl Urban is good in almost every movie he appears. Only a few downthings to this movie and thats the somewhat thin plot and the really bad ""first person scène"". Overall give this movie a chance even if you've seen it some 10 years ago. You won't be dissapointed!",Doom
318,moviewatcher417,Doom.,5,2 November 2005,"Poor Karl Urban. His first staring role, and he gets upstaged by the rock. Urban's name is listed first in the credits and he is playing the top character. But pretty much every promo or major review calls this movie ""Doom, starring the Rock"" or ""The Rock's next movie."" However, if you consider the reception this movie has been getting, it might actually be better for Karl if he isn't singled out. Now, the movie itself isn't that bad for a project based on a video game. It's better than Resident Evil (which isn't saying a lot). Karl and the Rock play their roles as well as they can as members of an elite force of Marines, sent to deal with a ""situation"" on Mars that gets way out of hand. The rest of the squad's characters are pretty much one-dimensional and, like any good lambs to the slaughter, they stay that way until their time comes. For example, the jerk is a jerk, and so on. If you are looking for an action-horror flick with lots of blood and big guns, this is it. The problem as I see it is that a lot of fans of the game went in expecting more from the game (""get in the game"" the ads promised)and the movie failed to deliver on a lot of those expectations.",Doom
319,shadow-moses,"Worst film I have ever went to the theater for, bar none! (Spoilers)",1,4 December 2005,"Good god this film is awful! As an avid video game fan who began with Doom on 486 PCs I was utterly let down by this film because other then the literal meaning of the title (your 6-10 dollars is Doomed, not to mention the 90 of life you will never get back) this film has no viable connection to the game I played as a youth. First off, IT'S SO BORING!!! After an hour of boredom it dawned on me that I made a huge mistake in seeing this film. So what makes it so boring? NO ACTION, that's what. These slimy jerk-off characters grope around in the dark and see almost nothing. Then a guy runs in to some clawed hand and gets thrashed, more nothing, the end. No hordes of monsters, no bloody battles through crazy hellish surroundings, nothing. When I think Doom, I think constant battle in hell! Well none of that in this filmNow the reason I held the slightest hope for this film was because of stuff I saw in the trailer: the first person shooter gimmick and the BFG. The first person stuff was kinda cool; it was the only enjoyable 45 seconds in the entire film.Now the BFG, it's fired twice:Once into an empty toilet stall, And then into a wall. That's it.Yes, I know Rock was trying to hit living targets but so what! This is what he HIT! It wasn't used to get our hero's our of some insane situation where they're surrounded by swarms of monsters and NOTHING else will get them out alive EXCEPT the BFG (you know, like in that game Doom?). Hmm, maybe that toilet had a gun I didn't see, and Mean Scary Toilet Eyes. I don't know.Why the hell can't the plot be like the game? A portal to hell is open for no real reason, causing chaos all around our heros with monsters everywhere and they have to fight their way out. Cool! What's wrong with that? Infections?? If I want to see Infections I'll watch 28 Days Later. I wanted to see Doom dammit! Hey, how bout' some Demonic Possessions or something like that? Screw infections!Then we get to end where the movie turns from stupid/boring to utterly retarded. They go back to Earth and the Rock says they have to kill all the unarmed civilians because of these stupid ass infections. Boy that was my favorite part of the game! I remember how tough the final boss was, you know, that room full of unarmed civilians? Wow, that was so much fun! Civilians? Really? YOU KILL LOTS OF UGLY MONSTERS IN DOOM, NOT CIVILIANS!!!Yeah, great, so the Rock is the 'Final Boss' Well who cares! Screw the Rock and screw this wretched film. You want to see a movie based on Doom? Well it already exists. Its called Aliens, watch that instead. Or Event Horizon, that has more Hell in it then Doom! (On the screen anyway. In Doom it's the audience who's in hell.)",Doom
320,MDMeridius,*sigh*,6,28 October 2005,"I am a fan of the game, growing up playing the first two. The biggest problem with this movie was it felt like a corridor-crawling Alien clone and not Doom. You never REALLY got a good visual of the demons. However I suppose that was sort of true to form with the latest, Doom 3, at least for the first level (which while playing scared the bijezzus out of me, and this film didn't do that, another shame) Also, I never saw it, but my friend said it felt like Resident Evil. Resident Evil is not about Demons from Hell. Doom is. When doom looks like a bunch of zombies and little else, there's an issue. Half the time the demons/zombies were hiding and/or running away, or attacking like a bad horror flick... you see nothing but a hand grab a limb or something. Balls. The team of marines was made up of a cliché'd group of eclectic characters... which made it kind of fun to bet upon who would get iced in which order. Take the positive or the negative, up to you. I didn't mind all that much.The first person segment started off okay... then for a little while began feeling like a funhouse walk. I was cringing. The pinky fight i suppose made up for it but that was tough to follow. I wasn't sure if buddy was dying and coming back to life a la a video game or not. Now that's pretty much the negatives... the soundtrack was PHENOMENAL. I loved it. The acting about par for an action flick, and above par for a video game flick. The Rock was a great Jarhead and Karl Urban in military pro forma is always good. Back to my comparison to the third installment of the game: like that, the movie takes place largely on Mars, and hits on scientific research going too far and causing some kind of evil resurgence or this chromosome makes people evil. I don't know the stories totally in each of the games, i just know that in the third there was more science to it, like this movie, which was good. I like a bit of logic, even when they neglect to say ""pairs"" whenever they speak of 23 chromosome (pairs). The extra pair was a cool reason to be superhuman/superdemon. One last thing, and i hope this is true, although i don't know about economical possibilities: it truly was left open for a sequel. Hell, (ha ha) Doom 2 was about ""Hell on earth"" rather than someplace else (mars) so if that leads to more story development (because you never really found out what was going on, even at the end) and more straight up non-corridor Doom action with full visuals of those badasses, I'm all for it. This film, if only an introduction to a trilogy, even, works. As a standalone, does not give enough homage to the game. I'm glad i saw it, in the end. C+ I'm buying the soundtrack - Mansell does good work.",Doom
321,Zombafyed,Resident Evil in Space,1,1 December 2011,"This movie is about a video game.Which video game? I have no clue.It definitely isn't Doom.Doom is about an invasion from Hell.

The Doom movie came and went leaving fans empty handed.This pile of crap should've never been made. I hope and wish they will eventually redo the movie the correct way.This is just Resident Evil in space. An incredible letdown to us true Doom fans.",Doom
322,chrishn,A tribute to FPS,7,14 November 2005,"This is a great action movie and nothing more. The plot is sufficient to set the frame for all the action and suspense. The characters are portrayed with all their semi-psychopathic traits, which is enough to be entertaining. The action is really great. The weapons are ridiculously huge, which is GREAT. The fights are full of gore, action and suspense. Actually the movie has some creepy moments. It's not a horror movie, but it has the same eeriness like most first person shooters today. By the way, if the word FPS (first person shooter) doesn't ring a bell, don't see this movie. If you haven't played these games AND ENJOYED IT, most aspects of the movie will be lost on you. To those of you who claim it isn't based on Doom there is one thing to say: THANK GOD. A movie based directly on Doom would be something like this: ""One man running around dark corridors carrying a zillions tonnes of weapons and ammo. Finding keys etc. The entire plot and story would be told in the introduction. There would be no dialog, no other characters, no plot twists (the movie has a twist, albeit a small one) etc.This movie is not only dedicated to Doom. It's dedicated to all FPS's, and it's meant to all of us players, who have always dreamed of being in the middle of the action. Why doesn't it get 10/10. First of all there are too few monster types. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of monsters, but it's the same all the time. I would have liked a regular Boss-monster at the end, like a hell knight or cyberdemon. Not all the weapons are there. However, the weapons are still cool, and you get to see both the chainsaw in action, and the BFG. If you like FPS, the movie is a must. Especially since it has a great first-person passage, where you get all the action and gore right up your face.",Doom
323,de_cafe6914,Doom?,6,26 February 2006,"Having just watched the film last night, I still am not quite sure how I felt about the whole thing. I, for one, was disappointed, because, the monsters were not demons from Hell, nor were they aliens from space. In short, this was basically a Resident Evil movie with a higher budget and bigger monsters. I suppose now I shall summarize the story. A group of Marines receives a stress call from a research station on Mars known as Olduvai, or, something of that nature. Led by Sarge(Played beautifully over-the-top by The Rock), and the group of Marines heads to Mars through some type of travel device known as the Arc that was found 20 years ago on Mars. Their mission: To find the 6 missing scientists, find any government property, and search and destroy any threat they come across. Soon, all hell breaks loose.One of the biggest problems with the movie was what they decided to be the cause of the monsters. They were not demons from hell or from outer space, but they were the result of uncontrolled genetic mutation in humans. Sound like Resident Evil to you? I thought so. THe cast does a great job for the most part, especially the lead, Reaper(Played by a gruff Karl Urban). The film is very poorly lit, and is extremely graphic and bloody. I don't know, I was guess I was expecting more suspense and a survival horror element, but that was not here. It was a pure action movie. I must say, the creature and digital effects were done very well, though.Overall, as long as you don't go into it with high expectations, or a knowledge of the games, you won't be disappointed. The action is, for the most part, non-stop and very gory. The acting is pretty solid, and the film moves at a very quick pace. A pretty decent way to kill two hours, and a good popcorn movie. However, I still felt very disappointed. DOOM runs 1hr. 53min, and is rated R for Strong Violence/Gore and Language. 6.5/10",Doom

I have played the first doom games and Doom 3, I will say that this must have been a very difficult movie to make. keeping fans happy while making the movie approachable for new fans.It will not reach BlockBuster, but its a nice little piece of horror and action to remember. I bet everyone, in the movie, tried their best to bring the game to life, bringing fresh, new action and if some people out there don't like it and claim to be fans of the game...

325,joshua-c-s-63903,Pretty solid till about the last 15 minutes.,8,9 June 2018,"The last 15 minutes or so of this movie where the camera turns to first-person and Karl Urban and The Rock randomly start fighting is right about where this movie goes downhill for me. I mean I still don't understand why The Rock's character all of a sudden wants to kill John Grimm (Karl Urban) before he's even turned into a monster, or that the previous guy to get bit on his neck was near-death before eventually dying and the Rock appears perfectly fine.Nonetheless, the rest of the movie for me was quite entertaining. The tension that builds as you anticipate the next attack by the monsters, and the enjoyment me and my brother had putting bets on who would die next only made this experience better. Overall, if you can try to look past the absurdity of the last 15 minutes and you like a good ole' fashioned pick 'em off movie like I do then give it a shot. Also, I recommend watching it with someone and betting which character dies next and where. Trust me it's fun.",Doom
326,semi_cool18,Very Entertaining,7,1 November 2005,"Doom does what it is supposed to quite well, and this is something that most critics don't (and never will) understand. This movie isn't setting out to win an Oscar, but it is gunning for entertainment, action, with just a little bit of comedic relief. These goals are all met, and are done so with style and bombastic action. The Rock plays as the head of a team of marines sent to investigate some missing people on a desolate institute on mars, and he has quite a remarkable change in character near the middle the movie. I'd say the feel of the movie remains fairly faithful to the game (which is awesome), although it could've done with a little more horror/suspense and a little less action. (But what can ya do?) Also: The 10 minute-or-so sequence of 1st-person view was really entertaining, and think it should be implemented in more movies of this style. Doom is fun, entertaining, and will probably be enjoyed by fans of the game. I couldn't ask for more.",Doom

The movie has some cheesy one liners and while the plot is weak and not fully flushed out when the action is set in you don't care. Also the first person view scenes where Karl Urban is seen killing the monsters with a machine gun and a chainsaw, yes a chainsaw will make any fans of pointless action and the games cheer for more.

The Rock as Sarge is absolutely perfect! i just couldn't imagine Karl Urban doing a better job then The Rock when it comes to Sarge. Although many have branded this film ""Resident Evil in Space"" and yeah it is but that doesn't subtract from the film at all. The 1st person scene was especially pulled off well and will give you some giggles (c'mon who didn't laugh?).The Score is absolutely awesome and sets the atmosphere perfectly! too me this film had an old school 80's horror feel to it which i felt made it that more enjoyable (we got lots of uncensored over the top gore which now we don't get enough of). Overall don't judge this movie till you see it because it is a lot better then people rate it unless your looking to find something thats a 100% identical too its source material (Doom 3) then i'd advise you to not watch this film because some of it has been completely rewritten from its original context hence no hell.

The well-polished first-person shooter sequence. And being that the entire sequence is presented uncut in the special features, this DVD should only cost $1 and be sold as a short film. Now, i myself have made crap..garbage even..and been in crap short films...but that was all very intentional crap & garbage. And the last short me and my friend made only cost approx. $40 to make. It's fine sometimes to throw away a few bucks to make cheap crap for kicks...but expensive crap is a different story. Movies like this (and there are many out there) have no excuse. It cost millions of dollars to make. You can't polish a turd. They totally didn't get what Doom is all about. This movie tried to act like it's cool, like it's the Fonz. ""Heyyyyyyyy!"" this movie sucks. Bad. The budget of this crap-fest could have helped a lot of starving and homeless people around the world. I think, in general, Hollywood needs to at least try to be creative again. It definitely wouldn't and shouldn't cost millions of dollars to make a Doom movie. Horrible script, horrible acting and on top of everything else, it's boring. I nearly fell asleep many times while trying to watch this piece of guano.

This is a pure made-for-fans-only and I would not recommend anyone to have too much expectations.But if you like the game-genre kind of movie adaptations, Doom is very true to the feeling, scenery and in most parts characters and monsters.Without giving away any spoilers I would still like to say, YES you do get to see some true game POV scenes that is a must when making a movie about a game that maybe was the biggest part of the rise of this kind of FPS POV games as we see them today.If you need to know what the synopsis is about, just google for the game or read it here on IMDB.

That was me watching DOOM while every other patron as entranced by SAW II (which I doubt I'd so much as touch, not cause I'm scared of it, but because it looks rather unintelligent, as the first seemed as well). But that's neither here nor there. For the most part, I expected DOOM to not be the perfect port it wasn't destined to be, seeing as I've seen different game-to-movie ports that haven't been the truest to the original mold, where they've either been rather entertaining (Super Mario Bros., Mortal Kombat) or atrocities (Street Fighter). But my being a rather big DOOM game fan collided with my already present cynicism, so I entered the theater with some mixed hopes. The end result? Not as bad as I anticipated. Alright, once again, it's not the direct game-to-movie port, but like I did with Mario Bros., Mortal Kombat, and Resident Evil, I took that away and tried to see the movie for what it was. It did remind me quite a bit of the aforementioned Resident Evil, it terms of production value and how the end product came out. Sure, the acting was a bit under-the-weather, and some of the special effects could have been tweaked up (though they were not NEARLY as hackneyed as Resident Evil's were), but as a whole, I found the movie quick, action-packed, and pretty entertaining. The writers also get special props for the FPS scenes (which I thought were REALLY cool and as close to the games as it can get, more-so than the previously mentioned movies), and whatever twists were thrown in for added entertainment. So in the end, I really enjoyed the movie for what it was, rather than what it should have been.

In fact, the movie has little to do with the demonic and yes sometimes satanistic nature that is presented in the games.

338,B_a_S_t_A_r_D,Where is the hell?,3,5 March 2006,"To cut a long story short, ""Doom"" is an extremely disappointing movie. As a huge fan of the games I could hardly wait to see the film. In all honesty, the track record of disappointing video game movies (Tomb Raider, Mario Brothers, Resident Evil) did put me in a lot of doubt and, upon seeing the movie, justified that ""Doom"" was just another in a long line of quick money making spin-offs. Fans of the game can not possibly like this film. First of all, one of the unique selling points of the game is the theme of hell and extreme, constant violence. Hell, other than in the occasional cheesy one liner (""go to hell"" and the like), is a complete no show. Violence and nightmarish imagery is sparse. There are no dystopian flaming skies and deserted, blackened cities, no twenty - foot demonic pentagrams, no bloodied, impaled corpses lining the corridors. Overall, this movie does not look or feel like Doom. Once you've gotten over the completely misinterpreted mise en scene and uninspired set piece (a small laboratory full of white lab coated doctors instead of the fiery shores of hell?), there is the huge problem of the script and acting. Neither benefits the other, and the fact that more than one person ""wrote"" this film is utterly embarrassing. Casting the Rock in any move is a mistake from the outset. He can't act. His awful one liners are more horrifying than the ""Zombies"". Speaking of which, the fact that Doom is focused more on the Zombie threat than the obscure demons of the game is another disappointment. This is where it begins to feel like another Resident Evil movie. With the game there was a gallery of brilliantly detailed, terrifying mutants and demons that would really have put a shock or two into the movie. The only ones that feature are the Imp (quite rightly, but where are the trademark fireballs?) and the Pinky demon. Perhaps the writers could argue that they are trying to do something different by almost alienating the film from the game series, but different is something Doom is not. It is just a Zombie movie without the wit or originality of a George A Romero film. There are a small number of saving graces in ""Doom"", the most obvious being the first person sequence, which was the only time throughout the film that I felt like I was watching ""Doom"", though they could have done more with it. The inclusion of the aforementioned demons, the BFG 9000 and the chainsaw are also much welcomed. Unfortunately, these things do not save a Doomed film. The unoriginal script, wooden acting and severe miscasting, along with the non existence of a classic set piece prevent this film from being able to hold a torch to the Doom game series.

What bugs me is that I can't figure out WHY they did these changes. A big part of the DOOM experience is the ""Hell-is-loose"" storyline along with the isolation of being alone on an alien planet, hunted by demons. The game Doom 3 is by far the scariest game I've ever played. In fact it's scarier than any movie I can think of too...All of that is lost in the movie due to the plot changes. What is left is an OK action flick with some ""Doomish"" elements to it. As an action movie it is OK, but it is NOT Doom! Another thing that is quite annoying is that this unknown threat is supposed to be dealt with by a single squad of so-called elite soldiers. Now this squad of soldiers aren't very convincing as elite troops. Mostly they act as whining morons, and when the dirt hits the fan they split up so the demons can get to them easier - plus their CO suddenly and inexplicably turns psycho and becomes the main villain. Again - that is NOT Doom! Compare this group of undisciplined soldiers to the squad of space marines in ""Aliens"" and you really want to throw the writers in a pit along with some demons... In ""Aliens"" the marines are very well portrayed as an experienced fighting force full of bravado, who gets whipped anyway since they have no idea what they are up against. Maybe it's unfair to compare Doom with that masterpiece, I don't know, but Doom would have been more convincing if the soldiers had actually acted like soldiers.So - imagine this movie done by James Cameron instead! Now that would have been something...Also, I would have liked to see the BFG get to better use! Still, Doom is an OK sci-fi action flick - see it and then play Doom 3 to get the REAL feeling!",Doom
340,penguin847,It was pretty good,8,17 April 2006,"I have seen this movie with a bunch of my buddies, and we were all into it (despite a few comments going back and forth about the acting) we loved it But we seemed to be laughing half the time because of some moments of bad acting and the overuse of the F-word. This is a pretty violent movie with some blood, but has nothing to crazy. The one thing that makes this the best video game to movie transition is the 5 minute first person sequence (which has some of the most blood in the movie.) Overall this movie was good not great.The acting could have been better and it could fill in some plot holes,but otherwise it's a very good movie.",Doom

I mean, the games were great, and in truth there HAVE been some half decent movies based on video games recently. Granted, both the Mortal Kombat films were absolutely shocking. But seriously, can you truly say that you disliked Resident Evil? Okay, so the storyline was sh#t. So the acting was sh#t. Who cares. They were enjoyable movies, if only for the chance to stare at Milla Jovovich in skimpy clothes.But man, Doom was shocking. They tried the same sh#t with a different movie, and if I'd seen this unenjoyable zombie flick prior to every other George Romero movie I've seen, and a whole heap of others besides, then maybe I might have enjoyed it.

342,pyramidhead84,Not actually about Doom,5,6 April 2007,"I watched this movie long after it had been released to DVD and had heard quite a few scathing reviews. I went into this with low expectations and was only mildly surprised when it was all said and done. I'm a new fan of the Doom series, and have only actually played the first part of Doom 3 to completion. What I noticed first off is that the movie has little to do with the game, aside from monster design and the title itself. Personally, I think if you're going to do a movie based off a game, you should probably stick as closely to the source material as possible, and this movie shot that concept down, stomped on it, then threw it out the air-lock to suffocate on the barren surface of Mars.I thought the acting as done well, and the setting looked as close to the game as one could hope. There were a bunch of slight references to the games, and the monsters themselves looked exactly like their game counterparts, but the story itself is almost completely different. I'm not even that versed in the canon of the Doom games and I could tell this movie had nothing whatsoever to do with them. All through the first half of the film, I was waiting for the one action sequence that would turn the whole movie around for me. When that sequence came, I was cringing. While trying to pay homage to the first person shooter, they managed to create the worst looking first person sequence in movie and gaming history. It doesn't even come close to simulating the feel of the games and it definitely cannot stand on it's own as a viable cinematic technique. Think cheap light-gun carnival ride.Basically, the movie was alright. It's your basic sci-fi action flick with mutants and aliens, but it simply doesn't live up to it's name as a valid Doom story.",Doom
343,punisher6191,One of the greatest movies ever!!!!,5,11 December 2006,"OK, I love this movie!!!!!!!!!! yes OK, it doesn't really have that much of a plot. Something is wrong with the research base on Mars, so a team lead by The Rock is sent in to investigate to find out that there are a bunch of crazy killing monsters. But it was a lot of fun. The acting was good, the special effects were excellent, and the action was awesome!!! There is only one problem I had with this movie. It is based on the popular game series ""Doom"", but they changed the plot a little. Instead of having demons from Hell on the planet, like in the game, it was a biological experiment gone wrong. I think they should have gone with the original plot, but that wasn't enough to knock it down a vote. It was still amazing and the plot did work. If you want to see The Rock killing a tons of monsters with lots of gore and just have fun, definitely see this movie!!!!!",Doom
344,cobradvs,Worth Your Time,7,20 January 2008,"Pretty descent movie, good action, pretty good actors, and a awesome franchise. First off their are several differences between the movie and the video game (by the way the video game gets a 10/10). In the movie there are genetically engineered monsters, and in the video game the ""monsters"" are demons, I though this was a little bit of a let down, considering demons are fall better into the story. In the video game Doom 3, UAC is experimenting with teleportation technology, but in the movie it seems that they are just exploring mars and the bones of a humanoid they found.I feel that by leaving out the demons and putting in the genetic monsters was a mistake, but nonetheless you still get that same scary feel. Oh, and I thing the FPS (first person shooter) portion of the film was pretty cool.OK, as far as the monsters go, they're pretty true to the game. And all of the classics are here. You've got the Imp, the Hellknight, and pinky. I think instead of the ending being a face off between Sarge and Reaper, it should have been a battle where the two of them face off against the Cyberdemon, but in the end Reaper and his sister still get out alive.Finally, I think if they were to make Doom 2, the should change the monsters to demons, and have the Cyberdemon in the ending.",Doom
345,lastostadas,Doom goes loose,5,15 March 2010,"AS I finished watching this film I just felt teared apart into two halves. The first half of mine was just thrilled with the action and the graphic (really graphic) violence this movie punches at you (just think that some scenes considered too violent had to be deleted). And the other half? Well, I was a bit disappointed, maybe because I was expecting something more filmy and less video-gamish, not story depth or character development,it's an action flick after all, but just a not all that bad story and a bit of variety. Maybe I was pushing this movie too much over the edge.Just think about Resident Evil with all its violence, story and characters, mixed up with 2001:A Space Odissey, and that's what you'll get, taking out the depth and plot and classical music score of the latter. Sometimes even, you'll forget this movie is taking place on Mars, and not on Earth, as many reviewers have pointed out, because it's all interiors, corridors, labs and sewers. Some characters even just seem to vanish into thin air, you just have to assume they're dead or have been converted into demon-like monsters.Surprisingly enough there is no plot in this movie. But this is just something to expect coming from a video-game. The good thing is that if you're eager for action, horror, insane madness and forgettable lines this is your movie. But if you expect this flick to deliver something else such as a compelling story or at least a bearable ending and a reasonable plot, this is just not the kind of film you'd like to watch.",Doom
346,Aiwaz69,Mediocre Action Flick,6,11 February 2006,"Doom, based on the video game, has a lot of action, guns, and blood, but it's very average and unoriginal. Much of the movie's plot and tone has been seen before in numerous other space or zombie flicks, plus the monster effects are not very good. The game Doom had a plot involving Hell, but this movie deals with a virus (again, unoriginal) that turns people into zombies and monsters (though the movie does suggest the virus releases the ""inward demons"" inside the people), transforming the movie into an inferior Aliens rip-off. The characters are uninteresting and unoriginal, plus the story (or lack there of) is filled with mistakes (the human genome has already been mapped) and not consistent (TheRock's characters starts off as a decent guy then suddenly, with no warning, is a uncompassionate killing jerk) Having said that, the movie does offer plenty of fast-pace action, a good deal of blood and a nice FPS-mood that does add something original to an unoriginal story. This does help tilt the balance for me to a more favorable rating. 6 out of 10 stars.",Doom
347,blueavenger,This film should not have been called DooM,3,8 November 2005,"Echoing what others have said, this film should not have been called DooM. It had nothing to do with the original game in tone or spirit. I can't comment on it's similarities to Doom 3 as I have not played it, but Doom was a classic filled with stunning imagery: skin stretched across walls, rivers of blood, Greek columns and temples, amazing technology... None of it featured in the film. This was basically a sub-standard retread of Aliens (which WAS a great film) with some poorly defined characters, predictable deaths, under-developed sets (when in doubt, just turn the lights down), few thrills or shocks and a boring final conflict. Only Karl Urban came away with merit points for a reasonably affecting performance (The Rock started off okay, and I like the guy, but his descent into psychosis was unconvincing and unexplained). To have done DooM justice would have needed a far, far larger budget ($ 100+ Million?), with a better script, better actors, an actual story (intead of an out-of-date and tired man-messes-with-science parable), and a talented, visionary director who could capture the dark, arcane vision of hell. Very, very disappointing. ID sold out. This should have been called 'Demons of Mars' or something and then people like me who loved the computer game wouldn't have wasted their money in the hope that there was something worth watching here!",Doom

But it was still an awesome movie. I foresee a franchise since we never really get to see if everything is OK at the end :P But the storyline changes didn't take away from the overall experience of DOOM. I thought the movie was awesome.And that 5 minute FPS scene kick ass!If you haven't seen or played any of the DOOM video games then expect a mix of Resident Evil meets Aliens for this movie. It does a great job at being a fast paced Sci-Fi action movie even without the video game background.I would recommend this movie to any action/scifi movie buff. Good Stuff!,Doom
349,Particle-X,Prototypical Bad Movie for Spoiled Boys,2,8 November 2006,"sorry for my maybe rough tone, but i wonder sometimes what brain state is necessary to love a movie like this? OK... i love video games, especially 1st person shooters that push the envelope of what is possible to simulate on a PC screen. in a game it's all about immersion and fooling your poor brain into stress :-) a good storyline in a game supports this effect. now... doing a movie script is something totally different, because here the viewer is in a more passive position. what works in the game does not work on film. i really thought that this knowledge is common sense now, but... shock! one of the poorest story lines ever written! i somehow imagine totally idiotic kids that get excited about the fact that they can actually comprehend a storyline in a movie for the first time! duh! an experiment went wrong, mutants, space marines, like Alien never happened. and to top it a little, we also have, as a bonus, the totally redundant ""1st person sequence"". if this turns you on, you probably can't be helped anymore.and to you the ""commenteers"": which synapses misfired when you came up with a sentence like: ""the special effects in the movie are better than in the game""? maybe you could write an essay on the differences between plastic apples and real apples. i realize that my comment isn't really helpful to describe the movie, but all i can say is: BAAAAAD...",Doom

What kind of crap is that? The characters were so crappy and boring. There were all these mentally unstable marines and that doctor who new a lot but didn't tell them anything for no reason at all. Actually, she might have had a reason, but I was either too busy laughing or trying to figure out any one of the previous parts of the story that made little or no sense.The best part of the movie is when the guy becomes super-human (because of a DNA alteration which shouldn't affect him anyway) and they start showing the first person mode and he's fighting the guy (who is a now a giant pig or something like that) in the wheelchair with a chainsaw (the pig is in a wheelchair, not the superhuman guy). At least then, there is no pretense about having a plot or good characters. It's just violence which exists for some reason or another. It's awesome. I think they should have taken out the other 95 minutes of the movie.At any rate, I would very much recommend this movie if you have run out of other things to do. I mean ANYTHING ELSE.

351,SnakeEclipse,"good enough to be a fun movie, but not enough justice to the game.",5,23 October 2005,"OK, where must I begin. I might as well point out the bad things first in respect to the game. Now, what the hell was with the whole 24th chromosome thing? Makes sense to me, yes. However, what the hell happened to, well, HELL? These monsters in the movie were respectable enough to relate to the imps and hell knights in the game, but WHERE THE HELL ARE THE FIRE AND PLAMSA BALLS?! Where are the flying lost souls? Where are the CACODEMONS? where's the F**kin demon lord and spider demon for crying out loud. Maybe I'm being a little vain and asking for too much, but the monsters in the game were different breeds, and all came from hell, not mutated. The whole plot was actually somewhat too similar to Resident Evil. It p*s*e* me off. They completely abandoned all that the game was based on plot wise.Now, as for the characters, I'm glad that they made it a team effort in this, and the characters were funny at times, but they seemed so underdone, except for of course, Reaper and Sarge, even Rosamund Pike couldn't add to anything in the film. I know I'm being picky, but blood and guts game? One man fighting to stop hell (or team effort)? Hello?The good things were that they stayed on Mars, they had the BFG in it, but it was so underused. I think the highlight of it was the first person thing, which I feel quite gypped on because of the short amount of time that we see it. I feel like they just put it in there for the game fans so they'd have their glory, and I am a die hard doom fan, but i feel somewhat insulted by it. They have had plenty of technology available to them to make this so much better, but they didn't use what they could've had available to them. Maybe if ID worked with them on it, it wouldn't have been such a disappointment, but this was just insulting to us gamers once again. however, a SMALL improvement when it comes to other VG movies. The action was however enjoyable, and the fight at the end made it fun, but I almost felt like Rock had to do it to show off that he still has his smack-down glory.

352,ethan-b-uk,"Quite good as a mindless shoot-em-up fun movie, inspired by but not based on the Doom PC game",7,9 December 2005,"OK, so this is a movie, not a PC game. There are many people who have never played Doom or Quake etc, or who've played it but didn't like it. This movie has to 'work' as a movie, the games the posters and the T-shirts are already out there.As has been pointed out, this movie does bear an *awfully* strong resemblance to Resident Evil (the movie), not the computer game which was written years (1996) after Doom the computer game (1993), but with bigger monsters, and bigger guns. But then Doom's reason for existence as a game was as the best game for any computer with the best immersive graphics and was a mindless 'if it moves, kill it' blast-em-up, to the beat of a heavy, zany rock music soundtrack. Doom didn't really have a plot which would work as a movie, but as a blast-em-up game it didn't need to have. It does need to have a halfway plausible plot if it's going to become a movie, however.They have modified the plot slightly from the game, but the basic spirit is there, albeit a little diluted.I did find the movie a little slow and wordy at times, I was expecting a non-stop rush of evil monsters almost from the word go. I scarcely felt the overriding sense of being totally enclosed with little chance of escape, surrounded by deadly evil, that was a component of the game - probably because there was too much chatter. The movie was given more plot (and dialogue) than it strictly speaking needed, I think.The actors gave very creditable performances on the whole, with no-one standing out as being particularly hammy - annoying maybe - as part of their 'character', but no-one shining as giving an outstanding performance either.There was only a short period towards the end of the movie where there was a real sense of this being the movie of the game - it's fun while it lasts, although the music could have been a little louder in the mix!If you fancy a not half bad part chatter part blast-em-up movie with some half decent special effects it's absolutely worth watching. I enjoyed it, but felt that it should have been a bit faster-paced.It is very similar to the Resident Evil movie, overall I'd say probably not as good, but it's not exactly the same, and it's not as grim and foreboding somehow. It's a bit John Carpenter-ish, although I think he would have done a slightly better job of it, it doesn't stand out as needing to be a whole lot better - it's OK as it stands.

I'll admit Karl Urban did a good job with a crappy script and the horror parts in the beginning were good enough. Now the story is complete crap and is hard to even describe. All I can say is these marines are sent to see this problem thats going on in this facility. There is much more stupid stuff to the story though that includes terrible jokes, hand to hand fighting sequences, and for the most part god awful acting. The terrible acting in a strong sense is lead by The Rock's performance which is terrible. He says the worst lines as well, but thats not to say many of the other characters don't as well. The FPS sequence is about five minutes long give or take and if you watch the film really didn't fit into the ninety minutes in the film. This film would have been much better if fifteen minutes were taken out.

The plot is a mix between ""Alien"" and ""Dawn of the dead"".The cast includes well respected actors Rosamund pike ( die another day ) and Karl urban ( lord of the rings ) and heavyweight fledging credible action star The Rock ( Scorpion king ). So why did it give me such a headache? because it was bad.The acting was poor, except for urban who was better then the material. The sets looked like something out of the syndicated show ""Farscape"". I couldn't tell the soldiers apart because their roles were so underdeveloped and acting so forced. The action sequences were the main reason i wanted to watch the film, and they were all pretty cheap. The coolest visual effect, was too short and too late in the movie. Honestly, after about 50 minutes, i was rooting for the mutants.This movie tried to squeeze 3-4 movie clichés together ( Friend turn foe, soldiers gets killed one by one, mysterious enemy/disease, and only 1 man can stop the evil blah blah ) and give it a title.

357,DukeOfMarshall,Unrealistic and Out of Character,1,9 September 2007,"This movie was definitely out of context with the story line of the original game. In the movie the creatures come about because of genetic tampering. Something that's been done countless times in movies over the years. Wow, what a surprise. In the game the creatures came about because of opening a gate to hell. So it's really unlike the story line of the game. As a fan of the game itself I found this movie ridiculous as pertains to the game.The other thing that ruined this movie is the military aspect of the reaction team. The ""Sarge"" has a tattoo that reads ""Semper Fi"" across his back which is the US Marine Corps motto. During the movie he refers to himself and his team as ""soldiers"". Soldier is a term for the Army and not for the Marine Corps. A Marine would never refer to himself or fellow Marines as ""soldiers"", but rather as ""marines"". Also, some of the dialect used by the military personnel in the movie is absolutely ridiculous and would never be used by actual military members. This is apparent when you take into account that the military adviser used for this film was not a member of the American military even though the members portrayed in the movie were supposed to be American military.

358,erv-7,A disappointment (contain spoilers),3,26 March 2008,"I've watched this movie quite some time ago, and for me this this was a complete disappointment, since I loved Doom (1,2, not Doom 3, which in my opinion was fault) as a game. The main part of Doom as a game was a Hell Portal, which doesn't exist in a movie. Since there is no hell portal, there is no hellish reality, no demonic invasion and all movie is reduced to shooting mutated creatures (that just look similar to Doom 3 monsters, but except that, have nothing to do with the game world) in a bunch of closed rooms. I personally believe that hell portal concept that was in original Doom - with the possibility of an endless hordes of demons invading earth - is scarier or more apocalyptic that mutated or biologically-engineered creatures.As a game, i believe, Doom (1,2) had a potential of being a material for a great movie - the game had a wonderful atmosphere of being alone with no place to run, no place to hide, and no hope for help - just you and your enemies, somewhere far from home, and the only choice is either to fight or die. That was the right ""Doom"" atmosphere, and unfortunately, this atmosphere didn't make it into neither Doom 3 nor Doom: the movie. The film I saw was not scary, and was barely interesting (although in last minutes it become better).I'm giving to movie a ""3"", not ""1"" because movie was not a complete fault. All could have been worse (see ""Postal"" movie for an example on how to totally spoil game idea). Also, it was interesting to see Doom 3 props in a movie (some of equipment is very nicely copied from those used in game) it is shame, thought, that BFG looks different. The final battle was somewhat interesting to see.The mentions of Carmack causes a smile for split-second, but nothing more. The ""3D action"" scene, to my taste - is a really bad joke, since the main hellishly-demonic concept was thrown out. Also there are not enough enemies for that scene to be truly ""Doom""-like. I still remember places in original Doom (1,2) where a dozen (or twenty) of imps attacks you at once just to be wiped out with a single BFG shot (*Sigh*). After that any scene with monsters in ""Doom the movie"" is just boring.I also suspect that filmmakers didn't really love game and didn't play or complete whole game series. It looks like the scenery was written based on only a brief Doom 3 impression. Why else they could have thrown hell portal and demons away just to replace them with biological monsters?Conclusion: If you are a Doom 1,2 game fan - do not watch this video, it has hardly something to do with the game and you'll be probably disappointed with it. If you liked Doom 3 then you *might* like this movie, although differences with the game story will still surprise you. If you've never played Doom as a game, or didn't like it as a game, there is a chance that you'll like this movie, since it is not totally awful, it just not what the game was about.",Doom

I got to admit: the weapons are cool and all that but there was so much suspense that they forgot to give it an excellent storyline and ""man vs alien/demon/mutant"" kind of battle; that would be really exciting. The looks of the Doom creatures are amazing, but their capabilities are very far from the game. I mean; in the game, those monsters can throw fire balls, stick to walls, and very agile. Whereas these movie ones can't even perform a cartwheel maneuver. And I never quite understand why Sarge(The Rock) has gone totally INSANE! I didn't really liked the ending too. There should be a lone surviving Hell Knight to continue the terror. It's a pity it only grossed over 50 million dollars. If they will make a sequel, I hope it could gross over 150 million.

Neither did The Rock save the movie. This role is not for him. Still, there were few jokes that I liked.They still brought many things from the game. The first person-shooter part was pretty fun and I liked that brought the BFG gun to the movie.The story is not wide, many things were left unclear.

361,bigelowam,Uwe Boll this is not,8,12 April 2008,"Okay, so Doom was not the ""perfect"" movie. But I don't think anyone was expecting too much out of this, including myself. What the movie does excel at, though, is providing an entertaining thrill ride full of mindless action and blood-thirsty monsters. The Rock was perfect for the role of Sarge and Karl Urban actually surprised me with his, for the most part, great portrayal of Reaper. The supporting cast was a little weak sometimes, but overall they helped the movie move along. Anyone who knows the video game knows the first person shooter point of view. Near the very end of the movie, the movie switches to first person shooter view of Reaper while he searches for his sister. Many people have criticized this scene as dumb and pointless. Actually, if that scene weren't in the movie, I don't think it would have been a legitimate ""Doom"" movie. I thought the scene was great and the movie would have been incomplete without it. Lastly, I applaud the director, Mr. Andrzej Bartkowiak, for making an actually enjoyable and entertaining movie based off of a video game. For years, video game fans have been waiting for a worthy video game movie. However, many have failed, including one Uwe Boll. This movie, though, succeeds at where Mr. Boll fails: a legitimate plot that stays mostly true to the video game and developed characters you don't want to kill (Well, at least not all of them). Anyone who is a fan of the video game ""Doom"" or any other video game should not be ashamed of this movie and should give this a look. I hope Uwe Boll learned a few things from this and I look forward to Mr. Bartkowiak's future projects. 8/10",Doom

In the original Doom it was scary because these creatures came directly from Hell with a portal. And the Rock shouldn't be the villain in this story.",Doom
363,CrazyBomber,What's up with the high grades? Is this the GAME they're reviewing?...,3,21 December 2005,"Alright, I get it. No-one who played Doom can rate this ""film"" more than 5, at best. Then again, why the hell would anyone rate it more than that anyway?Seriously, my girlfriend laughed all the way through the film. How scary is that?So, let's start with the bad points: The story sucked, sucks, and will always suck as long as there's a RESIDENT EVIL, EVIL DEAD, and countless other zombie pictures around.The characters were... forgettable, at best. Ridiculous is a praise to what that cast showed on screen.Pinky was a daemon in the game. It was called pinkie daemon because it was a pink daemon. It wasn't pretty, and had a huge mouth. In Doom3, the new version, they decided to make the pinkie daemon without pink, uglier, scarier, and with cyborg legs. Seemed pretty cool, I have to admit. But why on earth would anyone think of calling a GUY... PINKY! just to have him transformed into the ""pinkie"" daemon... he didn't wear pink! there was NO REASON for him to be called pinkie! What the hell is wrong with the script writers these days? Even if there was a reason, it still plain sucks. It was never meant to be that way.So, we have a movie based on Doom (whose major points are HELL, DEAMONS, TELEPORTERS) which has NOTHING based on the game? What, the monsters looked alike? Yep, that's pretty much all the similarities, if we forget about UAC.Oh, the UAC itself. UAC stands for Union Aerospace Corporation. That name compels you to think the UAC is either a military corporation or a scientific research corporation. Actually, it's both. In the game, they were researching teleporters. Here they're researching a... what?... virus?? Should have changed the name to Union Biologic Corporation or something.OK, OK, that's all the bashing for today. Now, the good parts:OK, that settles it. On to the conclusion. In short, this movie sucks. The only interesting part comes 5 minutes before the end. And that's kinda ridiculous too. It makes no justice to the games.Unlike what many people say, Doom does have a good, interesting story which could be exploited to make a very good and scary movie. Of course, why spend more braincells doing something GOOD when you can do a movie like this and still get the money? Oh... they didn't get the money... suits them right!3/10 is more than it deserves, honest. And it's only because of the monsters.PLEASE DON'T RUIN THE GAME AGAIN, WITH A SEQUEL! that's all I ask.",Doom

It was the sole reason that I moved from an Amiga to a PC, however good the Amiga games machine was in its day.Like many reviewers here, I found the movie okay for sure, and The Rock can carry a movie despite its shortcomings. It had decent amount of one-liners, action, and the first person perspective section was well done.However, I'm still waiting for someone to produce a movie based on the game which is faithful to the content of the game itself.",Doom

Throw in plenty of good-selling violence, borrow a bit from Matrix towards the end, and don't forget the opportunity for a story full of logical flaws without the risk of anyone bothering, this movie simply commanded to be done.

Sometimes I don't want to have to follow the plot or think too hard while doing so. So for that purpose it is a great movie. The FPS scene was enjoyable. For awhile there I thought I was watching a zombie movie. It's not a good movie if you take it seriously or have high expectations..

368,Philip-12,The Best VG to Film Yet,7,31 October 2005,"This film was a pleasant surprise. It is the best VG to film effort yet. It was well written and well executed. That is not to say there couldn't have been improvement, but it was well done. The Rock showed great perception in taking on the role of Sarge instead of the John Grimm character. In a film like this, he is a great supporting character, albeit a major one, and probably the major draw, but for him it worked nicely. The name tie-ins were inventive as was the transport method. The movie could have easily been longer (if the content quality were maintained). Specifically the beginning sequences and a more thorough background. Usually (and in this case) that is a compliment in that the film seemed to go by quickly. Very enjoyable. I understand why this movie must be R rated but I think it restricted the audience since many of the players under 18 may not have been able to see it (unless their parents took them).",Doom
369,terryhicks18,It really saddens me,3,21 October 2006,"(sigh) I just don't understand why directors and producers and screenwriters can get away with some things. This movie was supposed to be based on the game Doom 3, but has no connection with it what so ever. Why did they destroy such potential for a great game-to-film adaptation? I'm starting to doubt whether game-to-film adaptations should be even made anymore, since directors like Uwe Boll and this dude (forget his name) get a hold of them. This film instead has been turned into a generic sci-fi thats instantly forgettable, and by the way, that first person scene was crap, it doesn't work and never should be used again.",Doom

Its just a great sci-fi scientific thriller were you have no idea whats coming up next. sadly it sometimes deals with ""stuff"" (nothing horrid or nothing) some viewers may find unorthodox (a.k.a the good old ""oh my god i cant believe that just happened, oh my good that crap should be illegal"" or quite possible the extremist ""my god i didn't know that existed"") still the film is just as awesome as the game which is just AMAZING. buy one, heck buy two.",Doom
372,danixdefcon5,"Hey, its DooM with an E(vil)-Virus!",9,25 November 2005,"Well, I have to begin with saying that the movie by itself was good. Despite going in a very different tangent than the Videogames (no hell, and well at least as far as I remember the teleport device was only in Phobos and Deimos, maybe Mars in Doom3 which I haven't played), the movie itself had a decent plot line.Hell, this is the FIRST damn science-experiment-gone-wrong movie where the quarantine procedures actually WORK! Olduvai Station is fully operational when the RRTS guys go in, it isn't overrun except well, the sector where all hell broke loose (no pun intended). Plus, when they find out there is something inhuman in the area, they do not hesitate. They evacuate the whole complex. Quick thinking! No shitty ""they got killed b/c some jackass didn't tell them to run in time"". (Though what happens later is independent from these decisions, ya know?) However, they could've kept most of the original storyline w/o having to totally keep the ""from hell"" explanation. The Doom Novelization books were 100% sci-fi, and used an interesting gimmick to explain this as ""genetically produced demons"", based on what the aliens knew humans were afraid of.But oh well, it was OK, even if there was no hell. Still would've liked the original Doom1 setting ... the Phobos and Deimos moons. Cause Phobos means FEAR and Deimos, TERROR. Now that is some setting!!!",Doom

The Cons: Even when you try not to think, as you really shouldn't with this kind of movie - There's a couple of gaping holes in the Doom storyboard space-time continuum. The blunders include: They must secure an area in an operational hi-tech facility, yet they never turn on the lights, unless to show the viewer something is not scary after all. This is the future, but they don't have infrared goggles. They discover hell on Mars, but they never once report back to the authorities or any commanding officers. And you never know why.You almost never know where any of the characters are, areas seem disjoint.

375,Dude_001,"Doom is inane, poorly written and badly acted, all of which would be forgivable if it were entertaining.",4,18 February 2009,"When a distress call from the colonized planet of Mars reaches earth, a team of space marines, lead by one Sarge( Dwyane ""The Rock"" Johnson)is sent to investigate the matter. What they find is... well, as you have probably guessed, not very pretty...To be honest, I am not a big DooM fan, though I have played the original once or twice. However from my experiences with the game, I have garnered enough to know this much; this movie ain't DooM. The plot of the game involved STRONG religious themes... if thats really the way to put it. The Doom film has none of that; instead we are treated to a very safe, ""Science gone haywire and creating evil creatures"" plot that has been done over and over since Mary Shelly penned Frankenstein way back in the day. But Frankenstien this ain't.A DooM movie should not have been hard to make: Guns, gore, creatures, and some more gore. Honestly, I don't think fans wanted great acting or a stellar script. DooM isn't a complex game: You point and shoot. This movie misses the mark. The creatures look great I will admit. But you rarely get a good view of them, as they are hidden in the dark. Now is there anything wrong with hiding the monster? Defintly not. But the monsters in the video game where never hidden. They were always shown in their full, gory, glory. The wide open action and chaos of the game is replaced with a bunch of marines walking down dark hallways and shooting nothing. Sure there were some decent action scenes,and some gory gags, but certainly not the level you would expect from the DooM movie. And sure, there are plenty of weapons, but we never really see them in action. I mean, this is DooM for crying out loud! I don't want to see one of the biggest guns in the movie fired only once- at a monkey!Okay, thats enough as to why this movie doesn't add up to a DooM movie, why does it fail as a movie? Well the acting is just bad. I mean, I'm no means a fan of ""The Rock"", and his performance here certainly doesn't change that. Quite simply , he is an entertainer that doesn't entertain. Rosamund Pike is forgettable as the screaming damsel. The only interesting performance was from Karl Urban, who did quite good with the material. The rest of the cast refrains from acting per say, they mainly point guns and quote terrible dialog. The script is inane, with halfway decent characterization, strange plot devices, and, as mentioned, some really bad dialog.So, what did I like about Doom? Well, as admitted, the creatures looked great. Some of the sets, be they research labs, dark hallways, sewers etc were quite impressive. I especially enjoyed the ""prison cell"" set. And the much talked about ""First-Person-Shooter"" scene at the end of the film was quite enjoyable and was executed very well, making this otherwise almost unbearable film watchable.Doom is inane, poorly written and badly acted, all of which would be forgivable if it were entertaining. I didn't expect anything great, I just wanted to have fun and be entertained, and Doom barely did that. If the first 90 minutes were as fun as the last 20, this could of been a pretty good flick.4/10",Doom
376,LarsKrebs,"Bad, but I'm not surprised...",3,25 March 2006,"Well, can't say that I'm surprised to how this movie turned out. A brief look at the cast, the plot summary and the other people involved didn't exactly made me expect any masterpiece. But anyway, I decided to rent it and here is what I got from watching ""Doom"": Somewhat expected acting-skills of everybody involved, not worse but definitely not better either. Fair enough CGI and special effects. Despite two screen writers, a terrible plot that brings absolutely nothing new to the genre, except a weird first person shooter scene that has won applause from some fans. Personally I think it was an idiotic move cinematically speaking. The movie totally lacks an introductory phase, and we are pulled directly into a rescue/reconnaissance-mission on a research facility on Mars without really getting to know any of the involved characters. Some people probably thinks that this is cool, but its definitely not how to make a good movie. And when the soldiers has nicknames like ""Destroyer"" and ""Reaper"", it doesn't exactly make you take the movie more seriously. Also, despite the missing introductory phase, the movie still is remarkably slow pacing. It takes forever before anybody begins getting killed and mutilated, and when they do, you don't really feel sorry at all because the characters weren't properly introduced.Finally, as I understood it anyway, the movie is supposed to be inspired by the classic video game that bears the same name. Turns out that the name is almost the only thing that they share. Except from a few misplaced references, I didn't catch the resemblance. If the initial idea was to bring the game to the screen, it could've been done much better.To sum up, ""Doom"" is a movie a good deal below average that I will definitely not watch again. But it fits kinda nicely into the growing pile of bad movies based on good video games. Apparently, and unfortunately, those two things are inseparable. Fair CGI and nice puppetry earns this movie three stars outta ten in my book. At most.",Doom
377,dezell6,DOOM - Avoid at all costs!,4,24 October 2005,"If your looking for a film packed with numbing fear and clever suspense, then avoid this cinematic travesty and rent Aliens, Predator, or Resident Evil instead. DOOM is the latest entry for the worst video game-turned-movie. Anytime one goes to see a movie of this genre, expectations are usually low, but you hold out to be amazed by a screenplay that will elevate the story to something multi-layered, engrossing, and surprising. DOOM is a failure at every turn. While DOOM barely glosses over the A-B-C's (Action, Background (Story), Characters), it does so as if it were developed by a 10 year old. This movie should have been called DUMB. It's truly sad in an action film where the only love interest is between brother and sister! The Rapid Response Tactical Squad - what a joke; a group of hardened Space Marines who aren't even packing night vision goggles! By the year 2145, shouldn't NVG technology should be more advanced - ocular implants maybe? If the marines are looking for a few good men, then how did they ever end up with this bunch of malcontent misfits? Between giving away their position to every monster on the station, to exhibiting masochistic behavior, planning dates with underage hermaphrodites, and massacre the very people they were sent to protect, when were these ""marines"" going to do their mission? Somehow there is an ancient race of humans on Mars that are so advanced that they cracked the code for DNA manipulation, yet they didn't discover how to write anything down! Not to mention intact and upright skeletal remains. What happened to the structural remnants of this advanced civilization? The screenplay writers apparently don't mind asking for the audience to remain blissfully ignorant while they rob you of your money that was wasted on such tripe.The FPS (First Person Shooter) scene was cool, but unfortunately this is the only element that was truly faithful to the game.The characters were standard fare, but either borderline insane or sadistic: Sarge - The Rock's acting performance was good, but unfortunately the direction for his character degenerated into a Mei Lei massacre Part II syndrome.Reaper - Boring. I always enjoy watching a manic depressant head-case with a conscience. He should keep his day job as a Necromonger.Duke - Not the brightest bulb in the pack, but he at least didn't die a sucker's death by being trapped in a nano-wall - he just got pulled through a metal grate instead. It was such a shame too because the burgeoning romance with Doc. Grimm was just about to blossom.Destroyer - Outside of carrying a big gun (barrowed from Predator) and having a fear of monkeys, I guess his only redeeming value is that he may have a future career as a wrestler.Goat - An ideal candidate for the psych ward. Has a problem with heresy but not with killing? I guess he's working his way slowly through the ten commandments in between his remedial reading classes and anger management counseling.Portman - How this psychopath made it through a screening process for anyone's military is a major question. Complete disregard for authority, bordering on mutiny. Lack of training - taking the time to leave your buddy just so that he could answer nature's call. I don't know about anyone else, but don't think that I'd be in the mood to take a dump anywhere near a place full of carnivorous non-friendlies.The Kid - An utterly useless crack head. How did he even make it through basic training, let alone become part of an elite special operations unit? Mac - what a waste of a character! Other than some grunts and about 2 lines of dialog Mac's death was pointless.Dr. Grimm - has to be either the most clueless or naive scientist on Mars.Basically, save yourself some time, money, and mental anguish and wait for the DVD rental  which should be out in time for Christmas.",Doom
378,EmilyApricot,A Fan Pleasung Sci Fi Thriller Horror Mix,8,3 April 2018,"DOOM presents the sci fi atmosphere of the beautiful UAC Mars station in DOOM 3 and the mystery of what is going on as well of the morals of dealing with it very well in the first half, and delivers gory action the game's fans expect in the second. DOOM 3 fans will be pleased by the references, but this can be a little hard to place in a genre. It is a bit tame for a horror or action movie, so I prefer to classify it as a thriller. Like what DOOM 3 did for the franchise, it is more about the sci fi atmosphere of the place and the mysteries surrounding it and how it might affect Earth and the people at the station. More stars if they had a little better effects and took us all the way to hell, tho. Kudos for placing a part of the sequence in the first person perspective like the game. Also, it is very faithful to the source material with the look and feel of the space station, teleporting, Pinkie the Cyberdemon, and issues with the Sarge. At first, I hated the Sarge's character development, but I also recognize it is the opportunity for the best acting in the film. Rosamund Pike also really acts her heart out in her role as sister to a marine and a devoted forensic scientist. She shows real passion and resolve in investigating the mystery, and striking shock and horror wnen it goes all wrong. She really carries the viewer from scene to scene and will help non gamers have a character to identify with. But, seriously, Karl Urban, Star Trek's ""I'm a doctor"" bones is doomguy ?

Again, I think people are selling the Rock short... he's quite talented... let the damn guy act!!!

I was sitting in the middle of the theatre and I thought the two people flanking me were going to lose it.

380,marttisarkia,Better than I was expecting,7,19 October 2005,"I saw the movie before it came to cinema, because I won the tickets to the fore-performance (shown few days before the first night performance). Anyway, the movie was much better made than I was expecting when I entered to the cinema. But why the movie was so good? There are several reasons for that. First of all, the movie is pretty loyal to the Doom games, especially to the latest one. The movie contains many monsters and some weapons from Doom games and the conclusion is simply great. The weapons looks and sounds fine. The other thing I liked about the movie was the cast. The Rock and Karl Urban are true professional actors with guns and they don't show their feelings too much. The movie included quite a lot blood and gore scenes but not too much. Too much or too little blood had spoiled the whole movie, I suppose. The shock effects were also pretty cool.Doom wasn't perfect movie because it included also some bad stuff. One of them was the clichés, but in other hand, I think that action movie isn't good action movie without clichés so they didn't bother me so much. I think The worst mistake was to add the first person camera scene to the movie. The FPS scene felt like some kind of pour simulator and it was confused and that brake the whole excitement for a while. In my opinion it could have worked far better if they had mixed several FPS scenes with the other action scenes. The soundtrack was terrible. The atmosphere of the movie suffered very much when background music was something like heavy metal all the time. I think the music had fit far better to the movie if it had contained something like Resident Evil contained (I don't mean that Slipknot track or any other metal tracks).Overall this movie was probably the best movie based on a video game. It was brutal, well acted and exciting experience.",Doom
381,dagen-2,There s only 1 thing I expected from Doom..,2,23 March 2006,"Doom is originally a Computer game.When anyone says doom, I think about pixels, green barrels of ooze standing around, those weird brownish monsters and a shotgun. Yeah, the opening scene of the first Doom game. Next thing I remember is the ending of the second Doom game. Big flying tomatoes with teeth, out to get you and an infinite amount of monsters, spawning every few seconds. A huge room with some weird huge stairs and .. Yeah, the last level.. Then there s also a twinge of Quake. The start of the original quake.. a hand gun and some fallen down walls.The only thing I expected from this movie was that it d be true to the Doom concept. I at least expected that Doom monster, the Doom 2 tomato, ..What did we get. It felt like a zombie film. The classical story of experiment gone wrong, everyone dead and trying to get at the living. Doom felt like a recycling of a Resident Evil scenario. Yet it deserves so much more! There were monsters in it, alright. And yes, I admit, they were doom monsters. But only from Doom 3! Why do I care? I grew up with this. If I think Doom, I think the aforementioned. Fair enough I d come to expect some of that stuff. Yet they chose to only incorporate Doom 3. Its sad, its a missed opportunity.And that quite sums this movie! A missed opportunity. They could get away with a lot, making a Doom movie. All we expected was a Gore fest in the world of Doom. Yet they weren't even able to live up to that. And We would still be forgiving if they d have made a movie based upon Doom with a Good scenario. But even that is crap.Oh.. & the end sequence, where you get the standard gun in hands view.. That was just cheap!

I do believe they could have done much more with this movie in having any real storyline like the 3rd game in the series provided.

It is a decent action film where you leave the theater reasonably satisfied.I thought the trailer made the movie look hokey -- the first person shooter scene looked bad, the guns talking seemed excessive and silly, and the jokes were bad. However, these same scenes fit in relatively nicely when you see the film in whole, and don't stick out like sore thumbs anymore.The story in the film strays some from the story used in the game, as many have said. However, the story was reasonably coherent and helped add a little more plot to a game that has almost none.Overall, not a bad film, but not something you will probably watch more than once.",Doom

385,deadlypen,Shoot The Writer(s),5,16 April 2006,"During the 1990's, a rumour was enthusiastically circulated that Arnold Schwarzenegger would portray the lone space marine at the heart of the familiar 'Doom' storyline. But that casting call made in heaven never materialised; the opportunity to make a 'Doom' movie at a time when both Arnie and the game were the hottest properties on the planet was lost.Now, years later on the coat tails of 'Doom 3', we are at last given Doom - The Movie. Sadly, the project has not matured like a fine wine. Instead, it seems to have gone stale. Ironically, thanks in no small part to the legacy of the Doom games, we have seen this kind of film rather a lot and a new entry in the genre has to be something really special if it is to have a hope of standing out. This movie is mediocre in just about every department - with the exception of the screenplay...and the screenplay is so poor that it is difficult to summon up a negative term which adequately describes its utter awfulness.The main characters are supposed to be an elite military task force - yet most of them suffer from such disturbing personality flaws that they would be deemed unfit to serve in the Catering Corps. Their leader has the mentality of a Nazi; the squad is also blessed with a psychopathic and masochistic religious maniac who cuts himself, a bi-sexual pervert who uses drugs, a melancholy depressive and a chemically-dependent coward who seems to have no understanding of even basic military skills. Fortunately, politically-correct viewers can watch without fear of damaging their sensitive nerves because the two black guys in the unit are both warm, caring and well-balanced individuals.I watched the so-called unrated extended version which allegedly contains scenes too strong to be included in the cinematic release. I am still trying to work out which parts of the movie were considered to be that scary. In my opinion, there was nothing in the unrated extended version which merited any kind of censorship. The monsters were not very impressive; the special effects were adequate but far from inspired. Doom is saved from being a complete disaster by the cast - they did a pretty good job, despite being chained to generally unrealistic characters.If you can buy the notion that a bunch of feeble-minded, coked up degenerates belong in the special forces (instead of a school for special needs), Doom provides a couple of hours of fairly average no-brains action.",Doom

Hard to make a movie from that.However Doom 3 came out before this movie and did a great job of padding out the original game with some story. Portals to hell, demons, horror and survival elements. If the movie followed this it could have been so much better. Instead we get some crap about genetics and good vs. evil.Take the movie for what it is, its a bit of fun and has it's moments.

387,jamyskis,A surprising amount of depth - but that still ain't much,7,11 November 2005,"I went into this film a bit closed minded, to be honest. I'd been looking forward to this film being released ever since it had been announced (almost a decade ago). Back then, I was not so picky about the sophistication about what films had to offer, and video game adaptations were still untested waters. Time has taught us since that by and large, video game adaptations haven't been particularly successful. Some blame it on the subject matter, but I would be inclined to blame it on inexperienced, or worse, incompetent directors.Bearing this in mind, Andrzej Bartkowiak, someone with considerably more experience in the field of action movies, was put to work on bringing Doom to the big screen. Having seen many negative reviews beforehand, I wasn't too hopeful. Having seen it however, it offers a surprising amount of depth and interest considering the subject at hand.At heart, Doom is a no-brainer action film. Those looking for deep emotions, complex story lines or even good acting may be better served elsewhere. The Rock's odd facial contortions (recognisable from his time in wrestling) don't do the credibility of the film any good.Fans of the games may also complain about the accuracy to the original source material. The game bears indeed little relation to any of the original games, especially not the first two, but then any attempt to replicate the almost non-existent storyline of the games would have been doomed to failure. I applaud the makers' decision to play a little more fast and loose with the storyline while keeping the general feel of Doom in tact.Throughout the first half of the film, you can't help but wonder if anything interesting is going to happen. In the second half, it does, and does so very well.The characters motivations and concerns are developed more fully to make them more interesting, even those *gasp* of Sarge, played by the Rock. While Dwayne Johnson's acting abilities are seriously doubtful, you never feel like he is being pushed beyond what he is capable of - playing a cold, mindless, killer - so he doesn't make himself look overly ridiculous. Goat, played by Ben Daniels, has some interesting quirks. The Kid, played by Al Weaver, shows that he may be a little too green for the mission, including letting his conscience get the better of him and putting him on a collision course with Sarge - with explosive results. Karl Urban and Rosamund Pike turn in solid performances, but their sibling relationship never seems particularly convincing - a fault more of the script than of the actors.Finally, the film seems to play classic horror clichés deliberately to comic effect. Pinky's fate, in particular, is highly amusing. The whole parodying of these clichés might seem like a cheap trick, but it works.It's no masterpiece, but Doom offers just enough beyond loud noises and cheap shocks to make this film worth paying out for.",Doom
388,echromlog,Sorry but I love this film,10,25 November 2019,This has to be one of my favourite films. Please bare in mind I do not know the original game story line as I was very young when I played the game. I can understand if gamers are annoyed. If you dont know the original story line you will enjoy this film. The action and suspens are great. I love that the film contains a first person shooting scean.,Doom
389,JemyM,"Part DOOM, part something else",6,4 February 2006,"*Warning* This review contains mild spoilers to the GAME, but not the movie.A dig in the nevada desert have found a portal to an ancient city on mars. Since then, scientists have struggled 20 years to find out more about the civilization that built the city and why they disappeared.Apparently they found something. In an emergency transmission sent from the science facility on mars a head scientist explains that there is a ""level 5 breach"" and quarantine procedures must be implemented immediately. A squad of elite soldiers are sent to the science facility on Mars to protect and retrieve property and make sure quarantine is kept. What they find is naturally more than they are trained and equipped for.This is another game that made it into the silver screen, and the DOOM franchise isn't exactly known for it's multi-depth story lines. This made me seek out and watch this movie with plenty of ice in my stomach, ready to forgive the producers for mistakes they made.And mistakes were made. The greatest one was of course to change the entire plot. As a gamer who put more value in story than the action, I would personally say that the DOOM3 storyline was better than the movies (completely changed) storyline. In the game the city plays a central role. In the movie you never leave the work areas, you never get to see the old ruins. The city isn't even mentioned beyond the intro. Beyond 2 <10 second scenes, you do not see the Mars exterior. You barely register that these events take place on Mars, not on earth. The artifacts that played a central role in the game is not mentioned or present in the movie. The entire ""Hell is loose"" plot was completely cut away, the events of the movie blamed onto something *COMPLETELY* different. The theme ""one man against hell"" became ""a few men and their issues"". The ghost of the little girl (one of the games scarier parts) did not make it to the move.DOOM3 was also a horror experience playing both on achluophobia (fear of darkness) and Monophobia (fear of being alone), this was an aspect missing in the movie where areas was lit and the characters was always going at least two and two. I almost think the movie could have been better if they hired less actors and put more money on storywriters.Another aspect completely gone is the ambient red tone of being on mars, something that could have added a more artistic flavor to the movie. Except for very short moments in the beginning of the movie you never see that these events in fact take place on mars.I was not happy to see the storyline almost completely changed and the horror downscaled to almost not scary at all with nothing better added to it. There are no deep questions asked here, no philosophical submessage to the audience to go home thinking about. This is a lighthearted actionmovie and that's it.The most faithful part (to the game) is the labs and the monsters. he developers who made the game gave the areas/monsters/weapons an unique design that wouldn't have been right to move away from. If you care zero about the plot, then yes this is DOOM.There's also the first person sequence in which we get to follow a series of events through the eyes of a soldier when he runs around and shoot monsters in corridors. It was fun, although I would say that it failed to capture me. I was mostly annoyed with the choice of music and it could have been more scary.I see some ways this movie could have been made better with the material it's based on, but I did not expect it. At least the action is well done. If you want 2 hours of entertainment that wont change your world, DOOM offers just that. If you do not watch many movies and want some extra quality when spending time on one, you can jump this one.Game-movies so far are between ""awful"" and ""ok"". This one was ""ok"".",Doom
390,moconnell-2,Best Video Game Movie to Date,7,21 October 2005,I just watched Doom a few hours ago and I must say that I enjoyed it more than I expected to. I am not a huge fan of the game but have played each of them and the makers of this film did a decent job in the adaptation. My biggest complaint about the film was the lack of creatures. It was almost more of a zombie movie than it was a creature movie. Also the fact that the creatures/zombies were biologically created instead of coming from hell was disappointing. Besides the Rock and Karl Urban for a cast of relative unknowns they did as good a job as one could expect in this type of film. In my opinion the Rock stole the show as he has a tendency to do with his magnetic personality. I don't want to give anything away but this is not the same Rock you have seen in his other movies! Overall Doom was a good action/sci-fi movie that you can just enjoy for an hour and a half.,Doom
391,dragonbite,Great Entertainment!,10,18 February 2006,"I loved this movie. I grew up playing the video game and I thought that it did a great job. They took some liberties with the movie, but so what this movie never stopped moving from the first shot. I also thought that the acting especially by the Rock was really quite impressive. He has shown me that he is more than just muscles and brawn and trying to squeeze a dollar out of his fame from the wrestling gig that trained him to be a pretty good actor. The other supporting actors and special effects in the movie were excellent! I don't want to give anything away but man the monsters and and the cgi in this flick are right up there with some other very good films. This movie is a lot like other gaming movies and it pulls from some classic thriller movies too. Its almost a combination of Resident Evil, Dawn of the dead, Aliens, and even Predator. So anyways this movie kept me in my seat and I got my money out of it. The DVD also is a great purchase, as it has many special effects and the sound is amazing too, if you have a home theater it will get its excercise.",Doom
392,PrimitiveScrewhead,WHERE WAS HELL??? This is NOT based on the video game.,1,31 January 2006,"I had the most unfortunate experience of viewing this wretched pile of filth that is a movie. A pitiful exercise in mindless, pathetic attempts of making a film that bears no agenda and zero substance.That movie is Doom.Now, as you the true hardcore fans know, Doom is apparently based on the highly successfully PC game. Although, I don't see how it is based. Nothing in the film reminded me of the video game. Now, Ultimate Doom was truly elaborate and epic in its scope - a lone Marine stalking around the shores of hell, fighting off his zombified team-mates, battling vicious imps, throwing rockets at hell knights and crushing spider-masterminds with the power of the BFG.What we got in this pathetic attempt was a hacked-up version of Doom 3 (which was a bloody great game by the way) that is a simple carbon-copy of Aliens (doesn't every film just use Aliens as a template for marines vs. otherworld anomalies?) with a few zombies and a generic alien that bares very little resemblance to an imp.NOW WHAT THE HELL WAS UP WITH THE CHARACTERS? Who was the hero? Who was the villain? Where was my trusty Doom Marine character? This film has problems. The Rock decides to turn against everyone for a reason not strong enough. ""Oh I have orders. We quarantine this area. Nothing else gets out."" Sounds to me like a poor attempt at an Albert Wesker. Yeah, this is just Resident Evil in space!!! Oh yeah it is, cos the demons (if you can all them that. More like mutated vegetables) are just the result of human research. Yes, this is NOT BASED ON THE DOOM Video game!! Oh of course, we get the much-hyped 'first-person' shot. But the problem is, it doesn't advance the story one bit. It feels incredibly out of place, especially when the pinky/dog-like demon comes out of nowhere, just thrown in as an afterthought. Why wasn't this the pinky-demon introduced beforehand? Why throw it in now. I TELL YOU WHY, BECAUSE THE DIRECTOR HASN'T GOT A DAMN CLUE ABOUT HIS CRAFT AND THE SCREENWRITER IS A HACK!!!! What the fupping heck was up with the ending? A lame attempt at a poor matrix-fight between Reaper and Sarge? Where was the showdown between the hardened marine and the cyberdemon? You might as well rename Doom the Movie to 'Paul W.S. Anderson' in space. I'm sure he directed this film under a different name.Once again, The Rock proves he should've stuck with wrestling. Sorry chump, you rocked the wrestling world (no pun intended) but the movies you keep signing yourself up to you are just poor imitations of Schwarzenegger's past. You'll never be him so quit it.WHERE WAS HELL? WHY WASN'T THE BFG GUN GIVEN AN AGENDA? IT SERVED NO PURPOSE IN THE STORY.No characters were fully developed. When people died, I didn't care because there were no attempts at giving them a personality - just generic garbage. Binary oppositions were deceptively unclear. Most characters acted in the same way i.e. scared. Sure this film was marketed as a quick, mindless action film but so was Commando, but unlike Doom the movie, Commando had a personality and was fun to watch. Doom the movie is garbage.The majority of the film is dark with hapless marines stalking around corridors. NO STORY.WHERE WAS HELL? Why are the character so bland? Is the Rock the false hero? If Reaper was meant to be the protagonist, then why was he only given more screen time toward the end? Again, this proves the screenwriter does not know how to structure characters around a narrative. Did you even go to film school? I think you better go back to the drawing board. Pick up William Goldman's book on screen writing, you might learn something.In conclusion, THIS FILM IS NOT BASED ON THE Video game!!!!!! GET THAT RIGHT THROUGH YOUR HEADS NOW!!!!!! One day in the near future, I'll adapt Doom into a movie. It'll be the most terrifying, awesome experience everyone will ever have. Mark my words...",Doom
393,Guga3D,You are DOOMed if you don't see this movie.,10,18 October 2005,"I was expecting Doom for quite long time, not because I really love the Doom series, but because I hoped for a decent movie based on a video game. I was quite worried that this movie would fail miserably on all fronts, since the first trailer released seemed quite lame, the duologue's also seemed rather unrealistic and quite badly played over by the actors. The second trailer - which contained the FPS scene - made me anticipate this movie again and it raised my expectations on the overall quality of the film. However, I still had some thoughts that Doom would be a mediocre movie - somewhere around 6.5 from 10 - but once I got the chance to view the film, I understood - it's great. It's wasn't what I expected, it was something more greater, something more admirable. I was surprised by the overall action flicks in the film, the FPS scene was fantastic, even though it was short, it still was gratifying. Everything else also seemed admirable, the sounds were perfect and scary, the plot was intriguing. Only thing that kept me giving it a sharp 9 would be rather flimsy duologue's in some scenes, but it wasn't poor enough to spoil the fun ride Doom delivers. Finishing off the review, I can say that this movie is must see for all Doom fans, and also to some people that know enjoy action blockbusters filled with superb amusement. 8/10",Doom
394,DarkSkyX,Resident Evil with a different cast,5,4 November 2005,"To sum up shortly: If you've seen Resident Evil (another movie based on a video game) you've seen this. Not to say it isn't worth watching (renting, as I'd advise against paying theaters prices to see it). Same plot - a biotech firm has something go bad, nobody knows what's going on, insert trigger happy soldiers, fight the mutated monsters and try to escape. ""The Rock"" 's character was a bit underdeveloped. It was hinted towards his take-orders-blindly attitude at the beginning, but this is taken the absolute extreme at the end, which I found was a bit too out of character. The effects were good, the acting of the 2 main characters (Urban and Pike) was as good as it could be given the genre of the movie. Towards the end you got about 5mins of video-game-style (1st person shooter) camera work. Don't expect much plot, which is basically ""Don't let any bad guys leave the research facility. Period."" Simply put, if you're the type of person that liked the video games ""Doom"" you'll like the movie. If you just watched Resident Evil, you'll suffer from severe deja vu.",Doom
395,dafuzzbudd,"GARBAGE, through and through",3,23 April 2009,"I've been staring at this movie on my DVR, for just over a year now. On a lonely night I decided to start it up, to see if this 'Doom' movie lived up to any expectation. The opening of the movie is something that has been copied from a generic sci-fi plot. Mercenaries are send to a plant to protect/figure out whatever strange event is happening.The middle of the movie starts to open up a plot that, while not original, keeps you planted for a conclusion.*At this point I decided to give my brain a rest and resumed the movie the following day*****SPOLER**** I picked up about 1h10m through, where the main merc (The Rock) kills the new recruit for rightfully questioning his order. I should go into this further to develop this point of disgust, but I feel like it already speaks for itself.The plot is meaningless, the direction reminds me of a generic 90's sitcom where there's lots of times the camera is plainly centered on the speaking character, or the camera is symmetrically planted on the actor with action.In sum, this movie has HORRIBLE cinematography, a stereotypical plot, average acting/cast, and no reason to watch. This movie was free for me to watch (Starz) and I could not finish it after (the Rock) shot his own squadron in the head for no valid reason. While racking my brain I've realized that this is the only movie I've ever turned off mid-way through. May everyone involved in the creation of the movie find careers elsewhere.",Doom
396,lvl3mines,"Great movie, even for non-gamers.",8,22 October 2005,"Doom turned out to be better than I was expecting.I played the original games, so naturally I was excited to see this movie. Although, my excitement was somewhat kept in check because I knew this movie could *easily* be turned into a weak 'Hollywood' piece of cardboard. It still is a little Hollywood, but not nearly as much as say, resident evil, AvP, etc..The cast was excellent (no Hollywood pretty boys here). The sets were thrilling. The story worked well. Mostly 'real' non-cgi monsters.Go see it. The worst thing that could happen is you will end up sitting by some overzealous gamers who want to narrate the entire movie (if you are close enough, just turn around and thwack them!).On a side note.. anyone else getting tired of the negative reviews on this site? People must just be extremely stupid. Most trailers, including this one, do a good job of depicting the type of movie it is representing. If anything, the movie should be better than you expect it to be based on the trailer... not worse. There are some exceptions, mostly with trailers that just don't tell you jack crap about the movie (history of violence, astronauts wife, American psycho, etc..) But come on... how could you watch the Doom trailer, enjoy it enough to go see the movie, then claim it's utter garbage? STUPIDITY.On another side note... the people on this site need to learn what a movie review is. You shouldn't be writing down an entire layout of the entire movie. No one (well, save for the stupid people on this site) would want to read about everything in the movie.

397,Hagard1956,Great Movie,9,27 October 2005,"This movie was REALLY GOOD. It was more of an ACTION/SCI-Fi movie than a Horror, but it was still really well done. The special effects here were LIFELIKE and I could not tell them from real aspects of the movie. Great ending, and OF ALL, THE BEGINNING WAS Awesome. The BFG was a really cool aspect of the movie, although it didn't get used too much. The Rock was good in this movie, but the best actor was Karl Urban, because he was in Chronicles Of Riddick. I would compare this movie to Pitch Black, like everyone else. This is a movie you should watch, especially if you have never played the video game(s) before.All in all, I give this a: 9/10",Doom

They are briefly presented, and then, tossed into action.The high points are: Even compared with Aliens(which i think, was the inspiration for the original video game) this movie stands up, on its own feet, and has enough creativity and punch to deliver the story until the end.It has its flaws too... And the one Flaw, that doesn't go away, is(and here go spoilers) Why they don't have a night vision? You see, everything is so hi tech, and the space marines don't have a green vision(like the Paris Hilton Video - hehehehehehe) All in all, it's a worth movie, and, a very well crafted piece of film, paving the way from video games to movies in a very good sense.",Doom

That's maybe the reason why i liked this movie, i didn't have any expectations because of the game and the plot of games wasn't familiar to me. This movie is almost as good as alien movies, but the cast isn't as good, the actor who does the best role is Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, as a rock face serge. The ending is kind of surprising not presumable, but they could have done it better. The coolest scene is the ""first person"" shoot scene, it's fresh idea not done in any other movies.If you have home theater system, hear me out, this movie's DVD version has an sensational soundtrack. I used the DTS mode, and the subwoofer was rocking! Also the surround mix was incredible. YOU CANT WATCH THIS FILM WITHOUT USING MULTICHANNEL HOME THEATER SYSTEM, the best creeps you get from this film aren't visual.

Taking a pot of potential and only using half of it. The plot was stupid, The Rock was terrible, and there was hardly and blood or gore! On the good side, the movie is a PERFECT popcorn movie (only reason it's getting a 6/10 from me) and the first-person sequence at the end of the film is pretty cool. And the few scenes with actual monster attacks instead aimless running around in the dark were pretty darn cool.There's a lot of untapped potential in the Doom franchise as far as movies go, and I hope someday another director realizes that potential and makes a great sequel to this movie.6/10 from zero-hour-ii",Doom
401,flatworlder,"Fantastic Action Movie, Doom Feel, Not the DOOM I hoped for",9,26 October 2005,"Doom, for what it was, was the best action movie I've seen since (ironically) The Rock, (the one with Nicholas Cage) The movie had almost perfect pacing, It didn't move so fast that you got lost, but it didn't move so slow that you got bored. The Marines put up a good fight and actually stood a chance. For example, the fight between Destroyer and the original monster was good and he almost defeated him, I mean he kicked the monster's ass, but fell just short. The movie looked great, so great in fact I wouldn't recommend younger kids or people with weak stomachs to see the chunks of gore that fill this movie. The Characters were all characters, none of them were boring and if they survived long enough, you could grow to love them. Then feel the agony as one of the boys dies. The developments of Sarge and Grimm were particularly well done.The Movie had a Doom feel with the high technology, dark corners and cramped corridors. Though it deviated from the original plot quite a bit, I think they have it set up so a sequel could perfectly capture the release of Hell's Demons. What with Karl Urban prepared to be the super marine the gamer plays in the games.Some things that I would have done differently would be to save the room full of people, (not having Sarge kill them) and have the black dude live (and instead have the crazy white guy get pulled through the grate). Breaking the horror film mold of having only one or two survivors at the end.Overall this was a great movie and should be what action/horror films attempt to match, though a few things could have been more innovative towards the end...it was a great movie.By The Way, Ebert and Roeper have no idea what they are talking about, the FPS scene was fantastic.",Doom
402,hawkie-3,Blood,8,30 November 2005,"The formula is simple. Fancy weaponry, alien landscape and grotesque creatures. You can't go wrong with a film of this type because it contains the factors that make for a bit of crack with a few cans of beers and a groups of friends around. Beer and movies are fun but it helps if the movie is entertaining and has lots of action and technology that is different than todays world. Doom delivers on these premises. Perhaps from a story point of view it is not hat powerful but who cares when you have the fun factor. After all their are two types of films; those that entertain and those that arouse the mind. Doom entertains but doesn't touch the surface of technically brilliant movies such as Pulp Fiction or Aliens which entertain but contain elements of light, sound and camera brilliance.

I only saw five movies in 2005, but that's enough to say this was the best darned movie I saw.Before I review, let's review the movies I went to go see.The Amityville Horror. Saw it with my dad at the Regal. Sucked as far as the story is concerned. Micheal Bay should be shipped to Ethiopia and fed to starving children for what he did to the story of the Lutzes.Land of the Dead. Okay, it's not a horror classic but still George Romero can do better than THIS! If he was gonna make a real zombie movie he would have released it UNRATED, balls to the walls and a whole lot gorier than this.War of the Worlds. No comment. No comment at all.DOOM. (See Review) Aeon Flux. I never watched the anime, I had no intention of seeing this crappy movie. I hate this movie, it sucked and it deserves to have all copies of itself destroyed and melted down into nothing. AEON FLUX, ha, what a joke.Now, onto the review.THE STORY The story essentially that of (here it comes 0/1 people found this review helpful) contrary to popular belief, based on Doom 1 & 2, not Doom 3. There were no devils in the first two games, and I'm a veteran of all of them. There were no devils in this movie, that's fine, would have been cool to see some, but hey, we live in a culturally sensitive world. Anyway, there's a chemical that turns people into zombies, what more do you need for story? I don't want to give anything away! THE ACTING The acting is superb, this is by far, The Rock's best film. But the guy who really steals the show is Karl Urban, the Doom Marine, and he looks the part too, (If you ever played the first two games there's a little HUD at the bottom with a picture of yourself, Karl Urban looks like him.) acts the part out with passion and does his very best. This movie is the reason I go to the movies, people, to get scared, have fun, see zombies and laugh my arse off afterwords. The Rock on the other hand is a little different, he plays (SPOILER ALERT) the most evil character I have ever seen in any film in my life. Before I saw this movie i thought Rhodes (Day of the Dead 1985) was the most evil character but boy, does Sarge blow him out of the water. (END SPOILER.) I love this movie, I recommend it to all of you, and I think all of the 'haters' out there should reconsider they're hasty opinions. Peace out.~ Wulfus",Doom
404,thegeneralJDE,What? What?,4,1 January 2006,"While I congratulate Karl Urban on another spectacular dark-hero performance and Dwayne Johnson on a splendid anti-hero creation, I have to ask, whilst spluttering uncontrollably: what was that? Was that really Doom? Personally, I preferred Resident Evil - RE provided a screenplay that went deep into the characters and gave us brilliantly constructed gore scenes about the actual release of the virus. It had me gripped within a few minutes of sitting down to it. Doom, on the other hand, had a rather strange start. It enabled us to journey with the gang, sure, but the screenplay was a bit clichéd and one that I think could have played with the original game elements in small ways to make it more of a movie rather than a game-fan-pleaser.And what was with Rosamund Pike's American accent? Even if I didn't know she was a Brit before, I would have within five seconds of her speaking in the film. Her accent was, to put it simply, terrible, and although she upheld her performance as the 'doctor' well, she did not provide me with a terribly convincing performance as an American doctor. The director should have played her as the sister who moved to Britain and lost her accent or simply recast the part.The 'game' sequence was good. It brought us back to the reason the film was made, and provided a good few minutes of entertaining film, where we could all go: ""hey hey! That's pretty cool!"" Unfortunately, we were brought back out of the scene with slight disappointment, when we realised that Rosamund Pike's character was still alive.Also, is there another Doom film in the making? Because frankly, the end scene when they're going up in the lift was a bit of a cruddy ending for a film that has raised so much publicity in the gaming world especially. The characters were ones we've seen too many times - Resident Evil was a game (and a film) that experimented with the team-based shooter, and made personalities more than what the old horrors dictated them to be. Doom didn't do this - which is why I'm rather disappointed with it. Back to the drawing board. How about making Killzone into a film. There's no clichés in that...(!)",Doom

Then again I'm not sure why i thought some elements from the book might be included. The fact that the ""monsters"" were pre-humans as opposed to aliens rushing through the gates kinda disappointed me. However the highlight of the movie for me was when the ""good guy"" Unfortunately not Mr Fly, was injected with some mystery-juice and then the following few minutes were filled with adrenaline-pumped first shooter scenes, YES first person shooter, picture watching your friend play doom, and kick some monster gluteus maximus. That made my movie watching experience a lot better. Good action movie, I will definitely watch it again. Cheers.",Doom

Never played Doom, but it's a familiar game, and I expected nothing less. Monsters and shooting stuff, gotcha.But there's something in this movie that I just can't forgive. If you pardon me for quoting a fellow reviewer: Wrudd said: ""What really killed it for me was the the whole bit at the end where the Rock turns bad and the guy who started out to be a sidekick becomes the hero and goes off into the sunset...with his own sister!""I hear ya! That, my friend, is called a screaming Point of View mistake. What a jarring moment. Here we are, following who we think is the PoV character, the one telling the story, the one through who's eyes we see the world. Then in one confusing moment towards the *very end* of the film, they switch into someone else. Now he's the hero. What a low, low trick to pull.And the sister thing...yeah, a little... creepy. It could have been a touching moment, after all, we all love our siblings even though they are a pain in the *** most of the time, and would do anything to save them. But instead, it just seemed slightly creepy.And the actors were a little wooden. What can I say? A wrestler does not an actor make. Now that I'm done bashing the film, time for a little praise. As a make-up artist I really respect the effort gone to crafting the monsters (it's hard work!). They were mostly done old school, using false parts and other goodies. Most CG monsters make me uncomfortable because they're so clumsy, but these creatures I kind of enjoyed in a perverse way. Why don't they do this more often in films instead of that CG bull that never looks right? Go on! Employ a few starving FX artists!All and all, not a bad movie in it's genre (I've seen worse), just nothing to write home about. However, the PoV mistake is not forgotten or forgiven. Shame on you screenwriter!",Doom
407,radoslavginev,I never get soxk of watching it.,10,31 October 2020,I've seen this movie 5+ times and i still love it. I appreciate it even more now that it is 15 years old.,Doom
408,LennyNero,Back to Hell,3,15 November 2005,"Although many reviews have been written about this movie I must have my say. The reason for this is quite simple: I feel an urge to write comments on movies if they belong to a special category. Let us label this category ""garbage"". Sounds pretty tough, but Doom really deserves this label. Don't be fooled ant think I did not know what to expect. Having read a lot of negative reviews, my expectations were quite low. However, one should make up one's mind and judge it by oneself (at least when you don't have to pay for the tickets which holds true in this case!) The main reason is that Doom violates the most important rule concerning movies: A movie should never be boring. Movies can be stupid, dull, shallow or mindless but at least they should entertain because that is what they were made for (apart from the fact that the studios want to earn a lot of money). The problem in this case is that there is no tension at all. I can not believe that there are people out there who were kept at the edge of their seats while watching this flick. Instead I believe that 99 % of the people who have seen more than one movie from the sci/fi-horror genre in the last 20 years were yawning since they anticipated what would happen on the screen. Andrzej Bartkowiak should have watched Aliens (yes, I belong to the James Cameron-is-one-of-the-greatest-directors-of-all-time-fan club) a bit more often then he would have known what tension means. Apart from the fact that Doom is boring, it also is not atmospheric at all. Personally I think that a movie especially a sci/fi, horror or fantasy movie- which lacks this feature has a problem in getting the audience involved in what is taking place on the screen. One is just sitting on the seat but is not really ""participating"". The final fault of the movie which somehow connects to the aforementioned point is its cheap look. I am astonished about the estimated budget of about 70.000.000 Dollars. Where did they spend the money on? Most of the sets and creatures look so cheap. Anything else? Yes! The funny thing is that from time my yawning was interrupted by laughter because some of the one-liners are so dumb that I had to laugh pretty loud. Eventually Doom is the product of a very mediocre director who additionally was plagued with a poor screenplay. Back to hell with Doom (oh, I forget: No hell available)",Doom
409,Creedonjj,The cult video game classic has now been made into a movie,7,3 May 2006,"Doom, a hit computer game from 1993, has now been made into a major motion picture. It was directed by Andrzej Bartkowiak. This movie adaptation of the computer game is a kill-em-all, action-packed, explosive adventure with surprises, death, destruction, murder, and mayhem around every corner. This movie is most definitely worth seeing if you like the action genera. In the year 2046, an urgent message was transmitted from the UAC Olduvai research facility on Mars. It concerned a level-5 breech and it required a complete quarantine of the facility. An eight-man Marine Rapid Response Tactical Squad (RRTS) is dispatched to the facility to assess the situation, recover UAC data, and neutralize the threat with extreme prejudice. For a movie translation of a video game, the plot was done quite well. There were deviations from the video game, but that is to be expected when making a movie like this. It has been made into a mainstream horror film. Doom has a star-studded cast of actors who all delivered outstanding performances. The three main characters of this cast consists of the highly motivated and truly dedicated commanding officer of the RRTS, Sarge (The Rock), the level-headed Reaper (Karl Urban), and the intellectual Dr. Samantha Grimm (Rosamund Park). The cinematography in Doom is excellent. The scenes were shot in the typical horror format with the lighting set up for a frightening and suspenseful environment. The sets were awesome and very close to those in the game. The special effects are brilliant, from the explosions to the blood. The special effects team did not miss a beat. The monsters are definitely like nothing anyone has ever seen before. They were created extremely well. It was great to see some real monsters on-screen and not something that was constructed by computer animation. The makeup crew did an outstanding job as well. The first-person shooter sequence that resembled the one in the video game was amazing for a continuous shot. It flowed perfectly. I do not know anyone that did not laugh during this sequence. It was unexpected and incredibly enjoyable. The military tactics were right on target from the way they handled the weapons to the way they moved as a squad. The actors actually looked like they knew what they were doing and did a terrific job. I enjoyed this movie very much since I was a fan of the Doom series. I like this adaptation event thought the plot was not the same as the game, but the story still prevailed. A problem that I came across that distracted me from the movie was when they kept calling the Marines soldiers. I am a Marine myself and I know for a fact that a Marine would never call another Marine by that name. That term is used in the Army. The actors made it exceptionally believable. From someone who has been there when leave is cancelled to go to combat, the reactions were similar. The actors portrayed Marines quite well. This movie is not for everyone. If one is expecting a perfect translation of the game, they will experience a tremendous let-down. I would still recommend this movie to anyone who has played the game even if the plot is different. The objective remains the same: search and destroy.",Doom
410,Morson,This truly sums up the movie in ways nothing I could say would..,4,16 February 2006,"There's nothing I could say you haven't heard before. That it throws out the plot of the game, destroying the reputation of not only Doom but the game industry. That the marines aren't remotely in touch with reality. That it's a knock off of a hundred things, except it's source material. Nothing new there.. however, this.. this sums it up in ways that I could not in a million years:---... On Doom ...Would he have done it any differently, then? ""I don't know if I would definitely make the movie very differently, because I think that Doom remembered me in a lot of the camera angles, what the creatures were doing and so on... I think the guy who made Doom definitely saw Alone in the Dark."" - Uwe Boll, interview with Eurogamer.---",Doom
411,paganpriest66,Could have been better!,6,13 October 2006,"So, we have another ""video game to movie"" movie. And ""The Rock"" is playing a bad guy? OK, I liked the game, I'll give the movie a go.The best I can say is that it wasn't a complete waste of time, as far as it went it was a fun little monster-fest. The Rock did a credible job as The Sarge, but his transition from plain old Grunt to bad guy was a little heavy handed. One minute he's ""kickin' ass and taking' names"", the next he's shooting everything that moves, good bad or indifferent.I did like the monster make-up and FX, they did look pretty cool, and the ""first person shooter"" sequence was an excellent reminder of the movies origins. By far Karl Urban as Grimm was the star of this movie. The movie is fun, but the story is a little weak and very predictable. Don't expect too much with this, except to while away an evening and not feel like time is wasted. Enjoy it for what it is, guys killing monsters with BFG's!",Doom
412,handanodaman,Genetics can be a Doomy thing!,10,4 November 2005,"It was quite a good movie. Although there were lots of projects which had been made on the topic that how genetics can be a very dangerous area to study on, this movie puts emphasis on another issue: Are some of us born to be evil, genetically? May be you are known to be a good man by others but at the same time you are suppressing something evil inside you, which you don't even think that it exists in your soul. With the clever usage of cameras, and a dynamic soundtrack you will be able to find the answer and i think you will enjoy the 2 hours you spend for watching this movie. I know that Doom was actually a computer game and adapted to cinema later, like Resident Evil. So in the second part of the movie there are scenes that makes you think you are somehow playing a computer game. That is nice of the director and i appreciated that. To sum up, if you like action- horror type movies, take your time to watch it!!",Doom
413,empty2005,Boom,1,29 October 2005,Doom is set in a research facility on Mars where an outbreak occurs. When a group of army corps are sent to retrieve vital information about the research on the Human Genome Project all hell breaks loose. The plot is very weak and is closely related to Resident Evil (eg. viral outbreak in a research facility). The acting is horrible with really poor dialogue and action scenes (eg. game related scenes). The sfx are nothing special (eg. the monsters) This story in my opinion is a major knock-off of Aliens but has not got the qualities of Resident Evil or Mortal Kombat. With a disapoinintg ending and major plot holes 1/5* stars from me!,Doom
414,luluevil,A 90's taste movie. Forget the title.,6,15 October 2018,"The movie is really good, like 90's or 80's action movies. 
The story is solid, characters weren't deep but did some good acting. 
It has rewatch value, weak CGI but it's an old movie, dark sci fi space environment which has similarities with the game & this genetics sci fi was cool as well. 
I think it's a must-watch!",Doom
415,Terkel_72,Great Flick!,10,15 January 2009,"OK, first of, people, stop calling this a Resident Evil clone, as that is not true, the game DOOM came out before Resident Evil. This movie doesn't even resemble Resident Evil and the storyline in this movie is a hell of a lot better. Yes, I know it is not the same storyline as in the games, but I don't think the storyline of the game would have fit the movie screen very well to be honest. One man against hell's legions for two hours? YAAAWN. Great for a game, but not for a movie. This movie's storyline is good, better Than Re. Evil. More credible. The ""zombies"" in Res. Evil were pathetic, if I were Romero I would be mad. These zombies in Doom were a lot cooler, even though they could run and only losers like running zombies. Zombies should only shamble, but other than that, great flick!",Doom
416,jayk_bakner,"Annoying, annoying, annoying!",4,16 April 2006,"This movie COULD have been one of the best video game adaptations to date, simply because it it could have been incredibly suspense filled, slow-moving action horror movie...oh! Much like the game. It had an enormous amount of potential, and the film-makers MOSTLY threw it away.Instead, we got a face-paced action movie with a small amount of horror thrown in for good measure. And whilst the action set-pieces were pretty entertaining - the first person shooter about 3/4 of the way through was a stroke of true brilliance - the horror parts are just awfully directed. I just didn't feel anything whilst watching besides 'Oh...he's dead. And now he's dead.' However, since the movie didn't completely consist of horror elements, and the action sequences were entertaining, why only 5/10? Well, two reasons.First, the story. It was just awful. I mean, even though they decided to not completely base it on the game - which was an incredibly poor decision in my honest opinion - they could have come up with something better than the crap that they did. I can't say WHY this is, because it would spoil the story, and I honestly think that despite it's flaws, this movies is worth a watch.Second, the script. Completely and utterly inconsistent. Occasionally, it's quite good; above average at least. Other times, utterly pants. Lines like 'semper fi, mother****er' and 'sniper-scope instead of microscope' had me laughing for all the wrong reasons. Unfortunately, the latter case happens far more often than the former, and it spoils the movie completely.However, it has to be said that, dodgy accents aside, the cast actually does a pretty solid job of keeping the whole thing together, even if it isn't award-winning quality.So all-in-all, if you're an action nut, give this film a go. If you're a horror-nut, avoid at all costs. And if you're a fan of the video game, go in with an open mind and you never know, you could end up enjoying yourself! All you have to do is just remember that it's NOT going to be that good.Overall, 5/10.",Doom
417,ccrespo182,Just when you thought you'd seen it all...,1,24 March 2006,"Somehow, somewhere, certain people did certain things to put certain events into motion that would result in something that I never thought could really be possible. They made a boring Doom movie.I wanted to sleep so badly while watching this plodding, thin and underdeveloped excuse for a movie. The characters for the most part were not interesting, especially the lame brother-sister story line that goes no where and does nothing to enhance anything about the film. The action is staged and shot with the inventiveness and visual acumen of a blind gorilla...meaning a gorilla with sight could make a better movie.Even the story for Doom 3 the video game, which this movie is obviously based on, was much more interesting than the story in this film.Where are all the demons? And the Evil? And where's Hell? gone gone gone and the first person sequence? come on, i derived more enjoyment from watching my friends play the game...I've also derived enjoyment from watching grass grow.All that being said, if you hate your life but need that last final push to get you to kill yourself, Doom is it.",Doom
418,Yukle,Don't judge the story because there isn't one,3,27 October 2005,"I went to see Doom for the same reason I saw S.W.A.T. which is just as a mindless waste of time with my mates. I knew that I wasn't going to be impressed about any plot twists, but who cares? This is not a movie that was made to do that so I won't judge it so. However, there is little left to compliment the film. I must admit, it was very clever to use the first person view borrowed from the game but this was actually a little disappointing. The camera was jerky, which is understandable but for a soldier, there was very little looking at the enemy. Throughout the whole movie, the camera angles were terrible; rarely focusing on the exciting parts and showing only split-second images of the action coupled by several minutes of a panicking woman who seemed totally incapable of thinking for a scientist. A little sexist, but The Rock is the real worry. He played his character perfectly, don't get me wrong, but his character was incredibly annoying. Given the characters were made super intelligent, it is a little strange how stupid they are. Given I went to see the action, there should have been more of it, rather than snippets followed by the survivors walking through the scene saying, ""Dear me, whatever happened here?""",Doom
419,lafferj,I want my money back,1,17 November 2005,"I thought it was as good as Starship Troopers 2. Yes, that is taking the mickey. I thought the cast was awful. I love the Rock in everything else so far but even for him, this was a wooden performance. I too have been an avid fan of the game since early 90's. I was so looking forward to this. When I heard that Dwayne was going to be in it, I thought cool. My wife wanted to walk out in the middle and she is an avid fan also. I also have to agree with comments by others here, ID software sold out. They are trying to squeeze every last cent out of what was once the greatest computer game ever.

420,sandletting_go,"Not the ""Doom"" I know!",1,22 October 2005,"Playing ""Doom"", and figuring what it was all about, truly terrified and amazed me. I always thought if this game were made into a film, it would be great. I was wrong, but that's because the people involved with this movie decided not to use the game's plot line. This movie only resembles the game because of its title and some of its monsters, which you cannot clearly perceive. The only good thing about this film is near the end (not the ending itself!) and that lasts a couple of seconds (well, maybe some 2 or 3 minutes). There is even a couple of gross moments, and I mean gross, not gory. Well, what truly frightened me when playing the game was clearly discarded from the movie. Those who have played ""Doom"" til the end of it will know what I mean.",Doom
421,cjhaacke,oh well....,3,25 October 2005,"For what it is worth, I did like Dwayne ""the rock"" Johnson's acting, although I have to ask; is it in his contracts that each movie he is in have a pro wrestling-type fight? I also like Karl Urban, and Rosamund Pike. Being a fan of Doom 3, I loved it when ""Pinky"" showed up.Those are, collectively, the movie's high points.As I said, I am a fan of Doom 3. Sadly, the game had more atmosphere, more plot, than the movie. More shooting of arguably well-done demons than a few zombies and genetic mutants; ""genetic mutants""? This was supposed to be DOOM! As in, monsters from Hell loosed though a portal, not created by a virus or ""24th. strand of DNA"". Often, it felt like Reaper spent more time fighting humans than monsters.I had been looking forward to the move for months; was excited making my way to the theater, watching the previews roll. But once the visceral thrill of gunfire faded, I felt kind of robbed. ""Zombification by way of blood/virus/etc."" had been done (to death?), better, from Romero to Resident Evil, which I liked, by the way. Doom lacked a certain ""scope""; there should have been more Hellknights, more Imps, more non-zombies. Hell itself. ""Starship Troopers"", at least filled the screen with its monsters, and, sadly, had only slightly less plot.Also, in one final bit of annoyance; what kind of ""elite soldier"" would have been stupid enough to WANDER OFF, in a ZOMBIE-INFESTED COMPLEX to GO TO THE BATHROOM, and ALONE?!?!Oh well; at least, unlike in Doom 3, they had flashlights on their guns.",Doom

Now I have played the games before, but when walking in to see the film, I couldn't shake the fact that this movie was going to suck like the rest of the Video game-Films (RE 1&2/Alone in the Dark/Mortal Kombat Annihilation...etc). THANK GODDDDDDDDDD, I was wrong! Doom is an actual VG-Film movie that shocks and surprises. Those who have seen the film know what BIG SURPRISE towards the end, that I'm talking about. I loved everything in this movie (except Portman and some of Rock's acting). The action was solid, the hero was cold and cool, and that final battle WAS THE SHEOT! The acting is pretty much solid, except for some instances from the Rock and Duke. But overall, the film is packed with plot twists that actually shock you!

BUT if you look at this movie in terms of awesomeness, this movie rules. The Rock is so intense, you can't even begin to imagine how cool this movie was. He tells it like it is and doesn't take sh*t from no one in this movie.If you're looking for a deep, intellectual movie, this isn't the one for you, but if you're in the mood for a movie that kicks so serious ass watch this one.

424,CapnMikel,Doom - Faithful? No. Good film? Yes.,6,22 October 2005,"So many people everywhere have some sort of Doom memory. Whether it be playing with friends, siblings, or hell even family, Doom seems to be something that anyone who's played enjoys. If anyones seen the film Alien and Aliens -- the difference between the original dooms and Doom 3 is exactly the same. Doom 3 being more like alien, more horror with less action, and the originals like Aliens, more action, with some horror.Now the film review. After seeing my title, ""Faithfull no? Good film? Yes."" your probably wondering how it could be unfaithful to the games and still a good film at the same time -- i'll explain.Anyone who's played any doom game as much as I have(Which is a lot) will DEFFINTLY be disappointed in this film. It's got light rough elements of the original games in there yes, but not enough. Lets not even talk plot for a moment. Say the whole 'hell' involvement thing didn't even matter. Think demons, think weapons, think action/horror. Thats what dooms always been about more then anything, right? Right. Which is why this film comes to a disappointment.Lets talk demons first: They included 4 of the demons from the doom games, The zombie, The imp, the pinky, and the baron/hell knight whichever you want to call it, it really dose't matter in this case. The zombies behaved well, like zombies. You don't see much of them, but you see them none the less and they never do crap. You just see them die. Thats it. The imps and barons? They don't shoot fireballs anymore sadly. The barons use brute force, while the imps either just scratch or attack you with their tongue to turn you into an imp, IF your souls 24th chromosome is declared ""Evil."" If thats not bad enough, you don't even get a good look at them or see them very much! The pinky, he was in one very short scene, and pretty much just acted like a slow CGI monster, so it was kinda obvious. It was fun to see it get slashed with the chainsaw, one of the few moments that everyone loved in doom. Though, in doom 3 they at least explained why chainsaws were on mars..Weapons: You see the rocket launcher picked up, but never used. You see the shotgun shot ONCE in a very dark scene, meaning you see flashes and hear a shotgun sound and thats it. The big mini gun/chain gun was used ONCE to shoot a monkey. Other then that you see the machine gun used the WHOLE time, and the BFG used twice. The double barrel shotgun and plasma gun don't even get a mention! The chainsaw just happened to be on a random table and used to kill the pinky. The pistol was used a few times. Shooting wise - this film was dull. The first person section was really the only place you felt doomish, other then the 2 times the BFG was used. Not to mention the BFG color changed from green to blue..The action / horror: You don't see much of it. You see some action here and there, but it's mostly random. You don't see much shooting and stuff dieing. You do, but it's dark not very gory and hard to see. The horror? Absent in this film sorry to say. They tried 1-2 cheap scares, which didn't even work..Plot: I'm not going to go into this. Only one thing to say : Not doom. The plot of hell and demons was taken out, and replaced with a genetics plot. Not much else to say.Now i've explained why it's very unlike doom, i'm going to say one more thing on the matter, and thats that the soundtrack was nicely done(Remiended me of the original doom music sort of..) and the sets were constructed mostly very well and close to the game.The next part of this review: Good as a movie.Anyone who's never played a doom game, can DEFFINTLY enjoy this. Anyone who's never played video games: Can ENJOY this. They won't understand the FPS section maybe, but you can still enjoy it none the less. As a sci fi film, it's not the best out there no, but it's pretty well done, and if you don't see it as seeing Doom the movie, and just some sci fi movie on mars, you can DEFFINTLY enjoy the film.The plot, is out there yeah, but it explains why some people are infected and others are not. It explains a lot about chromosomes, and hey, they even included an ancient civilization bit, which was in the game, AND makes sense in this plot. Don't worry about knowing nothing about the games - it won't matter. You'll be able to understand it all.Overall, you can defiantly enjoy the little action mixed with the strange sci fi plot, into a nicely mixed film that lets not refer to as doom.My final judgment: If your a doom fan see it, but don't expect to like it. You may enjoy it as a film, but you won't like it as doom. If your a video game fan, see it, you'll probably find yourself enjoying it. If you like Sci-Fi, give it a go, if you haven't seen Sernity yet, which is the only other sci fi playing to my knowledge at the moment. If you just want a movie to see on a Friday night with some action, go for it. If your looking for a in depth rich story lined sci fi action combined film, go rent aliens..I gave this a 6/10, because though unlike doom, it was still a well done film, and maybe one day Hollywood will learn to make a successful video game adaptation..",Doom
425,nicholascamerontaylor,How bad can a film be? Doom certainly does its best to answer that question.,2,18 July 2014,"Settling down for the evening, I put up the chair, crossed my legs and pressed play for the movie I had decided to watch that night. I had thought on a whim to watch ""Doom"" as I sometimes enjoy watching bad movies (for a little bit of light humor) and as I hadn't watched it since it's release in 2005 (when I was just the tender age of 15) I thought why the hell not. With the power of hindsight I wish to god I hadn't.The question one has to ask when watching a film like ""Doom"" is simple. Is the film any good? And the answer like the question is simple. No, it's bloody terrible. It is watchable at the very least but it's not enjoyable. It won't leave you physically nauseous but it will have killed a few braincells in the process. There in lies this films major problem, this film is nothing. At it's heart lies emptiness. It has no impact on you whatsoever, it might not leave you hating it, but you certainly won't have liked it. In fact if you went and put the kettle on straight after watching this film by the time you came back you will have forgotten you even watched it. I have a hard time remembering anything from this film just 24 hours after watching it. That is the kind of mindset you have to adopt if you expect to gain any enjoyment from this hollowed out corpse of a film. You have to know it is going to be a waste of your time, because guess what? It is going to be a waste of your time. Let's look at the cold hard facts shall we, this film managed to gross only $56 million on a budget of $60 million. And this is exactly what it deserved, it deserved to take a loss because $60 million to make this piece of crap is just mindboggling. Did they spend the entire $60 million on Dwayne Johnson's (or should I say the Rock's) salary, because if they did what a waste of money. To call it a performance is a disgrace to anyone else who has ever graced the silver screen. It is surprising to me that ""the Rock"" ever managed to get himself taken seriously after this abortion of filmmaking and his complete lack of acting ability in it. Give me $60 million and I guarantee you I could make something better than this... hell my gran could make something better than this... and she's been dead for 18 years.There are just not many positives I can take from this film, I doubt anyone could take many positives from it. In fact I can't take a single positive from it. No action scene in the film is good, no performance in this film is good, no line of dialogue in this film is good, no prop or setting in this film is good. To cut a long story short, nothing in this film is good. They could have easily made a good film, the source material is great, they just had to adapt that and attempt to capture the same feelings it inspired. Instead one can only assume everyone involved in this project was suffering from a clinical case of temporary retardation. Because what should have been easy they made look very difficult. Not since Uwe Boll has a director missed the mark so incredibly with a video game adaptation brought to film. In this reviewer's humble opinion Andrzej Bartkowiak should be extradited and tried for crimes against humanity. To think that Cinema has been paved by true geniuses and that science fiction has been influenced by greats the like of Georges Méliès, Stanley Kubrick and Ridley Scott only for a film like this to exist makes me weep, I can only hope that whatever apocalypse brings down our ultimate demise also destroys all copies of this film so that alien astronauts might not discover it and judge our race accordingly. You have been warned, for the safety of your brain, don't bother watching this stinking pile of.....",Doom
426,Alicepire,Go mutants!!!,1,1 July 2006,"'Doom' seems like a very apt title for a movie that makes you lose the will to live half way through. It was a monumental waste of 2 hours of my life, which could have been much more agreeably spent lost in such activities as watching grass grow, or gnawing my own arm off.Yes, yes I can almost hear you laughing at my stupidity for actually going to see a movie based on a video game, but in my defence I shall admit that my main motivation to see this farce was Rosamund Pike. Ms Pike was brilliant in such films as Pride and Prejudice, Die Another Day and The Libertine. Unfortunately I think the time has come for her to fire her agent and to cease all contact with the person who told her she could do an American accent. She can't. And not even watching her with my fingers in my ears could made this ordeal, directed by Andrzej Bartkowiak, bearable.Pike's performance, although unusually painful to watch, was still the best on show. The Rock deserves to have his licence to act revoked.On a positive note; the special effects were excellent, however they would have worked far better had they been included in a movie with a plot and had the script been written be someone other than a chipmunk on Amyl Nitrate.The 'plot' for Doom was simple: in 2046, genetic mutations in humans on Mars have made people super human. Some good. Most evil. 10 US marines were obviously the first choice to send to save the world. Half testosterone, half sexist bastard, but all jerk, our heroes run around the space station shooting things, occasionally stopping to make 'witty' comments, or, preferably, die. As riveting as it was, 45 minutes in I found myself hoping that the mutants would kill the marines quickly so I could go home.All in all I would only recommend this movie if you don't care about plot development, well written scripts and can see past terrible acting and just go for blood and gore. For everyone else, two thumbs down.",Doom
427,chodefacemcgee69,Very Good For What It Is,10,19 October 2005,"Despite what many others may say, this movie is VERY good for what it is: a mindless action movie.I enjoyed the game itself very much and it really scared the **** out of me. I was expecting a horror movie, but i soon realized that it is an action movie. Well, what can you expect from an action movie other than lots of shooting and SOME suspense? If you think the movie is shallow, it is, but its supposed to be. Anyone who complains about the movie being a mindless shooting movie should realize that this is not the movie for them, so they should go watch one of their ""emotional"" movies if they want. However, if you need a break and just want your testosterone pumping so you can take a break from life and just be a manly man. If you don't like The Rock, then go watch a romance or comedy, this movie isn't for you. However, if you like the video game and like mindless action, this is the movie for you.

I wished they didn't stray so far away from the games story line but the Christians and Catholics would have made a big sense about it. Without a doubt best movie based on a game so far (halo will be the best). The movie had great action, good cast, easy to follow storyline. A non-fan of the doom genre will still like this movie. The daemons or mutants they mixed it up a little which is good. the POV scene was great and refreshing.I would like to see a sequel with Karl urban.game based movie get a bad name from Pual Anderson and Uwe Boll, that is not the case here.",Doom
429,TheLionGod,Perfect!,10,27 October 2005,"Doom was quite an entertaining video-game turned movie. It promised violence and it definitely delivered. While you did not have to think too much about what was going on, it did have a plot with some great twists. I expected a straight forward ""shooter"" movie, very similar to the game and, frankly, I expected it to be boring. I was anything but. The video game style of the movie was limited pretty much to one scene. One awesome scene that, if you felt the movie lacked in violence in any way, should fulfill your blood lust.Sarge (The Rock) is the leader of an elite USMC team which is sent to a space station on Mars to investigate a problem of disappearing scientists. Upon discovering most of the scientists dead, they soon realized they were not going to stay that way. I do not want to give away much more than that but there is more to this movie.Sarge's team consists of Destroyer (Deobia Oparei), the religious Goat (Ben Daniels), Duke (Raz Adoti), Portman (Richard Brake), The Kid (Al Weaver), Mac (Yao Chin) and John Grimm (Karl Urban), who happens to be the twin brother of one of the scientists, Samantha Grimm (Rosamund Pike).Doom started off pretty slow, but once the ball got rolling, it resembled the game more and more and kept the excitement up as well. All of these actors pulled off their parts to great avail. Really, how could they go wrong? I went into this movie with extremely low expectation. Especially after reading some of the reviews so I was very pleasantly surprised. I can recommend this movie to those who love a good, bloody action movie. Basically, if you can relate to Sin City, then Doom is also the movie for you. 10/10",Doom
430,mongo46538,Low Budget Gore-Fest versus Sci-Fi Thriller,6,8 February 2006,"Being an Avid FPS player I was once again disappointed at how Hollywood botched following up on the specifics. In this case there are several things that would have piqued the Gamer's interest that were either left out or poorly done. Number one, the FPS sequence was extremely slow, there should have been attention payed to how fast these games are actually played. The FPS sequence in which Reaper (John Grimm) encounters Pinky Demon (with wheels) was well done, a nice but rare piece of Computer generated Graphics, something you might think avid gamers would want to see more of, but instead we get a steady barrage of B-rated ""Night of the Living Dead"" style ketchup drenched human zombies making wet sloppy noises. Lost Souls, The Forgotten, Tics or Trites would have been nice and the (I believe) Imps were decent but easily recognizable as guys in suits, when you look at all the creatures in this game, you could have easily come up with more suited characters, see link.http://ucguides.savagehelp.com/Doom3/enemies.htmI was also disappointed by Sarge's evil nature, exposed by his killing one of his own men and wanting to terminate Women and Children. He's supposed to be the Hero in this story, since he is the person you are playing throughout the whole game. I realize that Hollywood needed to add to the storyline to make an actual movie with a real plot, they could have achieved this without taking as much away from the game as they did. The acting was first rate and there were some thrilling moments but unfortunately the obvious, easily recognizable low budget aspect to this movie may impede future movies of this Sci-Fi Gamer genre. A shame because I would like to see a Quake4 movie with all the of Doom's Shortcomings properly addressed.mongo",Doom
431,imohiuddin2,Four out of Four Stars! Two Thumbs UP!,7,10 February 2006,"The Rock has never been better as an actor in this movie. What I believe to me is that a lot of this negativity comes from gamers with too much of a high expectation, whenever this happens the movie turns out bad no matter how excellent it is. That's just how movies & people work. Excellent Plot, Good Music Background.. Goood directing!! Good Suspense... Great Entertaining movie no joke.. This is one to buy. The actor the Rock,(the wrestler) plays a perfect role in the movie, a very good actor. This action movie is a non stop thriller a rock'em sock'em action flick. I know when I see a good flick and this one is good. This movie is an original one of a kind. I rate this movie amongst all my favorites, like tears of this sun, Armageddon, mortal kombat, t2, aliens, braveheart, gladiator. Never saw Karl urban and the rock acting so great with cohesion in this movie. I actually rented this movie at BlockBuster and they were all sold out the first day it came out, now that I've seen this movie.. I should've watched in the theaters :) Who knows... if people loved it so much, they could make Doom2 and have a portal from hell open up and thus make a whole trilogy about this, and enhance the quantity of people fighting like in the lord of the rings. Sky's the limit. There are certain weaknesses to the film but hey, all films do, the thing with this movie is that the good things about the film FAR outweigh the weaknesses. This movie is straight up entertaining. I have to say, I would watch this film anytime anyday again.",Doom

I am a game lover so I wen tot check this movie out. Nothing but disappointment through the movie. There were a few cool fight scenes but this movie stayed pretty typical.

433,reenefly,Bloody awful (no pun intended),1,6 March 2006,"The only people that will enjoy this movie are those who haven't played or heard of Doom, and those looking for a gory movie with cheap thrills and a shallow plot. For those who seek an accurate portrayal of the classic game, they will only be subjected to the effective funeral of whoever wrote/directed/starred in this godawful movie. The only references to the game Doom was the Pink monster, who for some reason had wheels for legs. Erm...? The brown imps shooting fireballs were nowhere to be seen, only to be replaced by an 'Alien' rip-off. And I would have loved to see the bigger monsters featured in the Doom game, like the centaur that shoots green fireballs, and the mechanical spider. All you get is a bunch of half-assed actors (the Rock??? That alone cracks me up. He should have stayed in the fake boxing ring flexing his muscles)and a truly awful (and laughable) plot. It's your typical zombie plot. No thanks. The only saving graces of this mess was the appearance of the BFG 9000 (which I think stands for BigF***ingGun.. oh yes) which made a several fantastic holes in walls, and the chainsaw. As well as the much-hyped point of view sequence, which you wait well over an hour for. You don't see any 'monsters' until well into the movie either, which doesn't create suspense, it creates frustration!!! And the frustration is already there anyway because the set does not resemble the game AT ALL. Where the hell are the industrial settings? With a blood-red sky and impailed corpses on sticks? All you get is a laboratory and a sewer. The plot doesn't make any references to hell, which is what Doom was based on, except for the Rock saying 'Go to hell'. *sarcastic applause* Fantastic line (!)

But would it really work as a movie? Maybe most of us fans wonder what a movie would be like, but we actually already know that it ain't gonna work!So, finally, back to the movie again.They resurrected a great title, completely flogged it, re-dressed it and then made a movie bearing it's title in the hope to win new fans (ie. those who are too young to remember the 90s games and who will be tomorrows consumers).Well, I hope it worked, because here's one less fan of the reincarnation mumbo jumbo.If it ain't broken, don't fix it!!Thank you very much!",Doom

You know how some movies can be fun to watch just because everything is done so badly? Well, this isn't one. It's not scary enough to be horror, not suspenseful enough to be a thriller, not exiting enough to be an action flick. Couple it with some incredibly tacky special effects and a paper thin plot that is surpassed even by its game counterpart and you've got one of the worst movies ever in its genre. Resident Evil, with a very similar plot and approach, did a much much better job, so go see that if you're after a good video game based action movie.",Doom

Marines don't call their Sargents 'Sarge', it's considered disrespectful. But unlike other people I can get over the little things such as that. The movie was very close to the books and the game. The demons were amazing looking. The suspense was great and didn't leave you hanging. Karl Urban was amazing as always.

The movie itself was pretty good, the acting was great. As I'm sure it was intended as such, I didn't like the sleazy guy, Portman. He made me have flashbacks of dirty old men with greasy hair that used to stare at me. How can a supposed Marine have hair that long?

438,hstephen138,Game On,3,10 October 2007,"If you enjoyed playing DOOM the video game then this film will make you cry with disappointment in the way the film makers have squandered the rich source material. Primarily this is an action film loosely based on the latest installment of the video game DOOM 3. And thats where the similarities end. What we have is a team of tactical rescuers going to search for survivors from a research station on mars. The said research station has been attacked by forces unknown. This film is formulaic to the very end, you'll not find much here that you haven't found in other mediocre sci-fi action films. Big men, Big egos big guns and lots of shooting, oh and a few ""It's game time"" moments sometimes such a style can be alluring but the plot is so shallow that you'll find it hard to carry on watching past the first half an hour. Sure its got some token DOOM moments, ie the BFG makes an appearance and has a lengthy section devoted to the build up of its actual use, but its a disappointment, and the much hyped FPS viewpoint which is refreshing only it lasts to shorter time for it to become properly enjoyable.Ever since aliens, directors have tried to emulate the squad dynamic that the space marines employed, they had believability, the space marine in doom 3 come across as a bunch of idiots and why does one of them look like hes thirteen!! and hey there's even a token chirpy black man thrown in. They appear to have no training or discipline whatsoever.Possibly the biggest departure and subsequent mistake of the film makers was to change the monsters from demons and hell spawn to genetically advanced humanoids from mars. A weak and run of the mill action film, lets hope they don't ruin quake in the same way.But if you like films with The Rock in them then its ""Game Time""",Doom
439,jwdesign6,I don't think they really tried that hard.,3,12 May 2016,"There is a lot that disappointed me about this movie. It took over a decade for me to finally watch this and I've heard bad things so I had low expectations, overall I enjoyed watching it but it's far more disappointing that it strays from the games than it is a B sci-fi horror movie. Now it seems to be based more on the DooM 3 game rather than the original so I'll refrain from some of the other criticisms but here are my biggest gripes:1. The characters- typical of any B movie, they push the personalities really hard in this, there's the ""religious guy"", the ""creepy guy you're supposed to hate"", the ""newbie"", etc. And instead of some good character development these characters just have bad dialogue to cement who they're supposed to be. 2. No Doom suit? This honestly could be any B sci-fi/zombie movie if you turned it on the TV, no actual identifiers that its DooM. 3. It would have been cool to show the scientists working on opening the portal to hell and how that came to be, except there IS no portal to hell. Whyd they change the story to one more generic? Was it too unbelievable and edgy or? 4. Too many zombies. Seriously DooM had its zombies but its supposed to be mainly horrific demons. There's only one type, the Imp. Im glad they kind of look like imps but they don't throw fire or anything. They mainly gun down zombie scientists, whats DooM about that? 5. *minor spoiler* The POV scene. Im guessing this was supposed to be the big ""payoff"" in the movie we were all supposed to be excited for but it looked more like a House of the Dead demo at an arcade. The zombie scientists were popping out on the screen and dropping one liners like at a bad haunted house you'd pay 5 dollars to go to. *end minor spoiler* 6. My biggest gripe though is definitely the blatant misogyny. There is only one female character in the movie, the scientist, which the entire team of marines have no trouble sexually harassing throughout the film. Now Id like to believe it was some sort of social commentary at first, but it went on and on and just got creepier, even in a later scene when she was alone with one of the marines and he made constant sexual comments towards her when she was dissecting a body, and the movie presents it in a completely harmless manner and the fact that they somehow work in nude women into the film show they are not exactly being sympathetic to sexual harassment but rather glorifying the sexualization of women in a completely non-sexual environment.Now for some things I did enjoy: 1. I liked the references. The scientist named Carmack. The character Pinky, which later pays off. The BFG. The lights on the sides of the doors. I believe when a helicopter lands in the beginning of the movie it makes the classic door noise. 2.There was some pretty good suspense.I feel like all these video game movies take the most basic plots and cant get it right and I cant understand why. There was no need to do this for this movie, if you don't find a portal to hell believable then don't make the film!",Doom

I won't put in any spoilers but will only give one hint: ""First person shooter, anyone?"" I loved the original DOOM games in the early 90's., and this movie was a nearly perfect homage to them.Karl Urban shows us he can play the lead in a big budget movie, and surpasses his more than acceptable role in Lord of The Rings.The Rock is, well, the Rock. While I'm afraid his time in Hollywood will be ending sooner than he might think, he does seem to get into movies that he fits into pretty well. However, there are only so many of those you can do (ask Hulk Hogan).

Karl Urban, Richard Brake and the rest of the main cast all give solid shows, so the movie is very good in that aspect. It also doesn't do anything stupid, it sticks to its guns. It doesn't go off in some wonkey directions. If you want a solid action flick that wont let you down. Doom delivers in spades.

I remember all the hours of excitement and tension I felt when playing the game. It was a totally immersive experience.There are two things that I liked very much about the movie, which made me think that it was a good adoption of the game: 1.) The first person view part is an excellent reference to the game and at the same time a great experience on the big screen. The way the scene starts couldn't have been conceived any better. Real credits to the producers here! 2.) The movie doesn't stay too close to the storyline of the game but also doesn't loose the connection to it.

I played all the Dooms (not saying that to prove anything, just saying I know what they were like and I am a fan) and it was dark, creepy and very bloody. By no means is it a masterpiece, but it does a nice job building suspense, and then living up to it. I recommend it for anyone who likes action with a twist of horror.

After all the unimportant characters were cleared up, the most enjoyable part of the movie began. I really liked the fight between Reaper and Sarge, for example. And I thought if Karl Urban hadn't shown a great performance, I wouldn't enjoy the movie that much.

It is entertaining for movie lovers, but I doubt that fans of the game will not be disappointed by some aspects of the movie.SPOILER WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS PLENTY OF SPOILERS!!! Basically the beginning starts off with a brief prologue where the scientists are running, then getting picked off one by one. The last one to survive sends a distress call, and then the big creature bursts through the door.The team that goes to Mars is then talking about going on vacation, but the Rock gets an order, and they're off to Mars. Pretty straightforward.Now, here's the first game to movie difference. The portal is supposed to lead from Mars to hell. Not Earth to Mars.Now in the beginning, Reaper expresses fear of the place for some reason, and Sarge/the Rock is the only one who knows. Anyhow, once up there, the team is sent into the darker depths of the facility to neutralize the enemy, and keep them from harming the civilians. During most of the search and destroy scenes, it is mostly moving very slowly, peering around a corner, suspecting something to attack you, only to have it happen unexpectedly.The movie features spectacular special effects, not-so-corny and sometimes funny dialogue, awesome fight scenes, and great acting aside from the Rock saying, ""I'm not supposed to die"", before disappearing with the dead people.Now, here is another problem. A large bit of the movie is talking about how people get ""infected"" by what changes people into these creatures. This leads to boring but interesting lectures, and confusing moments. For example, the monsters in Doom, demons from hell, but in the movie, mutated humans. Also, when people are killed by the monsters, they come back to life, making it your average everyday zombie scene. Others become freaky mutants.However, this is mostly made up by the action and drama of the movie. So, really, as a movie, there are no really stupendous flaws.The FPS perspective scene is very innovative for movies, and very, very entertaining. There was not a moment where I was not on the edge of my seat, begging for the next action packed kill.The ending hand to hand fight scene kills the concept of shooting the enemy, but keeps the film from becoming boring and repetitive.Over all, this film, being the best film adaptation of all time, definitely kicking Resident Evil in the ass, and throttling Super Mario Bros.Basically, this film makes up for every of the few things it lacks, so if you love movies, or Doom, or both, do yourself a movie, and grab a few friends, and watch this movie at your local theatre.",Doom
455,masterofjustice82,Doom,6,28 October 2005,"Fans of the computer game may find themselves either satisfied or disappointed by director Andrzej Bartkowiak's interpretation of the video game. A so-so cast and a thin storyline are complemented with spectacular action sequences. It is truly up to the Doom fan to decide whether to walk away from the film smiling or completely dissatisfied.In the film, former WWE Wrestling superstar The Rock (real name Dwayne Johnson) is simply known as ""Sarge"" who is ordered to lead a team of Marines into a research facility on Mars in the year 2046. The other male lead in this film is John ""Reaper"" Grimm (Karl Urban) who at first is told to stay behind but travels with the team anyway because he has concerns for the safety of his sister Samantha (Rosamind Pike) who is a scientist on the planet. How they get to Mars is way different than I had ever imagined. They teleport there, not in the Star Trek way, but through a liquid-like orb that once sucked into it, will instantly land them inside the main hall of the facility. (Leaving the weary traveler sick to his stomach!) The team learns that an experiment went horribly wrong where a human injected with a gene-altering liquid turns the subject into a ferocious mutant. The task then turns to stay alive and get out or get infected and become one of the mutants.The action sequences are dazzling. The mutants are very well detailed. These things keep your attention as the movie progresses. What I do wish the film did more of was more first-person point of view angles like in the classic PC game I was playing when I was 12. They do this, but in the last 10 minutes of the film. The acting was sub par at best and the story is more like ""Resident Evil"" moonlighting as ""Doom"".",Doom

Waste of 10 bucks for sure. i mean ""Mario Bros."" was bad, ""Street Fighter"" was worse, but this may take the cake of proving why successful video games do NOT translate onto the movie screen. I mean, having the rock in it may attract wrestling fans, and people who are hardcore video game fanatics may get a kick out of one sequence, but fair-weather viewers be warned: this movie is not to be seen by human eyes. This would be better kept as a video game. the acting is terrible at best, and the fight sequences could use some work. the special effects are the film's one saving grace",Doom

It's a film BASED on a game, if it was supposed to be the same as the game it would be about 6 hours long and confuse the hell (excuse the pun) out of non gamers. I took my 15 year old son and his mates to see Doom and we all enjoyed it and yes I have played all the games and so has my son. Okay the acting isn't great but it sort of fits the acting in games, besides if you like to see good acting go watch Pride and Prejudice. Like I said earlier it's only based on the game so if you like a decent gore type horror flick go see and ENJOY, don't get so hung up about the game thing.",Doom
458,weskerian,A Diamond in the Rough,8,11 December 2005,"Since this movie has vastly more pros than cons, I'm going to discuss those cons first. There were really only two that I could find, the main reasons that kept me from scoring the movie with a perfect 10.The first is rather obvious: for a movie that was intended to come from Doom, there was not a lot of storyline staples apparent. There was no Hell, and having played Doom 3, I am now well aware that is what the whole game revolved around. Still, I think this is a minor point. I know some will disagree, but think about it: the violation of canon is nowhere near that of the Resident Evil or Mortal Kombat movies, since Doom doesn't have a rigid plot, AND, the movie's plot as it stands is excellent anyway, completely unlike the RE and MK movies.The second was a little more subtle, and that was the cliché. I'm sure everyone knows the old ""soldiers are called in, learn a disturbing truth and are soon slaughtered"" story; it happened in both Aliens and Resident Evil. This particular version is closer to Aliens, in that its half-way decent and entertaining rather than coma-inducing. Some of the characters were slightly underdeveloped and were really only used as meat like in so many other horror/action movies. However, there was a pleasing amount of breaking from the norm, which more than made up for these points.Now for the parts that warrant an 8/10 mark. The plot, while not Doom as already mentioned, is very good. Rather than a boring, wordy story that didn't match the action movie medium, or a standard, mindless action plot that did, they reached middle ground by presenting a plot that was worth a thought if you were that way inclined, and easily ignored if you weren't. Rather than having the demons materialising and killing people because they were from Hell, they built up a motive in the ""genetic blueprint for the soul"" angle. Personally, it brought quite a few moral dilemmas to my mind at the time, but I'm guessing some people just completely failed to catch on, either because they were more interested in the gore, or because they were too busy lamenting the lack of Hell. The plot is not about Hell at all, and I think that is why its wasted on Doom purists.The characters, as already mentioned, were sometimes cliché, but they also delivered some superb turns. Reaper, the main character, remained sombre and quiet throughout the entire movie, and only came into his own towards the end, when it was revealed he was in fact the Hero of the piece. At first it appeared that Sarge was the Hero, but it turned out in the end that he's only the hero when his mission dictates he can be. He offered a fresh perspective on the standard ""I'm not paid to think"" mercenary, and I think he was wonderfully realised by both the script writer and the Rock, who is a much better actor than people realise or give him credit for. On top of that, I really enjoyed seeing a rookie with the guts to defy a commanding officer when he found an order morally objectionable, and a guy willing to fist fight with an Imp despite being scared absolutely out of his wits.Another refreshing break from the well-worn movie clichés is the lack of romantic interest. A romantic interlude in this movie would have broken up the flow and ruined the characters, and I am glad that they decided to break the mould. The lack of any so-called ""tough women"" is also a nice change of pace, considering how much of a rash they are all over Hollywood now. Its nice that the fighting is done by people who actually look like they can do it, i.e. soldiers, and not by toothpicks in small red dresses (thank you Alice, that will be all).The main reason for this score, the bulk of it, comes from the overall feel of the movie. It and Doom 3 have a VERY similar atmosphere, from the lighting to the instrumentals, from the weapons to the monsters. It was this that made the movie, not the plot, which is unimportant, but the soul. The Resident Evil movies didn't capture the soul of the games. Not only did they completely disregard the rather rigid canon, but also the ""survival horror"" atmosphere. The places weren't remotely familiar, and the sense of terror and claustrophobia was replaced with a sequence of cheap action scenes. The atmosphere of Doom 3, however, runs deep in the movie, and if you play it you can see what inspired this.Another atmospheric issue was the first-person segment. I am aware that some people thought this was lame, but not me. It was the perfect compliment to a great movie, and the movie itself was already so much like the game in every way bar plot that adapting the camera format seemed like the next logical step. That segment even included the chainsaw, the Holy Grail of Doom armaments, and the ""Prod"" manoeuvre from the original Doom, which had me sniggering into my popcorn. I really enjoyed it.I can't believe that anyone can fault this thing on anything but the plot, and only because it was not Doom 3 canon. No movie has pleased me this much in many, many years. I mean, I signed up for IMDb just to review it. I think its a travesty that this movie is doing as badly as it is.Watch it, and if you are a Doom fan, at least TRY to keep an open mind about the plot.",Doom

What the heck was the people involved in the script thinking?! This is an ""outkast"" to what Doom should be about! There isn't even a lot of guts, which may not be important but i think it is! The storyline is also abit out of place. Overall the film is nothing what i expected it to be and i doubt anyone who is a real doom fan will find this to be a true reflection of the game!

The movie did not take much from the game except for a few monsters, a gun and the name. It is clear that if you are a Doom fan you shall be disappointed. The very nice demon and hell plot has been replaced by a weird Resident Evil-like plot. What a pity!!! So many films these days go with this strange fashion of ""zombies and viruses"" plots. A hell demons one would have been most refreshing. Anyway it must be said that the film does deliver a nice action movie for those not looking for any particular Doom references. I would give this a 5 out of 10 if it wasn't for the First-Person-Shooter sequence which i found very innovative. Therefor I shall give it a 6. Action fans will like this even if i think the film should be a rental movie. If you want to buy something get Doom 3 for PC.",Doom

This movie is clearly for WWE fans who have nothing better to do than watch a poorly made, terribly acted, and sinfully uncreative film about zombies...or a virus...or something, I'm not sure. It was hard to focus on the actual plot when you could only see terrible sets (a sewer in a highly technological science facility?), the awful special effects, the completely lame creatures, and the unbelievably terrible acting done by all of the characters (especially The Rock). He should've stuck to wrestling, film just doesn't do him any good.Either way, this movie was the worst waste of my time in my life, and if this review saves one person from seeing this pile of junk, my work will be done.",Doom
462,N/\S/\,Not bad at all,8,4 November 2005,"I have played all version of Doom and I guess making a move from this game must be a trade-off on many levels. The original ingame story is not something most players really care about - you just want to blow stuff up. Only in Doom3 the story element became a little more interesting, but still you basically only want to blow more stuff up. The first games had graphics so old by todays standards it would not be possible to make movie bases on images from them. Doom3 on the other hand looks great. And the Doom movie is obviously based on Doom3 which takes place in corridors and other tight spaces, mostly.Something all Doom games have in common is a really thick, ominous, dark and scary atmosphere. Very much because of the game soundtrack.The Doom movie soundtrack is also effective, but its not used as much as I hoped, but it works when its there. Its not the heavy rock theme I'm talking about - its the repetitive background theme. I hoped it would have been used more since anyone who played Doom2 knows how it almost drilled a hole through the the head - without being annoying, just hypnotizing.The locations are good but too few, I would have liked more locations to provide a larger feel of the station. And the sewers were felt very much out of place, they didn't seem to lead anywhere and should have been replaced by some other location.The Rock works very well as Sarge but judging by the end its fairly unlikely he will be in a sequel. He never turns into a cartoon with one-liners.They avoided all the usual errors that torpedoes and finally sinks these types of movies: no annoying kid(who's always too smart or too helpless), no screaming babe without the will to live, no contrived love story, no übercool heroes. Lets hope there will be a Doom 2 movie made by the same team, with a larger budget.",Doom
463,Braxus,Hell on Mars,7,28 October 2005,"When in 1993 the first part of the doom computer game series was released, it immediately became a cult classic. A very simple gameplay with stunning graphics and a good mixture of horror and action totally accounted for the complete lack of a story. In 2004 id software published the third part of the series which was more or less a technical update of its predecessors. After there have been rumors about a conversion of the game into a movie throughout the nineties obviously now with the commercial success of the third part the time was right to make the movie.From a serious critics point of view this film seems to fail for obvious reasons. So I think it is appropriate to turn the intellect one level down and to consider this movie from a video-game-made-to-movie perspective. Actually last year hasn't been such a bad year for video-game-based movies. Resident Evil: Apocalypse and Alien vs. Predator were more than half-decent adaptations. They transported the atmosphere of the original game and were action-packed, that's what I am expecting from this kind of movies. So filmmakers have learned a lot since the days of Mortal Kombat (well, maybe except Uwe Boll).Now what about doom? When after some minutes of the movie I was looking at the naked back of the Rock with a ""Semper Fi"" tattoo written on it I was thinking that this movie might be a trash fest. I was fantasizing about portals that would open where hordes of monsters would be leaking out, and about the Marine Squad shooting the them into pieces with blood and gore flying around just like in the first two parts of the game series. Well, it wasn't quite like that. The movie sticks very close to the atmosphere of the third game. The design of the research facility was taken nearly one by one out of the game. The story unfolds rather slowly, this might also be because there is not so much story to unfold at all. It is just your average mad-scientist scenario with a number of plot holes. The acting is mediocre at best with the social conflicts between the characters as stereotypical as they can be. So where does doom score? The movie creates a very claustrophobic atmosphere with many scenes shot in dark tunnels where the only light source is the flash light attached to the Marines guns. This atmosphere is supported by the nearly complete lack of any hostile encounter within the first 45 minutes. The action keeps pace with the story, firefights getting more intense as the movie proceeds. The final fight is in opposition to the ""the longer the movie runs, the bigger the monsters have to be"" rule, which was congenial to me. Altogether the action was neat not at least because it was well dosed and wasn't megalomaniac. Another essential feature of the game series was the violence and gore appearing in it. The movie is one of the goriest high-budget productions I have seen in years. People sometimes seem to forget that taking out the violence of an action or horror movie also takes out a lot of atmosphere. When used in the right place it can make a movie much more thrilling. And this is what Doom does very satisfactorily in opposition to Alien vs. Predator and Resident Evil: Apocalypse.Altogether I was pleasantly surprised, Doom continues the line of better recent video game conversions and even considered as a stand-alone B-movie it was far above average.",Doom
464,stvengoranmatthews,Not as bad as House of the Dead! But that's not saying much!,2,4 April 2006,"Well, what did i expect! I didn't expect Doom to be amazing but considering the calibre of the all-star cast and the relatively big budget of the production, i at least expected better than what i got. The original Doom computer game was brilliant, if incredibly violent and now with slightly dated graphics. The film is completely awful compared to the memorable computer game. The effects were okay and the basic storyline, although in no way strong, was what was expected considering the film is based on a computer game. The major disappointment for me was the acting. The Rock has never claimed to be a great actor and he proves that he isn't even a talented amateur with his monosyllabic presentation here. Rosamuind Pike, whom i dislike as much as that other Ultra-English Rose Kate Beckinsale, got some of the film's more stupid lines and delivered with trademark blandness. I thought Dexter Fletcher delivered the best performance, and also had some funny lines, but we didn't see enough of him, unfortunately. I liked the fact that Pike and Karl Urban's characters were siblings as opposed to starry-eyed lovers, that was an original feature in a decidedly unoriginal film. When the Rock turned bad at the end and went all gung-ho on his own team, that was also interesting, despite being totally out of character. Overall, i'd much rather be playing the original computer game, with its outdated graphics, because the film was a big letdown. However, like i said earlier, at least it wasn't House of the Dead! Thanx Steve",Doom
465,smshthestack,"In Doom the movie 'Hell breaks loose' only one thing, it doesn't.",3,4 May 2006,"OK, take the hype of Doom exploit it for large amounts of cash and run it through the intestines of Hollywood, out it comes and what have you got, that's right s**t. This is exactly what happens when you use a good computer game with the potential for a good movie (due to it's massive fan base) and turn it into drivel; very few references to the original game, first person shoot scene, Dr. Carmack, Sarge, Pinky, Dr Willits and the BFG, where is all the demonology that made the game so successful, where is all the demonology that made the game so successful (yes, that was worth mentioning twice), isn't that part of what Doom was all about, this game to screen conversion should probably be called (1950s style) genetic zombies from mars, at least the movies from the 50s are laughable. In one scene Richard Brake who was at the back of the group falls down a hole in the middle of a tunnel, can I ask just how everyone else managed to avoid this hole that was big enough for a marine wearing full weaponry and body armour to fall into and disappear, this is supposed to be serious, instead it's laughable. A bad remake of Resident Evil which isn't brilliant crossed between Wes Craven's Mind Ripper (which was a much better low budget film), not even the music of Clint Mansell or the special effects save this film, bad acting, bad story & bad screenplay, it felt like watching Resident Evil again made by a director not as good as Paul Anderson which takes some beating; a hamburger film for zombie newbie's and a wet dream for teenagers at best. The whole film is just cheesed up to the max to get the ratings, the storyline is sparse with bits of science thrown in at random to speed the storyboard along, the action is average and too little too late as well as all the gore being toned down for the kiddies to reduce the certificate and appeal to a broader audience span and increase marketing. If I actually paid to watch this movie I would demand a full refund, thanks be to Satan that I didn't. I've seen some bad horror & zombie movies spanning thirty years, Doom tries to be a good action zombie flick but doesn't hold any of the elements that make a good horror, thriller or action movie, little gore, no suspense, no pace, more action backed with believable suspense and a supporting storyline may have improved it a little. If these guys can get the financial backing to make something like this with actors that probably demand fair pay then the potential is limitless to what can be achieved with the right team who strive to make it work, not just saying, 'oh well that'll do we're happy with it it'll make a decent profit from the biggest audience' (the teen scene), is it all OK Mr. Producer.Do they have a rule book in Hollywood that every mass profit film has to pass certain criteria in order to get financial backing, a good film is done well when it stays true to the original story, game or book, you don't have to put characters in that will appeal to everyone, just make a good film without being too obvious, in Doom you've got the silent Asian guy for the eastern fans, the girl for the female fans, the British guy for the Brits who is also disabled for the disabled fans, the homosexual for the homosexual fans, the black guy for the black fans and the white guy for the white fans, do we really need this just to appeal to as many audiences as possible as if people can't understand or relate to the movie if there isn't a character in it for them and what is happening at the end, the big black guy vs white guy scene, wtf, both have specialist combat training, both are infected and both have no weapons, one difference, the rock is about four times as big so how does he lose, well the answer is because the white guy is the good guy and he therefore must be more intelligent and has to win to bring a sense of order back to return to the classic Hollywood ending, give me a f***ing break, I'm surprised the rock actually chose to be Sarge, wouldn't it be more positive and original to have a black guy playing the hero instead of the bad guy. If you're going to take on a computer game that already has a large fan base who is expecting something decent at least try and stay true to the original storyline, not remove everything that made the game interesting and cash in which seems to be the thing to do in todays world.",Doom

It wasn't until I saw the movie the second time I started laughing.With lines such as, ""Semper Fi, Mother******"" being the the the most brilliantly written parts of the movie, you know you've been swindled out of the five and half bucks it cost you to rent this train wreck. The dialogue that was intended to be clever and witty made me actually want to rape and kill the nearest nun or person of the cloth.The acting wasn't all that bad, but some of the characters seemed outrageously stereotypical. You have the radical Christian guy who slices open his arm for taking the lord's name in vain; you've got the creepy white guy who peddles drugs and makes 'hysterical' jokes like, ""I'm afraid I'm, eh, gonna have to, uh, strip search you fine ladies;"" and you've got the die-hard, no-nonsense sergeant who'll stop at nothing to get his men home safely. Of course, he does shoot one of them in the face for no particular reason.The Rock undergoes a complete and instantaneous personality change partway through the movie. He watches a video that shows doctors injecting a serum into a man strapped to a table. After watching this, The Rock screams, ""I DIDN'T SEE SH*T! I AIN'T PAID TO SEE SH*T!"" From that point on, The Rock decides it's his duty to murder all the civilians he comes across, when before that, he was a relatively nice guy.And if you expected this to be a scary movie, you can wipe your hopes right off your face. The scariest part of this movie is a monkey hiding in an air vent. Yeah, that's right. A monkey. In a vent. It jumps out and goes, ""CREEWEAEAE!"" Instead of getting scaring the hell out of people like it was intended to do, half the theater was laughing. What kind of lame movie needs a cheap Cat-In-The-Cupboard scare to keep it interesting?Doom. Oh, and if you were expecting this to be anything even close to the game, don't get your hopes up. The font of the main title was same, but after that the movie just wandered further and further into the swirling grey cloud of stupidity.Acting: 5/10 Dialouge: 2/10 Story: 4/10 Overall Rating: 4/10I would not recommend buying this movie.

The humour came not so much from the script, which was fairly transparent, or from the acting, which was average, but from the directing and camera work. Amusing camera angles were used when appropriate, and the general attitude of the characters (especially towards the end) had me in stitches (probably to the annoyance of other movie goers). If anything let the movie down, it would have to have been the 'old-school horror'-style plot and the lack of any military bearing by the marines. Seriously, they did nearly everything wrong and deserved everything they got because of it. It had an almost 'Aliens' feel to it in places, but where Aliens tried to develop an empathy with the characters, you just knew why most of these guys were there...

I say so freaking what? Lets have a look at what we are dealing with shall we. Firstly we all know how popular and awesome the Doom games and naturally turning it into a movie was gonna be an effort. Well least they tried I say and a decent effort it was. You see people have to realize if you made a carbon copy of the games it would fail much more because people would think ""why watch something we have played through before?"" which is my point. The filmmakers obviously seen this, seen how difficult making a Doom movie would be and thus decided to go for something new in the Doom universe.If they had all the monsters etc coming from hell in the movie then there goes all believability and realism out the window. The whole virus angle was a bit silly yes but look at it this way...at least it added some realism and still gave us the demons we loved killing even if there weren't very many. If they make a sequel which would be cool then they can still use the whole hell thing easy done, they did in this one if people actually noticed properly...And the first person sequence? Now that was so much like Doom in the way it was shot (excuse the pun), the random appearances of the enemies, and the atmosphere itself.

475,Hamiel,To Doom or not to DooM?,3,4 November 2005,"Being a vivid DooM gamer from as early as circa 1993 and knowing that ID software was involved in this movie, I had high expectations.But then the bad news started to appear... Rumours began emerging saying there would be no hell, no Mars and no teleports; all essential parts of the original games. ""Ok, these are just rumours"", I thought to myself, putting my faith in the games' development team, ID Software, which I thought would keep an eye on the production and keep it true to the games. Fortunately, later on it was confirmed that it would indeed be set on Mars and that kept my hopes up, even though they decided to go with B-rate actors.After seeing the movie I felt disappointed, realizing ID Software had completely sold out itself. Nothing in this movie is worth the title ""DooM"", except for the props, the monsters and the weapons. The movie to me felt like a Resident Evil clone set on Mars and if you ask me this movie should have been titled ""Resident Evil: In Mars... with Bigger Guns... and Bigger Monsters"".A major disappointment for me was that the producers decided to remove hell from the movie. The idea of the monsters originating from hell was an important aspect in the games. I'm guessing the producers decided to remove the hell part from the movie because of the large population of Christians in USA, thinking it would scare them away from the box office. Doing so, they completely betrayed the gamers, so their plan backfired badly.Viruses, cheesy one-liners, untalented actors, and not staying true to the original games' themes compel me to give this movie 3 stars. One for the creative FPS scene, one for the monsters and one for the props.If you ask me, this movie doesn't deserve to be called DooM!",Doom
476,sheepskin404,One of the worst movies ever,1,27 February 2008,"In all seriousness, and perhaps it was because I actually saw this in theaters and spent 8.50 at the time... but this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The worst part is, of course, that it wasn't even the acting (""The Rock"" yet again displays why he should never act in anything other then the wwa), but the screen play and dialog which normally isn't important at all in a movie like this, sort of was. It would have been better with grunting, NO I'm serious, it really would have been. If you are in the mood for something to MST3K drunk with friends, by all means, the only thing this has going for it is special effects which are actually alright, but shinies will only get you so far. The set looks like it was made out of a plastic factory, the guns were about as lifelike as dead wood, and believe me, things being blown up was very prevalent. The only thing this movie delivered on was overly gruesome gore and humor. I just had to laugh at some points. If you haven't realized yet, basing a movie on an FPS that has a plot of ""kill everything and what you can't kill blow up"" should never be put on a movie.",Doom

Still that isn't nearly as much of an atrocity as completely discarding everything that's Doom, or well, they have retained some resemblances with Doom as they said. Resemblances like them having guns, and them having to shoot bad guys. It's nothing but another shite movie about a bunch of roughnecks with big boomsticks fighting with more sprinter zombies, hence I vote to rename this movie to ""Resident Evil 2: RE on Mars"" and stop this good for nothing possé of ""actors and scriptwriters"" from dragging along with Doom's fame because they can't produce anything good of their own.",Doom

Well, ""Alien Vs. Predator"" had recently come out. It's just people looking for monsters in a spaceship. They even directly rip off the dialogue from ""Predator"".

In order to avoid spoilers, I'll just say this - if it weren't for the title, it would be difficult if not impossible to tell that the movie was based on the game. I wanted the movie to reflect the game - I wanted to see the hero fight his way through hellish encounters with a variety of horrible monsters. I wanted to see settings that filled me with dread, and artifacts that hinted at horror unleashed. Instead, I got . . . well, it might was well have been ""Tom and Jerry Meet Marvin the Martian"".

Do you enjoy sci-fi shoot-em-ups?If you answered Yes to:0 of 3: You will not like this movie. Seriously, don't bother. This movie does not make any designs on being an Oscar winner. It is designed for one purpose only, and you watching it and then complaining about how bad it was would be pointless.

You find yourself squirming for joy at some parts, and trying to figure other parts out - in a good way...3 of 3: You will see it more than once, and you will be calling the studios asking for free goodies.

The directer tries to get cheap scares out of you with loud noises and bad lighting. BUT! Persevere. The second half of this film is AMAZING! Sure its gory as hell and deserves the 18 rating that it never had but it's so exciting. The first person scene is simply stunning and the twist in the storyline involving Sarge is outstanding. I cannot see people's problem with this film. The special effects are stunning (apart from the opening arm disembowelment scene.). The monsters rock. Its super jumpy and the gore is totally realistic. Go see it, you'll hate it and then love it. I've never played the game before but i sure will now.

483,x_Drizzt_x,What did this movie have to do with Doom?,4,29 October 2005,"This movie is, hands down, the worst movie experience I've ever had. They didn't even use any piece of the plot the Doom 3 game had, despite it being the same time and place as the game. They also destroyed the one untouchable thing in all things Doom; Sarge. The Sarge character was more mangled than a cheeseburger coming out the other end. I can't go into detail unfortunately, you'll see if you have 8 dollars in your pocket that happen to be covered with Anthrax powder and you are forced to give it to the movie ticket salesman to stop him from shipping teenage girls to other countries forcing them to work in brothels and Doom is the only movie showing in the entire theater.Everything else aside, the movie was quite entertaining. If I hadn't played doom 3, or any other doom movie ever made, I would have loved it. I, however, have far too much loyalty to Doom than to harbor anything but hatred of this movie.",Doom
484,duk_,Oh so almost there,5,2 January 2006,"If you want to enjoy the movie adaption of Doom, leave the movie after about halfway into its running time, because that's how the quality of this movie is distributed. The movie has a wonderfully paced set-up and just collapses into one too many cliché pitfalls that Hollywood seems to have invented. Act one: Right from the start of this movie, it's extremely obvious that director Andrzej Bartkowiak was a cinematographer before he was a director. His shots seem to prevent that ""mass-produced space Hollywood back-lot studio"" feel that poster-child-for-mediocrity Uwe Boll has become a master at and that's what will let most skeptics breathe a massive sigh of relief. The greatest surprise then comes when you start seeing fleshed out characters that actually have near-equal amounts of screen time. And it's that pacing that gets this movie on the right track. We're then introduced to the research facility and given just snippets about these monsters and their patterns of behavior. Not so little that we're not interested, but not so nearly enough that we have everything figured out. I enjoyed one of Bartkowiak's earlier movies, ""Romeo Must Die"", because he actually dared to try to find some truth in the material (corruption will grow wherever you allow hatred to, regardless of what side you're on). And that is the same here, there is an obvious passion for the ""something's horrifically wrong and beyond our explanation-now people will start dying"" type of story and I honestly believe that Bartkowiak milked the best part about that material and tried to keep it running the movie for as long as he could. But it couldn't go like that forever, which brings us to Act two: Dave Callaham and Wesley Strick managed to create the most disappointing, most cliché ridden second act in a movie in the history of film. And, thanks to the quality of the first act, these letdowns are so obvious. The following cliché happens in every single streamlined action movie: One of the team loses composure and starts worrying about something other than survival and will kill other team members to protect it, and, as a result, all hell breaks lose and the person that blows it will pay the price. The choice to do this is quite possibly the worst choice to make. We're dealing with monsters, why can't underestimating them actually BE the problem? The first act made this completely possible and almost any adventure sci-fi that chooses to stick to its primary conflict excels for doing so. Not here though, Callaham and Strick force a villain and a climax that has so little to do with the beginning of the movie, that all kinds of rhetorical analysis will render this script as ""crap"". Bartkowiak tries to keep things going, but it's rather obvious and hopeless that writing choices make this movie so unsalvagable. Anyway, as you expect, we start losing team members and eventually end up with all hell breaking lose. Then we get the famous ""FPS"" sequence, which, for anyone that has not played the game before, is basically meant to mimic the game. The funny thing here is that this sequence is actually a whole lot of fun and it captures what there is to like about Doom, carnage and sense of surviving as the fittest. However, this one entertaining exception to act two sets up for the biggest disappointment of the film. The finale: Survival movies have a basic set-up for it's conflict. The characters that have managed to survive are greeted with the source of the chaos and must confront it to get out alive. Whether it be standing toe to toe with raptors, fighting the queen alien, or tackling the masked killer instead of running away. Doom instead chooses to go with a much weaker route - fighting our quickly created villain mentioned earlier, that's right. We travel to Mars and learn about these creatures to watch two marines fight each other, then the movie is over. This is Doom! People are itching for a marine to cut down a gigantic monster with a gigantic gun! Instead we get a non-sensical character choice that was harder to script and attempt anyway. Short summary: Good cinematography and excellent pacing in the first act that is spoiled by unjustified character choices and horrible choice in climax. I recommend the first 45 minutes of this movie, then go home and play the game.",Doom
485,tjewu,Wow!!! why do they let Hollywood touch video games.,1,24 October 2005,"I just watched DOOM over the weekend and I must say, it pretty much sucked. I had low expectations going into the movie...I mean look at the history of video game to movie adaptations: Resident evil 1 and 2, Alone in the dark, super mario bros., street fighter, and lets not forget house of the dead. But I did try and stay positive before I went to the movie with hopes that someone in Hollywood would surprise me and make a good adaptation.***SPOILERS*** Well the movie started pretty good and did a good job of getting involved right away and stuck pretty good to the source material for the most part. They talked about the genetic research they were doing and about the dig that they were doing down into mars. Unfortunately after the quick part about the dig into mars they never talk about it again, it was kind of weird. Then it goes into how they did genetic research on human subjects changing their DNA. Apparently this is where the monsters were coming from because only a certain percentage of the population was capable of turning into monsters because they held some evil gene (makes no freaking sense). And to everyones surprise they got out some how. I immediately was taken into a resident evil movie and no one told me. By the end of the movie it was just a freaking zombie movie...which is bullsh*t. To top it all off, the last fight was retarded with ""the rock"" and ""Reaper"" doing a WWE fight while they are both super human soldiers...completely lame.The problem I have with this movie is that it didn't even come close to following the source material except for at the beginning when it was trying to setup the story. If anyone has ever played DOOM 3 and finished it, they will tell that the research they are doing and the dig on mars is true, but while doing that they unleash a gateway to hell and that is where the monsters come from. Those monsters and hell are then trying to reach earth through a distress signal that is sent out to earth to bring as many reinforcements as possible. They were going to kill everyone and then take the ships back to earth. Not this freaking DNA change crap. Now I know they never showed the marines going down to the dig or showed it up close so theoretically it could still be there for the sequel, but that is stupid. The major plot of the game just gets dropped for some other stupid story about zombies. I could have stayed home and watched a good zombie movie ""Dawn of the dead."" So, basically if you want to watch a zombie movie, watch one that you already own or can go rent some where else. Avoid this dogpile.",Doom
486,trigger_happy15,For you people who don't pay attention to movies...,8,22 October 2005,"Alright first this contains a couple spoilers.OK, for certain people who I will leave nameless who like to comment on movies without seeing them, specifically those of you who claim that Doom had nothing to do with Hell. Next time you decide to sit down and watch a movie, pay attention.The movie first of all was a starting point for the Doom series. It didn't get deep into a discussion about Hell simply because as a bunch of leading scientists, how could you logically explain that Hell is releasing demons...you cant because there is no way to prove that, as like most of religion.So if you paid attention in the film, you would hear them hinting towards it in order to stay true to the Doom story line. When they are talking about how the demons were choosing who to attack and infect, they mention that 10% of human DNA is still unmapped, saying that some people believe it is the genes of the soul, at which point John adds something along the lines of how they control violent tendencies and other things. Now if we actually use our minds here, we will think, ""Gee, genes of the soul...hmmmm maybe it has something to do with our souls...and maybe souls have something to do with Hell too...hmmmm"". As for what John said, about how some of those genes cause violent tendencies...it's explaining how the worst parts of humanity are being exploited by this Chromosome 24, which if again we think about it, Hell would be an incarnation of the worst parts of humanity.So in conclusion, Doom doesn't come straight forward and say ""Hey people, this movie is about Hell."" Instead it actually gets us to think about what is going on, and to make it a some what plausible story line. Given this, all of you people who complain about how ""Doom isn't about Hell"", well you are totally wrong. Maybe next time you go see a movie pay attention and think about what is happening, and if you don't like actually having to interpret what they are saying, go watch a Disney movie that will hold your hand all the way through and tell you exactly what's going on!",Doom
487,rkreh19,Doomed!,2,24 October 2005,"Video Games movies have disappointed me since day one. The first of a long line of video game based films started for me with the ""Super Mario Bro's"" film of the early 90's, and Hollywood continues to disappoint when trying to bring our most beloved games to the big screen. They have successfully ruined many of games franchises in the transition, the most notably being the ""Resident Evil"" series, and the most recent being ""Doom"". Growing up as part of the ""Nintendo Generation"", these games are very close to my heart. Gaming has matured from its humble roots, and has grown into a multi billion dollar industry that continues to out gross Hollywood. The film ""Doom"" is based on a computer game developed by John Carmack in the early 90's. This game has been met with great controversy over the years, and was even blamed for the behavior of the Columbine shooters in April 1999. The ""Doom"" video game has always been at the forefront of Controversy due to its violent content. The game is a FPS (first person shooter), in which a team of Marines is called to a distant planet that has been overrun with demons and the undead after scientists unknowingly open a portal to hell. Your job in the game is to dispatch these monstrosities with a wide assortment of big guns, and save the day. The film is similar in that it involves Marines being called out to a base on Mars after several scientists are brutally killed by an unknown force. In the Film, the monsters are not demons unleashed through a portal to hell; instead they are people whose DNA has been genetically altered by the scientists. Using DNA of an extinct race of ""superhuman Martians"" with 24 chromosomes on human subjects, they intend to create a ""super"" human race. But of course, the plan doesn't go as intended, and as the tag line implies ""All Hell Breaks Loose"". One thing that really annoys me about the film is the storyline with the altered DNA, and mutants. How many times has this been done? Too many for me to count. There were a few good points to the movie, such as its lighting. The film was very dark, as it should be. The excessive shadows made for decent suspense as you waited for something to jump out of the darkness as the character walked by, and in some cases this was very effective. I The lighting in this film was reminiscent of the ""Alien"" films, which ""Doom"" tries so hard to be. The sound effects in this film were also very effective. As I mentioned, the film is very dark, leaving a lot of shadows. A major part of the doom game is gun play, and this movie doesn't disappoint. The weapons in the films range from machine guns to the famed BFG (big freaking gun) from the game series. The sound effects for the weapons are impressive, the front the rapid fire automatic machine gun fire, to the futuristic sounding BFG.Other than ""The Rock"", I didn't recognize any of the actors from other films, so I am assuming they were all unknowns. Although any of the other actors were more talented than ""The Rock"". I consider ""The Rock"" to be the modern equivalent of Arnold Schwarzenegger, all muscle, and no acting ability (Vin Diesel would fit in this category as well). ""The Rock's performance was mediocre at best, and his acting ability was most likely the comic relief in the film. I would also like to note that one of the characters was named Carmack, which I am sure was to pay homage to the games creator John Carmack. The films cinematography was the only saving grace. For the most part it wasn't anything extraordinary, but there was a sequence at the end of the film that was highly original. This scene was shot in the same ""First Person Perspective"" as the game. In the game you see things from the perspective of the character, staring down the barrel of a gun. I think this was the best part of the film, as it has never been done before as far as I have seen, and it definitely captures the feel of the game. This sequence was very effective; although I am glad the whole film wasn't shot in such a fashion.The special effects were decent in this film as well. The biggest digital effects I noticed were the blast of the BFG gun. But the one thing I was most impressed with was the creatures. Although the creatures looked similar to other monsters of Hollywood past, what really impressed me was that they weren't completely digital. I have always preferred makeup creature effects that have been done well, over digital ones. I can always tell when a monster is digital, and a lot of the time looks fake to me. I think digital creatures should be saved for things that actors can't play (like Jurassic Park). A good example of this is the werewolf transformation scene form American Werewolf in London compared to its sequel, Paris. When everything was said and done, and the credits rolled, I couldn't help but feel disappointed, although I have gotten used to this feeling after being let down so many times with ""Video game adaptations"". With the big screen adaptations of two more of my favorite games announced, ""Silent Hill"" and ""Halo"" (being directed by Peter Jackson), I hope that Hollywood can get it right. I am starting to give up on game adaptations. ""Doom"" is a no-brain action flick. If you are into films that have lame ex- wrestlers turned actors running around shooting guns for 2 hours, then Doom is the movie for you. If you want a film with more depth, and originality, then board up your windows and steer clear of this one. Oh, did you hear ""Doom"" made over $50 Million its opening weekend? Suckers",Doom

It had to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting was terrible, the story had nothing to do with the game in any way, and the 1st person scene, though a good idea, was cheesier than all of France. The only reason I never gave this a 1 was because the CG on the monsters was really well done.I can understand some fans of the game trying to defend it simply because it's Doom, but please, use the film critic in you and not the game critic and put this movie in it's place next to some other famed game to movie conversions, ie. Super Mario Bros., Street Fighter, and Mortal Kombat Annihilation.In conclusion, garbage.",Doom

They do it every time. They managed to take the best video game shooter ever and turn it into Resident Evil in space. As an action movie, it's okay. Being DOOM, it should have been great. I thought I had heard a couple years ago that Id would keep creative control over the movie, obviously they didn't. I guess they were too afraid of the demons from hell part of the original story. The casting is solid, and the violence is what Doom should be, but the story isn't. What really sucks, is we'll probably never see a real DOOM movie after this. We'll probably see a crappy direct to video sequel (Band Camp anyone?). I will give them credit for the first person shooter sequence, which rocks. If you're looking for a good shoot 'em up movie, check it out (or check out Resident Evil for the same effect). If you're a hardcore DOOM fan like myself, be ready to be pi**ed.",Doom
491,Tominatorxx,Why DOOM?,6,5 July 2016,"First of all, I kinda like this film for what it is: an action/horror movie. But I have no idea why the DOOM name is attached to it. As a big fan of the games I can safely say there is not much in this film that is faithful to its source material. Now there are similarities between this film and the DOOM games (as you would expect) but there are also many things that are completely different from the games.So the film is set on Mars like one part of the games is (the other being Hell which I will come back to later in this review) in a facility where all hell broke loose (pun intended). A special team of highly trained soldiers is sent there to investigate and to terminate the threat.Now this is already the first big difference. DOOM games are well known for having a nameless character starring as the protagonist. We all refer to him as our beloved Doomguy. Now do I think the director made a mistake by not following the game in that aspect? Not really to be honest. It would be almost impossible to make a film in which the protagonist doesn't say a word. You could ask yourself: ""Then why would you make a film based on a game like DOOM?"". And to be honest I don't know why you would.But I have to say that the idea of soldiers sent in by UAC is possibly the best they could come up with. At least that way you can have conversations in your film.Now back to the story. Without spoiling everything. The reason why these monstrosities are causing havoc has something to do with chromosome science. They want to create superhumans by adding 1 chromosome to people. Turns out the test subjects (criminals) become monsters after they get injected with the 24th chromosome. The reason? I'm not going to spoil that. But honestly it is basically pure nonsense.The people who read the previous paragraph and played the DOOM games will immediately notice something... Where are the demons from hell? Well they aren't in the film, in fact they never go to hell either. I know... a DOOM film without demons from hell... is not a real DOOM film in my opinion.What is in the film though is the BFG (though for some reason it shoots blue energy instead of green plasma).If you read this review up to this part, you might as well be reading a review about a film adaptation of Resident Evil. Monsters and zombies created by questionable science projects, a team of trained operatives which is send to investigate. Only differences are: we are in a science facility on Mars instead of a creepy mansion. Characters can even get infected by the monsters in the movie. In the games the monsters from hell just kill you. That's it. Onto the good things about this film then. Most of the characters are enjoyable to watch, the acting is good, the atmosphere is very well done (very DOOM 3 like), the special effects are pretty good for a 2005 film and the soundtrack is very good as well. And I should of course also mention the FPS section of the film, which is really well done. It's quite impressive actually, if you consider that the film came out in 2005. Nowadays it's easy with GOPRO cameras but back then it must have been really hard to pull off.All in all I have to say that I enjoyed the film. Mostly because of its atmosphere and not because it's a good DOOM film. In fact if I would rate it purely on the basis of it being faithful to DOOM, I would probably give it a 3 out of 10.But if you watch this film and can look at it as an original idea that isn't based on a certain game, then I think you might like it for what it is. Me personally, I'm kind of torn between giving it a 5 or a 6 out of 10. It's an okay film. I'll probably give it a 6 just because that FPS section was really well done and the atmosphere was definitely good as well.Don't expect anything great from this film. It's pure popcorn entertainment. And it's pretty good popcorn entertainment.",Doom

It was almost predictable, in fact, just when I thought I'd seen every cliché' move, and every possible style of action, I began to think, where's the hand to hand stuff. Sure enough, about two minutes later, there it was. The ""Game View"" was choppy and confusing, and for the time you saw it in the pre-views, was only slightly longer. The game looked better than what they did.Like I said I didn't expect much, but when it was all said and done, I figured I could look at it as 90 minutes I'll never get back, or 90 minutes I'll never get back, that I paid $8.50 for.

The Rock as Sarge was perfect, along with Keith Urban as Reaper. I have seen almost all video game movies and I have to say this one is with out a doubt, the best.

The FPS was AWESOME, I was afraid I was gonna puke when I first heard about it, but was only disoriented for a very short time right when it started, then I wanted it to last longer. I am going to buy it the day it comes out and watch it some more.Fun, Funny, Action, Scary Movie!!!!",Doom
496,Eye_of_Chaos,There's NO HELL,5,21 October 2005,"First off, I loved the game, and loved the story, but the thing I hated about the move was that....There's NO HELL. In the game you fight your way to Hell and back. And thats what I thought this movie was going to be, a portal opens up releasing demons....but no. just mutants. And there was only 2 creatures, the Pinky, who was a mutant man, and imps who were mutant people, no demons, no Hell knight, no Archiviles, Wraths, Machubus, Charibum, Trite, Lost souls, etc. If they would have followed the storyline of Doom 3, the movie would have made A lot more sense. I mean I didn't even get the story, cause I was waiting for a ""Hell"" scene. I loved the Doom3 story, and they did make the ancient civilization exist, but it had no relevance. All I'm saying is that when you think of Doom, you think of Hell breaking loose, the only thing that even hinted evil was something about a virus attacking evil souls.....but it made no reference to demons, hell, anything. and no Hellknight..waaaaa. The script was lousy, but I expected that, and none of the weapons except the BFG, was there. No doubled barreled shotgun???Thats what made Doom famous. The game scared me, due to the evil spirits and voices, none of that here. And wheres Dr. Betrugerand the Gateway to Hell? The best part was the FPS, which was awesome, but only lasted for like 5 min. The ending was dumb, and was a Resident Evil fight scene. And the characters mutating if injected with some virus thing...R.E. The movie would have been more original and made better sense, if they would have followed the game...but why didn't they? And where's all the demons? I mean the shooting and gore was OK, but nothing scary. So if you are expecting this to be like the game...No its not, I'm like the biggest Doom freak out there, and was so disappointed in the plot. SO to make it clear...no Hell, no demons, no evil voices. Just bad scripts and one small pinky.",Doom

498,Ken7i,"""We're marines, not poets""",8,31 October 2005,"mentioned during the conversation between the Grimm siblings (I don't know what else to call them). It pretty much summarizes the film. Don't expect poetry in this movie. It is action, a bit of thriller and horror, and a lot of blood.Characters are in black and white, which goes well with a film that explores good and evil in the most simplistic of manners - by personifying the good into angels and the bad into terrible monsters. We have the typical conflicted hero (John), religious fanatic (Goat), protocol-addicted soldier (Sarge), the unprincipled rogue (Portman, I think  the guy who likes she-males), the flirt (Duke), the strongman (Destroyer) and the kid (the kid). I'm being a bit slack with character descriptions, but I think that really describes them all. All are black and white, as I said.And beautiful because of that.It is beautiful in the way a hot, saucy playboy cover is; in its simplicity. It's not the kind of beauty that requires loads of thinking; its not 'abstract art'. The script-writer conveys his ideas, or I should say judgment, through the fates met by each character. Goat for example, a religious maniac, dies and turns into one of those demon zombies. The message conveyed is clear. Religion is not to be equated with good. It is simply a path to good. Goat uses religion to fight the devil within himself when he wakes up after apparent death and crashes himself against the glass walls. Similar arguments apply for all the characters. I'm going to stop here before I get too preachy.The weakest part of the film is when 'the Rock' turns bad; the audience is not prepared for that sufficiently in my opinion. I say he turns 'bad' because he kills the kid. It's difficult to deny his 'evil' after that act, otherwise, one could simply attribute his fate to his enthusiasm to 'follow orders'.I enjoyed the movie. I loved the fact that the director focused more on action than on horror. There were a few sudden and shocking parts, but all quickly balanced by the humor ( I still laugh over the 'big, fat gun' I'm easily amused), and intense fight scenes (my favorite is the Destroyer's  very raw action. Really sets the adrenaline to pumping). I recommend that any who watch it, watch for what it is. A video game adaptation.",Doom
499,Marv1179,Doom Doominates,9,4 November 2005,I know the critics hated this film. But its not supposed to be an Oscar winning picture. Its a horror flick. However this film is by far the best VG adaptation to date. I loved the plot. I personally dislike the Rock but he was awesome in Do0m. Karl Urban is a true anti-hero! The effects were nothing short of extraordinary. Warning this film is not for children. The gore level is extremely high. However like every other film it is not without flaws. Some plot holes needed to be filled. I do wish it was longer. But this film overall was awesome. My favorite part was the First -person segment. The only reason to pass this film down is because of a weak stomach. The reason this film received 9/10 is because there is always room for improvement :) See this movie now!!!!,Doom
500,kylegraper,A Part of Me Just Died,3,18 October 2005,"I just came back from a sneak preview showing an hour ago, so what I just witnessed is still fresh in my mind. If, like me, you are a fan of the series, esp. Doom 3, and think this movie may be a fun way to blow to hours, go back to your computer and put the game in. This movie manages to ruin everything I liked about that game. First and most offensive, was the plot. Doom 3 follows a single Marine trapped in a Mars research facility as Hell literally breaks lose around him. During the testing of new teleportation equipment, scientist opened a portal to Hell. Not the greatest in the world, but it makes for a Hell of a game, pun unintended. The writers of the movie took a dump on this story. Instead is some genome bull that either turns good people into supermen, or bad people into hideous monsters. So The Rock, John Urban, and a few other highly stereotyped marines (including ""the asshole, the Jesus freak, the newbie, and of course the ""tough black guys"" go to kill everything that movies. Oh, yeah and some bull about Urban's sister, a cold set, and dead parents, woohoo! If you like action, don't see this. If you like adventure, don't see this. If you like movies, don't see this. And, above all, if you value your appreciation of Doom, an excellent game series, do not see this movie. Thank me later.",Doom
501,Zeiramrei,Watching someone play the game would be more entertaining.,1,22 October 2005,"After having the royalty of viewing this movie on opening night, I have lost all faith in the entertainment industry. I knew this movie was going to be bad from the previews, but I didn't expect to be bored out of my mind in the process.During this film I was reminded of Resident Evil nearly the entire time. An elite task force is called to ""Secure"" a secret science facility. They find zombies and monsters. They get picked off one by one, until two are left which become enemies at the end, in a show down thats so cheesy, you'd wish you had milk to wash it all down. The film was far too short, didn't explore much of the lab (and none of Mars for that matter) and didn't really build much of an atmosphere. Most of the movie was shot in a lab to be honest.A couple things weren't that bad in this movie. These were two of the science labs that were modeled correctly after the game, and the First Person Shooter scene for a grand total of two minutes of pleasure. Other than that, there was no suspense, all the marines died in the same fashion that the teens from Scream did, and there were a grand total of 4 unique monsters in the entire film. The typical zombie, the imp, the hell knight and the mutated dog from Doom 3. None of the monsters worked together, or were every on the scene at the same time, minus the zombies at the end.The special effects were something out of sci-fi films that you'd see on TV, and most of the monsters were shot in suits, not CGI, giving them unrealistic movement and in particular scenes, laughable. The weapons started out unique, but you didn't get to see much of them in action. Only the BFG really had a time to shine, as the other marines didn't get to use their guns much at all.In summarize, I believe this film is on par with Anaconda. It was more of a teen slasher movie than it was a horror film, and I thought it was poorly coordinated. The movie didn't pick up until the very end, and when it did it ended so abruptly, it was like driving your car into a concrete wall.",Doom
502,movieman1124,Decent flick. Definitely best Video game movie,4,21 October 2005,"First thing that i did enjoy about this movie before it ever came out was that i did NOT see directors Paul W.S. Anderson or Uwe Boll. Right then I knew I wouldn't be seeing CRAP. What I do not get is how Hollywood keeps giving them movies to direct. But different story.so i just got out of this film about an hour ago. I have been looking forward to it for little over a month now. I worked at a theater and there were posters and cardboard standees showing off the first person view shooter mode. Well get to that a little later.At first I was thinking that it was starting a little bit slow. Which was OK because of course they need to tell some story to those who have never played the game. However, once they do start showing some of the monsters when arriving on Mars the suspense starts to rise. Just know they show slight images and shadows of the creatures at first.Acting in this movie was not that bad. Not that much cheesiness. Just of course all the references they would make about hell and demons. Rock wasn't to bad in it. I was actually happy on how his character turned out.Now on to the first shooter view. Hey it was pretty good. The only problem was it was one long duration shot of one character, yes I know like the game, but the problem was the monsters weren't fast enough. And some of them would just stand there and not attack. I liked the first person view I just feel they should have done it for all the soldiers and cutting back from first person to third person views.Now after that happened the movie died. I loved the beginning and the middle but then ending fight scene was a little lame. But hey this is only my opinion.",Doom
503,hodson_2008,"I LOVE the game, but the movie was thoroughly disappointing...",4,24 October 2005,"DOESN'T GIVE AWAY TOO MUCH, DON'T WORRY!!!! I've been playing DOOM and DOOM II since I was 4 years old. A friend got DOOM 3 about 6 months ago. I love the original two. The third was okay. I've read the books at least four times (execpt the third...let someone borrow it, never got it back.)I was PSYCHED when I heard the movie was coming out. But, then I read the previews. I mean, does anyone see how The Rock can fit as Flynn Taggart??? If anything, I think that Karl Urban (who plays John ""Reaper"" Grimm) would be a MUCH better Taggart. He even looks kinda like him! And where are our other characters? Arlene? Albert? Jill? What about the monsters? Where are our favorite bad guys? I only saw a few game-movie connections, and only ONE book-game-movie connection. I don't know about you guys, but I want my old monsters. This movie reminded me more of Resident Evil (the zombies in R.E. just moaned and walked around...in Doom, they have guns) and Half-Life (scientists being attacked by aliens and slowly turning...). I think John Carmack needs his head examined. He creates a game that changes the way First Players are played, and, yet, he approves a movie that kills the true DOOM feeling.",Doom
504,kurisu-4,"Pretty poor showing, even for a game movie",2,27 October 2005,"When I first saw the preview, I had pretty low expectations. I'm a big fan of the game, but I'm a bigger fan of great action movies. This one doesn't stack up. It's sad when you have low expectations of a film and it doesn't even live up to them.The film begins with the Rock leading his crew of Marines into a research facility (with everything from archeology to heavy artillery) to contain a situation. Right off the bat you see a troop of the most un-Marine like Marines I've ever seen. They're undisciplined, nonthreatening, have no instinct and even look ratty. Aliens (1986) had perhaps the best crew of Marines for a film like this; Doom didn't put any thought into this at all.There's also a lot less action in this film than expected. When there are action scenes, they're relatively short and unsuspenseful. There's a few ""gotcha"" moments where things jump out at you, but the scenes involving the aliens and zombies are pretty routine. The game packs a lot more action in its download-able demo than there is in the entire film.It's clear that once Aliens and Predator (1987) came out this genre has been spent. Since those two films, there hasn't been a noteworthy film of the soldiers-versus-aliens type worth mentioning. Doom clearly comes up way short.",Doom
505,jgarbuz,The movie was too short and underfunded.,7,28 October 2005,"IMO, there was nothing wrong with the acting or the gradual buildup of suspense, but rather that just as it was getting good, they decided on that rather abrupt, spoiler ending! I'm certain that if the movie had a $100 million dollar budget,it could have been made as good as any sci-fi thriller - such as Aliens. But it is also true, that because the ""story line"" in such genres is essentially similar, i.e., going from room to room to search and destroy the monster, it is clear that Doom couldn't add much of anything new to it. Perhaps if they had had the budget, and more story time, they could have included some of the more exotic scenarios and monsters, and a more powerful ending. BUt I guess on their limited budget, and relying mainly on a very limited audience of ""Doomers"" who will just go see it out of curiosity, it was probably all they could afford to do. It wasn't that the movie was ""bad,"" but just that there wasn't enough money and time to make it much better.",Doom
506,Mister_Kick,What?! This isn't Doom!,1,30 October 2005,"This movie is an absolute travesty against all fans of the game. Anyone else may advise that I look at the movie more objectively, but I see it as this: when you make a movie based off of a popular game, you aren't making it for the people who haven't played the game, you're making it to pay homage to the game and give fans a different way of enjoying it. This movie fails at this goal, absolutely.To put it more bluntly, this movie is trash. The acting in this movie is laughably bad. The camera shots hardly ever work. The lighting is crap for the greater part of this movie. The special effects aren't especially well-done or unique. Even the gore is sub-par. Not to mention, the story has very little to actually do with Doom.What should this movie have been? This movie should have been an action-adventure with one hero venturing into hell to fight hordes of demons and eventually save mankind. How can you go wrong with a foundation like that? Cliché, yes, but more satisfying than this garbage.Bottom line: if you're a fan of Doom, go see this movie if you want to burn your eyes out with a hot iron afterward. If you don't know what Doom is, don't go see this movie. Go play the game, that's a far more satisfying experience than watching any of Andrzej Bartowiak's films.",Doom
507,MocoCoco,Game Fan Recognition,4,30 October 2005,"Okay I gotta say this movie was pretty bad. Storyline: NULL. Suspense: Non-existent. This film seemed to have been rushed into production. Makes me sick to think that people don't take more consideration into making a movie based on a video game. Next you'll see someone ruin Super Mario Bros. ....oh wait...they DID.On the upside there is that two minute sequence in the film that looks just like the game, and to me, that ALMOST made up for the rest of the movie....almost. And also I enjoyed seeing Karl Urban, maybe someday he'll make a movie where he smiles once or twice. The Rock, what can I say? Sometimes even the big hitters strike out.By the way.

508,fraser-40,Shouldn't have been called Doom,6,8 April 2006,"So was it a good film? Was it Doom? Did they miss the point? My best memories of doom, were playing late at night in the dark with the sound turned up. Being able to hear the baddies close by but not knowing where they are, then turning around after several moments on the edge of your seat to find one standing right behind you. For me this means a doom film should have been a scary film like alien with little touches here and there designed to make you jump.This aside was it faithful to the doom universe? In a word no. The storyline was changed. They can only have done this either, to make it more believable (it is about zombies and demons for crying out loud); to make it different (different from the game perhaps but not the horde of other zombie flicks out there); or they thought the original story was rubbish (we are talking about an established series with fans).The imps are a shadow of what they could have been, and despite this they are a fairly minor enemy in the game so shouldn't have been the focus. The weapons aspect were also a let down, they ruined the BFG. They used machine guns the whole time which you don't even get in doom 1 and 2 and no shotguns, plasma or rocket launcher.Before i sign off on the doominess of the film I guess I have to mention the first person shooter sequence. I have seen lots of comments about this and how good it is. I didn't think it was, I don't think it helped the film any other than to get a load of geeks horny for it. I felt it was only included because the film wasn't doom enough without it.Right, so as a film then....It is quite good really. It didn't take me long to stop looking at this film as doom but as another action film. That is exactly what it is and it delivers on this front. The twist at the end is actually quite intriguing and in some ways made the film for me, but in others it ruined it. I'll explain.... ***spoiler coming up***My major gripe with action films is that they care too much about what test audiences think and what sells rather than artistic vision. This means that most action films end in the same way, and characters don't act like real people. So in what way does this apply here. The Rock is one of the heroes of the film, heroes do only good and save the good guys and victims, right? Wrong!!! Up to a point this is true but once he learns what is going on and realises the difficult task of survival ahead he starts to only care about himself, a very human trait and very believable. However, they go overboard with this slightly, because he doesn't just want to save himself he wants to murder all the innocent just in case! He acts unlike his rank and previous behaviour suggest he would which is not believable. The other thing that annoys me is the fight between the two leads at the end. The way they face up would likely have prohibited the fight on two occasions. Firstly Sarge (the rock) fires the BFG at Reaper (Karl Urban) at near point blank range, yet Reaper avoids it. How? He should have died then. The second time is where Sarge has no weapon but Reaper has one round left. Sarge challenges Reaper to hand to hand combat, and Reaper accepts, firing his last round into the air. Now at this point Reaper already knew that Sarge was turning, why didn't he, like any normal person interested in their own survival, bury that last round in Sarge's forehead. You'd try to avoid the savage beating followed by the marginal victory with punchy one liner wouldn't you? (For reference see how Indy deals with the Swordsman in Raiders of the lost ark) Oh and one last thing, why did Rosamund Pike's character have to be in it? For box office not for plot advancement. All in all this film is not a bad way to spend an evening. I think doom fans will be generally disappointed but as action it works (if you can lay aside the more sophisticated plots on offer in other genre)I give it a 6/10 because it does well as action but it brings nothing new to the table.",Doom

OK, the acting was not much to speak of (it was The Rock for Gods sake)! And I'd have like to see more variation in the monsters (for example where were the big round one-eyed meat ball things?) but it was a good fun no-brainer run around shooting things movie! And though very easy to compare to films like Resident Evil, what the hells wrong with that!? Sometimes I just want to watch a film that goes straight into the action without a long complicated plot build up, goes where its gotta and then finishes and this film fits the bill just fine!

While its no award-winner, its certainly a lot of fun for anyone who wants slimy aliens, beefy guys with guns, and tons of gore. Althoug it strayed from the plot of the video game somewhat, it still managed to pay homage to the classic title through lots of subtle nuances. The acting is uniformly mediocre, but no one stands out as truly bad. The Rock looks like he had a lot of fun playing a character that obviously wasn't written with him in mind. For the gorehound in me, I was pleased to find tons of the red stuff (as well as green, pink, and black stuff). Overall, it was a lot of fun. This is the kind of movie you'd get if Roger Corman was paid 100 million dollars to remake ""Aliens""... In other words, a lot of goofy, cheeseball entertainment.",Doom
512,c_waid,Horrible adaption on multiple levels,2,8 February 2006,"First off, they reduced the storyline to that of Resident Evil. Doom is NOT resident evil. They limited it to genetic mutation. Doom goes beyond that and into Demonic openings from hell where they comes through portals. This was completely left out of the movie. I'm not one to say Game movies have to be perfect replicas of the games, but this completely tore up the story, while not performing on the action or anything else.So let's look at this assuming we don't care too much that it isn't the same story as the game. Although I didn't fall asleep in this movie, I was not impressed at any point. Surprisingly very little action and when there was action it was Slow. This makes no sense. The best example of slow was actually the FPS clip of the movie. Although I loved that they actually did this, they did it horribly. In the game...and in any action movie...things need to be somewhat quick paced. Every time they showed a zombie/monster they stood about a foot away just standing there for a few seconds. Then in a shot or two they would be killed. They KEPT doing this. You don't walk slowly and stand still in front of a zombie/monster doing nothing but looking at it (even the zombie/mutations were just standing there...maybe swiping a claw...but not even hitting...yet standing 2 feet away). If you play the game or would even imagine how any situation like this may occur, it was totally unreal and slower than anything could imagine.Oh, and there was ZERO spooks, scares, or anything remotely eerie...which doom is ALL about. I guess they got the gore in there, but that's about it.Some how though, I didn't fall asleep like I mentioned earlier. Still thought the movie was sucktacular though.",Doom

514,Will-Hare-89,For what it's worth..,6,5 February 2006,"Doom will certainly not receive any Oscars. Nor any Golden Globes. Nor any SAGs. But for what it's worth... it's a decent movie. 'Doom' attempts to take the license of the video game and do just what the video game does: make a bloody, violent mess of things. Maybe the movie is not scary like the game, but it has a fair share of awesome kills and gore and death. It is not necessarily the acting that is the problem, but the script itself. The Rock does a decent job of portraying a poorly scripted character full of one-liners and clichés, and Karl Urban plays a good protagonist. I'm not saying it's a great movie... there are certainly lots of crappy directing decisions and such... but it's a decent movie to get a bunch of guys together to watch. Six out of ten.",Doom

I know Aliens set the bar for space marine films with monsters in it but this is quality in my opinion.The Rock was surprising in it. I wont spoil it too much but he really did surprise me.Also, I'd just like to state that its nice to see a classic monster movie with actual monsters instead of CGI all over the show.

517,Rayzor-2,Certainly not a movie about real Marines!,2,29 August 2007,"First off, I want to say that this movie was far worse than I expected it to be. As a Marine, I found it offensive that Marines were referred to as soldiers at least five times during the course of the movie. It would not have been so bad if it had been civilians calling them that, because many civilians do not appreciate the difference between soldiers and Marines. The sad thing was, it was the Marine sergeant who was calling them that. No Marine would ever refer to a fellow Marine as a soldier. The movie also referred to the sergeant as the Commanding Officer. Since when is a sergeant a commanding officer? A sergeant is a noncommissioned officer, and as such would be referred to as the NCOIC (Noncommissioned Officer in Charge), but never as the Commanding Officer. Was the budget for this movie so small that they could not afford to pay even one Marine as an adviser? Also, Corporal Portman had hair that was far too long for the Marine Corps. His hair would not be able to be over three inches long at any point on his head.You may think these things are nit picky, but as a Marine, they insulted me and made it hard to get beyond them to give a fair assessment of the movie. I gave this movie two stars out of ten because Karl Urban and Rosamund Pike did some good acting. Other than that, there isn't much more I can say. If he had seen this movie, Chesty Puller would turn over in his grave so violently he would have to be called Pinwheel Puller. I sincerely hope they don't make a sequel to this film!",Doom
518,pyro9909,Under-rated and entertaining,7,18 April 2006,"This movie was quickly blasted when it was released, which didn't surprise anyone. Video game movie about killing monsters + The Rock = Critical punching bag.But the characters are real enough in this flick, more real than many in plenty of other action flicks that have received far more acclaim. The central characters even have decent arcs to them, especially the Rock's character, with his surprising turn into the villain at the end. Yes, it's hammy and corny and is full of one liners, but that's what you want if you wanna see this movie. The game had no storyline, save for the simple ""opened gate to hell, go kill monsters and shut the gate"". The characters are varied, unique and memorable. I think this movie delivers on what it promises and maybe even a little more. Sure I would have liked more varied environments and better sets, and perhaps a more interesting explanation for monsters. But still, it's a lot better than perhaps the game deserves.",Doom
519,dplunkie,Better than I expected,7,20 October 2005,"Several previous movies from games, and games from movies, have been major dogs in the past. With my expectations reduced I went to see this with my son who has played Doom 3 more than I have.I was pleasantly surprised at both the story arc, the action, the direction and the cinematography. The dark mood on screen was reminiscent of the game and invoked the same suspense. Bartkowiak does a good job of bringing that in-game feeling to the big screen, without filming the whole movie in the First Person role - though if you've seen the trailers... What an excellent homage to the game.The special effects are good as they don't detract from the action - you aren't constantly picking out what is an effect and how it was done. Though there is a lot of violence and gore (hey, look at the game though!) they are done, er, tastefully - not too over the top, just what is needed for each scene.The Rock, though not the greatest acting talent of this century, does a good job of portraying Sarge - a character right up his alley from his WWE performances. Karl Urban does a good job as well in fighting his own demons as his character. The rest of the rag-tag group, along with Rosamond Pike, flesh out the story of this video game into something almost believable in the sci-fi frontiers. It helps to know the game, and see some of the in-game characters, locales, events and monsters come to life, but this movie can stand alone - hey, maybe it will even sell more games!",Doom
520,dodgeball1987,Scratching my chin.,5,29 April 2006,"To be completely honest I don't know what to think about this movie. Yes it was a very good action movie and I was very surprised to see that the movie did not completely revolve around the Rock. The blood and gore effects were great and at times the movie had a splash of twisted humor thrown in. Whats there not to like? This movie was based of a video game, one which was not centered around some biological experiment gone bad. That would be Resident Evil. Doom was about how scientists found a way to open a gateway to the underworld. Then demons and other demonic force over ran the facility. That was the prime factor that divided Resident Evil from Doom. If the director and writers of the movie had at least some how touched base with the actual story then this movie would definitely have been great. To put it plain and simple this movie was not Doom in any way.",Doom
521,Cobalt-60,A worthy adaptation,7,15 May 2006,"I have played all of the Doom games from which this movie is drawn. And I say it is a worthy treatment of the subject. It's most similar to the latest incarnation of the game, Doom 3. But anyone who played old school Doom will feel right at home. On top of that its a pretty fair action film. The rock pulls his weight as the hard driving Space Marine Sergeant. His men are a bit ragged, but get the job done. If the Mario Brothers got a movie, Doom deserved one too. Back in the day the game that inspired this film was accused of sapping the country's productivity. It's definitely worth a view to any doom player or science fiction fan.(intersecting sets, I'll admit).",Doom

523,jonathan-501,Doom Rocks with The Rock,10,30 June 2006,"Let's start out by saying up front that this film is stupid. I'm absolutely certain that any scientific info you pick up while watching this will end up false. The only universe this movie is consistent with is its own. It has its own rules, and trying to make sense of them will only make you depressed. However, this movie's saving grace is that this is not intended to be a science documentary, but rather a mindless action horror sci-fi. Big gap between those two.I enjoyed every minute of this film. The Rock and Rosamund Pike did great, and Karl Urban was a lantern on a hill. Creepy aliens show us just how bad Mars can be, and the facility has possibly the coolest teleporting design I've ever seen. It makes StarTrek transporters look clumsy.The first three quarters of the movie kind of drags action wise in comparison to playing a shoot-em game for an hour. But after our hero gets the video game equivalent of a serious Power-UP, we see one of the coolest scenes in CGI ever. The next five minutes of solid, in-your-face action more than make up for the hour-long tedium of explaining why this hero is all of a sudden so bad-ass. Long live DOOM! If you sit down with this movie, don't expect anything other than a good time. There aren't many morals to learn, or any large contributions to mankind's arsenal of Ben Franklin style quotes. This is just for fun.",Doom

I saw the exact opposite.What I thought was going to be your basic video-game movie (a joke) it ended up being a very good movie. To put it in perspective, I was drinking while watching it and honestly could never find a good moment to go to the bathroom, there was always something happening that I didn't want to miss.While there wasn't much time spend on a few of the main characters, most were very believable and very hateable or lovable. What I thought was the most believable part was probably how well they created the military-style of how the squad worked.Every part of the story was incredibly original and very interesting, and the first-person sequence was very well done... gave a true first-person video game feeling that can't really be explained unless you see it.I'm speaking as someone who never was very into the Doom games, although of course I've played the original... I don't live under a rock.As your average movie person, this isn't what i would call a favorite movie but is good for a night you have nothing better to do and feel like watching a movie that isn't a waste of time, which it most definitely isn't.",Doom

Lots of stupefying movies like this are made just to entertain people and make them cringe at the actor's skills and laugh at the over the top gore and the screams of agony which are splattered in the script (Alone in the dark is the other film in this category which comes to my mind).Doom is a movie which i would've liked to enjoy. But this movie is just too bad. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Instead of being stupid, ridiculous and hilarious, (like what i was hoping for) this movie is just stupid. Sometimes these types of movies can allow the viewers to actually care about the characters, just enough so that the really dumb plot can engage u somehow. But THE ROCK and the rest of the cast, but especially the ROCK are so bad, that you just want to scream. THe dialogue which is already nauseating, is made 10x worse by the acting. Just a headache of a film.Once in a while, late at night, when I'm bored i do enjoy a nice crappy cinema showcase (like Alone in the Dark), or what Doom should've been. I know many people out there enjoys those movies too. But Doom isn't stuffed to the top with action (like it should've been). And when there was action its just mildly entertaining and mostly very confusing. A movie like this doesn't have to have all the action in the world but it can't have dialogue and acting that are both unbearable. Basically, what i am saying is don't see this movie--please!",Doom
526,josephmoese,Simply Outstanding: An Excellent Movie,10,20 June 2006,"I was into DOOM at a very young age. The first two DOOM games were very similar in the plot line, and the weapons, etc. When DOOM 3 came out, i was blown away, and i played it nonstop. I saw the movie immediately when i saw the add, and i was extremely impressed. Sure, it didn't stay true to the game in many ways, but it did stay true in many other ways. The only thing i could say that disappointed me, even a little bit the the lack of the gate to hell being open, which was the plot in the game. The tag line for the game and the movie both was ""All Hell Breaks Lose."" In the game, it was literal. In the film, it was just a figure of speech. But the use of the well chosen game elements such as the BFG, and the monsters, particularly the Pinky Demon, which blew me away when i saw it, were fantastic. The BFG mad me widen my eyes at the screen, seeing a great big blob of plasma obliterating a monster. Another very original thing in the film was the firs person shooter (FPS) scene. It was completely original, and something i wasn't expecting at all, but overall, an awesome idea. And another thing, The Rock is the perfect person for the role he played (Sarge). He plays it well, and looks like a sergeant.As a final word, i know that many people believe that a movie based on a game is always bad. A lot of the times on those occasions, it is like watching someone play the game for you, but that is not the case with this (with the exception of the FPS sequence). If you are a fan of military movies, The Rock, the DOOM video game, and bloody films, DOOM is the movie for you. This movie is, hands down, simply outstanding.",Doom

528,jensenacklesrocks-1,I loved Karl,8,27 August 2006,I loved this movie. I watched it and was not going into it thinking about the dialouge. It was just going to be pure action because the Rock was in it. The actor Karl Urban has really cemented himself as a action hero and he really suits those parts. I think he was best in the role of John Grimm. This was a great movie that was 2 hours of pure action. I really liked Karl Urban in his role and I think his performance was really great. He looks like a marine and acts like a marine with the big gun and the Rock is great as the macho marine with the BFG or the Big Freakin Gun. The storyline lacked a bit but the effects were good. Don't go and see this movie if you have to have proper dialogue. The action and the occasional hint of relationships is enough for you to enjoy the movie without picking everything that went wrong in it.,Doom

Those demons in the movie were supposed to be from hell. The whole point of the game is to go to hell, beat up the guardian of the sole cube, stop the ships that have demons in them from hell, and save the world. There were no tele-porters, where are the tel-porters? I miss the machine gun, and there isn't supposed to be some guy in a wheel chair nagging at you every five seconds saying "" i cant see what your doing "" There is a part in the movie where there is a first person scene for like 5 minutes.

I love shoot 'em up movies when they're well made. This got anything but my adrenalin pumping - you can enjoy deep and shallow movies as well y'know. There seemed little point to anything and the plot-line, such as it was, ran out of steam about half an hour into the story. Who built the Arc? - don't know, who did that guy with the sister on Mars lose? - don't know and so on.

Armed men battle a number of mutated creatures with the usual results. I enjoy a mindless action-flick as much as the next guy from time-to-time but this one was a waste of my time and I admit I was bored enough to watch it in the first place. It was that or clean the kitty litter box. I should've cleaned the litter box. I might've enjoyed it more.I wasn't expecting much as I read another's review first, a recommended idea btw. But DOOM was boring even for a bored person. Weak plot, weak acting, poor directing, weak script, everything is in near darkness (of course), no laughs, etc. You can tell PRECISELY what is going to happen next in virtually every scene, so very little real suspense either.I'm middle-aged so I will acknowledge that my tastes *may* differ significantly than young men in their teens or early 20's who also enjoy action flicks.

However, if one were to regard it as more of a ""general Sci Fi"" type of movie, and disregard the idea that it was based on anything at all, then the movie becomes much, much more entertaining. From such a generalized standpoint, the audience would be much better off watching this film, as it's extremely well-done special effects, great imagery, and very well defined horror movie style hearkens back to older movies like Aliens. Not only that, but the acting is rather good for such a movie, with the characters clearly defined as separate, individual personalities, and the dialogue less corny that most Sci Fi films.

It was put together well, the story was OK, and it kept you on the edge of your seat. Actually, the story surprised me to be this good, on it's own. But it's not the story of Doom. The only teleporter was from Mars to Earth, and at this point it was only a tool. While in Doom experimenting with Teleporters was the whole thing that went bad and made contact with hell. Which brings me to the second story arc that isn't consistent. All the creatures are mutants. Which I really don't get. I don't see how they could have made that decision. There are so many movies with an experiment with genes and stuff gone bad. And people turn into monster and zombies, and when you get bitten you become one of them. I've seen this a thousand times. But a teleporter creating a link with hell, and fighting hell itself basically, that hasn't been used so often. A major disappointment. But, I'm here to comment on the movie and not to the links it has to the story it was based on. I saw previous users giving this movie a really bad vote because it didn't fully ring true to the game.

535,G_Train,"Doom The Movie, Far From The Game.",7,20 April 2008,"Regardless of age, an avid gamer will know the name Doom. Considered by most to be the true father of FPS (First Person Shooters), rivaled only by Wolfenstien 3d, both Doom 1 and 2 shocked the gaming world with gore and suspense previously unheard of, earning a permanent podium in the gaming hall of fame.Since the original, release in the early 90s, the franchise has been dormant for some time, waiting until 2004 to reignite the almost cult following with Doom 3, containing a slightly remade storyline, but sporting some of the best graphics ever created.With the success of the game, it's no wonder a movie was put into work almost straight afterward. However, to the dismay of gamers, the movie deviated from the game quite a bit, rewriting the story almost completely and adding several unnecessary characters.The gist of the game, in short is: One of earths largest corporations settles mars and sets up an outpost to research everything from biomechanics to weaponry. However, the twisted and nefarious head of the research department finds a way to manipulate the study of transporter technology and open a portal to hell, allowing demons to stream forth into the compound and kill or possess its occupants. Enter the main character, part of the marine corp assigned to guard the facility, he survives the initial attack and must work his way through the compound, killing countless demons in his path, to close the gate to hell.*SPOILER* The movie basically took the idea of a research facility on mars, and went in an entirely different direction, blaming some BS gene-therapy for mutating humans into monsters that try to convert others, can you say ZOMBIES? What a cliché! Doom 3 for me wasn't about the graphics, it was about a phenomenally unique storyline, I can think only of Constantine that compares? Yet, for a reason beyond me, the director or writer decided to can this in favor of the bogus story found in the movie, this was so disappointing. Not only was the story different, but the movie contains only a fraction of the monsters found in the game, and there are so few of them also.With that being said and gamer fandom aside, this was a decent horror/action film, good acting, good photography and while every person I've spoken to hates the First-Person scene, I personally loved it and thought it was a good homage to the game.I could compare aspects of the movie for hours, but in short my opinion is this is a decent flick, especially for those who didn't play the game, its simple yet entertaining, and who can pass up seeing The Rock in action? But if you *ARE* an avid gamer, like me, I can almost guarantee you will be severely disappointed with the lack of synergy between the game and movie, quite frankly they would have been better off to sell this movie under a different name, and simply state it was inspired by Doom, but not related to it.",Doom

I was afraid that i were going to become claustrophobic for my whole life, if you know what i mean. But this movie is in fact not as scary as you may think. Of course the demons are not pretty or wear dresses, but they are not as bad as they are in the games. I actually enjoyed this movie a lot, and it had a pretty interesting plot. There were some moments where you are about to jump under the table, but you are constantly surrounded by something interesting. Onething that is absolutely freaking awesome, is the part when you see things through a guys eyes (like in a 1.st person shooter). But i won't spoil anything more for you.

537,proletarian-1,Every copy of this movie should be hunted down and burned.,1,26 April 2009,"I've always believed, that a Video game adaptation movie doesn't have to strictly follow the original piece to be good. With this in mind I watched the infamous DOOM, and this is, one of the most regretable decisions I've ever made in my entire life.So the plot is about scientists discovered a dead alien civilization on Mars, and those Aliens have 24 pairs of chromosome while humans have only 23, and that particular 24th pair of chromosome made those Aliens extremely strong and intelligent. Hey, we gotta try it out on humans, right? Then guess what? That 24th chromosome only works with people of a good soul, and those test subjects, who apparently are not model citizens , got turned into ugly homicidal mutants and taken over the Lab, so a bunch of stereotypical space marine morons got sent to the Mars lab, trying to figure out whats going on.That definitely sounds like DOOM, right? Remember in the game when you have to jump into a liquid mercury bulb which is supposingly a Teleportation device to go to Mars? Remember in the game that only monsters you see are guys in black bulky rubber suits, who are trying to pass on the infection to you by detachable tongues? I certainly don't. A gate way to hell actually makes more sense and more believable than this whole '24th chromosome' thing. The movie did some poor attempts to relate itself to the video game, like that wheelchair guy called Pinkie, who later turned into a 'pinkie', and that much hyped oh-so-powerful 'bio force gun', which fired 2 times during the whole damn film(first time into a empty toilet, second time punched a hole through a wall). Can't think of anything else that is Doom-related beside that.The acting is horrible. Rock should've sticked to wrestling. The best line presented in the whole film is actually :""Semper Fi,motherfxxker!"" This movie sucks so much that I laughed all the way through in embarrassment.Don't watch it, whatever you've played the original game or not.It's not only a humiliation to a great video game franchise ,it's a disgrace to the whole movie industry.",Doom

The games worked well because they took place in the future where the technology was possible to create the situation found in the games. The movie is present day, which radically alters the situation. As well, only one monster from the games is in the movie. The other 10 or so monsters are never even mentioned, including the iconic Hell Knight. Seeing some more monsters would have been great. Also, the section in the movie where the camera takes a first-person perspective of the main character was poorly done.

Obviously this is not an 'art-cult film' but it delivers what it has to deliver.Secondly, the timing and pacing of the movie is brilliant. They're no wasting time in silly chat, there's some monsters that must be killed and about at 10 minutes the soldiers (mercenaries, whatever) are doing their job. The production is truly great. It is not just a lot of bullets being fired for no reason.

542,laquox,Doom The Movie,7,24 January 2006,"I never got to see this movie in the theater and recently got a chance to see the uncut edition. Honestly my very first impression of the movie was ""this is cool"". Then my fanboyism got a hold of me and realized it was not doom. Honestly if this movie would have been called ""UAC Marines"", ""Viral Apocalypse"" or something else random, this movie would have done A LOT better. It was actually really good for a sci-fi movie. Much in the vein of Resident Evil meets Mission To Mars. The thing that really made this movie not a movie about DOOM however was the lack of cohesive elements to the game story. In the game it's all about hell and demons and weird psycho doctors wanting to be more psycho. The movie focuses on an ancient race designing a machine called the ARC, this machine makes direct transport to mars possible. There seems to be a problem on mars and the UAC Marines are sent in to investigate. The next about an hour and forty five minutes is all about trying to figure out what happened and destroy the threat if any. It's your very standard sci-fi story but it achieves what it's meant to do. Entertain you for a moment. The movies main downfall is it is only LOOSELY based around the game that everyone wanted to see on film. However to appease the fanboys(girls?) out there DOOM does have a very unique experience visually in the form of a (about 5-10 minute) segment where the camera is completely shot in first person perspective. Which having never seen this EVER done in a film was really neat. A bit out of place where they chose to do it in my opinion but cool nonetheless. Overall if you want to see a really interesting take on a sci-fi movie checkout DOOM, if you are wanting a direct translation of the video game, I suggest you just keep playing the video game.Visuals: 7 Sound: 9 Gore To Idiocy Factory: 3 (It's there and does what it needs to do.

Mostly it's just a bunch of guys trying to figure out why what's going on is going on. Ms. Pike and Mr. Urban really should've let their accents out, they sound bad. Especially Ms. Pike. None of the characters are particularly likable. The script is filled with clichés. Most of the time it just feels like someone crossed Aliens and Resident Evil and somehow came up with this crapper.

The most important thing to remember is that it is A MOVIE. This is not the game but a thoroughly separate entity and as such needs to be treated as such. The plot is sound, the usual send-in-the-tough-hombres to sort out the bad guys which in this case are genetically modified humans who turn into monsters suggestive of game based creatures. The actors really seem to be having a ball - especially the underrated twosome of Karl Urban and The Rock.The support did exactly that-which was to support the main characters and combined with a kick ass sound track,great cgi effects and a good dose of menace and thrills meant that the film,for me was a treat. The audience laughed out loud more than once to the cheesy one-liners which is always a good sign and no-one left early! Sadly some pretty juvenile 'game geeks' rated the movie as a game and gave it just 1 or 2 stars which is a shame for had they rated this just as a movie then it should have scored much higher than it is.

I can only assume that those involved in its production didn't even like the computer game as there is absolutely none of the source's qualities present here. This was a movie with an abysmal story, poor script, bad characters and worse performances. But the flaws with this film (and they are numerous) are not to do with inaccuracies or deviation from the game.So if you're gonna slag off this movie (and you should, it's really easy) then say something about the film itself not just what you were expecting based on the game.And just to undermine my argument...I quite liked Resident Evil!!!!",Doom

The variety of monsters was severely lacking and the role they had The Rock play in the end was pretty dumb too. Yes, it IS possible to make the movie a lot more like the game and write a good story line at the same time but I guess that was just too hard for the writers and the budget.

Very good performances from everybody, especially Karl Urban (Reaper) and The Rock (Sarge).Now with a name called DOOM you would expect guns, F-Bombs, blood and gore. Well you got that in this movie. Lost of action and blood and gore, heads are gone, arms are decapitated and more! The atmosphere of the game is in the movie and looks just like it. There has been people complaining about how it looks nothing like what it should, but it does. Don't listen to those people.The problem is that its just like what happen to Timeline. The book was awesome and had a lot of science to explain whats going on. Well when they did the movie, they gave it to Richard Donner, and he doesn't do ""science."" Same thing happens here, they try to write science but its just there for plot purposes, and if your really big on that sort of thing, you might get mad about it. Which lead to the second problem that people had, is that there is no hell, like in the game. Its genetic mutation, and for me that all right, cause with the new story it works with the film. Leave your brain at the door and just watch this movie for fun, because thats what it is fun.The FPS scene is just pure greatness and work really well with the film. The BFG is also here and just look cool, could have used it more but I'm not complaining.So if you want to watch a movie thats better than the other games to movies that have been out (AvP, Resident Evil, Laura Croft, Super Mario Bros.) then go watch doom. And I'm hoping for a unrated director cut on DVD. HAVE FUN!!!",Doom
550,sangotham13,woeful lame film. marines who do not even look like marines.,1,21 October 2005,"bad. really bad. that is all I can say about this film based on the revolutionary video game. logic is horrific, even for sci-fi, and the manipulation of sarge for the seemingly sake of it is in poor taste. marines who do not look or act like marines, and a lack of head protection (helmets) seems like a painfully obvious attempt to give the rock more face time in a film that advertised him as the lead... but clearly he is only a supporting fixture at best. sound just like the mummy sequel too. what could have been? all i know is this... doom is sadly a failure. the first person visual effects are solid, but the production value cannot overcome a hack job and obvious cash grab. watch resident evil instead.",Doom
551,billyx4,Doom Film Review,8,19 December 2005,"The long awaited Doom film starring the rock was brilliant , and did what it said on the can . For any fan of first person shooter video games it hits all the right buttons . Some reviews talk about it having no plot . This ain't war and peace , just a little bit of mayhem ...Recomended must see film . Just like the Doom game its very dark and intense, in fact this is the best game to film conversion i have ever seen. The acting for this kind of film is also very acceptable, and all involved put in their best. The special effects are also very well done and bang up to date . Don't go and see this film if you expect some deep meaningful film , its a good old fashioned Science Fiction monster film and well worth the admission fee",Doom
552,Mud_dib,Doom: Skip it,2,21 October 2005,"While droves of fans have been awaiting this movie and they will most likely make it a box office success, this is a terrible terrible film.This film promised little more than some cool special effects, gruesome violence, and true to its word that is all it delivers.This script is so bad I wouldn't wipe my ass with it. The dialog and characters are ridiculously unbelievable the story is inconsistent nearly to the point of incompressible. It would also seem that having The Rock in this film was an excuse to have a super powered version of his days in the Ring.Ultimately Doom is a prime example of why video game shouldn't be made into movies.",Doom
553,craid,From a pure old school l33t gamer,9,14 November 2005,"OK ... at around 1984 i got my first ""PC"" ... (if you can call a CMB that) and since then i have had my hands on almost every game that have emerge for the PC platform. One of my first altime favorites was definitely Wolfenstein 3D... time went and the new ""Doom"" game from ID soft came out. At first i didn't like it, but it quickly grew on me - especially when i got a new comp and i could run it full screen sized :-PNOW from my p.o.v. this movie does just that... grows on you. In the beginning it seems very ""Alien 2 (Aliens)"" like... and i do believe a few things have been ""borrowed"" from that :-P But since Aliens rox, it ain't no problem IMO. The scenery is actually very accurate if you compare it to Doom 3. look at the textures in your game and compare it to the movie - it looks almost identical - though optimized for the big screen of cause - a BIG plus IMO. - The whole thing takes off in a pretty slow but non-boring pace. It slowly builds up to the encounter with the first alien. - After that all hell breaks loose with cool new elements to movies like a ""nanowall"" and a cage that will be used in a cage fight (UFC??? :-P). Now all in all the previous comparison to Aliens seem once again appropriate - battles/hunts in sewers, hallways and tunnels, brute monster force vs the somewhat fragile human body and the goBUHinthedark effect.Now ... for all of you guys who are disappointed about this movie because it lags some certain elements - don't be... because :This movie ain't about the Doom 1 game ... this is prior to that ... the BIRTH of our Reaper hero char. This will make it possible to exclude all ""this is unrealistic"" ""*whine* how can he take so much *whine*!"" statements made in the future movies about our hero ... now there are a few of our wellknown enemies in this game but ... those are only to satisfy us Doom 1 gamers with SOME form of monsters.Now stop complaining about this movie and just enjoy that you actually get the history behind Reaper, the BFG and the reason why the ports to hell is opened on Mars!BTW - don't comment about my grammar and spelling since I'm a dane ... aka i normally speak danish. så goddag med jer danskere :-P",Doom
554,mcguy281,"Doesn't relate to the game much, but it's still awesome!!!",9,18 June 2013,"OK, this is probably the best possible storyline that someone could make for the game, but it's not THE best movie ever, but if you're into a movie with action, guns, and gore, with a taste of horror, this is for you! This movie is most likely based off the game, DOOM 3, which came out the previous year. The game is focused on Mars being invaded by the forces of hell, and it's up to you to stop it. The MOVIE on the other hand, also takes place on Mars, but that's pretty much it. The movie starts with a special team of soldiers who are called to Mars to deal with a problem. When they get there, it's your average ""Evil organization hides secret, secret comes to live, etc, etc."" movie.Still, it's pretty great. If you get the chance, it will easily be worth watching!",Doom
555,Darkness_Infinito,This......Now this is DOOM <(^.^)>,8,30 October 2005,"I very much enjoyed this version of DOOM. It had all the elements to make it worthy of the title DOOM. There was lot's of shooting, dying, and a whole boat load of action to make this a contender for best video game to movie adaptation so far. From the opening title to the somewhat anti-climatic ending, the movie kept me in my seat and ready for more. I'll admit, the first person shooter segment seemed a little dizzying and perhaps rushed, but, it was something fresh and exciting, something I hadn't seen in a movie, and I liked it more than I didn't. All in all, DOOM has satisfied my craving for an adaptation of the masterpiece. Darn, no hell in there, but heck, maybe they'll do a sequel. Maybe they might say, hey, they liked it. Maybe we'll add hell in next time. Who know, they just might. I do believe this one tried in many ways to appeal to the gamers and for that I applaud the creators. As a fan of the game, I say right on. As a fan of movies, I say cool. I can't say academy award material because this isn't a movie masterpiece nor was it ever intended to be. Did it have all the elements that made the game great? Maybe not, but it sure came pretty close. Great game made into a great adaptation...nuff said.",Doom
556,pmatthew1,i hope u guys and girls have actually played the game,10,21 October 2005,This was a great movie and probably the best game/movie translation.I just hope that you guys have actually played the game and know what your talking about before giving this movie a bad review.i have played through the game many times and the movie stays very true to the storyline of the game.The fact that some parts were first person was even better considering the game was an FPS (first-person shooter).i can understand why some people wont like this movie though especially if u haven't played the game.And this is only one of the many game movies that will be here soon.I am most excited about the halo movie which is another FPS that will be directed by Peter Jackson.The Lord Of The Rings trilogy was my fav movies and Peter Jackson is the perfect man to do the epic storyline of halo and halo 2(possibly).I hope that this has given some populist of info about doom.go out and see it.its not the greatest movie ever but its a good one.,Doom
557,Jay80,A Video-Game-Adaption that deserves it's name,6,3 November 2005,"First of all I have to state that I never played Doom the Video Game, though I really like this kind of game. My expectations of this movie weren't too high. A typical Action-Horror-Plot that has similarities either with James Cameron's ""Aliens"" or ""Resident Evil"". A movie where the guns play the leading roll. To my surprise we weren't alone in the theater, it was almost full. OK, the game is popular, but can it be that the video game fans fill a multiplex theater? I guess not. Some of them may be attracted by The Rock and the anticipation to get a kick-ass popcorn movie.This expectation was right to some extent. Aplot which presents a bunch of space marines who have to secure a science laboratory on the mars which has been attacked by a strange species. We now what happens in such a movie. One by one of the troop drop dead as the plot is slowly revealed and the showdown comes closer. But in contrast to ""Alien versus Predator"" the characters get enough time to develop. And surprisingly the plot is not that foreseeable as I thought. Karl Urban plays solidly the warrior with heart and The Rock drops his simple lines as we expect him to do. As Karl Urban (Reaper)says: ""They are marines, not poets."" The film doesn't try to totally transfer the games story. But the look and some of the gimmicks (for instance the Kill-Cam which brings the First-Person-View into the movie or the ""Big f*** gun"", how Sarge calls it) might make the game fans feel like they're home. If I have to compare ""Doom"" with other movies of this genre it would score better than ""Alien versus Predator"" but not as good as ""Aliens"" as it is sometimes a copy of it.",Doom
558,rupej-1,"DOOM: A terrible, terrible movie",2,22 October 2005,"DOOM was a much hyped movie that ended up disappointing severely. First of all, it was the most boring video-game based movie I've ever seen. Yes, even worse than Mortal Kombat: Annihilation. I've never gone to a movie on opening weekend and received such bad vibes from the crowd. No one liked it, not even the MUCH too long and boring First Person sequence or the monsters. They weren't even entirely true to the original DOOM/DOOM II; the much feared boss from those classic games doesn't even make an appearance. I know people are gonna say that it was based more off of DOOM 3. Well guess what, that was also one of the weakest FPS to come out in recent years! This film will be worth it when the rental comes out, but don't see it otherwise.Personally, I'll be counting the days until a Duke Nukem movie comes out. Now that would be awesome.",Doom
559,damonaz,This is not DOOM,3,25 November 2006,"This movie bears absolutely no significant resemblance to the game. Aside from the name of the company and it being set on Mars there is NOTHING from the game. The key elements of the game that most people would like to see on screen, namely the various creatures and weaponry, are completely absent from this picture. The BFG is name-checked but it looks and behaves completely different from the game, and the only creature resembling anything from the game is the pinky demon, which now has wheels!! This is too imply which character turned into this demon but who cares!! Doom 3 is a spectacular, frightening gaming experience and there is even an attempt at some exposition to make it more realistic. The description of the way the game version BFG functions is quite incredible. None of this is translated to the picture. The story of a lone fighter making his way through a hell-infested Mars scientific research base (which I personally think could make a decent film) has been replaced with a 'story' of a gung-ho, barely believable military squad with varying personal issues chasing shadows that turn out to be (yet again) genetic experiment mishaps! The only reason I give this film a 3 is that the much talked about first-person sequence is actually quite fun and is worth having a look at. Just sitting through the rest can be tiresome...",Doom
560,jxnc,"Not only is this movie retarded, it trys to make the Marines look stupid too",1,4 July 2006,"I think I would have thought this movie was dumb anyway, but being a Marine vet, I thought it was extremely stupid. In the year 2026, do Marine Corps standards go to Hell in a hand-basket??? First off, ""Sarge""? I never heard a Sgt. called that while in the Marine Corps. Secondly, if he was a Sgt., I'm pretty sure he wouldn't be the COMMANDING OFFICER since that would mean he isn't a ""Sarge"" after all. O.k. that Portman guy looks like he is around 40 years old, and I'm pretty freaking sure that his hair cut isn't Marine regulation unless in the year 2020 whatever you don't have to even worry about a haircut anymore in the Marines. But oddly enough, even accepting the fact that he didn't act like a Marine or look like a Marine at all, Portman was the character that I liked the most I guess because he was the only one that seemed to realize he was in a retarded movie so he didn't care. But the dumbest part of the movie had to be when ""Sarge"" keeps on referring to his Marines as Soldiers. ""I NEED SOLDIERS!"" Any Marine or anyone with decent knowledge knows that a Marine is a Marine. That is a pet peeve among Marines, and I'm pretty sure a Recon Marine, or whatever he was supposed to be, wouldn't do that. Army=Soldiers, Navy=Sailors, etc. What made it even more dumb is the fact that they would have all these inaccuracies about the Marines, and yet act like the ""Sarge"" is into the traditions and customs of the Corps. He has a ""Semper Fi"" tattoo on his back, and he wants to have a good old fashioned smackdown at the end because his fellow Marine has violated this pact of always faithful to the Corps, or was it always faithful to the Army since apparently his thinks he is a Soldier and is confused. The ""Semper Fi Mother ******"" comment was so over the top it had me rolling with laughter. Then there is the whole drug thing going on. I guess they don't have drug tests in the year 2026. I know people that got kicked out for smoking dope much less whatever those green pills were that half the squad was on.The only part of the movie I enjoyed was the two or three minutes where the guy runs around in first person only because it reminded me or playing the game back in the day.",Doom
561,good_humer,Read the rating,2,9 February 2006,"This movie failed at a lot of things it could have been good at. The first thing they did wrong was to make the rock's character turn evil. I mean come on, ""The scorpion king"", ""Walking tall"" ,and ""The rundown"" he played a heroic character,so why did they make him a bad guy. Second they took to long to get to the action in the film, the film takes an hour to get to the plot. First there is getting to the facility, then trudging through a facility, and then finally we see a creature. When it does get to the plot , the action does not satisfy. And does every other word have to be a cuss word. There was pervasive language throughout the film. The profanity never lets up. On a positive note I did think that the writers were creative in adding elements from the game into the movie. One of the scientist is named Carmack, who also happens to be a programer of the doom games, and the way they made a character named ""pinky"" turn evil was cool too.There is one video game like sequence. It's like riding through an amusement park, that part of the movie was cool. And the fight scene at the end was great.",Doom

It was scary, had some good comic relief, great acting (and don't even say the rock can't act, if so then you don't know what acting is) especially by Karl Urban who seems to give himself to the role in every action movie I see him in. He's great. Great entertainment.

563,albi_gjino,Something special,10,28 April 2006,"After seeing the very low score from IMDb and seeing that The Rock was nominated for the worst actor I had the lowest of expectations for the movie. I had played DooM3, the video game the movie was based from, and I didn't like it either. So, I was prepared for 100minutes of pain.Well, the movie just sucked me in. A wonderful mess. Something I had never seen before, really. It is similar to Resident Evil (1, not 2). But this one has faster action, cooler actors and better effects/scenes. At the end I was very impressed how much I had enjoyed it.Karl Urban excels. Rosamund Pike looks like a mistake here. And the Rock... well, he has got to be my favorite crazy-head.I'm not a 14yrs old video-gamer. In 99% of the bad movies I totally agree with the IMDb voters. But DooM is nowhere near as low as the average says. Its a movie that at least deserves respect for being different. And if you are willing to experience new things and are tired from all those Oscar winners, you'll appreciate DooM.PS: Its not a 10, more like an 8. But I want its rating to go higher.",Doom
564,delvecko,Let this serve as a warning to others,2,18 August 2006,"I went into this movie without any expectation of greatness. Movies based on video games are always suspect. The producers and writers know that they are going to attract viewers from the gaming market and they count on this built-in audience. As such, the writing and execution are often quite lackluster. Doom is no exception. Like I said before, I didn't expect anything great...I figured it would be gun-porn with maybe some good fight scenes. It was dreadful. You can't blame it on bad acting b/c the script was so lazily written that it made all the dialog seem forced and awkward. The action scenes were altogether unimpressive. The Sarge character was uneven, so much so that his actions later in the movie served to seriously stall the already sputtering sense of continuity and pacing. There is an utter lack of suspense. Character development was neglected utterly. By the 1 hour mark, you don't care how it ends, you just want it to end. This was a painful movie to watch. I give it 2 out of 10 and I think that's being generous.",Doom

You know, I've heard a lot of ideas lately, and I've been considering some pretty attractive options: 'Do it like Final Fantasy' some have said. 'Go watch Sin City, just imagine what Doom could be like if it were made like that!'. But I think if people wanted a computer generated environment, they can just go play the video game. No, I believe we should reconstruct the innovative Doom environment with cheap sets, rubber alien suits, plastic guns and do it all in Prague to save money. I know I know, we could just use the money to do it like that Rodriguez guy did with that Sin City movie, but why take the chance? We can use the money for unknown, mediocre actors and unconvincing sets. And that simple Doom plot that is so captivating in the game? Well, it surely won't work on screen, no, the viewer needs a 3 act structure and character development. Mindless violence and disturbing situations will only drive our audiences away...we need exposition and clichés. Can someone get Davey on the phone? He's writing the script. Hello, Davey?"" ""Yes, I'm here."" ""Hi Davey, you are on speaker phone. I was just telling everyone what we want to do with Doom. Do you feel like sharing?"" ""Sure. Well, i don't have that much experience with scripts but I basically felt that as long as we stick to the well-worn path of past sci-fi successes, the film will just drive itself. I have taken elements of the Doom scenario and plugged them into this cool screen writing software that writes the script for you, it's really easy and fun. I set the program to include a character twist in which Sarge turns bad, and to add some extra spice, I bumped the ""Cliche Level"" up to 8 in the preferences menu. Oh, and I added my own scene in which the crazy doctor tears off his own ear."" ""Sounds exciting Davey, we can't wait to see a draft."" ""No problem. Oh and if my script program crashes, I'll just give that Cape Fear guy a call."" ""Sure, you do that Davey. Keep up the good work. Okay...the cast. We think we have the Rock. We tried to get Vin Deisel but his agent said Prague reminds him of ""XXX"". Anyway, The Rock is really the only actor we need, but rather than have a 'lone soldier against an army of demons' story, we are going with a 'group of soldiers against 3-4 different demons, but the real enemy is themselves' story. This can also cut back on having to show more than 3-4 demons from the game. Even then, our director wants to employ every possible trick in the book to avoid showing a demon or any on screen action."" ""The rubber suits look like crap, Laura. I don't have much choice."" ""This is Eastern Europe, Andrej. Not Skywalker Ranch. Tell them how you are going to cover the sex angle."" ""Well, I think a love scene might be a bit of a stretch, because while we want to make Doom as formulaic and predictable as possible, we shouldn't stray too far from the game. So I propose we have a female doctor character with hard nipples poking through her shirt."" ""Brilliant."" ""Thanks. I also think it would be a nice ironic twist to have a scene in which a soldier uses a computer monitor as weapon to fight a demon."" ""Andrej, you genius, where have you been hiding for so long?"" ""Poland."" ""I'm joking. You're great though and we are glad to have you on board. One last thing, just to make sure we have a strong opening at the box office, we'll be getting a lot of friends to place great reviews and comments on internet boards such as IMDb to fool prospective movie-goers.

566,infiltrator800,One of the better adaptations.,8,22 October 2005,"Well, worth my my moneyHere it is in black and white. In my opinion, this has to be one of the better adaptations of a video game franchise to date. The action exceeded my expectation for the film. I wouldn't necessarily say I'm a big gamer of the franchise, but I've played it on more than one occurrence.Some people say that this film is sub-par compared to other game-to-film adaptations, and in most cases, is a lame ""Resident Evil-esq"" ripoff. I completely disagree. While it borrows some elements from James Cameron's masterpiece ""Aliens"", it is not Resident Evil (which also tried to copy from ""Aliens""). ""Doom"", I believe put some hope back into the film industry to try and put credible video-game adaptations back on the market.What did it have to offer? Well, for one, the FPS segment towards the end was unique, and very much like Doom. I had a huge smile on my face the whole time. The acting, was far better than any other video game counterpart out there, and gave to the theater, rather than making the view feel less intelligent. There aren't many ""F-bombs"" flying all over there place, and if you look at it from a outside, unbiased perspective, you can take it seriously. The plot, in a sense, isn't directly thrown out there ( much like other adaptations of games where the whole plot is thrown out on the table in a single bound), it wants the viewer to think it through.If your a die-hard fan of the games, more so Doom 3, which the movie is loosely based on. You may find the film somewhat lacking. It doesn't have all the enemies encountered in Doom 3, it may not have all the things you wanted to be in the movie that is in the game, and it may not be entirely about hell -in the literal sense, but more of a mental/psychological way-. But overall, I believe you'll find it somewhat enjoyable as a film and you'll be glad for what you've got(Heck, its better than what we -myself included- Resident Evil game fans got!).In short, I give it a 8/10. It may not be a perfect adaptation, but it is one of the best if not the best out there.I would certainly recommend this film to the gamer who has played the game, or to the movie-goer. It is well worth seeing.",Doom
567,dicorp,"Very Bad, Avoid At All Costs",2,8 December 2005,"This is easily the worst movie I've seen this past year. In a year filled with awful remakes(Guess Who?, War of the Worlds), more boring autobiographical films (Get Rich or Die Trying') and just awful movies this pretty much no fail action flick managed to suck. Doom was one of the most original, creepy and violent games ever. This film is the most unoriginal, sloppy and boring sci-fi/horror flicks I can think of.Every possible cliché(super healing potion or something) was used. Even scenes in the film that contributed nothing to story were ripped off from other movies like the helicopter flight(Predator) or the weapons specific to the character (Predator). As for the so called action, there was hardly any of it. Most of the shooting was done at nothing because by the time the so called special team realized they saw something, it was already gone or pouncing on them from another side. Ditto for gore, hardly any,a pretty gross autopsy scene though but done better and looked cooler elsewhere(Blade 2). Finally, there was 3 monsters, and maybe we saw only one instance of each. The wheelchair demon was the dumbest thing I ever seen. To sum up, this is a lazy attempt to make a buck off a popular franchise, nothing more. Not like the director wasn't capable of a decent action movie. I far as i know he directed Exit Wounds, Cradle 2 the Grave and Romeo Must Die which were all good popcorn action flicks. Better luck next time Andrzej.",Doom

There were some notorious failures in the attempt to put on the big screen some worlds of famous VG's, (I remember that rubbish of that Wing Commander VG didn't deserve at all).Well, fortunately, this movie is closer to the VG than I expected. They even included a scene were the camera takes a first person perspective (that of Karl Urban), just as the shoot'em up VG. Wow, the crowds in the theater exploded with pleasure when he began to smash vicious creatures and we saw it through his perspective.The actors perform well, also. For those who have seen and loved Predator and Aliens, you'll enjoy also the different characters of The Rock's Team and their dialogs. An special note on the big black man with the chain gun, he's great as a nice re-edition of the unforgettable Mack in Predator!The plot has no great surprises, they were not wanted nor needed, anyway. It only lacks a big monster as final enemy, I think that The Seargent could have been transformed into this. A pity.So Doom is just action, but very good action.

In this instance I will, because a 3 year old with a hand-cam could do better.Don't go to see this, do not rent this, change the channel if it screens on TV. It is really that bad.And the people that voted this as anything other than a 1, hope the studio paid you well for selling out.Should have a warning on the cover: ""Watching this will cause the loss of your will to live""Would write more, but even the thought of this film is making me gag.",Doom
570,McNellis21,Doom was Doomed...,6,26 October 2005,"I liked the movie. Though I must admit, I walked out of Doom with a sour taste in my mouth, and it wasn't from the popcorn my friends. Doom was Doomed due to the lack of story. To any who may read this, if you are looking for a movie with story, don't watch Doom. Go dust off your copy of Homeward Bound (you'd probably be better off). However if you are looking for a movie with killer effects, then my friend you have come to the right place. The effects in this movie were awesome. I must say I have seen better action movies. Nothing really special about the action in this movie, and the suspense is mild.I give The Rock props. I thought he did an awesome job in this movie. The Rock carries this movie. It's just a shame that his performance is overshadowed by the story & script. Furthermore, it's just too bad the guys who wrote the script felt as though they could use the ""F word"" every five seconds and produce a killer script. Sadly, if you want to make an action movie it doesn't take much more than that.Foul Language + Explosions + Tough guy with attitude = Action The man in Hollywood who came up with that formula forgot one minor detail, and that is ""STORY"". You can have all the action you want, but without story to tie it all together. Who really cares? In Doom you don't really connect to the characters, and it's halfway through before you start to grasp what is going on. Had the writers invested a little more time in the story, there is a chance that the audience could have connected to at least Gimm and his sister before the last seven minutes of this flick.Perhaps I left this movie with a sour taste in my mouth due to the fact that I wasted a good six bucks on this movie.

Around every corner lurked a new demon more horrible than the last: cacodemons, arch-viles, imps, hell knights, revenants, spider-demons. They'd lunge out of the shadows or pop out of a doorway and I'd literally jump out of my chair.Needless to say, I was anxious to see the new movie based on the computer game series. Could DOOM the movie live up to the game? Uh, HELL no.Sadly, just as I suspected, DOOM is nothing more than a cheap Aliens clone. The movie features a team of Space Marines who head for Mars to contain a problem of serious magnitude. The team is the usual band of soldiers on a suicide mission: the kid on his first time out; the embittered hero with a dark past; the tough as nails, no nonsense sargeant; the yellow-toothed pervert; the religious psycho; the great big black guy; the token Asian with a name nobody can pronounce; the other black guy; and the purdy girl. They are lined up for the slaughter in predictable fashion and face only ONE type of monster throughout the entire film.The cause of the monster rampage is blamed on the tired, old ""science experiment gone wrong"". I'm not sure why the creators of this clunker decided against the ""opened Gates of Hell"" scenario that worked so well in the games. I suspect they just didn't want to shell out the dough to create an entire line-up of proper hellspawn, or perhaps they feared a moral majority backlash.In any case, The Rock is his usual camera-muggy self: eyebrows arching, lips snarling, muscles flexing. Yawn. He put in a decent performance in The Rundown, but this film takes him right back to The Scorpion King square one.I'm glad I paid matinée price for DOOM, that's all I can say. I recommend waiting for videobargain video.",Doom
572,AbideDude,surprisingly good,8,22 October 2005,"When I first heard that Doom was going to be made into a movie, I was very skeptical. Since, most video-game based movies really sucked, I thought doom was going to follow the same path. However, I must say that I actually really enjoyed this film. A lot of the scenes were very suspenseful, the acting was pretty good, and although at first I thought the FPS camera scene was going to be stupid, I think now that it was very entertaining to watch. Although it's not 100% like the video games it is still a movie worth checking out. In conclusion, I thought the movie was really fun to watch, the effects were cool, the creatures were pretty neat, but most importantly of all it entertained me.",Doom
573,toftt05,Worth watching if you like the Rock,5,25 November 2005,"What can I say, The movie didn't have a plot, it started out with scientists running down a dark corridor slowly getting picked off by ""monsters"" When you cross the Rock with Doom, you expect lots of intense action, but if you think about it, there wasn't much, it was all walking round very slowly with guns at the ready.I do give the 1st person scene a 9/10 it was just like a video game where the graphics were the greatest.I did get really confused with the locations, they went from some strange planet (guessing it was mars) to a different location (guessing it was mars)then they went through some warp hole to some facility on a red planet (guessing it was mars), so I don't know where earth came into (they mention earth at the start) The movie was a dud though, bad scripting and bad choice in film makers, we don't even get to see what the monsters actually look like, bad you kinda get the idea.all in all, a 7/10",Doom
574,cricri_452,They missed this opportunity!,4,16 January 2006,"Doom is a classic FP shooter, also one of the first.So, you got the rights to make a movie of it, THAN WHY Completely WASTE THIS OPPORTUNITY??!!!Well this is what Andrzej Bartkowiak (the director) has done. He had the chance to make a good movie, but...HE DIDN'T!And I've got a lot of reasons why this movie is such a waste and NOT WORTH LOOKING AT!In first place, WHY CHANGE THE STORY??!!some virus that chooses whom to infect and whom to turn into a super-human with special skills...WHAT THE F*** IS THAT??!!Second, DEAMONS!!!!we expect more demons to show up, I think only 5 or 6 demons show up, oh sorry not demons, since he changed the story INFECTED PEOPLE!!the cool think about doom, specially doom 3 are the demons, creatures, spiders and ""floating heads"" (I can't remember the name) that show up, and also the way they show up like by a Satan's star.A cool feature the movie had was the first person view,but than again they didn't know how to manage that view so it's also a total mess.And the actors, i mean, ohh my good!the only good actor there was Yao Chin(Mac the funny Chinese guy) who dies after 20 minutes, so the only good actor they have gets killed!I think the only positive think this movie has is the music and the environments.So, let's make a quick review:-They changed the story-""Infected Mutaded People"" instead of demons-You get to see only a few ""demons""-NO SPIDERS OR FLOATING HEADS??!!+Good FP view idea-...which turned out to be very boring+Yao Chin(MEC)act's-but gets killed after 20 minutes+Music and environments are OKP.s: FP means FIRST PERSON (DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!)",Doom
575,warvegeta,Very Good Movie,9,23 October 2005,"I liked how this movie was done. I loved playing Doom and Doom II way back in the 90's, when my dad bought it because it was the only game we could get to work on our computer back then. For those of you who have played the first two, this movie has throwbacks to them, but bears more of a resemblance to Doom 3. The plot is good, but is too Resident Evil-y (the games, not the movies) for my taste, and I don't know if you will see this as a spoiler, but near the end of the movie (those of you who have seen it will know what I am talking about), The Rock reminds me of Nemesis in Resident Evil 3. If you have no clue what I'm talking about, that is fine, those who do, more power to you. The movie itself is done well. The action is fast-paced and thrilling, there are bucketloads of suspense, and there are even scenes which are extremely similar to the games, which I must confess made me giggle in pure joy, because it has been a long time since I saw a demon get torn open by gunfire, so I loved that. If you are squeamish and/or cannot handle cursing, this movie may not be the one for you. The rest of you, I recommend this movie to you.",Doom
576,dhegge,Well...,7,30 October 2005,"I gave this a 7 just out of the unbelievable concept of having the movie made. Totally agree with the previous poster about the purpose of this movie, pretty sick of the bad reviews regarding shallow plot. Those folks are welcome to sit on the middle spindle of a merry-go-round while others give it a spin if they're stupid enough to expect ""Good Will Hunting"" from a first-person-shooter based film.There are faults. I have been sold on Doom since swiping Doom II from the computer lab at the U in '94, (where else could you come in drunk after bar-close and play head-to-head in those days) compressed to floppy-disks (I did buy it eventually).I am really upset that they based it on a genetic engineering project, rather than demon invasion. There was only one slight reference to Hell, Mars being equated to it, rather than Hell being the source of the invasion. The only reason possible for that is the pathetic state of our mindless country, we have to avoid offending worthless morons. If they're concerned about pissing off fairy-tale believers, I'd be glad to give them a tour of the real thing (courtesy of my BFG).Other flaws. We don't see much of the fun game weapons. Only Sarge gets the BFG, no rocket launcher or plasma gun. Most of the monster types are missing. I suppose being they wimped out on hell, they thought only so much was believable with genetic engineering.OK, final line. Did give it a 7 because they made the movie against any expectation I had, and they did preserve a lot of the elements. It does have a lot of fun nods to the fan base. Maybe in 20 years they'll make it truer to the original, as was done with Herbert's ""Dune."" If you loved the game, you'll probably enjoy the movie. If you didn't like the game, wait for it on HBO or something.",Doom
577,Blacklock,Fun for the non-squeamish action-fan! (non-player review),7,4 March 2006,"Having only seen the game being played by others, I'm in no position to comment on it from that particular aspect. Perhaps that's why I enjoyed it so much! Good action, great special effects, kick-*ss soundtrack, OK dialogue (well, under the circumstances... What would Shakespeare have made of it, I wonder?) and an overall really decent plot! I must admit I wasn't expecting much to begin with, just another shoot-em-up with cool computer graphics and a lot of hemorrhage and entrails, but in my mind this film offers those things in top quality, and more. OK, so the book club and the Ingmar Bergman-appreciation society won't exactly love it, and you won't score many intellectual points on a first date with this film (unless your date is genuinely intellectual, and you're up for a good debate), and they shouldn't! Let them watch yet another Jane Austen-adaptation instead, and leave the blood and guts and b*ttkicking action for those who can enjoy it for what it is, adrenalin-laden, noisy, messy escapism in a cool suit and gory make-up. If you were expecting even more than this from a film based on a video game... Sorry, but this is as far as we've gotten, for the time being...",Doom
578,googles49_,it's just like the 80's...almost,7,7 December 2005,"Hmmm, a film featuring Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson...now thats scary!No matter what people say about its cheesy one liners, laughable marines and plot line which is just an excuse for brainless violence, so was Rambo and the terminator and almost every action film written in the 80's. Cheer up a little we need a good no thinking save the world by using really big guns. ITS FUN!!! Some people have taken this way too seriously, I mean...really what kind of a plot did the game have?All this film needed was a lot of terrible monsters, a bunch of tough badly trained Marines who shout ""ITS GAME TIME"" whenever it gets tough and a plot only just thick enough to carry it...how can you go wrong? OK my initial fear was the lack of plot in the game this is based on...human genome, hell, do you care? answer = NO just throw me some monsters to test this big F*****G Gun I'm holding!!!And for what it's worth the rock wasn't bad either, we need a new action hero like Arnie and Sly and Rocky could be the one we are after. He looks like the BFG was made for him and one of my favourite bits of the film is *spoiler-ish* when he is confronted by someone with a normal sized gun asking how much ammo he has left and he just looks at this Gun thats 1/2 the size of him and smiles. And he's what?..6ft5 or something, its pure 80s cheese and guts and your either going to like it or hate it.",Doom
579,shinobi00i,This is the reason I don't trust directors anymore,4,21 October 2005,"Now, when I heard about a Doom movie I knew what to expect. A bad horror/action film with little drama, if any. And Doom not only went above and beyond that, it totally nose dived into the floor and came out in China. There was almost no note worthy scenes in the entire movie. Sarge had some crazy mood swing, there was only one good character in the whole movie who unfortunately died way to early, most areas of the film were not explained (and some that made no sense), and parts that felt out of place or just not right.The first person scene was perhaps the single worst moment in movie history. It was so pointless that sometimes you would have this urge to hunt down the director and ask him what the hell went through his head when filming that scene. It was maybe 10-15 minutes of non-stop shooting gallery action, and not in a good way. This consisted of the character standing up, looking around a corner, watching a zombie run at him, and then shooting it in the head and moving on. Nothing scary or creepy at all. You could play House Of The Dead for 15 minutes instead and get the same feeling and probably have more fun. This continued throughout most of the FP section. All with some rock track playing in the background. This could have been a great part of the movie and it was ruined because it was just there to trick all the Doom fans into seeing the movie, and it worked.The parts where something other than shooting some random zombie were either so stupid, like when a zombie ran away from the guy instead of attacking and him just following it and blasting the thing in the head, or the camera was being whipped around so much you had almost no idea what was happening. I thought they tied the camera to a bungee cord and just let it bounce around for a bit then threw in come CG. The story also had some major flaws. During a scene in the movie, an attempt was made to add a little back story to one of the characters by having his memories heard, but they failed to follow up on what actually happened. And thats not the only thing that went wrong. The explanation for why the creatures were showing up in the first place was so far out there that you just didn't want to believe what they were saying. It's like the writer just wanted to throw in a whole new storyline so he could throw off all the Doom fans. Also, there were some very random parts just added for good measure. Scenes that felt were just added so that every type of action fan had something to walk away with. The most notable was when 2 of the characters began to have a fist fight that lasted for about 6 minutes. But this was no ordinary fist fight, this was a hardcore, balls-to-the-wall, Matrix-copying fight. People being thrown into walls, punched 10 feet back, getting stabbed in the hand and not even caring, all lead up to a very cheesy climatic final showdown. Not only is straying away from the leap-out-and-scare-you formula a bad idea, even more so when it started to work about half way through, it makes it an even more bad idea when thats what the game was about. They should have stuck with it. The director almost had it, you could feel that he was starting to go somewhere with it, then he just rolled it up into a ball and throws it at you and laughs. The only part about the movie I liked was the actors. A few of them were very good. The actor who played Goat was by far the best in the whole movie with Reapers actor following in on a close second.All in all, this is a very bad movie. If you're a Doom fan, you most likely already went out and saw it and I feel sorry for you. If you're just someone looking for a good action film, go somewhere else.",Doom
580,cashcleaner35,I've seen a lot of bad movies in my time...,2,28 December 2005,"...And I can easily place this on the ""Bottom Ten Must-Not-See"" List. Horrible script and below-par acting mires the whole film from start to finish. The only good scene to come out of it is the few minutes towards the end where the camera takes on the perspective of the FPS game itself. It's sad that such a good concept from the game (ie: elite marine units fight off the minions of hell itself on a remote research outpost on Mars) has been changed and diluted to little more than Resident Evil in Space.One could assume that the problems with a Doom movie would be lack of a substantial plot or little reference to develop characters. The argument goes that since the game itself had no discernible story, the movie couldn't hope to either. I believe that analogy to be untrue, and that pointing to the game to excuse the flaws of the movie is incredibly unprofessional. Kudos go to David Callum for further alienating the Doom fan-base and for seemingly going out of his way to make a mockery of a popular game franchise.Despite what a few may say, this movie is very bad. Even if you want another mindless action film.",Doom

You go because there's a lot of gore and violence and its entertaining as hell. For what the movie sets out to do, its better than everything else I've seen based on the video game represented. Its a slow movie for the first half, then it really gets rewarding. Its so innovative where it goes that I have to give it a 7. Whenever you think you're gonna predict what happens, there's a break in the monotony. I loved it. they did a good job with really bringing out a decent work given so little to work with. Id recommend it, but ESPECIALLY if you've played the games. everything from ""the sequence"" to the end of the movie simply kicks major ass. Some will love it, some will hate it and thats fine.

The games had no story, it just said ""begin"" and you ran around killing monsters with an awesome arsenal of weapons, great fun.I'm 15 know and i have Doom 3. Know Doom 3 actually had a story and heaps better graphics and looked great, but i kept getting lost and i was annoyed so i played GTA:SA for the next couple of months. Then i saw a trailer of this film that looked awesome! I put away GTA:SA and played Doom 3 furiously for the next two weeks because i really wanted to see this film without the risk of having the story ruined.I loved the game, manly because it actually scared me with the light off and it turned up. But it had a good story and you kicked some ass.After completing it i when to see this film... and i hated it. It had nothing to do with the game at all. All it had was the Union Aerospace Coroperation, Mars and the BFG 9000, thats about it.It had NOTHING to do with Hell or the devil. This is what separated DOOM from other games and how this could of separated from any other bad zombie movie, actually being about hell braking loose.This was about some extra cromiszone in the human body (witch really is what makes you have downs syndrome!) and people mutating into Imp's (a demon from the game) and ""super humans""...WTF?! And there was no Ark as well.Not only is this movie unfaithful to the game, it doesn't make sense.The Game was scarier, more fun and made a lot more sense than this.

It's a win-win situation.If you like big guns, funny stuff, stuff that gets shot, creative use of technology, gore, and stuff, with lots of stuff like animals and cells (both kind), you should see this movie. It's the stuff.IMDb has given me the opportunity to vote for this movie and write a comment. For this I am grateful. I have read many comments saying this movie wasn't good enough for the fans. I loved all three Doom games (but didn't play the expansion for the third installment, and for this I am sorry) and I must say, this is the best movie from a game since Mortal Kombat.This movie did a couple of new things on stuff you thought you knew. Your gamer's instinct or movie-person's instincts are often misguided by a new and innovative twist on simple things, this is what is refreshing and stimulating about this movie.You got the good old' things, and no more old' bad stuff. The old' bad stuff has been replaced with some new good stuff. Well, the 'Doorway To Hell' is gone, but 'Hell' has been given a whole new meaning. This isn't a shooter-movie, it's a shooter-movie with an excellent script.Don't believe me or call me a liar, I don't care. I just think this movie rocked both worlds.So they made some changes. Big Deal. It's a movie, not a remake of the third game.I would've changed one thing, and that was a longer ending battle, having the bad guy come back one more time, but bigger and stronger, but apart from this Doom blew away all my expectations for a game-movie.The Music rocked. The Visuals shocked me in the good kind of way. The plot and coming together of the little puzzle pieces towards the end just had me by the throat and wouldn't let go.Believe what you want.

The camera-work is good in the film, even the infamous ""FPS sequence"" must've taken some degree of skill to execute. Alas, the film has been cursed by the usual cheesy script that we've come to know and hate. It's those unneeded one-liners - which you'd think might fit a movie about the DOOM video-game (because the game itself is full of them) - that are just so frequent and repetitive they really top the awful bits off in this movie.I was surprised to see Dexter Fletcher of all people, and I'm still not sure whether his accent in the film was American or English, if it was an attempt at the former it was so bad it just confused me.Anyway, I see Bartkowiak directing some superior films in his future career, he's not bad at all. I wasn't won-over by this video-game adaptation, but at least he's not another Uwe Boll!!!

587,HardCharger,It is what it is.... I also checked spoiler but its mostly opinion related.,5,21 October 2005,"I enjoyed the movie for what it was. I gave this a 5 rating. I played the original game of Doom for HOURS and HOURS with my Dad.. lol. If the name of the movie wasn't Doom, I might not have even made the connection.The movie to me seemed like the normal bug hunt movie we all know and love. It's basically the same thing over and over and we all keep going back for more. This one had it's own little back-story and plot, but it all melts down to the same thing.I thought the special effects were pretty good and the story was good enough to support the reason for the assault team to be involved there. The thing that mostly bothered me was never really getting a good look at any of the monsters. The movie was Dark for most of the chase scenes and the not getting a good look at the monsters part didn't really leave you hoping to get a better glance.As far as it being a gamer film.. I don't think they overdid it. Like I say, I probably would not have even connected it to Doom from my experience with it anyway.The small part where they did the camera like a first person shooter though.. now that was cool. Gamer or not, you will most likely like it and if you are a gamer you will for sure. I especially liked how going round a corner had that flat effect it always has on me in game and how I tried to turn my head to make Reaper look around the corner faster, just like I do in the game. lol 5 though.

I wonder who the genius was that decided to take the plot from 1 video game & movie (genetic human mutant zombies from Resident Evil), then use it for a different video game based movie that game-wise has a completely different plot. DooM is about demonic aliens invading mars through portals found on an archaeological dig. This movie could have been so much more, & so much better. I even read the DooM novels & was expecting the storyline from that, but was bitterly disappointed by an obvious rip off. Hopefully, those bigwig Hollywood producers will find whoever wrote this script & hang him. I cannot fathom why someone would take a great story from a classic game with an excellent plot, then change it completely to something that was already done to death & sucked the first time around.

The Rock was a real bad a** in this movie as "" Sarge"" you can only describe him as cutthroat, get the job done ,if you get in my way I will kill you ,borderline psychotic marine.But i loved it.The guy who played ""Reaper"" was enjoyable as the man who sort of was trying to avoid his past( further into the movie you see why). But the performance that is going to make you laugh is the character of ""Portman"" his sarcasm is too funny.

The story from Doom 3 (VG) has a much better plot in which scientists discover a portal to Hell and artifacts that are supposed to keep the demons in Hell. I thought in the movie the pathogen that infects the base was fairly accurate, however it initially comes from the portal from Hell in the game and turns people into the demons that already exist in Hell. Another thing I didn't like about the movie is that they didn't have enough variety of monsters. They only had the Imp, the Pinky Demon, Zombies, and the Hell Knight. Personally I would of liked to see others such as Mancubus, Arch Vile, Revenants, and especially the Cyberdemon. I expected the hero to fight Sarge but I didn't expect it to be the last battle before returning to Earth. I was really hoping for it to be the Cyberdemon. One more thing is that they could of toned down on the ""F"" word. All in all I would of been more pleased if it closely resembled Doom 3 in the story.

591,halldaniel,One of the worst films ever made,1,4 November 2005,"So the movie outing for the video game ""Doom"" finally arrives, with guns blazing and chain saws chugging away. And the verdict?Well, bad. Not just a bit bad, but incredibly woeful. Although it has passed into legend how video game adaptations simply don't transfer successfully onto the big screen (Streetfighter anyone), this film has found new depths in its unspeakable failings.An inexcusable, incoherent mess of a movie, this is loud, brainless nonsense aimed at undemanding cinema fodder. Everything is to blame here, not least the shoddy, hole-ridden, cliché-heavy plot, which will no doubt incense the puritan followers of the video game franchise. At fault too is the wooden acting, with the cast seemingly drifting through every scene as though the final pay check is their sole purpose for featuring in such irrelevant pap. What is significantly bad, however, is how boring the film is. The first half of the movie is seemingly spent lurking around dark corridors, with a shadow seen here, a noise heard there. Not terribly exciting, and the following half managing to be even worse, culminating in a first-person Doom-esquire scene that is so embarrassing to watch it hurts, and clearly marks a new found low in modern cinema as we know it. What is worse, however, is that it's one of the movie's few 'exciting' moments.An inconceivable failure that should be avoided at all costs. This film should only be watched as an example of how terribly bad Hollywood productions can be.",Doom

Why did they have to put that 5 minute video game affect in there Ill never know. We were all enjoying the film and then it just ticked me off when they put those video game affects in the movie. I thought there was a good story and it was flowing very well. But they lost steam toward the end and messed up a film. Oh well who ever was paid to do that and who ever was allowed to do that should be fired. because we are all not video game freaks. Some of us like good movies where they try to do 100% for the whole movie. It seems like someone just gave up and made a quick end to the movie. If there is a Doom 2 I will see it in hopes that they will keep the movie solid and learn from there mistakes. Over all it was worth watching but at the one point where video game affect start we all became agitated at the film. It was like a slap in the face and you just woke up from a dream.

Isn't this just like saying that a piece of crap is okay for what it is? I'm sorry, but as far as I'm concerned, a piece of crap is a piece of crap.I find it interesting that the one thing that critics and defenders of this movie seem to agree on is that it was ""mindless"". The defenders keep saying that it was only ""meant"" to be mindless shoot-em-up. How does that justify it? You mean the writers actually intended to make a piece of crap? Well golly, I guess that makes it great then, since they succeeded.And as for all you people who are saying that the ones who didn't like it must have been expecting an artistic, emotional movie and should go watch a romantic comedy - do you honestly believe that anyone who went to see Doom actually expected to get an artistic, emotional movie? All I personally expected (or at least hoped for) was a half decent movie that would expand upon the Doom experience, and possibly enhance it. The Doom movie could have been a great opportunity to expand on some of the thematic, atmospheric, sci-fi and psychological elements that were not fully explored in the games. Instead, Universal decided to make a crappy version of Resident Evil, and tried to pass it off as Doom by setting it on Mars and throwing in a BFG.Apart from the absence of Hell, which was the most obvious, and, in my opinion, unforgivable blunder that the screenwriters made, the movie completely failed to capture the pervading sense of isolation, hopelessness and torment that made the games (particularly Doom 3) so grueling and compelling. How did you feel when you played Doom, creeping along on 10 percent health, wondering how you were ever going to get through? How did you feel when you picked up a Berserk and became a psychotic maniac, surrounded by pentagrams, skulls and lava? How did you feel, in Doom 3, the first time you looked in to that bathroom mirror and saw yourself turning... into one of ""them""?Doom is not about a squad of special ops that get called in to an underground research facility to contain an outbreak of genetically engineered parasites. Doom is about demons trying to invade the world, and the lone marine who gets stranded on Mars - the only thing standing between Hell and Earth who has no choice but to somehow fight his way through and out the other side. It's the quintessential computer game plot.I had the impression that the writers just missed the point. It was as if they looked at the game and figured that it's just about shooting monsters with big guns. Sure, to some extent, that is what Doom is about. But it's also what a million games are about, so what is it that makes Doom so loved by so many? Perhaps the writers should have thought more about that before churning out this superficial, formulaic, and of course, ""mindless"" piece of crap that has precious little to do with the awesome game that it's supposed to be based on.The decision to use monster costumes rather than CGI sucked, because they weren't very good, and so to hide it, they hid the monsters in the dark and didn't let you see them much. I don't know about you, but I remember seeing a crap-load of monsters pretty damn clearly in the games. Doom has always occupied a computer generated universe, and personally, I think that that is where it belongs. If it were up to me, the entire film would be CGI, a la Final Fantasy or Flight Of The Osiris (Animatrix), and filled with hordes of gruesome beasts.Some argue that this movie could never have been anything other than a ""mindless"" shoot-em-up because Doom is so plot-thin, but I disagree. With a bit of imagination and a better understanding of and appreciation for the elements that made Doom so cool, I think the movie could have had just as much imagination-capturing appeal as the games did. I can't think of any reason for Doom fans to justify and defend this film when it so clearly let the fans down.",Doom
594,poopenmeyer,waste of a great license,4,17 April 2009,"The title of this film shouldve been ""Generic Space Action Movie"" or ""The Rock shoots things with the hot chick from die another day"".To be fair, the film was at least partially entertaining which is a lot more than I can say for unwatchable video game movies such as Alone In The Dark. However, the film completely wastes it's license I could just complain, so I will.Firstly, the story. DOOM and the subsequent DOOMs were all about the same thing. A sole surviving space marine battling the demonic hordes of HELL. This movie has a group of marines trying to save some people who have been infected by a virus that turns people into zombies, sound familiar? the only thing that sets this movie apart from other B-clichés is that some of the zombies turn into Imps and Hellknights. Though DOOM 3 which this movie drew most from had a few other survivors, it was still about the single marine fighting for his life. This movie brings in a bunch of faceless marines discernible only by their stereotypes who's sole purpose is to raise the body count.This bring me to my next point, this ""film"" tries to blend horror and action. Admirable feat sure, Aliens did this amazingly well as did The Terminator however, this film makes no effort to blend these two genres. Instead it takes one cliché'd scene from a horror movie then the next scene is stolen from a random action movie, there is a jarring transition when really it should be fluid and focused. That being said, the movie is more horror than action which really sucks because most of the horror from DOOM came from HELL and all the HELLish things but all that is erased with any references to HELL. Then again, wouldn't want to offend all the devout Christians older than 15 who are fans of the video game and space/horror/action movies.Then of course there's the much talked about first person scene, the best part of this film. Not just because it's the most DOOM-esquire but because it has the most visual flair out of the entire film. If the entire film were shot this way it could've turned out something like Cloverfield. Lastly, the sparse references to the game, what do we have, let's see... There's the UAC, Imps, Hellknights, chainsaw, bfg and a pinky demon. Six things that are specifically DOOM. Firstly let's talk weapons. As a first person shooter, weapons are pretty much the most important thing and yet not only does the movie feature practically none that are in the game, but the poster for the film features a weapon that's not in either the film OR the game! Great job, poster guys. Firstly everyone uses machine guns yet the machine gun was only used in DOOM 3 and it sucked. Shotguns aren't properly utilized, no plasma guns, rocket launchers or even pistols. The BFG was needlessly explained to be a ""bio-force gun"" and was blue. Would it have been SO hard to be green? They shouldve called it the ""Bum F-ing of the Game"". DOOM is about 2 things first and foremost, GUNS and MONSTERS you shoot with said guns yet the film only features 3 specifically DOOM monsters, Imps, Hellknights and a pinky demon. I assume they tried to adhere to reality by only showing the most human like monsters then a guy who is half segway turns into a pinky demon. Perhaps you turn into a dog demon when you don't have a weener or an butt(but the film had enough weeners and a-holes making it right? oh snap!). If they chuck a pinky demon in why not a mancubus or at least a cacodemon, the mascot of the DOOM series. Also a hell knight was needlessly carrying a chainsaw, not Bernie! When you're giant and have claws, you don't need a chainsaw!Anyway enough complaining, despite those last thousands or words, this film does have enough shooting to keep you watching and the imp stuck in the wall was cool but damn it, it could've been SO much better.",Doom
595,The_Yakuza,"Holy Crap, This is GOOD!",10,19 April 2007,"This is one hell of a movie. They changed the story to more resemble DOOM 3 instead of the original DOOM, but it is still a great. Karl Urban delivers a great performance as Reaper, the only RRTS(Rapid Response Tactial Squad) Member to survive. The Rock ROCKS as Sarge, the ""any means necessary"", by the book Marine Sergeant who is just a bit psycho. The rest of the cast are unknowns except for Rosemound Pike, who was in the bond flick, Die Another Day. If you buy this movie, get the unrated version because it is better than the regular version. The rest of the RRTS team have names like Portman, Duke, Destroyer, Mack and Goat. The weapons are cool, especially the BFG. The BFG has gone by many names, such as ""Big Fragging Gun"" ""Big Force Gun"" and my favorite, ""Big F**King Gun"". All in All this is one great movie!",Doom
596,revolutions_999,Doom is impressive but not great,7,9 November 2005,"I have never played the actual game but after watching this movie I am well impressed indeed. Furthermore, fans of The Rock will certainly like this movie. It is action-packed from the first minute to the last not like Resident Evil where it takes 20 minutes to start the beginning plot. Also there is video game like shooting scene when Duke starts to shoot everything in his way.But there are some downside on this game. First, the dialogs are lame. Other than that, this movie is actually about monsters from you know where but they changed the synopsis and the monsters are now created by those mad scientists.Overall this movie is satisfying and impressive but not great. The next sequel should be much more horrific and must have more monsters.",Doom
597,blackninja-1,A mind-blowing (literally) special-effects extravaganza,8,7 February 2006,"When I first heard there was a movie coming out based on Doom, I was both excited and angered. Most video game-based movies totally bomb, as I'm sure most of you are aware. Before I even start the review, let me say one thing: the people who say ""WORSE THAN THE MARIO BROS. MOVIE!!!"" are idiots.That said, here's my two cents on the movie. Because I know no-one pays attention to this site's spoiler warning, I'll warn you myself: there WILL be spoilers in this review.Doom starts off fairly slow, believe it or not. We are introduced to the futuristic Earth this movie takes place on, and then we are introduced to the characters. They teleport to a distant research facility on the planet Mars, and then things start to pick up. We learn of an extra chromosome which was apparently added to people living on Mars many years ago - and then we learn of the plot to try and replicate this chromosome and add it to modern humanity. It works - on some people. What about the other people? Well, as the movie's tag-line says, ""All Hell breaks loose."" The special effects in this movie are, as can be expected, incredible. The FPS (First-Person-Shooter) scene is nothing short of amazing - there are many clever nods to the game.OK, so I've told you some of the good - now for the bad. Once again, I warn that this contains spoilers.The movie's plot is very good and has many interesting twists. However, it is only very loosely based on the game. In the game, the ""monsters"" are actually demons. From Hell. In the movie, they are people who respond adversely to the introduction of the 24th chromosome to their body. In the game, the monsters come from a portal to Hell that is accidentally opened. In the movie, they come from the ignorance of scientists. While this can be overlooked and the movie enjoyed in spite of it, gaming purists may be upset with the change.Finally, I'd like to point out that there are two different versions of this DVD. There's the regular version (the R rated version shown in theaters) and there's an unrated version. The only difference between the two is that the unrated version has an extended (and yes, more violent) FPS scene. The unrated version also includes a couple extra features about the making of the FPS scene.Overall, Doom is a very good movie. It's definitely not for the faint of heart, and some gaming purists might not like the changes made to the game's terrifying plot. However, if you can ignore both of those things, you can expect to get some awesome thrills from Doom.",Doom
598,sdlehman1,"If Halo is like this, I think I might cry...",1,3 July 2006,"The first thing I want to get out of the way is that this film shares the same name as the game franchise and that's all. Nothing else. We're done with that subject. Moving on...Back in October of '05 I had planned to spend some time with my father. We decided to see Doom. It looked cool and I had enjoyed Doom 3. But then the bad reviews had started piling up and we decided to back off.About five months later, it was released on DVD and we decided to give it a chance. This was one of the biggest mistakes of my life.The movie opens up with a cool Universal logo and Doom title screen. So far so good. But then people enter the movie. As soon as an actor is on screen it all goes down hill.This is not a scary movie. The effects are good, but they don't frighten. Well okay, maybe it's not supposed to be scary. No biggie, I like action flicks. I like a lot of movies with corny lines. But there is a line that cannot be crossed. Doom not only crosses that line, it sh!ts on it. When the marines arrive on Mars, they find an unfortunate crippled man named Pinky. And even with his extremely tragic situation, he still keeps his sense of humor. He cracks a light-hearted joke about losing his legs. The Kid: Is it always that rough? Pinky: Believe me, it used to be a lot rougher. There was a time when Ark travel was susceptible to, let's say major turbulence. The Kid: What's he mean? John Grimm: He means he went to one galaxy, his ass went to another. Pinky: Call it a scientific miscalculation. Here are some more of the worst lines of all time:John Grimm: Like The Kid said, ""Go to Hell""! Sarge: Doctor Carmack's condition IS irreversible. (Shoots Carmack)Sarge: Because Carmack's condition is THAT. He's dead.Corporal Dean Portman: Ladies, we're under a Level 5 quarantine so I'm gonna have to strip search you girls.Sarge: Kill them all, let God sort them out.Samantha Grimm: You know, Duke, I bet secretly you've got a big heart. Duke: Oh, yeah? Well, guess what other secret big thing I got? Samantha Grimm: You mean your penis, right? Duke: (chuckles) Lady, you have no idea. Female electronic voice: RRTS Special Ops clearance verified. Handle ID: Destroyer. Destroyer: Daddy's home. Female electronic voice: Handle I D: Mac. Handle ID: Portman. Handle ID: Goat. Handle ID: The Kid. The Kid: ""The Kid""? Female electronic voice: Handle ID: Duke. Duke: Say my name, baby. Sarge: Semper Fi, mother******!I think the Rock alone destroyed the movie. His personality changes immediately and for no reason.Sarge: Reaper, we better check this tapes out. It could tell us what is going on. Reaper: Okay. (video shows zombie stuff) Reaper: Oh my God! Sarge we have to do something! Did you see that? Sarge: I didn't see sh!t. And I ain't paid to see sh!t.After this Sarge goes on a killing spree. One victim in this spree is one of his one marines when he refuses to murder an innocent person. We never learn why the Sarge has the sudden change of heart.At first the 1st person scene was kinda cool. Then it became obvious that it was wasted film and time. It was like a carnival haunted house. One thing attacked him. Zombies just leaned against a wall and laughed maniacally.GradesDialog: FEffects: B+Story: D-Acting: FMovie: FThis movie only ranks above the likes of Dirty Dancing and Hulk.

599,too-tall-1,Doom Unrated DVD,10,7 February 2006,"I've seen Doom in the theaters, the experience was ruined by gamers sitting behind me ""aww, ohhh, yes!!!"" the whole movie long, but re-watching it on DVD i was able to seriously enjoy it to its potential.at this point the Doom Unrated DVD should be rated FP. for F***ing Pyschotic. it is the ultimate experience, from the movie to behind the scenes/bonus features.

So for historical sake this movie should be in your collection as well.",Doom
600,Jesse76-1,Even for an Action Movie Based On A Video Game...,3,13 January 2006,"Doom the video game is a cult classic. From gaming nerds to prom kings, everyone has heard of it. With a great story under their belt and a cast of a decent (if not good) caliber, I would have expected more from this movie.OK so they took out the Hell sequences altogether, I can live with that...they put in a cheesy, unresolved, and unexplained story between a Marine brother and a Scientist sister...I can even deal with that. I can't deal with the fact that the people in charge here had such a burning desire to cater to the video game users, that they added in a 10 minute sequence of first person action that can only be explained as awful. What were they thinking? It was choppy and had no contribution to anything that the movie had to offer.I enjoy an action movie with no plot line as much as the next guy. Believe me, I own a collection. I can't appreciate this movie for too many reasons. First off, the special effects aren't all that special...leaving them at the modestly and aptly named, ""effects"". The monsters were never really shown in clear view, shadowed and hidden by a camera that was shaky and whipped around all too often. The final effect wasn't suspense, it was that they were trying to cover up the fact that the monsters weren't all that well put together (and for 70 million, the same amount of money that was spent on ""I Robot"", I would have expected more).So the monsters are underwhelming at best. The guns? Well...the BFG melting effect is not too bad, the rest are simply machine guns and pistols. If they wanted to really throw something at the game users, they would have incorporated the full arsenal of weaponry (where my plasma rifle at?). The movie ends with such a lack of subtlety, it's almost as if the producers ran out of scratch and just decided to scrap the rest of the project (Did they spend all of the money on the closing credits?).So honestly, the movie wasn't that bad in the first hour, after that, it took a tumbling fall down a hill to nowhere. I suggest you rent this if you are a fan of the genre or the video game (I am of both). Other than that...steer clear at all costs. Of course, you can turn it off after the first hour is done...Hell, they pretty much do it 30 minutes later anyways.Jesse",Doom
601,N_Rivers,"I had low expectations, and was pleasantly surprised.",5,11 May 2009,"Knowing that this was a video game adaptation, I had little expectations of this resembling the game that much. I wasn't surprised when the plot was changed, although the genetic experiment plot has been way overdone, in my opinion. It might have been interesting, if they had tried to re-create the original conditions of the game, and make a portal to Hell. That would have been hard to take seriously, and a bit hard to believe, perhaps. Although the science used to explain the situation seemed equally implausible.With all this, I continued to be disappointed that they didn't even try to recreate some of the sets of the game. This could have been done without harming the story that much. Obviously, they could have updated things a bit. Fifteen minutes into the film, I had completely dumped any expectations of this being Doom.Frankly, I came into this movie expecting something similar to those endless monster movies that they crank out every Saturday on Sci-fi channel. I was actually surprised that the movie was a lot better than that. The acting was pretty good for an action movie. It carried things along decently, without making you cringe. They didn't delve so deep into the characters that it weighed the action down. There weren't an unnecessary amount of flashbacks or tender moments to make you care about the expendable characters. There was little over-dramatic acting that usually accompanies productions of this nature.There was a ""First Person Sequence"" that amused me. At this point, I forgave the movie a bit (more). For those that are skeptical, the shot showed the muzzle of the weapon, and proceeded to show the gun-wielding character making an assault Doom-style. Though such a perspective was far from realistic, it was a pretty faithful tribute to the game of Doom -- minus the status bar.I would say that this was a decent movie. It was better than a lot of similar movies that have been released. The twist was pretty much expected. I suppose it was even more expected considering that they hadn't shown any former sergeants yet. The movie could have been so much worse. There could have been gross over-acting. There could have been obvious (and awkward) attempts to splice and drop terms from the game into the movie. The only example of this was when the BFG was introduced. That seemed overdone.Even though, there were no flying meatballs, or animated skeletons, I think the movie was enjoyable and flowed pretty good. I think that those that aren't expecting a recreation of the game won't be disappointed. However, that's the dilemma for a movie that's titled ""Doom"", though. Isn't it?",Doom
602,potterpiano,"This is NOT ""Doom"". This is just a bland space thriller.",2,8 September 2018,"Look, video game movies are rarely decent, but this is not even about the video game it pretends to be about. ""Doom"" is about literal demons from literal Hell (horns and hooves and everything,) accidentally loosed on a martian research base, fought by a lone Marine. He fights half a dozen different species of demon, getting progressively farther through the base.This movie, however, isn't any of those things. This is just another ""space zombie"" movie. It's closer to Halo than Doom, and it's nothing like that, either. This is a story about a science experiment gone wrong, creating ONE type of monster, which mutates from humans, being fought by a team of marines, escorting a scientist. They mostly stay in one small part of the base, allowing us to completely forget this is Mars, and largely forget that this is the future. It includes things the games never did, like ""nano doors,"" and ""chromosome 24"". Emotional tensions within the group account for a significant amount of the conflict. With the exception of Richard Brake, the actors do a very good job of trying to spice up a fairy cookie-cutter plot and script. Karl Urban, Dwayne Johnson, Rosamund Pike, and Razzaq Adoti all do the best they can, but they can't change the fact that most of the marines come in one flavor: Hard-bitten badass. Pike as the scientist has no personality beyond lame science exposition, and only three marines have the slightest personality. The Kid is the standard scared rookie, Portman is the disgusting perv, and Duke is the only one that is mildly likeably written. He is acted very well, and seems almost human. None of these characters, however, have any depth. There is one attempt at interesting cinematography, in a four-minute first-person shooter point-of-view, in an attempt at reminding us which movie this is supposed to be. To be fair, nobody knew that Karl Urban and Dwayne Johnson had range back then, and could do comedy and drama quite well. Still, this feels like a studio had the rights to this movie, and figured they might as well use them before their rights expired, because ""What the hell, sure, why not?"" but didn't give it decent funding, decent attention, and tried to make it conform to standard Hollywood story formulas, forgetting that this was a video game. Or possibly, it was just Hollywood not giving Gamers enough credit for being intelligent or having sophisticated tastes? ""Sure, they'll eat up anything, as long as it's 'Doom.'"" Whichever, this falls flat. If it were billed as just another space thriller about the dangers of risky science, it might pass muster as being mediocre. As an attempt at ""Doom,"" well, it succeeds in being a different story altogether, and a bland one at that.",Doom
603,Harper07,I actually liked it,7,7 February 2006,"Unlike a lot of the other gore-fest movies to come out in the last couple of years this one wasn't bad. It had a plausible storyline (come on, as human beings, when can we not leave well enough alone?)that was well adapted from the newer version of the game. I thought everyone wascast reasonably well, even the Rock, despite the criticism he takes for his acting abilities. To be honest I find it reminiscent of the second Alien movie and all the zombie blasting movies of the past decade, but a little more believable and enjoyable. The special effects were top notch, especially with the arc and the BFG. As well, hats off to the make-up guys, they did a phenomenal job with the more humanoid monsters.With an ending I did not see coming I enjoyed the movie quite a bit.",Doom

Its very Hollywood on how the whole thing is presented and creates a ""cheesy"" feel to the film. The one thing it had going for it, which made me see the film in the first place was the FPS scene. I saw the trailer and thought it would be pretty sick to see about 30-45 min of bit by bit fps stuff. Unfortunately, it was only about 7 min in the film and a couple of parts of it where sorta cheesy. Over all Dwane Johnson and Keith Urbal had good performances in not so great roles. I would give it a 5 for the best attempt at the whole FPS genre thus far. On a side note, Films based of games and Games based of Films don't usually do well. Just my 2 cents. -Frank The Tank",Doom

607,DarkArtimis,Doomed from the Start,6,26 February 2006,"Despite the performance of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, ""Doom"" falls short of the amazing thrill-fest promised at the box office. There was an interesting use of transition and there was the promised ""first person shooter view"", but it all came either too little or too late.Twenty minutes into the film we see the first of the infected people as a human, but in today's society we need to see those monsters bigger, better, faster, and I felt an infected human just didn't cut it. The special effects seemed somewhat lacking as well, the most common used being a ""nano-door"" which at it's high point was used to trap one of the creatures alive. Good, but not enough. As well, not enough blood spatter for most viewers and ""Doom"" fan's likings, we're talking bone-snapping, flesh eating freaks remember! The ending somewhat lacked as well, though a cool fight scene kept me readily amused for a while, just seeing Sarge thrown back onto Mars while the only two survivors escape was nice, there was absolutely no sense of closure. If a sequel is being written and made, the directors and writers had better bring Sarge back as a big bad-ass villain, all this technical crap throughout the movie just didn't cut it! I came to see ""Doom"" after all, I expect explosions and mass death! If I wanted science followed by alien fights, I'd wait for a ""Half Life"" movie, but I'm not, so do it right!However, I will not fail this movie based on 2 things. 1: The Rock! Despite he being written as a bad guy, he acted well proving once again he is The People's Champ both in the ring and on the silver screen. And 2: B.F.U., or the Big ****** Gun as it's referred to.

Sure Sarge finds a futuristic weapon about halfway into the film, but why wouldn't they have had them in the beginning? And cameras on the rifles? Plus they were not wearing helmets. What kind of infantryman goes into combat without head protection? At the very least they could have had infrared motion sensors in the dark scenes of the movie. And the dark scenes were so dark that I couldn't even see what was going on. Is this a good way to film a movie, so the audience can't see it? Lighting on a budget I guess. Even in ""Alien"" they had proximity detectors. This was just a bad movie, with an even worse ending. Avoid it at all costs. It cost me $3.99 on Directv PPV; spare yourself.",Doom

All you people who think that its crap because its not 100% like the game are a bunch of whiners. Think about it, why change the idea of hell into mutation? Hmmm, lets think...oh, I know because all the religions in the world would complain their asses off about the depiction of hell being shown to the general public. Granted it may not be the only reason but its still a valid one. Besides, the mutation idea still worked in my opinion. So did the idea of a team being whittled down to one man (well, two if you include the demonic Dwayne Johnson +The Rock+). The Imps and Hell Knights were true to the original models of Doom3 as well as the 'Pinky' demon, which was cool as hell (aithanku). But enough of discrediting the critics. All in all the film was great (if a little short) and had some great scenes, like the Sarge finding the BFG. But...the best part of the whole film has to be...the first-person scene. How cool can you get?! You get to see some zombies being annihilated, Imps being pasted, a couple of Hell Knights being blown to pieces and even a 'Pinky' demon being eviscerated and lobotomized!

But not this one.Sure, it didn't have much monsters or Hell and it's base appearance was closer to Resident Evil than Doom, but it rocked! Atmosphere was excellent; dark areas, flipping lights, strange noises and gloomy passages. Just exactly the things that make Doom good. Especially episode III.And the 1st person scene. Marvellous. Awesome. Probably one of the best and memorable scenes i have ever seen in movies. Battle with ""pinky"" was so hardcore that i was nearly jumping up from my chair and shout out in joy!If you don't count that overwhelming zombie-stuff in this movie, i personally did not find much to complain and wonder why people have misjudged this movie and blame it shitty..Excellent action-movie in long time.+ Atmosphere + 1st person scene + actors + guns (Ok, assault rifles were pretty lame) + Big Fu**ing Gun(BFG) + Chainsaw + Pinky DemonNo Hell, monsters were just mutants - Lots of zombies, almost like Resident Evil - no shotgun (or if there were one, it was poorly designed) - Superhuman fight scene at the end9/10.",Doom
612,caz_2006,doom,4,9 April 2006,"I have played doom for years, it's the first game I played that got me into computer games (as a woman you can understand that a lot of games do not appeal to me).So when I heard that they were making it into a film - with Arnie as the original star, I got very excited.Then after all the hype it was put on hold, and I did not here anything about the film until recently.As soon as it came out on DVD in went my order and I excitedly put the film on.Started out fine, I thought they would have to change it slightly as I appreciate that it is difficult to transfer games/books onto the big screen.The action scenes are o.k but not scary enough. It was more like Aliens to begin with, with many characters, would have been better with one or two, would have made it more scary.A few of the monsters that appeared in the Doom game were there, but not many.The most disappointing thing about the whole film is that they changed the whole story. Where was Hell? there were no scenes of the dig, no pictures of Mars.It was a Resident Evil/Aliens spin off, but these films are so much better than the Doom film.The best thing the producers could do to make up for letting down the fans- who all paid good money to see it, is make a sequel that mirrors the game.Big let down after having waited so long to see it.",Doom
613,capbadge,Fun underlining of a top PC FPS Shooter.,8,12 April 2006,"I thought making a movie that would properly portray what Doom the PC game was about would be impossible. How could the foes in the game be represented, with any plausibility, in such a radically fictional plot/storyline. Being a huge fan of the Id software stable, I was disturbed that the movie was even being made. The ordinary cinema goer would probably not get much out of this but true Doom fans will see the point. The film never tries to be anything other than a 'fragfest' because the plot really is weak. The Rock does just enough as the leading marine but is overtaken in acting ability by the real hero of the film that emerges late on. I've read many negative reviews but I enjoyed it immensely.",Doom
614,Cosmo_8,Good Movie!,8,15 April 2006,"Okay, the guy who said DOOM didn't deserve do be called DOOM was certainly WRONG. The Movie was great. Dude, the reason they went to Mars instead of Hell, it's because they're saving Hell for DOOM 2. If you're a true DOOM gamer like myself, you would know that. And if you were a DOOM gamer, you would have realized that Reaper was Sarge. He has the beard like Sarge in the games... and in DOOM 2, Reaper will become Sarge. So personally man, your opinion is WRONG. Like, honestly, did you not watch the movie? It was great. I loved it, and watch it at night, with your buddies, and it makes a sweet movie, as I am watching it with my Brother and bud, as I am posting this.The Movie was good. 8 out of 10.",Doom

616,izeusbox,Utterly Boring,1,3 May 2006,"Now, here's what I don't get: we have this 'orrible movie, chock-full of clichés and bad acting and poorly filmed action scenes, and people basically complain that ""it does not follow the plot of Doom / Doom 2"". What plot would that be, pray? Doom was all about atmosphere and action, one of the first FPS that defined the genre (and I can remember all the way back to Wolfenstein 3D). Nobody cared about plot; it was scary, it was exciting, it was great.I have no problem with the revamped storyline. I have big issues with a set of generic cardboard characters who basically stand around listening to one-liners from The Rock, a plot that doesn't make sense and above all a movie that's neither scary nor exciting. There's people shooting bugs in a corridor, that's about it.They should have cut it down to ten minutes and upload it at youtube. It doesn't belong in theatres. And for the record, if I want first person perspective then I need to be the one doing the shooting, thank you very much.",Doom
617,l-f-almeida,Could have been better,7,4 May 2006,"I've watched Doom expecting a catastrophe but I was actually quite surprised. The movie has basically no connection at all withe the game which is the movie's biggest fault. The story is (like the game's) pretty thin. The main difference here is that the creatures in the movie come from scientific experiments (much of the story doesn't make any sense, but it doesn't matter).When it comes to carnage, this movie has plenty, and the action sequences are well made. The only part that really sucks is the fist fight at the end of the film (the movie is based on a first-person SHOOTER and the end of the film is a fist fight!).The first-person sequence blowed me away, it's very well done. The part when Grimm picks up the chainsaw to fight the Pinky demon is awesome.The visual effects of the film are well made and the sets, while not innovative or creative, is competent. The monsters look great (the zombies are kind of a knock-off from Dawn of the Dead). What disappointed me is the lack of more monsters, I mean, apart from the zombies, the movie features several Imps, a few Hellknights (or Barons, as the movie calls them) and the Pinky demon. It's really a waste because the Doom games features such terrifying and visually interesting creatures and it's disappointing that the movie features only 4 types of creatures...Summing up, if you want to watch this movie, I recommend that you watch it but don't expect a masterpiece. It's a solid action film but weak on the science fiction point of view. Compared to it's original source, Doom fares better at the game.",Doom

What I didn't understand is why they just didn't use the Doom the game storyline, it would've made an awesome movie, Hell, Hell monsters, come on, thats sweet right there! And the fight scene between the Rock and Karl urban OMG that was lame, I thought the sarge was the good guy?! like action and ""terrifying monsters"" then this is a good movie.. I hope they do better on a halo movie *crossing fingers* But yeah overall it was alright action movie sorta a cross between Pitch Black and Resident Evil.......",Doom
620,ViperZeroOne,"Was good, for the time slot",9,5 June 2006,"Well, like a lot of those commenting here I am an avid gamer and fan of the Doom series. Unlike a lot of the people posting here, from what I can see, I understand what can and can't be done with a movie.First we have time frame. Anyone expecting to see EVERYTHING that was in DooM is just kidding themselves. You only have 2 hours to introduce the characters, develop a story, execute it, and wrap it up. In a game you have an endless supply of time, because you can save your game and continue it later. I'm not sure about everyone else here, but it took me roughly 3 days of solid 8 hour gaming sessions to get through Doom 3. So in the game they had roughly 24 hours to do what had to be done in 2 hours with the movie. That kind of time frame is an impossibility for a movie, so things had to be changed.I find the storyline in the movie was very well adapted from the game. It kept with the Mars location, and the dig. We were given the portals, by way of the Ark, although I don't know why people here are failing to realize that. We were given as many of the weapons as possible, up to and including the BFG (which was a BFG 3000, not 9000, which explains the appearance changes). We were given 4 distinctive ""creatures"", which was great considering there were only 6 scientists missing. We were given a reason for those creatures, the ""C24"" gene, which fit the storyline and nicely removed ""Hell"", which would have been an impossibility to explain in a 2-hour movie. They even gave us a non-stop 1st person shooter sequence, which was apparently a bugger of a scene to do. All in all, perfection for a DooM named movie.To those gamers who feel ""cheated"" by this movie, you need to get over it. If it was made EXACTLY like the game then the movie would have sucked, hardcore, and been a box-office failure. I think the changes they did were perfect, and them tossing us gamers ""cookies"" every now and then was exactly what gamers should have been looking for.Anyone looking for an action movie, go check this puppy out. You won't be disappointed. Oh, and The Rock was the perfect Sarge. He fit that role WAY better than he did in any of his other movies.",Doom
621,cyoung_packers,Feared for the worst...but was good,6,17 June 2006,"I heard the rock was going to be in it and got worried (dont et me wrong the rock is a good actor) but in doom. I also thought that the story was a little to Space age, and on mars instead of Hell was a bad idea. The Game fans (like me) would of like it better if they were demons and in Hell like in the game and if it would follow the game a little more. The Story line of Reaper and the whole crew was different from the game, but eases your mind from going, How the hell could one guy take on a whole group of demons from hell. Mac lets discuss this worthless character, the only thing cool about him is how he gets killed. The movie did have characters that you were supposed to like and hate (ex. hate. Portman and Dr. Carmack ex. like Destroyer, Reaper and Duke). Also the storyline at least knew were it was going unlike some movie have such a jumble-f*ck on where he storyline is.

The suspense was great too...monster effects were good too, even though the mutated zombies could have been a bit more animated... ... and BTW...i read many reviews in the past of doom...and some n00bs asked what the hell ""semper fi"" means (says sarge at the end)...IT MEANS (for those who don't know it and criticize it) it means - always faithful...used by the marines in the past and Latin meaning ""semper fidele"". .....

625,TheReverendCloutier,You need the right mood,10,5 July 2006,"In DOOM, there is a moment where Karl Urban says to Rosamund Pike, 'They're marines, Sam. Not poets.' That line sums up DOOM.Don't expect an essay on the horrors of war. The title says it all, for God's sake....big muscles, big guns, bigger monsters and a hell of a good time. What separates DOOM from other movies is that you truly care what happens to the majority of our band of merry explorers, with The Rock/Dwayne Johnson managing to go from tough but fair father figure to psychotic villain. Karl Urban is one of my favourite actors, and he once again manages to stand out as the most impressive actor here, all sorrowful eyes and deep voiced brooding.Rosmaund Pike doesn't fair as well, with a turn-on turn-off English accent. Meanwhile, Dexter Fletcher provides nice support, with Richard Brake and Al Weaver giving good performances.There are a few moments of true greatness (teleportation, the BFG, the now famous 1st person shooter sequence) but very little brains. That's fine. Who expected brains from the trailer? But this movie is a joyride from start to finish and worth watching if you're into that sort of thing.",Doom

627,l_haxor_gamer,A hard letdown,5,6 July 2006,"I was one of the ones waiting in line opening day to see what i thought would have been one of the most anticipated gaming movies to date. When in theory it turns out to be a spin off of every zombie movie in the history of the horror genre. The movie was a huge letdown with the story leading nowhere near to the background of the game itself, the movie has not one indication that hell is tied into the mayhem caused on mars. Any DOOM fan would know that the mutations that happened within the UAC compound were caused due to being possessed and or slaughtered and brought back to life to do the devils bidding on anyone who would try to end his reign. The movie environment, weapons, and monsters however are accurate to the game itself. There is the all famous BFG weapon in the movie, the downside being nothing ever gets killed by it. The weapon itself is just awesome but some kills could have been a plus. But, the imps, pinkys and zombies are accurate, one downside is variety of monsters, there were so many in the game but so little in the movie. More monsters gives more anticipation to what could be around the next corner. But the most important part of the movie was the biggest downer of all, the famous first person mode that everyone sees in the preview ends up being a five minute run around of some insane shooting. Even though that was one of the coolest things i had ever seen it could have been longer and had some more killing of bigger and stronger monsters. If there is a second movie it could be improved on by adding more length to the first person mode spaced at different points in the movie and have the movie somehow tie back into the storyline of the game. However, that may be impossible now that the movie has gone so far off track, but only time will tell.So in summary i gave this movie a 5 out of 10 for some accuracy but needed improvement, next time hopefully will make up for mistakes made in the first movie.",Doom
628,ajc1663,really excellent work of Art,8,18 July 2006,Doom is the first movie I have seen that has successfully included the actual game base in the script and it doesn't take any of the action away from the movie. The actors were all the right choice. Although I am a bit bias when it comes to Dawayne Johnson aka the rock. it was good to see him in a role as a villain instead of the good guy done wrong. The characters were thought out well and the special effects were excellent. I hope to see this type of quality in future movies taken from computer games. Looking forward to doom 2 as Reaper never reached the surface at the end of Doom. And there are many more monsters and planets to see.,Doom
629,n8brehm,DooMed from the start...,3,21 October 2005,"After the cool opening with the ""Mars-Universal"" logo, there's a not so interesting beginning with the scientists being slaughtered. Then we end up on earth. Earth is not Mars, and Mars is where Doom is supposed to take place. When they finally DO get to Mars there is a rehash of The Predator for about 45 minutes, we find out that the ""demons"" aren't demons from hell but are genetically engineered people turned zombies and we have Resident Evil for the remaining bulk of the film. No demons, no Hell, and no one man against an army of evil. Just the Rock and bad one liners.I must say this though; towards the end of the film, the 5 minute first-person action sequence was a little slice of heaven hidden among all that garbage. That's the only thing that saved it from being a total waste. Not even the BFG scored any points with me. Sorry Dwayne...",Doom

Be thankful.So what if it's not 100% like the game? It's still a damn good movie and I think they did a good job with it. It's not supposed to hold any metaphors about life, or anything deep. It's an action/horror flick not an epic. Sometimes, people just need to sit down, unwind, and enjoy a good movie and DOOM is just that. Something you can relax and enjoy without trying to have to unravel the complexities of some huge plot after pulling your 9 to 5.The movie works. Even if the storyline isn't *exactly* like the game. You know...Jackson added his flair into Lord of the Rings and you didn't see people dying...so, my mantra is it *isn't* the game, it is a *movie* BASED on the game, so get over it.",Doom
631,tripredacus7,Another excellent game turned terrible on the big screen,1,17 August 2006,"This movie was such a disappoint like all the others directors have based off of games and novels.Doom was not no Resident Evil copy cat or anything. The point of Doom originated on the planet Mars, scientists from UAC of the planet Earth discovered the means of an ancient teleporter, they recreated it and the teleporter was actually a portal to Hell. And there were no mutations, there were demons, dried up skin or grotesque, fangs, claws, uniquely shapened bodies like off of Doom 3, where they throw plasma fireballs from their hands. And zombies are not supposed to run, their supposed to be sluggish and more disfigured if their the undead or if their people possessed by evil spirits. Sarcasm and marine action was okay, but the whole super human battle in the end is getting old in movies, c'mon!this is supposed to be horror movies with monsters from the darkest nightmares, what better nightmares for monsters than demons manifesting into our world, killing everyone in so many ways and splattering their human victims all over the walls and floors. Demons manifesting all of the sudden with bright flame colored pentagrams glowing on the floor as the demon teleports from hell to our world. Seeing scary words written in blood written in dark rooms with a mere flashlight to shed light when a demon just lunges from a dark corner. Thats scary, that's true horror. Directos now a days have just lost their creativity in making a excellent horror or any type of movie based off of a video game.

The acting is good, good enough for a blockbuster action movie, all though I never really liked the rock before, I do now as he was just right for 'Sarge'. The only downsides I could find in this movie was that there was no hell (which was what made the games so creative) and the awfully sad end fight sequence, I thought after the FPS sequence (which was cool but a bit silly) the film kinda fell apart in that last kinda 10-15 minutes but all in all, the special effects where great, the acting was good and the characters where believable, the setting was creepy and the music score was excellent I give this movie 8/10 because I am a HUGE doom fan and this movie wasn't a disappoint at all, GREAT FUN, go watch!...and play the games too ;) ha ha",Doom
633,pridgeoftheapocolypse,Quite possibly one of the worst movies ever made,3,6 September 2006,"This is quite possibly the worst action movie I have ever seen, and also the worst video-game based movie of all time. Only the die-hard Doom fans will stick up for this horrible excuse for film.The story takes place twenty years after an event which transpired in 2026. A portal was discovered in the Nevada desert, which led to Mars. Yada yada yadaA movie with such a high budget should have at least been able to have good actors. During the whole movie the Rock doesn't seem to be capable of swearing properly, as each ""f"" word sounds more ridiculous than the last. I actually bursted out laughing when he said ""Semper fi mother F*****!"" It was really that horrible. The voice acting for each of the characters is down right pathetic.The movie itself is riddled with plot holes, things that don't make a lick of sense. At one point this lady just pops up in an area that has been locked down (meaning no one goes in or out) and she starts talking about her relationship with a friend. At that point I replayed the part of the movie that shows who goes into the locked down area, and she was no where in sight. I suppose the writers of the movie decided not to explain half of the things they threw into the film.The action scenes weren't even all that great. If you've seen a movie where people shoot at monsters, don't bother watching this one, because it doesn't bring anything new to films... except for that weird first person perspective sequence....Near the end of the movie, the camera switches to the first person perspective of one of the characters, and for around fifteen minutes he is just walking around, shooting bad guys with guns. It actually looked like a horribly done video game, no lie. Some of the monsters would pop around and corner, and just hissed at the character. I also suppose that in the future, they still haven't perfected working light bulbs. You heard me right. Many times characters' lights would just flicker out like a cliché'd horror flick, and at times these toughly trained marines would make silly mistakes that no trained marine would make. The film tries to be an action/horror title, and to me it seems like a mix of Aliens/Dawn of the Dead. (If you haven't seen either film, watch them first, they are much better than this junk)About the only thing that this movie has going for it, is lots of blood, gore, and a scene of nudity. And even then, its nothing to get excited about. Even for an action movie this is still a horrible excuse for film.I'm a hardcore Doom fan, so let a fan of the series recommend something for you.Buy an awesome computer, or an Xbox, get the Doom 3 game, and get the crap scared out of you.

This movie is for those who like mindless action movies and how just want to be entertained.I now there are those how believe that the Rock should have been the Doom Guy, but personal I thought that he was perfect for the role of Sarge.

The movie to any non doom fan could become boring but if you give the movie and the rock time you wont be disappointed you made a big bowl of popcorn.

But some of the people who were expecting to see a true remake of the game might be disappointed to see that the plot has been almost completely altered, with only a few bare-basic facts remaining, like the Martian location. Having said this, it could be that the film is not a re-telling of the Doom saga, but actually just a continuation of it, as at a point in the film it is revealed that the John Grimm character has some connection to the excavation sites, and that maybe what we are watching is just what has happened to the Mars UAC base in the future, after the gateways to hell have long since been closed.",Doom

I would give anything to see DOOM in theaters.

While I've heard a lot of negativity about the CGI (which there wasn't much of) and animatronics, I was bought by them.Second, the ""scarry Effect"". I am not one to get scarred at ""scarry"" movies, in fact, the last time a movie scarred me, I was 6 years old. My girlfriend would still be teasing me to this day if it wasn't for the fact that she was holding my arm through the whole thing, and screamed at several points :D.

642,fochoa-3,This is not a DOOM movie,1,12 December 2006,"I was pretty exited when I saw some trailers about the DOOM movie, being a Shooter Video Game fan I thought, it would be fantastic to see in the big screen a terrifying story and scenarios in a Video Game, and having in mind the release of DOOM 3 some months before the movie, it was a great complement of the VG. Having a lot of things to do I didn't have the chance to see it in theaters so I waited for the DVD release, I remember that I saw it a Saturday afternoon with my wife expecting something really creepy.I started to worry when the characters started to talk about a problem in Mars (nothing related with Hell) and the idea to be there for a rescue??.It was obnoxious and annoying spent almost an hour seeing a bunch of bad actors talking about subjects that weren't related to the game.I didn't see the movie until the end, I preferred to stop the DVD player and do something else.So, if you are a FPS Video Game fan and DOOM 3 is one of your favorites don't look at this movie, you'll be disappointed.",Doom

Now that I have, I must say I'm very disappointed that this movie actually made it onto the silver screen.The movie starts with a group of marines getting to Mars and from there on just shoot their way through to the (miserable) end. There is no story whatsoever, it's not even ""scary"" compared to the Doom video game and pretty much everything else such as the score, vfx, dialogue etc etc is on a very low level. Sad to see so much talent, time and money wasted.",Doom

It's just some crappy movie called Doom. I bet the people who made this movie didn't even play the game, and damn it sure made me grin when this movie got nominated for worst actor.

True I would have liked it more if it were more like the game. It could have been demons rather than a virus turning people into...hell really. But really what this movie did for me was two things, it brought one of my all time favorite video games to the big screen, and it showed me that movies based on video games can really be good. Not that I did not like Mortal Kombat or House of the Dead. The truth is I loved them. But in Doom the acting is WAY better. I'm awaiting a sequel that I feel it is very worthy of.

When I started watching the movie, I was expecting severe disappointment knowing that movies based off of video games are dangerous ground to tread on for a director. Throughout the movie I kept expecting that great disappointment, but it never came. I was happy with the movie, and the more I run it over in my mind, it gets better. On the other hand, if I hadn't known it was based off of a game, I probably would have expected something great, and then the disappointment would have really come on. This is by no means a groundbreaking, deep, or life-changing cinematic masterpiece, but it is one heck of a thrill-ride and I'll watch it again sometime.",Doom

I thought it was a standard action/zombie flick -- it wasn't until the last 15 minutes of the movie that I realized ""Oh my gosh, I think this is the Doom movie!"" Once it gave the first-person camera view and literally had the perspective picking off zombies and monsters like a classic FPS, I realized it wasn't the standard resident-evil movie, and soon recognized one of the creatures specific to Doom. Before that...it was a normal late-night zombie movie, nothing special. I was highly disappointed with the movie in that, although they attempted to give a ""scientific"" background to where the monsters came from (the monsters being genetically altered humans), why did all the monsters look THE SAME until the last few fight sequences? It was only during the FPS section that you saw a greater variety of monsters than you'd seen the entire movie - and that's not what the Doom games were like at all!

I thought the movie was quite good, descent characters, cool action, and awesome creatures the only downfall this film suffered was the title.

His performance is heart melting, and will bring tears to your eyes.The relationships between ""Duke"" and Dr. Grimm and ""Destroyer"" and the hideously mutated creature known only as ""The Baron"" (She insists her name is Linda!) show audiences through their unstable antics that it doesn't matter if you're black or white, human or hellspawn, true love conquers all - even Jupiter's lifeless, barren surface!

Adjusting the brightness, contrast, etc on my TV did not help at all. On the big screen, this movie might have been much better and much clearer, but on the small screen, it was simply awful. In addition, the poor acting, the nano-thin plot, the divergence from the story of the Doom games (1-3), and the deceit and lies apparently perpetrated by ID Software (who claimed that they were keeping tight control of the film / plot / etc), just made this movie oh so much more disappointing.

A corporation with no legal drawbacks lands on mars, excavates, finds artifacts, opens up a portal to hell, hell is released and DOOM guy fights to survive. He travels to hell to close the portal and all is well. Thats the story. Now go stick those two big thumbs up as far as you can up your bunghole. This is just another example of Hollywood ruining a good series by making a crappy movie. They think we don't want to hear a story we already know, but that is wrong. A real gamer loves to watch a movie about a game and say ""I remember that level."" or ""I loved that boss."" and so forth.

The only problem with this movie is that they completely changed the plot :(. Originally the gateway to hell was opened and demons and monsters were unleashed upon the Mars Research Facility, but the movie changes monsters from hell into genetically mutated beings. Smart change but disappointing for the Doom series fans (including myself). They also left out the artifacts such as the Soulcube, which was essential to the third game, and the ancient ruins deep within mars. The movie wasn't as scary as the game; the marines were almost never alone, it wasn't as dark and spontaneous, and the ending bugged the crap out of me (did a mutant perhaps use the elevator to escape the facility? What happens when John and Samantha leaves the facility? Is Samantha alive?). I still loved the movie but I think they could of made it a lot better.",Doom
654,briggsjazzgroup,Doom represents just that of cinema,1,25 October 2005,"A screenplay that feels incomplete at best, bad acting, bad (or no) direction is what sums up cinema's latest slap-in-the-face. The film has no patience, no intelligence, no subtlety and no respect for the audience. The attempt at a theme feels forced and is embarrassing. The POV sequence toward the end feels as though the rest of the film were put together (in a single day) just to present it. Though it has proved very effective in video games (ie Doom, Quake, Wolfenstein, etc.) here it only adds to the absurdity of the film. The major lesson of Doom is this; ignore all elements of storytelling and character development and you can retire. If you thought Resident Evil was bad, get ready to be enchanted.",Doom

I was really anticipating the ""scientists accidentally opening a portal which directly leads to hell and demons take control"" but they gave me the ""scientists genetically test people"". I was really let down by the whole thing, I mean they even got the BFG wrong, the BFG is supposed to be Bigger and be called BFG 9000, not v3.14 they also forgot the Rocket Launcher and the plasma gun.

The monsters didn't look vaguely like Doom monsters, it took all but 5 minutes for the movie to reach a one person perspective, and the plot was retarded. It was just another movie where man goes too far, pays for his mistake, and then everyone dies. Who the hell cares at this point, honestly. If they were going to ignore the entire premise of Doom, they could have at least made the plot somewhat unique. The only reason it didn't pull a one star is that there was one good action scene (Destroyer vs. alien in holding cell). Other than that, it was a travesty.",Doom

It all begins with an outbreak on Mars research facility. A squad of Marines featuring 'the Rock' is sent on a search and destroy mission. First part of the movie brings some memories from Aliens- abandoned complex, marines and unknown danger. It's all a good watch, the atmosphere is on it's place and the actors performances are decent. On the other hand fans of the game might find it unsatisfying that the movie is pretty much unrelated to the game. Some small connections like UAC, BFG, Mars, monsters and even Carmack are here but there's no hell gate being opened. The action is OK, specially the ending sequence is pretty unexpected. Overall it's a good sci-fi movie, however it would have been better to show it as a original not loose game adaption.

This is, of course, one of the reasons to not like it, but let's be honest here : By itself, this is a film that is the very definition of mediocrity.Nothing here seems to have had any effort put into it : the characters are one-dimensional, even moreso than I expected, the special effects are bland, the sets are bland and the script must've been written in a single night. People actually got paid for writing that script? Wow.There is such a thing for a film to be so bad it's good : it is enjoyable unintentionally and the sheer low quality of it makes for fun. However, the filmmakers needed to have put effort into it - they must've been convinced that they were making a good film. It's the fact that they shot for the moon and missed that makes the film enjoyable, that the dialogue falls flat but doesn't know it, that the actors are all terrified of a ragged puppet.However, if a film is half-assed, as Doom is, it isn't enjoyable.

What's the point of going to an action/sci fi/horror movie if I'm bored and don't get scared? Stay far, far away from this stinker; this movie is beyond terrible.

If you are looking for these then obviously don't watch a film with a name like 'Doom'.I only read the first page of user comments here and one struck me as requiring some sort of re-comment. For those of you looking for some sort of faithful game tie in, look somewhere else. The simple fact is that the story of Doom, particularly Doom 3, in my opinion, isn't really feasible as a film. It would have to tie in too many genres (sci-fi, action-horror and satanic rubbish) to make it work without some genius director/screen writers/special fx. It would cost too much and probably end up a mish-mash of every cliché film since Aliens came out.Instead these guys have come up with a story that ties in enough with the game (yes, including the religious aspect, there is a religious guy),doesn't plagiarise the game (therby retaining some originality) and achieves its goal of being an action-horror with its fair degree of cheese! I am a Doom game fan, I played it on the old computers many moons ago but I i like this film, its a good way of killing an hour or two, without needing to think of things. And for gods sakes, no offence Mr Rock, but you get a film out with him in it and what are you going to expect?!

Dwan the rock Johnson made this even better since we loved to watch WWF and WWE together. We especially liked the whole idea of Genetics and how it fit into the normal Doom video game monsters.

Another thing that i enjoyed is the fact that the creatures in the movie were just like in the game had some of the similarities with the monsters in the game and that makes for a realistic movie.

For the most part, this movie lives up to those expectations. It has good action sequences, it is a re-watchable movie, and the storyline isn't quite as bad as I thought it would be. Sure, they changed stuff from the video game during the transition, but it still worked, and you cant expect everything in the video game to work as a movie, they had to change some things to help the cinematic view of it.

The Rock can't act, so that's a huge problem, but when you think that might be bad, it gets even worse. I know that a big part of Doom 3 was that it spooked you almost all the time and yes it's nice to freak out a few times, but if that's all the movie is, it's a no-go. I mean really; I go to the movie with a very open mind, naturally hoping that it would be good, but what do I get? 1h 45 mins of pain is what you get. As I mentioned, The Rock can't act. All he does is shout all the time and makes his idiotic looks, monsters/demons/monkeys?!? jumping around spooking ppl and the crappiest attempt on the first person look you could possibly ever imagine.

Other comments have full descriptions of the movie so I'll go ahead in comments.It being connected to the game ""Doom"" was very poorly done. It being a standalone movie was moderate at best, but nothing ground breaking at all. The problem was not any of the other cast member's fault. The art direction superb, direction good, etc. It was the screenwriter's fault that the movie failed and as they say.. if the story fails, no amount of Hollywood magic can save it.The two main connections it had to the game was it was literally based on mars.. and.. it had a thematic connection to hell. The screenwriter made several bad choices in selecting the elements of the movie.. because we ALL have seen biological transformation movies that supposedly creates zombies and creatures from humans to induce believability. That part is done already by other movies and its first story was well told in the 70's and this story backpedals against its competition such as ""Resident Evil"".It would've made a wiser choice to impose a new set of ideas for biological transformation by bestowing supernatural properties to the story ala: ""Hell takes over."" Because the movie ""Doom"" was supposedly a horror / action franchise, the movie failed to deliver in both aspects which is very displeasing.Comment: Get better screenwriters or get the current screenwriters to ""smarten up"".Disregarding the story and critiquing the screenplay themes, however, do give a few notches up the scale. Characterizations and character are two different things. Characterization is what they appear to be and character is who they really are. The screenwriters actually did do some focus on both of these areas. The Rock's character, whom appeared to be a solid sergeant whom gives good calls, revealed himself as a madman and obscure advocate of military orders, denying his own human morality to go through with his commands.The secondary main character (can't remembered his name) also proved an interest aspect as well. A hardened, emotionally sealed soldier who obeys orders reluctantly whom appears to be a jerk, actually revealed himself to be a good person even after he admitted he has done terrible things. The one good note about the screenwriter was his marginally higher understanding of human character that even though a person has done bad.. that doesn't always make them a bad person. The deeper creed of character is their agenda under times of pressure and this selective transformation / biological enhancements aspect of DNA tampering reveals that concept.One clever aspect i noticed was the guy in the wheel chair and his biological transformation to fill in for that half robotic dog on the Doom game. It was clever connection but amplifies the horrid choices of the writer.Overall, the 10 minute first person action sequence and the final fight at the end disrupted the experience for its failure to connect. There was a lot of useless suspense that served no purpose, a lot of the sarge ordering people around, a lot of cliché human DNA tampering that provides over explained points that have been explored far too much by other people, and not enough enjoyable movie to fully give this movie a marginal 50%.It was a failure on the screenwriter's part for his lack of creative storytelling and the box office sales results proves it which yet again gives Hollywood a bad name.The Dude",Doom
678,perfectblackcascade,Needs more action,6,21 October 2005,"Personally, I liked the movie. Not saying it was good, but yes, for an action packed movie based on a video game, I liked it a lot. Veeeeery slow getting going (considering it's an action movie), and jam packed with cliché's, the last 20 minutes make up for the bad start. I believe that it could have had more violence/blood/gore/death/guns/demons (like 3x more) and not lost any audience appeal. I can understand some of the plot development, but much of it was redundant. Leave us something to wonder about! Also, what the heck was with the 'tiny' amount of demons? DooM was crazy-chalk-full with demons, and that IS what people wanted to see. But as for the FIRST DooM movie, it at least should prevent this stupid character building in the second one. Right? Second one? Please? You can't leave that as the epitome' of DooM!!!",Doom
679,sargeantjoe,You get what you want if you expect nothing,8,15 April 2006,"When first hearing of this movie in a preview at the cinema so long ago, I thought back to all the other movies made based on video games (ex. Mario Brothers, Resident Evil (1 and 2), etc.) These movies get torn apart by well-known critics simply because majority of the popular critics are fat old men who never touched a console. I myself was a great fan of the Doom series and played it on every occasion I could and on every debut of a new Doom. I did not stay up to beat really well with the story lines in the first and second Doom primarily because I was more interested in pumping those brown, furry, spiky, fire-ball chucking, bumbling, red-eye demons with shotgun rounds and taking my knuckles to those rifle-wielding bald dudes' faces. Doom 3 though, I am sure, had the storyline that was the base for the movie. I rented this movie from Blockbuster with a gift card, just showing I would not pay admission to a theater or actual dollars on renting/buying the DVD. Mainly due to the fact that I didn't expect much of anything from the Rock playing with the newly redesigned BFG. Now that ticked me off, don't mess with the weapon that drew us all to the video game in the first place. So I popped in the movie and began to watch and . . .found myself appalled at its greatness. The acting, the purity of the story, the loyalty to the originality of the series, and, my favorite, the lack of CGI. All the monsters were realistic and the fact that they were actually present, you could feel their gravity, their footsteps, their curdling roars. Parts of this movie will scare the crap out of you. Keeping track with the Hell Knights, the greenish bloody mess of an imp on the Doom 3 PC box cover, you almost find yourself chanting for the monsters to devour everyone. The only part of this movie I could have done without is the wannabe comedy from the token black guy. If they were supposed to be some elite force, how come they had a perverted Vegas white trash jerk whistling at the Mars' civilians and talking about strip searching? Please, don't try and make the movie into something its not, a movie with a soft touch. Just cover your ears every time Portman speaks, you'll thank me later. All in all, the movie sticks to the original story. It isn't a blood-fest horror flick, the film keeps an eerie Psycho mood with creatures in the dark corners and distant screams echoing the halls of the UAC plant. Not to mention, a gift to all you long time gamers; the money shot. I rated this comment a ""spoiler"", but this you just have to see for yourself. Great movie, recommended!",Doom
680,pamheath,DOOM - forget everything else - THE ROCK!,8,3 December 2005,"All the girls in the house say -- HEY!!!!!! Okay, so I'm not someone who has played DOOM, but I've seen it played. I play Warcraft, Starcraft, Diablo, Ultima Online, Everquest and World of Warcraft. I've even played Resident Evil. I think that for the genre that this was and what it was out to create, this film delivers and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Give up your pre-conceived notions of what SHOULD be going on if you were the filmmaker. You didn't make this film. That's like going to Thanksgiving dinner and critguing the turkey. Eat it, enjoy it and thank the host. Next year, you make the dressing.First, stop talking about ripping off men turned zombies ala Resident Evil. If they had done the hell demons running amok you would have complained it was a rip off of Event Horizon. Alright already. There's nothing new under the sun. I enjoyed the suspense of who was gonna bite it and the DOOM like first person shooter scene was excellent.And never mind anything else, I'm a hot blooded female and The Rock could have come out in a pink tutu reciting Shakespeare and I would have given this movie a thumbs up the man is hot! The only reason I gave it a 8 is because the plot was confusing.SPOILERS HERE OK, the biggest upset was the guy in the toilet calling for backup. What the heck was that about? I didn't understand what he was trying to do? Get more people to come and help? The placed was locked down under quarantine. Nobody was gonna come in there.Things got real complicated regarding the quarantine. People were evacuated but what was that stuff at the end? Things were happening too fast to understand what exactly was happening. Where did Sam go when Reaper passed out? Who hurt her? Was she infected? What was going on? Who cares, I'm in love with The Rock!!!!!!",Doom

What the hell happened to 3 story tall baddies with BFGs for arms? Why no pentagrams drawn in blood on the wall? Crying babies and overall creepiness? Not to mention that hell was left out all together (which seemed like an important theme in Doom to me...) This movie was not doom. It was an OK Zombie flick but I liked it better when it was called ""Resident Evil""This movie was decent but I kept thinking... ""where the hell is hell?"" It was sorely missed",Doom
682,jimmykusa,why US box office sales are declining,2,23 October 2005,"It was pretty bad. For a movie and for a movie based on a game, it was pretty bad, walk out of the theater bad. I didn't actually walk out, but stayed in hopes that the movie would pick up. It never did. It's a good movie in the sense that there are guns that are shot at monsters by cool looking marines, but that's only enough to satisfy people ages 13-16. There are pieces to the plot that seem added to the movie merely as an excuse to why things are happening the way there, not a reason. It would've been fine if the movie hadn't been pretending to be a serious movie, but it was.There were lines in the movie that poked fun at itself such as one of the marines saying ""I'm not supposed to die"", and another character saying ""there's something behind me, isn't there"", moments before attacked. These would've clever lines, if they hadn't already been turned into over-used clichés since the making appearances in movies beginning with the ""Scream"" Trilogy, and its (at the time) fresh breath of self-mockery.I really wanted to like the movie, I managed to get my girlfriend to go with me to see it, telling her ""it should be good, the game was pretty sweet"", and to my disappointment, it was a bad movie. The closest game to movie film that I can compare this too is Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, in terms of writing quality and the liberties taken by the writers with the source material.The only real remnants of the movie resembling Doom is the use of UAC, monsters that look like the demons from Doom, the BFG (which is actually only fired twice in the movie), and the fact that they are on another planet. The film was originally not even supposed to take place on Mars, and the only time you actually get the idea that they're on Mars is at the beginning when the screen says ""Mars"" at the bottom, no other reference to the planet is mentioned throughout the film.I know the movie isn't called Doom: the movie based on the game Doom 3, but for a movie that is released a year after the release of Doom 3, it would've served the creators of the film to put the game's script to use, as the game's story line is far more compelling then what has ended up on the big screen.Oh, and remember that scene where Kid takes drugs, why was that even in the film? It served absolutely no plot or character advancement. Here's what happens. The Kid is all jittery and needs to steady his nerves, so he asks another marine ""you got any"" meaning drugs, the other guy gives him the drugs (looking more like green skittles), and he takes them. About 10 minutes later, Grimm realizes that the kid is on drugs and says something along the lines of ""I can't have you being high"" and the kid looks down and ashamed of himself. End of the drug story.Horrible writing.The FPS scene was also quite laughable, seeming more like a novelty gag that you would expect from one of those 3D rides at Worlds of Fun.My point being, see the movie if all you want to see is people shooting guns at monsters (and to be honest, there isn't even really enough of that in the film), see the movie if you want to make fun of it later with your friends. See the movie if you want to support bad films like this, telling the film industry that it's okay to make bad adaptations of games, and that they can still take your money, even with bad films such as these. Don't go to the movie if you don't like wasting time, don't go to the movie if you want to send a message to the film industry to stop making crap, and start making good films. The MPAA wonders why over the past 3 years box office sales have exponentially declined, this movie is an example of why.",Doom

Which has become taken over by some genetic monsters, what follows is plenty of gun play (including the BFG!), and bloody kills, and even some scares, quite similar to Aliens.But the best part about the film has got to be the FPS part, as they managed to capture it as if you were playing the game and pull it off to keep it exciting.So if your looking for some good action, funny dialogue, monsters, scares, and some general 'coolness' then check out Doom now.",Doom

The action, yes was good at times, and there is one sequence in the movie that makes the entire movie, i won't say what, but if you are a Doom fan, you will know what i mean. Unfortunately, not even The Rock can save this movie. I'd say chalk this one up on the list of bad movies made from video games. Basically, if you thought the Super Mario Brothers movie was a good video game turned movie, maybe you will like this one. The acting wasn't that great at all, the storyline got WAY too confusing, and long story short, i didn't like the movie. I love the video game, but the movie i can definitely do without. Wait for the DVD to see this one.",Doom
686,scottfreemandavidson,Far greater than any previous game-to-film adaptation.,8,23 October 2005,"There has been a lot of argument over the quality of this movie, most of which seems to be completely unfounded.I, for one, rather enjoyed Doom and not just as a fan of the game. As an action movie, Doom seemed to hit all the right marks. Yeah. Of course character development is delayed and of course the dialog isn't quite poignant, but that doesn't mean Doom is a bad movie. It just means that the staff behind it knew exactly what they wanted and what expectations they needed to meet in order to make an exciting film.Are the characters one-dimensional? With the exception of Sarge and Reaper, I would say they are. But the characters do interact well. The relationship between Duke and Destroyer comes to mind, as does Portman, Goat, and the Kid. I feel that the actors all made good use of non-verbal cues, which perhaps had something to do with the military training they were subjected to prior to filming.While a certain element from the game's plot is not present, all of the its defining characteristics are in tact. Earth, Mars, marines, guns, monsters, and so on - this movie is definitely true to it's source material. There is a good balance of suspense and action, and the visual effects are awesome - not to mention the excellent creature effects by Stan Winston Studios.The direction was on par also. Andrzej Bartkowiak shows us only what we need to see, and that alone adds to the claustrophobic feel of this film. This reaches it's peak during the FPS sequence. And though the film editing is kind of awkward at this point, the action is exhilarating. The fight that caps it off, for example, had me screaming and cheering in the theatre.I could say a whole lot more, but simply I encourage you to give this movie a chance. If you enjoyed Alien, Predator, or the Cube series, there is no reason why you shouldn't enjoy Doom. I, personally, give it seven points out of ten because it is far greater than any previous game-to-film adaptation though not quite fine cinema.",Doom
687,Dustflyer,Doom as viewed a second time,8,13 February 2006,"With the release of the unrated version of Doom on DVD, and for me a second viewing, I'll have to say that I really like this movie! I emphasize second viewing here as the first viewing was a complete disappointment, what with the absence of Hell and many of the other things I and other lovers of the Doom games have come to expect from the movie version. On the second viewing however, I just sat down and enjoyed what the movie makers had to offer, and with an expanded 1st person part (it's now about 5 1/2 min long), some new scenes and my awareness that hell had been cut, the movie delivers some really cool fake scares (""it was a monkey... Some kind of monkey!""), some real scares (the dog who sees the Imp before Duke does) and the awesome before mentioned 1st person sequence. This, and the possibility of hell in a sequel, as the concept of good vs. evil in the effect of the chromosome thingy absolutely plays with, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! Of course, if you are a die-hard fan of the games the absence of hell is both striking and annoying upon first time viewing, but I urge you to give it a second chance as there is a genuinely spooky and enjoyable action-romp here for all who like such movies. Still, the build-up might be a bit on the long side and the final showdown a bit anti-climatic, but overall great fun for those who are fans, but not as die-hard fans as some of those present on the IMDb boards :) I really hope that this movie didn't flop so much that they do not make a sequel, because the premise is laid for a descent into Hell, which would be terrific, or Hell on Earth, which might be even better! DooM rocks! (But it really needs a Cyberdemon)",Doom
688,the_trike,Nevermind the Doomsayers,8,1 June 2006,"NO SPOILERS Forget what the decriers are moaning about -- Doom is better than that.I'd heard a lot of bad things about Doom and that it also bombed at the box office. Uh-oh, shades of the truly awful Peter Hyams flick, A Sound of Thunder. Imagine my surprise to find that I actually liked it! Holy fire imps! Yes, they changed a lot of stuff from the game, which is probably why the fanbois are foaming at the mouth. No more portals to Hell, it's not set on Mars, etc. To all that, I say, ""BFD - Big F***ing Deal."" The specific setting wasn't important. What they got right was the atmosphere and character of the game. Specifically, Doom 3, rather than Doom or Doom II. Anyone who's played all three knows there's a substantial difference in tone from the first two to the third one.Changing the problem from demon possession to genetic engineering run amok works better for the film. It gets in a little social commentary about dangerous corporate science, but they slip in enough religious talk to cover their bases.Casting The Rock as the Sarge from the game is perfect, and what they do with the character is creative. This ain't the old Sarge. There are lots of other little twists added, as well, including how they managed adding stock characters. It's a nice change to see the relationship between the Hollywood-mandated addition of the ""obligatory girl"" and the main character handled in a slightly different way than what we're used to seeing. Watching the supplementary material, I was surprised to discover that most of the actors aren't American. Coulda fooled me with their accents.The effects are groovy. Like Zathura, it's nice to see old-school practical effects and make-up in addition to CGI. As with the games, it's creepy, grossly fascinating and it has a sense of humor. The inclusion of the ""FPS sequence"" is integrated well into the story. It isn't just a gratuitous bone thrown to the gamers. It *is* that, but it also works as a plot device.",Doom

And most of it looked more like ""House of the Dead"" than ""Doom."" Still, it was a cool concept to be taken to the movie screen. I just wished they had used more of it.My Question is: How does the ""gene 24"" injection work? Some people are turned into monsters and others were turned super human. I caught that the monsters only injected the ones who would turn into monsters...but other than that I am confused.",Doom
690,wingc1959,A very good movie.,10,6 November 2005,I don't get why people hate this movie. Apparently they never played Doom. Who cares about lack of plot? Did you ever play doom? I mean really...there wasn't really a plot to speak of other than a small scroll of text every 10 levels. Basically you ran around and killed things and blew stuff up. ANd thats exactly what it delivers.....if you want to compare it to Doom 3 (which is a horrible game) from the get go don't even bother watching the movie. The plot is irrelevant. Five minutes of pure FPS action is relevant. If you liked the original games and wanta good excuse to see guys run around and blow the crap out of evil mutant demon thingies....then go see this movie.

Having not play the game, I walked into the threatre not expecting something like Resident Evil, Predator, Aliens, StarShip Troopers, and I got just that. Doom is dark and mysterious. It's one of those movies where you sit back and enjoy and do not require to think much. This movie had much more potential. There is more to the story than just running around and getting killed like Resident Evil. This movie is somewhat like Predator or Aliens, the only problem is there are many...and i say many miscasts. Unlike Predator, Doom has no real standout hero. The Rock over acts in many scenes, he raises his eyebrow which reminds me of his days in WWE. Rock isn't convincing enough to be a marine solider. The movie needs someone like (Ed Harris's presence in ""The Rock""...lol). That's how Marine commanders give orders. For John Grimm, Karl Urban was somewhat invisible. If he had died, I wouldn't care much. He has no heart and no presences. Think of that heroine in AVP and you'll get an idea of what Urban is like. His character isn't a hero, but the movie makes him a hero. The rest can be said with his team members. They aren't marines, they're Space Bounty Hunters. Each one has their own wackiness. The jokes are dumb. C+",Doom

I could say it was the best game adaptation I've seen since Mortal Kombat in 1995 - pure action, adrenaline and FUN. Sure, there are some differences from the game, but that's nothing new.I especially loved the FPP part, near the end - I just went ""Whoa! _This_ is *DOOM*!"" And the monster with the chainsaw - just like in the game... really terrific!

For example, when he wakes up from the injection and goes into FPS model, I still don't know whether to hate that because it is way too corny, or love it because it's something that fits the whole theme. The monsters were way too poorly done, they're just giant flappy dolls. The fight scene at the end of the movie between our hero and foe, what is with that? Fight is somewhat decent, but it ends way too quickly.

Rumor has it Karl Urban has agreed to a sequel??!! Say goodbye to your last chance at a decent script coming your way Karl. Some of the effects were cool and there was some good blood and gore, but no way can anyone seriously think this was worth spending money in a theater.

The fans of the games have a right to dislike the film for straying from the original concept, but that aside I thought it was a pretty solid action movie that does what it's supposed to; entertain the easily amused with explosions, bad jokes and Rosamund Pike First off, it was good to see Karl Urban in a film where he wasn't playing a complete goon (LotR and Chronicles of Roddick made him look like a prat).Secondly, I like the concept of there being a devil within us that can escape given the right catalyst (in this case, superhuman power).

696,Sacknassos,It's not bad...,7,22 October 2006,"It's a good action movie.... nothing more, nothing less. It's not THE film of the year, but it has some good action and gore scenes in it. I didn't expect too much plot and in-depth story when i started watching, but which movie based on a video game had a really intelligent story?! The cast is good. Everyone fits into his role. Especially the main character does a good job and he almost looks like the hero in Doom 3.The story is OK, nothing too thought-provoking though. Fast told, easy to understand, but it provides a good basis from which the action can be released. Sometimes it's predictable... but i don't mind. It's not the 100% original story from the game though... but you can definitely see that it's Doom.I enjoyed it.So... if you want a good sci-fi action movie with blood and gore, watch it. If you like Doom 3, watch it. If you like movies with a good plot, intelligent conversations and great feelings, watch another movie.Some Details about the movie:The facility, the corridors etc. are 100% Doom 3. The monsters and Zombies are well made and absolutely like in the game. The SFX are good standard and fit into the whole movie (I think Sci-Fi Movies must have some more computer-animated effects than other films).The Weapons: Sadly the makers didn't take the weapons from Doom 3 (except the BFG). Some Weapons (Reaper's weapon for example) are a G36 with something mounted under the grip.... I like the G36 but it would've been cool to see the original Doom 3 weapons in the movie. Whoa... and there are flashlights mounted ON the weapons!!! Clothes: The Marines don't wear the green ""armor wests"" you always pick up when playing through Doom 3.One thing makes the whole movie a few classes better. It's the ""scene"", where the camera switches to first-person-view.

They go in searching for the missing scientists first, but that mission is soon stopped, when they come to realize that there is something more that human in the facility and the scientists are part of it. After awhile the team starts getting taken out by these creatures in a matter of ways. Some blood.....and guts are both shed as they try to keep everything under control.The special effects are pretty good, but you can tell that a lot of CGI went into the making of this film. None the less you get some pretty nice kills. You ever wanted to see a guy rip his own ear off, then you can surely see it in DOOM. All in all I would say that the gore level are around average, so don't get you hopes up for a huge blood bath.Acting is OK in the film. None of it is really bad, but none it is really good either. You can't expect great acting either when one of the main characters is former wrestler The Rock. Anyways, the acting lies somewhere in the middle.I would say DOOM is definitely a movie worth looking at. The best part is when is goes into first-person mode like the game.....I think I was waiting for that part the whole time. If your thinking about seeing it this weekend or next I would have to recommend holding onto your cash, because Saw II is hitting theaters next Friday on the 28th.Synopsis: Something has gone wrong at a remote scientific research station on Mars. All research has ceased. Communication has failed. And the messages that do get through are less than comforting. It's a level 5 quarantine and the only souls allowed in or out are the Rapid Response Tactical Squad - hardened Space Marines armed to the teeth with enough firepower to neutralize the enemy... or so they think.The Good: The first-person part of the film was very fun to watch, but unfortunately you have to wait tell almost the end of the movie to catch that part. I would have to say most of the special effects were pretty good also.The Bad: The Rock....sorry....I just don't like this guys acting. There was also a bit to much CGi for my taste. The movie definitely caters more towards the ""Resident Evil"" fans.DOOM GETS A 5.5/10! The movie is worth checking out, but if your limited on cash I would recommend seeing Saw II in theaters first.

This movie uses a classic formula of having a team of special-ops type men with varying character traits. You know, a strong guy, an all-rounder, a newbie(kid) etc. Throw the guys into an impossible situation and watch em try and fight for survival. OK yes, it is another zombie type movie, but it does have a fairly satisfying twist that does set it apart from others if only fractionally. The fighting/shootfests are a little unbelievable and extreme but in a way that will cause a chuckle to escape uncontrollably from within.

699,mdgoldrush1984,It's a video game movie (minor spoilers),6,25 October 2005,"The thing to remember when seeing Doom: suspend your disbelief, and don't nitpick. I could go into things such as ""there's no Hell here"", or ""The BFG fires green bullets, not blue"", but in reality, it's one of (if not the) best video game movie I've seen. The acting's bad, there are plot points left unsolved (The Kid takes drugs, and then everyone forgets about it, Duke and Samantha may/may not have been beginning a relationship, etc.), and the plot's far-fetched.You're not going into this movie to see the next Citizen Kane. It's a movie starring the Rock. If you want a fun way to kill about an hour and a half, this is your movie. If you want to be impressed by subtle dialogue and nice camera work, it isn't (with the exception of the FPS scene...that's the best scene in the movie.)",Doom
700,outwarrior79,"Doom, A title that does not completely describe the movie.",5,25 October 2005,"Doom had great potential, however, it was amiss with some aspects. The acting was good all around except for The Rock. The Rock was not able to pull off his character well and every time he cursed it didn't seem natural. The settings of the game were perfectly reproduced in the movie which was quite an accomplishment. In the beginning of the movie, suspense builds and builds as if you were playing the game and you were walking down the corridor unknowing to what may lie ahead. The plot of the movie was no where near that of the game whereas the game speaks of hellish portals and imps with devilish powers, the movie focuses on people becoming zombies and then mutating into an imp-like creature that is just a super strong humanoid. The first person segment of the movie was very well done and is quite possibly one of the coolest filming techniques I have seen in a while not to mention it does a justice to the game. If you want to feel intense suspense and watch guns blazing and some explosions this movie may be for you. I give it a 5/10.",Doom
701,insane_treefrog,Solid gold rubbish!,10,19 November 2007,"'Doom' is absolutely fantastic.Oh, it's not fantastic in the conventional way - the acting is bland (or non-existent), the characters are two-dimensional at best, and the plot is as thin as a wet paper bag - but it'sfun. This is a film you can watch for the pure, unadulterated hell of it, a film you can laugh at, a film that is so very, very bad that it comes right round the other side of the spectrum and becomes good. Or if perhaps not /good/, at the very least highly entertaining.The basic premise is, at first glance, promising. Genetic experiments have been going on at a research facility on another planet, and something very strange is happening - monsters are rampaging around, and a group of marines are sent along to sort everything out. But then other things are added, things which add up as generally second-rate - a beautiful scientist, a man who seems surly on the outside but is a fluffy bunny when you get past that, a man with a tortured pastcliché after cliché is introduced into the storyline, and about twenty minutes in you become sinkingly aware that this is not going to be a good film.As it goes on, the movie becomes more and more unintentionally hilarious. The marines, for instance, are all great - there's the new kid, the perv, the cheerful black guy, the sullen black guy, the token Asian (the coolest of the lot), the handsome one, the fanatically religious one, and the strong, silent leader who isn't as nice as he appears to be. I became quite excited when I saw that the excellent Dexter Fletcher was making an appearance, but his atrocious American accent destroyed all my hopes that there would be one good performance.Things are resolutely never explained. It was my good fortune that I was watching it with two people who had played the game, so that they could explain things to me. But that all added to the wonderfully bemusing experience of watching this film. The highlight for me was the Christian zombie (if you watch it, you'll know what I mean), who had us in fits of giggles.I suppose I should mention the thing which is most talked about - the sequence in which the camera follows the action as if the viewer is playing the game. Wellit's not half as good as it's made out to be, trust me. It's just like watching someone else play the game, but with better graphics. Boring, in my opinion.No, this could under no circumstances be called a good film. But at the same time it is brilliant, and a joy to watch - just pretend that you're watching a spoof film along the lines of 'Airplane!' and everything will seem a whole lot better. You can laugh at the truly abysmal dialogue, the dreadful acting, and the mysterious lack of decent plot.In the words of Douglas Adams: ten out of ten for style, minus several million for good thinking",Doom

This movie really captured everything that was great about the game, I was worried that them not being hell-spawns would detract from the experience but it did not at all. The set designers did a wonderful job of recreating the UAC facility from the game. After this movie I am going to want to see the first person view in every movie that I see, it was just so perfectly implemented that it alone is worth the price of admission.

I never jump in movies and I did. I predicted what was going to happen and I was wrong. The last movie to somewhat do justice was Resident Evil and this followed suit. I'm an action flick junkie and this was the first movie this year that I went back to see a second time. The plot followed the video game and added some extras. I'm very critical of movies and I loved to be surprised. I loved the blend of actors from all walks of life working toward one common goal. Don't see that much in movies.

705,vission-enterprises,I'm glad I got my money back.,1,2 November 2005,"OK, this is my first review for a movie on IMDb.com, not that I dislike reviewing movies. I just don't ever have the time to write one but in the case of this movie, I felt compelled.First off, I consider myself a pretty big fan of the Doom PC series. I've played them all from the original, to II, to the Ultimate Doom and so forth, up to the recent Doom III, which was somewhat of a letdown in ways but nowhere near that of Doom: The Movie. I'm sad to say that because I was in high hopes of the movie, regardless of post discussion and people criticizing that The Rock was in it and not to mention previous video game to movie disasters, *Cough Tomb Raider, Resident Evil Cough*.My review from what I can remember (It's been a week or so & I've tried to forget).I went with a friend, 10:30PM (weekday). My friend already had low expectations but I tried to lift his spirits with encouragement that the movie would be good. The movie began, outer planet shots, then some scientists, something crazy happens, they all start screaming and running. Out of nowhere Rock music begins to play, not in unison with the scenes or anything. Guy locks the door before some other scientist can get in and her hand gets plopped off. Then off to title or whatever. I felt like after that scene, it was going to be some people filming a movie about the game, inside the movie. If you understand what I mean. I say this because the opening felt cheesy. At any rate, my friend wanted to leave but I encouraged him to stay more. We're only like 15mins into the movie at this point.Movie continues, Rock is introduced (YAY! No, not really) His performance is nothing special in this movie. I recall him blabbing about how his character would be so tough, tough as cotton candy. His acting was just bland and not believable. Maybe it was the script he had to work with but for some reason I doubt it. Supporting cast was about as good as the The Rock. Most of the movie is them walking around these endless hallways of what appears to be a labyrinth. I found only 2 monsters to my recollection in the entire movie and I didn't see the second one because I walked out 15mins before the movie ended (literally, 15min). Which I'll bet all the money I spent and got back that the best parts of the movie were in that last 15mins but I simply didn't want to pay to see them.The worst points I can recall of the movie were, one scene the marine's tac-light on his weapon just happens to go out ... similar to horror flicks when the person's flashlight goes out but the way it went in this movie was just dumb, no-one else had a problem with their tac-light(s), just him and some may say, oh it was the evil forces messing up his tac-light but whatever, seems like the rest of the marines used Energizer batteries and homeboy used the great value brand. Another scene, the marine falls into some pit, they said it was a holding cell or something, and then the 1 of 2 monsters goes after him, and he attempts to fire his gun at the monster and it what appears to JAM. His gun jams?!?!?! The marine has fired 0 shots since the beginning of when they appeared, so it isn't as though he ran out of ammo. So his gun JAMS and he is forced to then attempt to shoot it with his pistol before he is thrown, as I recall, then gets up and uses this 15ft or so cable that is connected to your average looking computer monitor, and continues to swing and beat this monster with it before of course getting killed. RIDICULOUS. WE HAVE FIREARMS THAT DON'T JAM. He is a marine, in the future with SPACESHIPS and his rifle JAMS. Whatever. They also cock their guns and say they are going in hot and loaded or whatever like 10x. I guess they felt the need to announce that each time to get the full effect. The FPS scenes I saw were so-so, nothing special, I did get the feeling at a point I was in the video-game, but then other times with all the first person turning around corners, I got a bit dizzy (might just be me). I more than likely missed the real FPS scenes that were in the last 15mins, probably. I missed the storyline, if there was one BESIDES the fact there was no communication to the scientists and blah blah blah. I never really saw real characteristics of the game besides the BFG, which appeared to be a footprint in the movie. Oh, I forgot to mention, cheesy rock music did begin to play out of nowhere in action sequences, etc.In the end, Doom was crap. I'm glad I got my money back for the hour+ I wasted. Rent it if you really feel the need to. I hope this review was helpful, I tried to cover everything I could remember and wanted to. My apologies for any bad grammar, spellings, etc. In bit of a rush.",Doom
706,majinjekku,Great Movie Until,3,24 October 2005,"I went to see this movie... thinking it looked kind of good from seeing the trailer. But, I also kept in mind that this was just another video game turned into a movie. So, I went in sort expecting it to be bad but I had some hope for it.During the movie, there are some great and intense sequences. The movie really pulled me in. But, there were scenes in the movie that started off really intense but then judging by the music... you would think it was going to turn into some sort of music video. They sort of took the that intense feeling the movie was initially giving to you.The special effects were well done and you really believed that the monsters were there... The acting was great for the type of movie it was. It wasn't great but it wasn't bad. The characters were cliché and that was to be expected.However, the movie took a nose dive and crashed and burned. It happens as soon as the hero is injected with C24 and he becomes super human. And, he wakes up after being ""dead"" for awhile because of the C24 drug and the audience is seeing through his eyes, creating that first person shooter (FPS) feel. But, he looks at himself in the mirror and this cheesy guitar riff plays because he's ready to slaughter some mutants now.And, I really lost interest in the movie. Then this FPS sequence starts... with a gun and he starts slaughtering all these monsters with the gun that hardly took care of them earlier in the movie. I don't know what the writers or whoever were thinking. But, I was throughly disgusted with the movie when this happened. They pulled me in and just shoved me out and made it really corny and really just... not believable anymore.And, the ending of the movie is pretty lame. I dunno. It first reminded me of ""Aliens"" but then it just became terrible and corny and it just went from one type of movie that was good to a terrible-terrible movie.You are better off watching the movie until he gets injected with C24. Then, get up and leave and assume he died and make up your own ending with the remaining characters. You'll like the movie a lot more. I promise.",Doom
707,bfg9001,Quite Good,8,26 October 2005,"I really enjoyed this movie; it was a fun action flick. Sure, there was no hell, but I thought it faithful enough. The sets looked awesome, the monsters looked like the ones in the game (Doom 3,) and they had the BFG, but it could've been used more often. Another great thing about it was the action was constant and never let down. Plus, the blood and violence was just fantastic! The end also has a really cool twist. The acting, on the other hand, was just par; nothing spectacular, nothing overly-crappy; it was just average. Also, if you think about it, hell is in there metaphorically...

Saying things along the lines of nothing new and slow action and things like that.While there may be nothing new in this movie other than it is the long awaited doom-movie I do believe that there is a lot of great content in it. I love action movies and this one certainly did not disappoint me in the least. For my tastes there was plenty of action from start to finish. The movie plays out in the same confined areas as the game it makes for suspense more than heavy action which I believe is in the spirit of the game and I find that excellent. The dialogue is great in this movies. Humorous and very ""Butch"". I love it. There are lots of references to the game. Not only in the environment but also in what transpires in the movie and I personally find it excellent that you can actually sit in the theatre and say; ""Hey.. I know that feeling"" or ""I have been there too"". :-) SPOILER:::: At the time the Reaper wakes up after having been injected with Chromosome 24 I just went ballistic in the theatre. You wake up looking out of his eyes just as you would do in the game and the following action sequence where you have the in-eye view that you are used to from the game is downright fantastic and a very bold move by the movie-makers that I think they pulled off really well. More of that PLEAAAASSE! All in all the best game to movie conversion yet and if you like the game and atmosphere therein you should NOT miss out on this movie. Prepare to be entertained.",Doom

I heard that id was heavily involved into the making of the movie and that why i find it really weird that they altered the story to be so much different than the game, I miss all the demons and the hell spawns. Most of the weapons used in the game aren't featured in the movie and the bfg fires only twice.The only fun part was the real fps in the end, and as far as i'm concerned the whole movie could've been like that i would've liked it more. Let me get this straight, I wasn't expecting something deep and meaningful, i was expecting shoot em all let god sort em out sort of action, but not as cheesy as this. If i knew what the movie should've looked like, i would've made it myself and earned a lot of money, but I'm sure of one thing, it wasn't supposed to be like this.

The psychological and physical struggle between The Rock and Urban is well told throughout the movie, thus the climax is their final fight.

711,pbucko,Boring,1,29 October 2005,I remember while watching this movie I wish it would just hurry up and finish. I went into this movie with not very high hopes for it mainly because I knew they changed one of the major story points from the game. I thought at least it would have some cool monsters from the game since I read they had kept mainly to the same designs. But I found them to be quite boring except for maybe the pinky demon which only showed up shortly. This was mainly because they were lacking in variety maybe if they kept to the original story they could have had some cooler monsters like from the game. They could have at least had one of the babies turn into one of those creepy baby monster things like in the game.,Doom
712,res18rwa,OK if you forget it's DooM,6,23 October 2005,"Okay this movie was a good movie... if you forget that it is supposed to be based on DooM3. There was almost no tie-in to the game except for the BFG and the character of Sarge (who, like in the game, not only has the BFG but goes evil {btw Sarge is not the main character in the game, he is one of the guys who gets off the ship before you at the start with the briefcase containing the BFG.}) The action scenes were pretty good. I think the FPS could have been spaced out instead of one long scene.Bottom line I don't think it should have been billed as DooM. It was almost as if the script was written with a different title, but the name DooM was added strictly for publicity. Sure it had HellKnights, Pinky, lots of zombies (albeit weaponless) and I guess Imps (tho no fireballs.) Still was lacking some of the more terrifying creatures like Revenants, Cacodemons, Lost Souls, and of course the CyberDemon. I think it was because they couldn't explain those away as genetic mutations (I guess they couldn't keep the R rating if it involved Hell.) While the creatures are far from true to the game, the locales are pretty accurate. They have an advanced weapons lab, living quarters, archaeological dig site, and science lab, as well as a teleportation room. Some scenes pay homage to the game as well. Three that I can think of are some hand to hand combat with a HellKnight - and in the FPS scene Grimm comes around the corner, pops enemy in the head, then shoots a flammable barrel next to it and fries it - and of course the chainsaw scene against Pinky.Good action movie, but don't expect to see too many familiar creatures.I just have to say that my favorite scene was when the Marine was in the holding cell with the chains hanging down and he went toe to toe with HellKnight and beat the sh*t out of it in hand-to-hand for a while. That was probably the coolest scene. He lasted a lot longer than I would have suspected given the rest of the scenes involving the hellknight.",Doom
713,paulcoulter980,how would YOU have made doom?,8,6 December 2005,"So this movie wasn't faithful to doom the video game? Okay maybe the element of ""HELL"" being the cause of all the nasty goings on wasn't there but was else was missing? What other doom goodies were missed out? Not many because what you all seem to be getting confused by is the fact that doom the game was about as two dimensional as they come. Walk down corridor, kill monster. Thats it!!!! What Oscar nominated master piece were you all exactly expecting? Doom was designed as a fun escapist game, nothing deep and meaningful. All i seem to read on here is how doom was a bad movie and it was nothing like the game and BLAH BLAH BLAH! So doom wasn't a carbon copy of the original game, but it was based on doom 3. Although I haven't actually played doom 3 in depth I can see where the film makers got there inspirations. I played the original Dooms for hours at a time and loved em to death, still do. If Doom the movie was just as all the haters would of wanted it, it would of really SUCKED! So you wanted giant orange blobs with eyes that shoot fire balls and bulldog looking demons all from hell while a single man wearing green spandex fights them all off all alone without an ounce of dialogue? Good idea! Not everyone who goes to see doom will be fans of the game so it needs to be accessible to all. I hear complaints that the zombies in the movie were just lame attempts to jump on the ""dawn of the dead"" band waggon. In the first doom who shoots at you with the shotguns? ZOMBIE SOLDIERS! I stand by my vote that doom was a fun, exciting movie. It did exactly what it set out to do. ENTERTAIN! the reason cinema was first invented. If you hate doom, fine, each to their own. But if you want to be entertained DOOM is worth a try. Doom may have its moments of cheese, but it's fun! Go and see doom and judge for yourselves. YOU'LL LOVE IT!",Doom
714,DoYaSeeMe,"Bad, bad...pretty bad. (with spoilers)",1,18 December 2005,"Big disappointment for me, even the FPS. First: let me speak about my experience as a gamer: I played DooM 1, 2, 3 , quake, and many other FPS . Doom 3 was one of the best because of the creeps that it gave me when playing at 3 a.m. I played it on the hardest level, and did it violently, my mouse crashed,i even got headaches from the brutal fast-paced action that this game brought to my eyes and ears at high frame rate and surround sound. Well, back to the movie now. what is this? where is the story of doom 3? this adaptation was awful, plot was lame, and we get man 2 man combat in the end? I read some comments a few minutes ago, some guys liked it because it's action just like in the game. Well, not at all. 2 shots from the BFG, the rest is machine guns, only 3-4 types of monsters that are only able to do close combat. No weapon fills the gap between lousy guns and BFG. Where are the troops from mars, there was no soldier there, but they had many secrets to hide, and especially military stuff like the bfg. The nano wall sucked, it was a useless technology. The base didn't look too good, the game had far better looking interiors. Also, i didn't get the thing with the main character being injected with C24. Did that turn him into a bad ass gamer? if so, how come that the other civilization didn't have such bad ass heroes? at least the game played a lot better with these facts. This base had no machines running, when the game had many, and they were making strange sounds and lights, amplifying the fear factor. I could go on and on, but i am tired and disappointed by the movie. I'd put id software to create their own movie, using their game engine, the experience of some nightmare level gamers, and the opinion of more other doom game fans. I am sure that movie would beat this one by far.",Doom

My only gripe were some of the enemies in the movie weren't as true to the games, but they were cool, none the less. The acting wasn't great, but it did its job. Awesome movie PACKED with action and moves at a very nice pace. I wish the characters had some more development, but that's not what DOOM is really about anyway. The editing and special effects department deserve a round of applause for a job well done. I'm not sure if John Carmack and co. - The original creators of the DOOM games, were involved with the production of the movie, but they were paid homage to, which I thought was really neat.

All I was hoping for was a mildly amusing action movie with some cheesy one-liners, over-the-top special effects, and lots of blood-and-gore. Doom didn't even live up to those expectations. The first half of the movie is so badly acted and so slowly paced that I actually had to be woken up by my friend because I had fallen asleep. I'm glad he woke me up because I was looking forward to the first-person POV sequence that this movie has been hyped up on. Even that was sadly disappointing at this point. I'm sorry, but the LEAST this movie could of done was have some fun with its cheese. Take Army of Darkness for example. That was a movie that was hilarious and fun because it was purposefully bad. This movie is simply bad. Horrible script, horrible homage to the game (the BFG is barely used despite the scenes that glorify its entrance), horrible acting, horrible editing, horrible, horrible, horrible... The only reason I gave it a three was because of one line The Rock says... I won't say what it is but those of you that have seen it will know what I'm talking about.

Get a grip guys, just because you can say how bad the acting was, doesn't make you look cleaver.Anyway, on topic, I loved this movie, especially the first person view. Unless you are a game who does like all of doom's releases then there is no point in watching this movie. It's as if you are translating a joke word by word, it's not going to be funny because a Brit will not understand the punchline that the French will.Same here, you have to watch the movie from another perspective, not the one where you sit down and judge a movie, trying to notice every single goof the actor did.

I still feel they could have utilized at least a couple of minutes after the final scene to at least leave the door open for a sequel or leave some questions unanswered. I thought all the main guys meshed well together, and The Rick was very good in his role as Sarge. I also was very impressed with Urban's acting in the movie, he is a very talented actor and fit into the John Grimm role pretty well. All in all, I would definitely give this movie at least 9 out of 10, but as so many people have come on here and given it bad reviews and bad ratings, I thought I would give it a 10. I have seen A LOT worse, especially what some people consider good film, but when you look at this movie it was never meant to be a Hollywood Masterpiece - it was based on a violent video game about mutants and monsters, some people just don't see that.

The basic story is that a lab facility on Mars has had something terrible happen so a special Marine force is sent there to clean it up and save the facility.

I've seen better graphics in Arcade games . Also the movie doesn't really have an ending you just see them in the elevator and thats it . Iam a fan of the game and this movie could have been a lot better i think. for example they could of made first person scene better .

I have grown up playing the ""DOOM"" franchise, and it has become one of my favorite video games of all time.I found that I had no emotional attachment to any of the characters in the entire film. They were not only forgettable, they also lacked any redeeming personality traits that could have made them the least bit interesting. Even the main character of the film, with an ""emotional backstory"", was just another generic soldier. The film is riddled with terrible puns, awful use of CGI, the worst first-person segment used in any form of media and appalling practical effects .",Doom
723,fargerich,Could have been worst,3,1 April 2006,"Okay, lets see... where do I start... First of all the movie concepts are great, every art detail was taken directly from Doom 3, which is really something these days. I loved th way the movie looked, the sets are beautifully decorated, creatures look amazing (the best part is that CG's hardly been used) and there are lots of details that any game fan will recognize. In the other hand, we have awful acting, bad actors, an awful FPS scene and a story that has NOTHING to do with the games... I don't want to analyze why the producers went with the genetic mutation sh*t and not with the original hell breaking loose history. Couldn't they find something better?? I mean, come on, the genetic experiments story has been used thousand of times, and it gets worse every time they recycle it.. I don't understand why no one at ID said something about the script. Another disgusting thing about the movie was the ending. What's that Sarge vs ""good Guy"" (can't remember the name of the character) hand to hand fight??? DOOM WAS NEVER ABOUT BARE HANDS COMBAT, AND WAT TO SAY ABOUT THE MATRIX JUMPS. I know that there had to be a way to end the movie including killing the bad guy, rescue the girl and save the earth, buy they could have come up with something better than that... This is not a movie for everyone, the game fans will enjoy it as much as any science fiction lover (sorry it doesn't fit into my horror definition) but thats it. Anyone else will probably hate it, so if you have never played any of the games before and you are looking for a movie to scare the Sh*t out of you go look somewhere else.. this is not your movie..PS: WHY DO Id Software ALLOWED THEM TO ATTACH FLASHLIGHTS TO THE GUNS!",Doom
724,rickkemp,Doomtastic Mindlessness,10,5 December 2005,"Good grief. Does what it says on the tin. A no-nonsense, straightforward blood and gore fest with some nice scares and good pacing. Acting & script a bit on the cheesy side - which actually fits nicely with the overall premise of the flick, y'know: adapted from a video game, Mars, marines, unfeasibly extreme weaponry, motherf*****g monsters etc. The first-person stuff is a complete blast and a great homage to the source material - I tittered my way through the entire sequence, much to the annoyance of an OAP sat next to me.If you want thoughtful story, highbrow script & characters to really care about try Uwe Boll's 'Alone in the Dark'. Otherwise unchain your brain, grab the nachos and prepare to make like a drooling idiot for an hour and forty.

Man was I wrong. Hollyweird I hope you read this, you need slapped across your face and get a grip on non reality, it takes a imagination to write you know. Which seems to be a problem these days with all the multiple remakes of old movies. Doom 3 gave you most of the story, other elements of the prior games might have given you some thing to work with.The game was about hell unleashed, not a freakin chromazon. Zombies turning into monsters is seriously off base, getting possed is a definite possibility.Not to mention the director and the writer both with great track records but, did they play the damn game? I don't think so.This fell into B movie class with big budget effects used sparingly. The Rock should have run in the other direction when he saw the script. I apologize for this caustic review but I'm am so sick of these lame offerings Holly weird is pumping out. Its as bad as my writing skills!Like any of the other Scifi based type movies based on games, they seem to lack substance, it leaves you with the feeling that some thing was missing. Kinda like pretend food, you can eat all you want but you will never get full.Not to mention where in the heck were all the creatures. I can count them on one hand. Not to mention elements from doom 3 should have been included.

I never thought I would see a movie worse than Resident Evil when it came to defiling a video game. Let me list the things that this movie had in common with the game. (At least with Doom 3)Mars, UAC, BFG, a character named SargeShort list huh? That because this movie is garbage. The one thing I can say that was pretty sweet about it was the scene that was shot completely in first person. It's just too bad that it had to be wasted on this atrocity. I didn't expect it to be good, but I also didn't expect it to rape the Doom franchise so ferociously. If I could give it a lower rating I would.",Doom
729,LegendaryStranger,"Great for the fans, mediocre horror sci-fi for the rest.",7,20 October 2005,"For the fans of Doom games out there, it's just about everything you wanted. The big guns, intense atmosphere, repulsive monsters, the works.The movie takes place in the Olduvai research facility on the planet Mars. True to Doom 3, something seems to have gone deathly wrong with the experiments being conducted, whereby all Hell is about to break loose.Sarge (Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson) and his group of mercenaries are sent in to make sure nothing escapes the compound, and to send the creatures back to where they belong; Hell.Having said this, don't expect a dazzling plot, as there are definitely some plots holes through the movie. Nothing that would ruin the experience overall though, especially not for the fans of the Doom games.The cinematography is top notch, camera work makes the entire experience very intense. The music also really adds to the overall atmosphere, not to mention the terrifying sounds echoing through the facility. Near the end of the movie it it seems to die down a bit, almost getting so repetitive to the point of being tiresome, at which point it only makes the coming part that much more satisfying.In conclusion, Doom fans will get their fill with this game to film adaption, possibly the best yet. Everyone else interested in this movie, expect a so-so horror sci-fi, though better than the last few movies of this genre you've had to sit through (Aliens vs Predator for example, though it's hard to call that a horror in comparison).",Doom
730,petrow14,Disappointing,1,22 October 2005,"MINOR SPOILERS -I would just like to say I'm a huge doom fan and have been playing it since i was about 3. So when i heard about this movie coming out so i was so excited to see it. Yesterday night(opening night) i went to go see it, i was so horribly disappointed. I had read the reviews on it, on how it was bad, but i ignored the critics cause they don't know what their talking about. But this time was the only time that i agreed one hundred percent. My cities paper gave it zero out of four stars because of its nonexistent plot and the horrendous one liners. When i saw it the people in the theater were literally laughing. One of the men in the squad randomly says,and i quote, ""I gotta take a dump"". It was so random and sounded stupid. All these lines totally ruin the movie. Whoever wrote the script had to be some loser who didn't know what he was doing. And for all you people who are wondering about the guns and monsters from the game. The only guns from the game is the BFG and the chain-gun. I was waiting for some serious enemy to come up in the movie but all that was there was zombies,imps and one pinky. The zombies which were humorous, not that how they looked but what they did. One zombie repeatedly smashes his head into a glass window until he dies. Who wondered how the imps looked, they were alright, better than i would have thought. A man in a wheelchair named ""pinky"" was humorous, who later turned to the pinky demon. You see this guy in this futuristic wheelchair that looks ridiculous and then tops it off with his goofy voice ""Hi, I'm pinky"". Everyone in the theater laughed. I consider myself a huge fan of doom and i still thought it was horrible. A majority of it was sheer disappointment from the high hopes i had.",Doom

Yes they could have gone in a completely different direction and included the whole bizz on hell, when in fact the first game actually mentions experimentation. The way that they did incorporate references to heaven and hell i think was a much more intelligent idea, even though this movie isn't a very intelligent one. The first hour and a half is like watching Aliens.. but guess what.. thats whats good about it. It may be contrived but it was still fun.. at least they didn't follow the style of a really bad movie. Also this movie captures the feel of the game.. what it was like going through all those corridors not knowing what to expect. They didn't include hell.. so what.. stop whining, at least they tried to give the fans a film. This movie has been in production hell, so probably the only way they could get the movie financed was by changing the hell factor so it was for a more general audience.(i don't know really why and i don't care) The movie is fun.. i was glad they made it.. i plan on buying it when it comes out.

On Mars, there's this facility that's like a weapons development/ bio-lab/archaeological dig all in one. Why you would want to put a weapons development facility in the middle of an archaeological dig site is beyond me, but hey. There's these screwed up creatures, no not from hell like the video game, they have too much DNA or something making them uber-powerful and uber-ugly. Oh and its a virus, so you can get it too. So basically something happens and these creatures take over the facility. Enter some tough marine mofos lead by the Rock. His first order is for them to split up in small easily destroyable groups... so they do, a bunch of them die, some get infected, the Rock turns out to be evil for no damn reason, and at the end the place blows up. Oh did I mention the virus only turns you into a monster if you're not like true of heart or something? I forget exactly.. probably because I was half way out the door at this point.Purely horrid film-making.

There was hardly enough action, most of the film contained action-like scenes of searching for bad guys, but not really finding them, or seeing them in the distance and shooting at them, not hitting anything. As usual, the Rock was good, and the first-person sequence was pretty sweet, but once again, they shouldn't have limited it to one scene.

It genuinely felt like I was watching someone else play a video game, and that was the feeling I was hoping for going into the movie.The marines, acted like marines should...human. Mistakes were made, and only a select few were of the ""only-in-a-movie-never-would-happen-in-real-life"" type mistakes.

The game is great for that very reason: your a Marine fighting Hell. The movie took out one of the most important aspects of Doom. And would it have killed them to add an imp or hell knight throwing a fireball. Or if they couldn't have the cyberdemon in this one, maybe have the revenent, or a couple of lost souls, or that big, fat, fire-throwing blob dude that always pisses me off in the game.

738,Squeet911,"Doom is a ""Fun Movie""",8,24 October 2005,"For the most part, I liked doom. But to enjoy this movie, people have to realize a few things. First, the movie is not going to have a lot of plot. Two, it is a video game based movie, and three, it contains lots of killing. If you just sit back and relax and enjoy the movie instead of picking out everything that is wrong with it, then it will be a fun escaper from reality, otherwise, you will hate it. It is hard to make a video game adaption that everyone will like.This is for all of you Doom fans. Don't talk about Hell and genetics, and which one is the driving factor of doom. There are four books written around the games, and I have read them (and played all the games). There is a mix of both genetics and Hell in the books. As the books progress, the two become incoherently entangled and inseparable. So, in the making of Doom, the director tried to mix both in and still have a decent movie. A taste of the books, the main character ""Fly,"" is sent to another dimension where the demons are genetically engineered to humans' greatest fear-demons, so I have no idea whether it was another dimension/Hell thing. I don't know. Anyway, Hell was represented in the demons form from ""evil"" people after they die implying that there is such a place called ""Hell."" Then the director incorporated the soul with genetics to create his own views on things as an interesting twist. Remember, a game can't be a strait port to the big screen, because it would be uninteresting and bland. (and it would be pretty hard to fit 10 hours of game play into 2 hrs.)",Doom

I have to say the direction of the movie was played very well. There was an opening for a Doom 2........ The rock really did a good job with his role and so did Karl. Nothing was over-done, really cheesy or didn't make sense. For an overall rating i gave it a 9 because It really wasn't the Best movie out there, but it had something to say.

Storywise it had nothing to do with the game except the fact that they were on Mars and the weapons were the same as in the game. The Rock was trying too hard to be the cool action hero by overemphasizing the F word whenever it spewed from his constantly slimming body. There were some cheesy one liners that I hate(I found myself laughing aloud at the stupidity while the rest of the theater was quiet) and in general the cinematography was garbage. It doesn't take a pro to point the camera at someones face and only their face and record some cheesy dialog.The music was terrible and .... whatever.If you loved Resident Evil: Apocalypse you'll enjoy this molded turd of a movie.Someone please help the Rock pick a good script.,Doom
741,cuelos-1,You have probably seen this movie 3 times already if not more..,3,22 October 2005,"First time you have seen this movie it was called Aliens. A group of workers is exposed to something and the marines are sent in to investigate. You will note that a great deal of the set is the same close quartered Closter phobic darkness that had you leaning in your seat to try and see a bit more around the corners. Some of the scenes are roughly the same: Look for the Duke and Hudson similarities. The majority the monsters come from the people the marines were sent there to save. I think you will agree that Aliens is the better of the films, and much more original.The second time you saw this movie was in Resident Evil I and II, but mostly I. Hey some scientists in a huge underground lab have just contaminated themselves with something deadly that turns them into horrible monsters. ""Hey, send in a team of Marine-like guys to investigate!"" ""Okay."" Some of the Umbrella's people came back as zombie like creatures and others mutated to a bit of spice. Doom with a twist on the same idea brought back people as semi demons but mostly just zombies, and a few people who really mutated into something cool. But you have seen it before, and Mila is much nicer on the eyes than the Rock.The 3rd time was probably Dawn of the Dead, Land of the Dead. Need I say more? I would not recommend this film as a full admission flick. I would say it is a worthy renter and maybe a Dollar theater ticket.Some things I did like about the movie. The First Person segment did rock the socks; they should have used it more in the film. If you are a fan of the Rock, and how could you not be, I thought he did a good job as the Sarge. The best part about the film is the Female lead, and thank god she did not have to be a love interest but just a character in the story.

I have grown used to the fact that they are separate art forms.That said, Doom the movie pays huge homage to ID Software and the game. I can't see how anyone can deny this, especially when compared to some other game-to-movie transformations. There is the weapons arsenal, the atmosphere, the environments (which are basically spot on), the flash-lights, the first-person scene, Pinky, Carmack, yes even the story to some extend. But the fanatics will always find some pet peeve, because their hearts are with the game and nothing can touch it.We see this with every media to different media conversion.As a movie by itself, it is an okay action flick.

I enjoy a bad movie. The movie is so hollow and poor that it is hilarious. The soundtrack is the best part. Every time one of the cheesy songs revved up the whole theater went into a uproar of laughter. That is just the soundtrack. Everyone's performance (except Karl Urban) is laughable. Generally most of the interaction between the characters caused laughter. Karl Urban is quickly becoming the unsung hero of action movies, very close to a Micheal Biehn of the 80's. The effects are close to standard. I would say that the movie has good visual appeal. One thing that I noticed is there are a couple of moments that one can definitely see a shot on DV where most of the film is on film. Also The first person scene caused an uproar of laughter, it was silly. If you can take this movie lightly and are ready to laugh I would definitely recommend it.",Doom

What I don't understand is why the so-called fans have been too uptight when it came to the plot. I thought the movie had a very decent one; granted, there were some inconsistencies but it makes for good discussion. Which my friends and I find kinda funny, because, hey, this is Doom - it's an action movie. The original Doom game wasn't really centered on the plot, so why clamor for it? It was nice that they made a fascinating story, at least for me. I like how the 24th chromosome thing was added - it makes sense and it's easy to grasp for the audience. The Doomguy *had* to be superhuman. I'd be more disappointed if Doom was a game that also had a great back story from the start (ex. Resident Evil). Action games were never big on plot; let the movies build on that. That's why I think we should give these new stories a chance. At least they still put in references from the game, and that's what I like most about video game-turned-movies. Spotting references is always fun; it makes the geek in me very happy.Oh yeah, some more things I liked:1. The twist. That's why Sarge's ""I'm not supposed to be die!"" line sent me cracking up. 2. The lines. I actually thought they were cool. 3. Most of all, the false alarms. You thought he was gonna die already, didn't you?A sequel would be fine by me.

The script was horrible, the acting was wooden, and most of the ""in jokes"" added nothing of value to it. My biggest complaint was the lack of hell. Sure the characters talk about demons and it being hell (on earth), but it is just an unethical science experiment gone awry. Can you say Resident Evil in space? Why remove the whole premise of the game? This was a niche movie, catering to the religious right by changing the premise seems to me to only alienate the fan base.

It's really a no different action movie from all nowadays. Effects are nice, dialog is OK, there are some refreshing lines (especially these of Portman), there is some blood and gore.What surprised me most is that they did make it really bound to the game. And not in the story, but in the screenplay. If you're not a gamer, and if you didn't played Doom, some lines (especially those of Sarge), weapons (the BIG one), and the scene when Reaper wakes up won't have the same meaning to you as if when you have played it - more, they can seem meaningless, unnecessary or boring; or they can give you a push to try the game. I liked these - especially the 3D scene was very dynamic and well made. The only thing that nerved me was that after one such dynamic scene they've put a long, hide-and-seek fight, which didn't need to be that long.The movie is OK, i really enjoyed it, i would watch it again with pleasure, but only in cinema - to enjoy it fully at home you'll have to have a good home-cinema-system.

It's not really that the movie is bad; it's that the title, ""DOOM,"" is misleading. I went to the movie hyped about seeing a movie version of a great game but was very disappointed when there were only a couple hints at the game. I would recommend that fans of the game NOT see this movie because it is a waste of time; although, I know any fan of the game will still see it for himself despite my warning.",Doom
749,spam-901,A rubbish cash-in on the Doom name,1,4 December 2005,"This movie should have been the ""Aliens"" of the 21st century. The Phobos base should have appeared dank and deserted, save the occasional body. The atmosphere should have built to an unbearable, silent tension. Then, and only then, the hideous creatures from hell should have started climbing out of walls and from under floors, and devouring the marines.But instead, the set of the base was boring (the film looked like it was shot in a single corridor). The atmosphere wasn't scary enough. The monsters were, frankly, pathetic. A guy in a rubber alien suit covered in KY jelly to make him look slimy may have worked 30 years ago, but not now. Where were the horrific bio-mechanical perversions of nature that characterised doom? (i.e. Spider Demon). Where was the demonic imagery? The torsos hanging from spikes in the ceiling? The five pointed stars painted on the floor in blood?The plot had nothing to do with the original games. The whole ""24th chromosome"" thing was actually less believable than a portal to hell, and undermined the tension when you found out that the creatures were actually human (once).There was no point to the film. No objective. Just people walking round corridors with guns. That may make a good game, but a film needs more than that. Even in Doom 3 (the game) there is a series of objectives, i.e. crossing the base to get to the transmitter and call for help. That's what this game needed - an objective for the marines to accomplish other than killing things. Without this, the film rambles on and the dialogue is superfluous, with no influence on the storyline whatsoever.I wonder if the producers of this film have actually every played Doom. The film did a fantastic job of incorporating none of the atmosphere of the games. It wasn't scary enough, it wasn't gory enough, and it wasn't evil enough.To summarise: it was crap.

I found Doom to be refreshing, too many movie makers have tried to recreate video games onto the big screen but in many ways fail mainly due to their own visions. A great example would be resident evil, although the movies are good they aren't exactly staying true to the game. Doom will not appeal to everyone and that isn't because it steps too far outside of the boundaries of the game. It is a gore fest much like the game, the language is very adult and appropriate for the style of game doom is. I loved the first-person effect that was added in briefly during a scene. House of the dead tried similar tactics in that movie with the flashing of clips from the original game which of course made it cheesy and lame. I at first figured that the first-person camera portion of the movie was going to be a joke, but it actually surprised me making me feel for a short time that I was actually sitting behind my computer playing doom. I gave this movie a 10 not just for it being a good solid sci-fi/horror movie but the fact it did what many movies couldn't and that was stay true to the game. There of course are some things that aren't exactly accurate to the games but I would say the overall majority did. So if you haven't played the game but are a fan of sci-fi/horror movies then I think you'll enjoy this and if you are a gamer like me then I think you'll add this one to your favorite movie lists. I hope we see more first-person camera effects added into movies, it really gives you the in your face feel and I think works well in horror orientated situations. If you wouldn't allow your kids to play the games then I don't recommend allowing them to watch the movie either. Unlike most of the other game-to-movie examples out there this one is not a watered down version to make the critics happy and give it a PG-13 rating. This is a solid R and made for adults and true fans of doom. With all the weak excuses for horror, sci-fi, and game based movies out there I think you'll appreciate Doom and just in time for Halloween. Definitely a must see and one I'd personally like to see a sequel to.",Doom
751,snair28,"Short movie, some good scenes, and great FPS mode",7,21 October 2005,"The movie is too short for the gamer fans. I guess I was expecting more action out of it. The best part of the movie is indeed the FPS mode for approx 5 to 10 minutes. Could have used that mode in many parts of the movie. They should have included more imps, fat zombie, zombie commandos, or even the trites or lost souls...One of the best monsters was Pinky..and they didn't give much highlight to the Hell Knight...Of course the movie is a lot different than the game, but all in all the movie sequences were great.Sarge and Reaper has done a good job. The rest of the characters are OK. There were a few scenes when most people in the theater including myself jumped from their seats..",Doom
752,sunny_kshitij,A movie worth to watch!!,8,19 October 2005,"hi buddiesDoom is the movie i have been waiting for for a very long time. It is really a nice sci-fi movie. The movie is only for guys who really like sci-fi special effect. The story itself; replete with sub-plot after sub-plot, rich in dialog and detail, was beyond anyone's greatest expectations. Everyone, including Andrzej Bartkowiak, expected this movie to fail. It is a timeless classic, which I will not repeat here. There are too many movie reviews giving full details of the plot, and I won't be redundant beyond what I have already said. And then there are the effects. The effects are so awesome; so creative; so ahead of their time, as to ensure this movie's vast success for the next forty years. Andrzej Bartkowiak enjoys an almost god-like status among sci-fi/fantasy fans worldwide.therefore i would seriously recommend that the movie is worth watching.i would rather give it 8/10 points overall.",Doom
753,Siphra,Hello Resident evil 4?,4,23 October 2005,"Ummm, Genetic mutation? What happened to hell? WAY too much like a bad RE rip off. The great thing about doom is it was hell, Something that was missing and in fact removed from the movie, probably only to make it more marketable. If you want a good movie, Rent Resident Evil, or RE2, much better and they have practically the same plot. (Oh yeah except RE doesn't happen on MARS) The problem here on mars is, get this, a 24th Chromosome that selectively infects people making them monsters, of course all the good monsters from the original DOOM, DOOM 2 and DOOM 3 are left out, opting instead for the corrupted humans only. other than that. as a movie, its a mediocre attempt.",Doom
754,pharaohkalb,the best game to movie translation to date,7,19 October 2005,"Which isn't saying to much. However this movie did accomplish a number of things that other game to movie translations failed horribly at. Resident Evil ended up being just like every other zombie flick. They even had zombies popping out of the ground on the second one (which didn't make any sense at all, i mean decayed bodies busting through a coffin and 6 feet of dirt, come on). Tomb Raider was just boring...period, i really didn't care about a single character in the film and almost fell asleep by the end. I'm not even going to talk about AvP because lets face it, anything is better then that abysmal film. This film however does a very good job at capturing the feeling of Doom and actually keeps me interested in whats happening.First of all, some people are complaining about the changes in the plot from DOOM 3. First of all, this film never promised to be a Doom 3 movie so i wasn't expecting it to be. However the reasons for changing a portal to hell into a genetic experiment is difficult to fathom. It would have been just as easy to do a film with hell involved. However this problem aside i think that the reasons for having a squad instead of a single soldier is obvious. A movie needs discussions, drama and breaks in the action. A single soldier with non stop action would have put the entire audience to sleep with its repetition. Also people have said that it ripped off Aliens, but then again, the original Doom even said that it was largely based on Aliens so whatever.All and all it was an alright movie, the PoV scene was pretty tight but the film could have used demons, and more then just Imps.",Doom
755,raginfanz,First person fun.,7,28 November 2005,"What I find hilarious is that the biggest majority of people voted for 10/10 19.8% maybe loyalists to the game but also some people vote 1/10 this means they are mad at the film because if they believe this to be less than 4/10 i can recommend some shocking films that you'd apparently prefer to watch. It didn't deserve less than 6 for sure the first person aspect was damn good, even if some other areas lacked.What was disappointing was that its not nearly anywhere near as scary as the game, indeed not really that scary at all, Doom fans will either appreciate or feel let down by this and go home and create their own better movie , but those new to the whole prospect should feel fairly satisfied.(Females under 18 voted it the best.)",Doom
756,bakyspritz,An OK movie if you let yourself be entertained,6,26 December 2005,"I had no preconceived ideas about the movie since I don't play video games nor did I follow up on the plot. It's basically an action horror movie and if you're not expecting much more than that, you'll be entertained. The lead was good looking and did what he could with the movie. Rosamund Pike was a bite stiff because she was much better in Pride and Prejudice. Probably didn't know what to do with the movie. The Rock is same as usual. Everyone one else did their job as required: overacted, posed, spout action one-liners etc...The movie was moving along fine when about 2/3 into it, the director decided to pay homage to its origins. When they started showing the scenes from a video game perspective, I got annoyed. It's a movie, not a video game! If it wasn't for the sudden change in style, I thought it was a solid action horror flick. As is, it's still an OK movie. I have definitely seen worse.",Doom
757,bigkillerhomeboy,great movie,10,24 February 2006,"This movie had what i expected of it lot's of action drama and thrills :) Everone see this movie because it's worth the while. The rock who you can see in ""scorpion king"" is really good in this movie. Then we have Carl urban who we most likely feel friend with trough the lord of the rings movies and some episodes of series Xena Warriorprincess To sum it all up i say it again this movie is super great from my point of view anyway. And if you go to see it go to the theaters to do it it's a total different feeling in a cinema than at home though i have a good sound and video system. From me bigkillerhomeboy to you all a great movie",Doom
758,redstriker,An average but enjoyable action movie.,7,1 July 2006,Having played and loved every Doom game and reading the previews I went into this movie not really expecting anything good but I was pleasantly surprised.Anyone who is a hardcore Doom fan won't like the change in plot from the UAC experimenting with teleportation that ends up leading to hell to the UAC experimenting in genetics as the source of the demons. But if you're a Doom fan with an open mind or if you haven't played the games then you should get some enjoyment out of it.As for everything else there certainly could have been a better variety of weapons and demons in the movie but what is there is done good enough. The characters are nothing special but the cast does a good job with them. The makeup and SFX aren't spectacular but they're great for what the movie is trying to do The FPS sequence is a nice addition for any FPS fans and recreates the feeling of being in a game nicely and is arguably one of the best parts of the movie.In summary as a recreation of Doom it falls flat but by itself it's an enjoyable film even if it's mostly been done before.,Doom
759,blackstar601,Waste of Celluloid,1,21 October 2005,"Beyond crap. Beyond trash. Beyond the stupidest thing you can imagine... there is 'Doom'. Lowest common denominator film-making. Presented as if the entire script was written on a piece of toilet paper. On your death bed you will cry out in pain wishing not only you had those 100 minutes back, but you had your $7.50 back as well. The tag-line for the film should have been ""If feces was an art-form.""Lets all hope that ""Halo"" in the hands of Peter Jackson and the super talented WETA special effects team bring a stunning piece of cinema that finally breaks the pattern of awful video game movies once and for all. Let us hope Halo's future success will send a message to Hollywood to stop wasting its time, energy, effort and money making garbage like Doom.Go see ""Serenity"" again.

760,anakkin,Beware: Garbage,4,30 October 2005,"Well as you know this movie is based on the popular 1st person shooter Doom.Basically, this movie is terrible. The story, while having potential, is not developed. Naturally, the acting is terrible. But of course anyone who watches this film is interested in the action. Well, the movie disappoints in this department too. Very low quality action, poor monster design. The whole thing was filmed quite badly,the movie is basically comprised of these scenes: silence for a while, a monster's head pops out of now where, the camera shakes a bit, and somebody dies. Repeart this scene about 5 times and you get most of the ""action"" in the movie.I suggest skipping to the last 20 minutes of the film, if you're going to even watch this.",Doom
761,picclo200,"Why ""DOOM"" is good and bad",7,22 October 2005,"Ill start with the badness first.... Well the movie was made after DOOM 3, the video game made after a storyline about a group of marines that go up to mars (through a spaceship) that brings them up there. While they're up there to investigate weird happenings, when the main character (you) have to go find a scientist not having been seen for weeks, you find that hell (and the devil) are living in the ancient martian civilization. The demons from hell take over anyones body that they want to. NOW I WILL GET TO THE MOVIE.............. OK now the good part is that they still stick to the story of going up to mars and going to the ancient martian civilization. Another good thing is that they have weapons only that are used on the game. While they have a great part that brings you as if you are playing the game while watching the movie. It has a part where it goes into first person, seeing through the eyes of one of the characters, and he goes around killing the zombies, with one of the most common weapons in the game, and it really is very cool. Now I will tell you the bad part. First of all the story of the movie strays way to far off of the story of the game. The zombies are made biologically, not from demons from hell. It was a lousy remake of a resident evil movie. Second, The Rock just ruins the movie. He makes it funny instead of scary, and when he turns into a zombie at the end, it doesn't happen from him dying and then turning into a zombie like the rest. I give this a 7 out of 10 because the movie isn't bad, and the graphics are pretty good, as the sounds, But the storyline isn't as good as the storyline of the game, and that was disappointing. From a gamers prospective it is mostly good, but they really could have done better with the story, i was really disappointed about that.",Doom
762,weltrauminspektor,ridiculous,3,16 November 2005,"i was really looking forward to this movie because i really loved the video games, especially i liked doom 3 for the atmosphere but this movie is just so full of wasted chances. in the beginning i really liked the atmosphere with people sneaking around searching for monsters they couldn't see but later i was really disappointed. the many logical bugs do their part to make it impossible to identify with the main characters as you were able to in the game. the ""great special effects"" look like from an old freddy-krueger-movie. there would have been so much potential in the hell scenario of the doom 3 video game.but the one thing that in my opinion really breaks the spine of the movie is the first-person-scene near the end.all the subtile horror from the beginning of the movie vanishes when one of the main characters starts jumping around and randomly shooting at dozens of monsters. this may be fun in a computer game but in a movie its completely in the wrong place.additionally it seems like the writers of the script didn't know how they could make the story end rationally so they just end it with a big shootout.doom is a good example for the fact that some computer games and books alike just aren't suitable to adapt them as a movie. i really hope that future movie adaptations of video games will be better than that one, but i really doubt that.",Doom
763,sanne-vangalen,How to turn a video game into a movie,8,4 November 2005,"I just went to see this movie and had pretty low expectations, because I didn't think has a lot of movie material. But they did an excellent job on this movie! First they introduce a team of commando's. A bit out of place maybe, but how boring would this movie be if it had just one person shooting around without getting himself killed. A good horror movie needs people to die, hence this entire team standing ready to be wiped out. Lots of blood, very nice make-up.In the first half, this is a typical horror movie. A team of commando's is locked up in a space station and is getting killed by monsters. The fact that they're locked up adds a nice claustrophobic atmosphere, and what they find out about the monsters adds an extra thrill. It doesn't really look like the game, though.In the second half, the movie slowly turns into the video game. When almost everybody is killed, the hero gets a effective adrenaline shots up and starts blowing the monsters into peaces. Here, an entire scene is shot from the hero's perspective showing only his weapon and the monsters, a very well known image for those who've played this game. And he also gets to use his chainsaw! Overall, this is a very enjoyable movie, filled with action, horror, and still some elements of the video game.",Doom
764,conquerormarr,"Not Doom, but great camp",8,24 October 2005,"People expecting something that is either frightening or a direct tribute to the original Doom games will be sorely disappointed, but this movie is great if you want to see some hilarious absurdity. The FPS sequence is as much a throw back to arcade shooters as to Doom, but it is still a highpoint. Roger Ebert has a whole practiced spiel about how the problem with movies that try to be camp is that they ham it up too much, but Doom does not overplay it. All the characters take the absurd plot and bizarre science seriously, which makes it all the better. The discussion of where the monsters come from is particularly humorous in its dubious science. BORDERLINE SPOILER: This movie has one of the greatest cage fighting sequences EVER, as well as an excellent use of the Marine Corps motto.",Doom
765,blackwaterparkx14,"I entered with low expectations, and was pleasantly surprised...",8,30 October 2005,"I enjoyed ""Doom."" Yeah, I said it. After reading about a trillion negative reviews of the movie, I had decided it was going to be absolutely terrible. Then my friend asked me to go see it with him. I figured it would suck, but I decided to go along as I was excited to see the movie, and gather my own opinion.The movies intro was the standard sci-fi/horror beginning. Some frightened people, some gore, and a black-out at the end. The plot was obviously not going to be concurrent to the 1st game, as it takes place on Mars, but I shrugged it off.The movie moved on, introducing the quirky team of soldiers sent up to kill whatever is causing mayhem up on Mars (watching Duke cut himself made me cringe).Surprisingly, the acting is pretty good, excepting Rosamund Pike's performance as Sam Grimm (she acts like she's reading off her lines from a teleprompter), with The Rock's Sarge and Karl Urban's John Grimm being the main characters.Like many have said, you won't really get a lot more from this movie then you have from many others of the same genre, but I found it to be an enjoyable experience.One last note, this movie got an 8 rating due to the first-person shooter recreation. It is the love-it-or-hate-it marketing draw in of the movie, but I personally think it a faithful (not to mention awesome) recreation of the gaming experience. It made the movie far cooler. My only complaint was that it was rather short. I was expecting a longer sequence.The ending was by far the most disappointing part of the movie. It just... well, ends.Pros: -FPS Sequence -Surprisingly good acting by most the actors. -Special Effects. -The BFG!Cons: -Not sticking to the plot (kind of a pro/con) -Rosamund Pike, period. -FPS Sequence too short.Overall: 8/10",Doom
766,I_Bring_The_Handsome,Awesome movie!,10,29 October 2005,"DOOM - You would think that the creators would ruin the entire series by making a movie and making it unrealistic or un-true to the game. It is loosely related to the game, but actually makes you want the movie to be ported to Arcade so you can be John while he goes through his FPS Fantana.The movie is excellent, top quality video game movie. It has action non-stop, from the intro scene of the facility getting taken over and infected till the final fight scene between Super John and Infected Sarge. The FPS Perspective was personally my favorite scene, It starts after Sam gives you the C-24 which in quick form, makes you super. His wounds heal, and his bullet wound disappears. He takes his gun and you see the FPS start. You get to see Pinky try to kill John and eventually infected Sarge. At first, he acts normal, but because of his behavior to the infected and non-infected John aims his gun towards him. The Sarge moves his neck and reveals the infection. They both have very little ammo, and waste it into no air. the BFG Clearly misses, but the bullets are close. They drop their weapons and gear, and do it classic style. By the end, Sam is in the elevator, John pushes the Sarge who by then, is almost completely demon, into the Arc and throws a grenade in with it.You see a bit more FPS perspective during the end credits, while the person is shooting at the creators and directors etc names while he/she continues down the path.All in all, I say this is the best movie I have seen this year, and will be great for FPS fans, Doom fans and really anyone who wants an action movie that has a ton of gore and violence. If you liked Resident Evil, the games or two movies, then you will absolutely love this movie. Its great, and the best Video Game movie ever.",Doom

OK now if your a fan of just sci fi movies this would be OK to see maybe when it comes out on video to rent it. but even for a movie it wasn't that great. and i wont tell you what it was but the ending of the movie was one of the worst endings i've ever seen.

The story was almost same and the environment was very similar. If you liked the game then you like the style of the movie. Story was not so surprising but as an old PC gamer I personally liked the story. I was wondering if The Rock could handle his role but he did it pretty good. A little evil The Sarge. Cold and vicious team leader, The Sarge, that's him! The story though had pretty good turn up after a while. I didn't expect that and it was totally surprise. Finally the one and only First-Person scene was the dot above I was perfect. Players of old Doom's might like it ;) I loved it. Only scene I waited for and it was worth it!

What I found lacking, mostly, were action and gore (there's some of both, but mostly people are running around in near-darkness, background noises promising, but rarely delivering those monster attacks you expect). And I've been wondering since yesterday: why did they even attempt to give this thing a plot? Not that a plot is bad for a movie, mind you, but... not this half-baked, pseudo-scientific sci-fi stuff, please! It feels like the alibi exercise it probably was. On the other hand, I have to admit that I really enjoyed the first-person perspective scene towards the end.

772,tnt_tar,Doom was disappointing but better than any other video game to movie adaptations,7,19 October 2005,"The reason why doom is getting so many negative reviews is because critics do not like video game to movie adaptations because they repeatedly have cheesy dialogues and poor script writing.The other reason why it is so negatively reviewed because of the fans of the doom games.The movie is not the game we hoped to be.But that doesn't mean it isn't exactly as the game.The facility is named UAC and it is set on a dead planet.The other similarity is the BFG,the chainsaw and the minigun weapons.Sure,they don't hardly use them but it still is a similarity to the game.I know the game was a non-stop violent masterpiece and the movie is supposed to deliver what the game have.It didn't meet it's expectations but the movie still had gut busting action scenes that has blood and gore with scary monsters.In my opinion,it is way better than Super Mario Bros,Resident evil,Mortal Kombat and even way better than Uwe Boll's horrible game to movie films like House Of The dead or Bloodrayne.The director Andrez Bartkowiak is a poor director but tries to deliver what the game had.The flaw was that the screenwriters were horrible.The movie itself has dilaogue errors like when goat said that we are a million years away from breakfast or the scientific facts of the 24th chromosome.The other error was the cheesy acting of The Rock.When he said to his men that everybody watch your god damn footing or if it breathes kill it.Those aren't even real words or even proper dialogue.But not all the actors were horribly cheesy like Sarge or Portman.There was Reaper(Karl Urban) who in my opinion did the best job and I think that most people agree.I also think that Duke or Goat did a good job but was killed off.Goat shouldn't have been killed off first.He was cool even though he said a dumb line but he had a shotgun and he looked like a tough guy military hero.They should have killed off Portman first.That guy was so stupid like when he said in the movie""I have to take a dump"".That's just so retarted and a dumb cheesy character who deserves to die first.I also thought destroyer should have lived longer because he was a soldier and had a kick ass mini gun but didn't use it hardly.Even though the movie has flaws and some disapointments but had action and gore and a lot better acting than most video game movies.I think this one was the best of them all but I hope later in the future that they will make a perfect video game movie or I hope there will be a Doom 2 movie that has way more action and based in hell where it was supposed to be.Oh and another thing,the creatures did came from hell but in another hell.In the movie there was a civilization of creatures who carried the 24th chromosome and scientists of the UAC found the bones and the DNA of the creatures in the dig.When they used it on a human being that was obviously a psycho because if the fact that Sam Grimm(Rosumand Pike) who is John's sister(Reaper) said that it makes psycho's monsters and good guys superhuman,mutated the scientists.When Reaper said that this place was always hell,it was true.It was always hell.So it does have kinda the same plot from the games.The one thing that made the movie sort of the game was the FPS scene which was awesome and the best part of the in the movie. PS: There is supposed to be an unrated extended version of the film which is 14 minutes longer and it's supposed to have an extended FPS scene and contains more action,monsters and gore that the theatrical version.",Doom

And a person who has never seen or heard of the game or any games like it will be completely lost. If you looking for a little gore in your life. And not a fan of horror. This might be the picture to get you into the genre. I like many of the the Rocks pictures but this one kinda surprised me. It also does not have many known actors. The story line was a little vague. The effects were OK. Now the weirdness of the gore was something where you need to make sure you haven't eaten anytime soon. A definite movie to see with a girlfriend or boyfriend. It was a little to loud also for some reason but that may have been the movie theater itself. And you have to pay attention to the story to understand what is happening if you miss a piece your kind of asking your neighbor. ""What did they mean by that again?""

It has the feel of the video game, but the plot concepts are different and too much time is spent on exploration. It feels slow and broken up, like a sitcom. Often during character interactions I had the feeling of 'get on with it already, i don't care, go shoot something'. Usually its either a lot of firepower and action with less suspense/exploration (aliens,predator,deep rising) or less firepower and action and a lot of suspense/exploration (alien,relic,leviathan). This movie tries to have it both ways and fails miserably. The most annoying aspect of the movie was the characters. The rapid response team was more like a bunch of office workers on a paint ball outing and not like a team of trained marines at all. The movie picks up in the last 20 minutes, but the events that take place in those 20 minutes are completely inconstant with all that has happened before. Almost as if the producers just gave up and decided to take a completely different approach at the end. The 1st person view piece was like a trailer for a video game.

Yes.For the non-gaming audience, the basic plot of the movie goes like this: It's the not-too-distant future, and corporation scientists have discovered ""something"" on Mars, and through researching it, have done experiments they really shouldn't have been doing. Now some kind of monstrous threat is making its way through the research facility, and it has to be stopped. So, a team of Marines, led by Sarge (The Rock), are sent in to neutralize the threat, and, as expected, discover that the threat is not exactly what they think it is.So, you could fit Doom into three basic genres--action, horror, and sci-fi--and they all work together well enough. None of them ever steals away any focus, and between the action/horror segments, there are some sci-fi explanations that do a pretty good job of breaking things up and moving the plot along (which is good, because the plot itself is pretty thin). Nothing ever seems tired, over-the-top, or out of left field, either (though there is one explanation near the end about the human genome that is a little bit silly). However, none of the genres ever seem to be used to their potential. There's a good amount of guns fired, but none of the encounters ever feel that tense. The horror sequences have your requisite monsters and zombies and gore, but nothing that really creeps you out or makes you jump out of your seat. As far as sci-fi is concerned, it's there just for what I described above--to explain things and move along the plot. And aside from there being an inter-spatial portal called ""the Ark,"" the action takes place almost entirely indoors, with fairly normal-looking labs, corridors, and sewers. So, there's no real futuristic, ""we're on another planet"" feel. Maybe if Doom had a few more firefights, scares, and something more sci-fi than just explaining why this and that is happening, it could have been a good popcorn flick.But then there's also the creativity aspect of it. By looking at the basic plot, the general feel you get is just, ""Been there, done that,"" and the content tends to go along with it. Shadowy figures sometimes scurry by quickly, dogs rattle angrily in their cages, and you have the occasional zombie that rushes at somebody or monster that lops someone's head off. There are no original scares, just eyeballs in the dark and the old shoots-something-out-of-its-mouth. No complicated firefights or combat sequences either, and no special effects that will wow you. And even if you come into this movie without knowing anything about the games or seeing any of the ads, odds are you'll figure out what caused the mayhem on Mars before the characters do.So, Doom's pretty much standard fare, but that's not to say it's a horrible movie. There are a few aspects of the flick that actually raise it a bit over mediocre status. For one thing, it's an action/horror/sci-fi mish-mash movie, which are few and far between. And as discussed, the mish-mash works, with each genre weighed out enough so nothing feels tired. The dialogue and acting also do the job, with no one standing out as flat-out terrible. The script/editing is fairly tight, and aside from one or two things, none of the plot points ever seem that needless. The plot itself, although thin, also has some tendencies of depth now and again, with an estranged brother-sister dynamic, and the old ""a soldier's duty"" topic that creeps in near the end. Almost all the jokes and one-liners work, too. None of them are really original, but they also never fall completely flat or feel uncalled for, so they'll guarantee at least a few chuckles. And then there is a ""first-person perspective"" sequence near the end of the flick that actually is kind of cool (more on that below).For the gaming fans, there are also a few things that make the movie a little bit special. There's the occasional name drop (one of which, when you find out the character's name, will make you go, ""Oh, sh*t, I know what's going to happen to him!"") the appearance of the BFG and the chainsaw, both of which are pretty awesome (but sorely underused), and a couple baddies that you'll easily recognize. But maybe what you're really wondering about is the fabled ""first-person perspective"" sequence, which is an attempt to recreate the feel of the games. Well, if you saw it by itself or if the sequence were cut up and interspersed throughout the movie, it probably would be questionable. But thankfully, the sequence is only used once, it's not very long (runs about four minutes), is near the end of the movie, and it actually has a point. What that point is, though, I'll leave up to you to see.So, Doom is a decent movie overall, that doesn't fail on anything it does, but still could have delivered a bit more. So, at least we can add another mark for the ""good"" side. Though, like Mortal Kombat and Tomb Raider, I'm sure it will be debated. But you know what? At least it's not another Super Mario Bros.",Doom
777,darthlordnaes,not the game,6,21 October 2005,"The action was minimal, should have spent more time on the dialog and could've used more monsters. Don't get me wrong i liked this film. I was just expecting more. I would've liked to have seen more aspects of the game. The game made such an impression on me. The movie barely tickled my lust for violence. The first person perspective rocked the house. But I felt like i was watching a new Resident Evil. The characters were undeveloped and generic. Elements of the story are left out or go nowhere. The ""BFG"" was awesome but hardly put to good use. I think the makers relied on the title but dropped the ball on the game fans. Non-gamers will enjoy it. Gamers might be disappointed.",Doom
778,shermstix,"I loved it, but could see how those not familiar with the game would not.",10,21 October 2005,"This movie is fantastic. I was very skeptical when I had seen the previews and read the sneak preview reviews. So I went in expecting the worst and was pleasantly surprised. The basis for the game was that scientists working for the UAC in a facility on mars have found and opened a portal to hell. The movie is more of a genetic experiment gone wrong, but with a nice twist on the whole evil thing that gets explained in the film. A side from the minor difference in story, the movie holds very true to the game. I felt like the sets were very detailed, many of which could have been pulled directly from Doom3 (the Pinky Demon's legs were a little off though...). The acting is very well done and there are many scenes in the movie that you will jump out of your seat during. I felt myself get very absorbed into the film. The majority of the film is standard third person perspective with about a 10 minute segment toward the end that is in first person. I read that some felt sick afterward, but the scene was so short that I am unsure of how. If you liked the original ""Resident Evil"" film, then you will love this movie. I would not recommend it to the squeamish though, because it is very gruesome as Doom is obviously known for. This film is well made, well directed and revolutionary with its first person perspective. I say thumbs up!",Doom
779,darla_jean_2000,I've seen this movie Before,4,21 October 2005,"Resident Evil 1 & 2 rolled into one! I really like the Rock, but he was a real rock in this film. BFG? Okay. I guessed that the first time I saw it. It began slow and it took a while to get to the action. Once the action started, it really didn't stop. The best part was how it looked like they were really playing the game. The monsters. No living dead. No zombies were a waste of ammunition. The chick from Resident Evil should have came in and beat some living dead behind! Why do the marines always come in to clean up? The Rock was not very convincing at being a commander. Maybe Mr. Urban should have been the commander, considering he made most of the decisions.",Doom
780,debenhoh,"All in all, an unsatisfying endeavor",4,24 October 2005,"Although I spent many hours in the past playing the computer game, I would not call myself a ""Doom"" fanatic. I really enjoyed the game for quite awhile, but seriously had no concerns whether or not the movie was going to try and match the game at all, so I entered the theater impartial and just hoping forward to a good movie. Sadly, things don't always go the way you plan.The movie started off OK, the opening scene was engaging enough to make me say ""oh s***, some people are DOOMed"" I was honestly just hoping for a strong action packed, gory war with monsters with some scares in it. So, for a few good points about the movie: The soundtrack was perfect for the genre, heck it was techno and metal and got the blood pumpin. The BFG was cool, to bad they hardly used it.and there was ONE good fight scene that was awesome to watch. The 'first person' view at the end was probably the high light of the movie, but definitely doesn't even come close to redeeming the movie...now..for the bad...The casting was overall bad, save a few people who pulled off good ""grunts"" for the military. I have enjoyed nearly every movie the Rock has been in, but in this one, he pulls off the ""military grunt"" and ""dedicated soldier, DO WHATEVER is necessary"" roll WAY over the top. But thats not his fault, so obviously the director was a fool. Monsters were really pathetic, no monster variety, and the pathetic reasons for why the monsters were what they were was horrible. The movie did not flow, the first half was suspense that was way to drawn out and the military tactics of this special ops team was "" OK, if we keep splitting up, they cant kill us all!!!!"" No character development, random cheesy one liners, and honestly, so many little things added up to unhappiness. Half way through the movie I was ready to walk out. I was upset.Even avid gamers will have trouble appreciating this, so I advise everyone to save their money on this one...it just is not worth it. Wait for it in 5 years when it is aired on ABC movie prime time just so you can finally see why this movie just doesn't make the cut.4/10 Stars",Doom
781,ryuliong,Worth watching,8,21 October 2005,"I think a lot of comments here reflect what I feel about the movie. It's entertaining and definitely one of the better game-to-movie adaptations out there. The movie takes elements from the game and uses it to create a tight plot and fast paced action. It doesn't give you all the explanations immediately, to keep you interested, and it doesn't leave you with too many unanswered questions in the end either.Just some responses to a few things a lot of gamers were complaining about.Complaint: It's not set in Mars Response: IT ISComplaint: There are no space marines Response: There are marines, and they're in space. Does it really matter?Complaint: There aren't any demonsResponse: Well, it depends on what you'd consider demons. If a portal opened up with creatures from the unknown spewing out... how could you tell if that was some alien planet or hell itself? Besides, the movie gives a nice (though simplified) differentiation between the creatures in Doom from, say, the zombies in Resident Evil.",Doom
782,violenceobscene,Hardcore Doomers might hate it -- super hardcore doomers might LOVE it.,8,21 October 2005,"Needless to say, I was scared to death of this movie. The original Doom, being my absolute favorite game of all time, finally being turned into a film! Video game movies are awful. This one was just FUN.Did you want hardcore super-duper plot? Go see Crash. Did you want bad-ass kung-fu? Go see Kill Bill. Did you want mindless fanboy shooting? Go see Doom.For avid fans of Doom 3, you might be a little disappointed in this movie, because even though it draws upon aspects from the plot, it's not exactly based off of it. But if you, like me, were one of those freaks who devoured the first game in all of its bloody gory, even to the point of researching the game's beginnings at computer shows and the 'original plot concept' that they had before it was released, there's NO REASON AT ALL THAT YOU SHOULD HATE THIS MOVIE.Funny. This movie's plot could actually be an interesting precursor to the plot of the very first Doom.Although the lack of Hell was a bit disappointing, the addition of the research into Chromosome 24 (the soul), I thought was great. Someone earlier said they were confused on why some people got infected and others were passed by. THe way I saw it was that the infection triggered bestial changes in those who had bad, evil tendencies (every character in the movie who gets turned has done something bad, unkindly, or cowardly), and triggered amazing strength in those who were good of heart. An interesting, symbolic twist on the concept of hell on earth! Why summon demons to it when you can just turn bad humans into them instead? I've begun constructing my required checklist. If you're looking for these references and things in the movie as a game-player, you won't be disappointed.1) From the original README of Doom: ""You put your Commanding Officer into a full-body cast for commanding you and your men to fire on innocent bystanders."" 2) Before the original Doom was released, the tentative concept being thrown around computer shows was that the former humans and former human sergeants were actually possessed by the Imps, and when the body disassembled, the imps were revealed in their true form. Who can know if this is what id truly intended when the game was released, though? They never expounded, and who cares if they did or didn't? 3) Before the original Doom was released, there were rumors that the main character was a cloned, genetically engineered recreation of BJ Blazkowitcz, the main character from Wolfenstein 3d. Okay, so they don't mention BJ's name, but it sure made me giggle when it got to 'that point of the movie'! 4) Remember reading those awful Doom novels by Brad Linaweaver and Dafyd Ab Hugh? Remember when Flynn Taggart injected himself with the adrenaline shot? What does Karl Urban do when he gets the sweet-awesome-cool shot in his arm? HE FREAKS OUT! Someone hit it right on the heard when they said that this movie, just like the game, was meant to be a shoot-em-up good excuse to have some fun and give a crap less about plot.I'm glad people still remember the basics of movies and games -- to have FUN! Though the plot wasn't exactly ripped from Doom or Doom 3, it was pieced together by it, and all of the obscure DooM references should have fanboys giggling for hours! SEE IT!",Doom
783,tig_jas,Excellent,10,21 October 2005,"Just saw it and wow, it was far better then what i thought it would be. The Rock did an excellent job in this movie and for all you people who thinks it ^*#$s because hes in it, you have no idea what you are missing. I've been a DOOM fan since the first one came out in '93. Though it has some story line it doesn't have much for the game. But the story line that they created for the movie is pretty good and it gets an A from me. While people say oh, it only had this many monsters and so and so, OK and? It had them and thats what counts, its an action movie not some game where infinite numbers spawn out of the air, and in the main game you see mostly imps anyway. A true fan of the games would know that this movie was pretty frigging sweet. The sound, graphics etc rocked and the first person was something new and cool.While it didn't have ""hell"" per say, once you see the movie it really doesn't matter because the story line is so gripping. Overall i would give it a 93% rating. The suspense and surprises were just like in the game, never knew what was going to happen next, though you may have thought you knew.I recommend you see it and decide for yourself, though with all the DOOM fans out there and all the other people who like these kinds of movies, I'm sure there will be a sequel like they said if its a hit, which in my opinion it is.For all you people who say it sucked and was crap, get a clue. Its in the future so duh they wont look like the ""marines"" now and the Rock can and did act well, so shove it. At least voice a intelligent opinion of the movie and not some ""oh rock sucks"" or ""Resident Evil (whichw as crap) is better cause of the zombies"". Try playing the game, cause the monsters sure as hell looked like they did from the game.

I would have liked to see the other weapons (i.e. plasma rifle,double barrel shotgun, rocket launcher!) I really liked the use of the BFG 9000. The creatures didn't look to bad, however where the CocaDeamons, Lost Souls, Reverents, Aracnids, esp. Cyberdemon? They could have come up with a better bad guy scenario. If anyone want to talk about bad video game movies then let's talk about Mortal Kombat II,Super Mario brothers, Street Fighter. I'm looking forward to Silent Hill. There is one thing I caught.

Not the wickedly cool lone soldier fighting off the hordes of hell we've all come to know and love. I expected to see all the crazy evil elements of the original series, and the retelling from Doom 3. There was none of that. I don't recommend this movie at all. It was like watching Alone in the Dark all over again. Man, it was awful.With all that said, I do however have to give the movie credit for 2 things.

788,NYGFAN1724,The Best Video Game to Big Screen Movie Yet.,7,22 October 2005,"This will be a brutally honest review. I have played Doom, but I am also a lover of great movies. I went to this movie as a guy and a gamer. And this is what I got.*****SPOILERS***** Doom stays close enough to form for anyone who has played the Original or sequels. I would have loved it better if had dealt with the portal to hell, but we still got the same monsters, only with a different catalyst. Now, I have been reading some of the comments. Take this review as sort of an FAQ.Q: This Movie is way to dark. WHERE IS THE LIGHTING!? A: The film is intended to be dark. Your not supposed to be able to see the monsters, just like in the game, or any otehr great Suspense movie. It is supposed to leap out at you. Notice the flashlights on the Marines guns? Remember, when one of the soldiers lights goes out, it gets dark. And you can't see the monster until it grabs him. Just like he can't see the monster until it grabs him. That is the reason for the damn darkness.Q: Canny one-liners. The acting sucked.A: Yes, it has one-liners. But isn't that also in the game, and any great action movie? And some may say the roles were clichéd. They are clichéd because most of you have seen the formula before. But it works in this movie. This is not your Best Oscar movie here, but it gets the job done. Kudos to Rosamund Pike for her great performance.Q; The plot was horrible. I can't believe they actually thought it would work.A: If you would actually pay attention, you'd notice the plot is woven rather well. Anyone with half a brain knows that the holes were gearing FOR A SEQUEL. And the whole idea of the 24th chromosome, and mans migration from Mars to Earth is a very viable substitute for the portal to hell. Just be god damned thankful they didn't go with the original plot.Overall, this movie was great. It had some of the best action sequences I've seen in a while (Destroyer's fight against Dr. Willits, The First Person perspective sequence towards the end) and it paid great homage to the original Doom monsters (Pinky anyone?)

Maybe it was just covered with makeup. If that's the case, kudos to the makeup department. Really, I just can't think of anything good to say about this movie. The plot was weak...the sub-plots were even weaker. There wasn't much action...don't get me wrong...there was action...but not the type of action you would expect if you've ever played the game.

791,spyder1529,A Doom Fan Extremely Disappointed....,3,23 October 2005,"OK....seeing as its David Callaham's first screenplay and story, I was willing to walk into the theater with a sort of ""open mindedness"". Although this movie is supposed to be entirely based off a game. There is definitely a large fan base that was brought up with this game, myself included. Therefore when the plot was dramatically changed from the game it was a huge disappointment and let down to me. One thing that really bugs me about ""scary"" movies these days is that there is no build up to the action. In this movie in particular there is hardly any in depth explanation to anything that is going on, its all sort of mentioned on the fly to patch the many holes in the plot. It sucks, and makes the characters/situations a whole lot less identifiable.If you are looking to go see a movie based on the classic doom plot, this movie is way off and a waste of money. First off this movie primarily looked like DOOM 3, and honestly it did look great. Although I mainly didn't like the movie because the plot of DOOM 3 includes Hell. It seems that Callaham has absolutely no guts, rather than being slightly controversial and including this concept he decided to skirt around it by adding a ridiculous virus to the plot.Another thing that bothered me about this film was the fact that it looked a ton like Resident Evil (the movie). They both kind of started off the same (people getting extremities caught in doors), and ended the same (elevator/tram out of the complex). There was also a lot of zombie shooting...I don't know...Doom really just went for cheap thrills. Oh I almost forgot the Marines that were supposed to be an elite fighting force seem like a bunch of random dudes with guns. This cast really does not make me believe at all that these characters are Marines.Well, the novelty of this film died when the first zombie did...It's kind of tragic though because this movie had a ton of potential, next time let any random DOOM fan write the script, most likely it will turn out better.If you still want to see it, please SAVE MONEY and RENT IT...you'll see what I'm talking about.",Doom

My interest was immediately grabbed during the opening scene of the movie when the scientists were all being chased and killed by an unknown creature....then they talked about the ""ark""...I was like WTF?! Plus they set the movie about 40 some years in the future instead of about 100. Then, they jumped right into the movie and didn't do any in-depth explanations about the UAC. And I was extremely disappointed when the monsters weren't demons from Hell, but were like the zombies from Resident Evil. Plus, the movie could have lasted longer. It would've been awesome as a 2-3 hour movie because they could expand the plot instead of shooting it right along. Another bad thing about the movie: it had too many one-liners like ""...Kill 'em all"" and ""Semper Fi, Mother******"". They also could've used the intro from the game where the text is on the screen that talks about the UAC's ""unlimited funds"" etc. After feeling as if I needed to dose off, the movie became 'cool' again when it went into first person and the remixed version of the original DOOM's music played.

793,clintcaddell,I don't know why this movie's rating is so low. It was great.....,10,24 October 2005,I have played doom since it's first release on the IBM Dos PC. I have completed all of the games except for the last release. I'm very familiar with the concept of the game. I believe this movie stayed true to the original concept and was very entertaining. The special effects were top notch and the acting was believable. Many viewers/reviewers expect this movie to be a condensed version of the latest Doom release. I can see that this movie may be the first part of a trilogy. The writers put in as much action as they could for a movie of its length and still allow for character development. To complete the entire Doom game takes days or weeks or months. Try to squeeze that into 2 hours. In the game the Corporation created weapons systems i.e. the BFG... did research of all types. Hence all of the labs you move through while playing. The comment that I have heard over and over is the monsters are supposed to be from Hell. The twist that the writers chose appears to be similar to the premise in Resident Evil. Except that the scientists on Mars did not create the mutation gene they found it. Hmmm.. I wonder where the Martians got the idea? The writers can very easily turn this storyline more toward the Hell premise in the second installment if they choose to do so. The race of people found in the excavations on Mars were very nebulous and can be fleshed out. Lots of room for back story and discovery. We all can expect (from the game) that the Corporation will take these experiments further in the sequel. And these further installments can include experiments on other things they turn up. Like portals to the Nether world. Which may be there already. We just got a quick glimpse of the Mars facility much more could be out there. As of my writing this movie has topped the weekend Box Office and made 16 million. True it has not grossed nearly as much as any of the Star Wars films nor would I expect to during the Fall Halloween season. It's not that type of movie. I believe the Rock played his character well. And was very believable. The twist at the end was very unexpected and was a welcome change. I think this movie stayed true to the concept of Doom and fleshed the premise in several ways that would allow for more sequels and more fun.,Doom

It was kind of boring for the first half of the movie and I personally got impatient, wanting more action to occur, but overall it seems to stick to the storyline of the game, which is rare.-SPOILER- I Especially liked it when Grimm (Karl Urban) goes superhuman because of c24 and everything went FPS.

Simply because your are experiencing the events yourself as another character,and are seeing things through there eyes.In short,the mindless shooting,weak story,and lame wit-less jokes did'nt do it for me.I think this movie is for Die-Hard Doom fans and the teens who just played Doom3.",Doom
796,zerothegreat,A Cliché'd Butchering of the Licence,1,24 October 2005,"I am a very big Doom fan, and with this script, the world's greatest acting could not have saved this movie. Just about the only thing this movie has in common with the amazing Doom series is the name. They make it into some stupid story involving chromosomes instead of a portal being open to hell. The ""Hell Knights"" are not actually from Hell, but are rather just genetic mutations, and the only other monster in the game is an odd interpretation of the pinky demon. The BFG looks and fires nothing like either incarnations of the weapon. Instead of a single marine, it's a whole team. They even include a martial arts fighting seen. Yep, you heard me.Aside from having nothing to do with Doom, this movie is sub-par anyway. The acting is over-dramatic and stupid, they try to get you to like or dislike certain characters but you don't care more than ""oh, that stinks."" They throw in a sappy brother sister thing. The plot as purely stand alone hardly makes sense and even for uneducated people would seem a little crazy. Aside from the ridiculous attempt at a plot and a 4 minute scene of first person action, I have scene everything in this movie before.If you're not a fan of Doom, you will leave feeling indifferent and not really entertained. If you are a fan of Doom, you will leave the theatre so upset I would advise not using any heavy machinery for at least 2 hours.",Doom
797,sternlc,It doesn't get more Doom than this,10,24 October 2005,"An excellent addition to action/horror genre. Also a very nice addition to the Doom Franchise line of stories(told via video games). It was like the game leaped off the computer screen to the Movie screen. Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnsons character stole the movie. Sarge was probably the best written character in the movie. I thought Karl Urban's character (Reaper) could have used a little more... I dunno, more polish I guess. Was more story there that could have been told. Character growth aside More of the First Person action would have been nice a bit earlier in the movie but I see what the Director was trying to accomplish. I.E. blend standard movie action scenes with that of a First Person Shooter video game. Most audiences not familiar with the 'FPS' perspective may have found a longer FPS sequence tiring. Us that are gamers ate it up and wanted more. Alas Doom is Doom, an action/horror film first, story second. All and all I think iD Software should be proud to add this to its collection of stories.",Doom
798,Shalom_Aloni,Amazing game to film adaption !,3,24 October 2005,"The movie is just amazing !I went with low expectations because the trend was that every game to film adaption just sucked. Man, i was so happy that i was proved wrong. I loved DOOM-DOOM3 , and i played it non-stop and it wasn't accepted for me to corrupt this amazing brand. I wished they have make the film's story precisely as the games was, but i think it really would not work in the cinema. I just wanted more action and more monsters from the game but i think DOOM2 will do that :)If you forgive the film about these two little things you are going for a great ride filled with blood and gore. The story was in fact very clear and interesting for me. The rock and karl urban did a great job in the acting. The pacing of the movie was just like the game had -loved it. The visual-FX were also great and loved them.The First Person Shooter from Reapers P.O.V was the most amazing thing i saw in a film lately. (after the comics look in sin-city). i can't understand how it wasn't done before !!! I don't want to give everything away but i wish it was more then mere five minute sequence. The fight with the pinky demon with the chain saw and the fear from him being so close on you brings all the terror from the DOOM game to life. AMAZING. This is a must see.Even if you don't like ci-fi, go see it for it's action. by itself it's an amazing action film.BEST GAME TO FILM ADEPTION EVER - WAITING FOR DOOM 2 !Go see it now. My score : 10 .",Doom
799,UlaireToldea,How do you screw up the plot of a game with a sucky plot???,1,24 October 2005,"Alright, like everyone else here probably, I only went to see the movie because I love the DOOM series of video games. I'm glad that it stopped halfway through in the theatre because at least i get a free ticket out of it. This is by far one of the most pathetic movies I have ever seen, and I've seen both sequels to The Matrix. Yeah, this movie is that bad. First of all, how do you screw up the plot of a game that already has a horrible plot?? There's no hell involved whatsoever in this movie. Woever had the brilliant idea of making a chromosome responsible for mutating humans into imps obviously never played the games. Imps were always demons from hell, never mutated humans. I also hated the little neck-sucking attack they had as opposed to... what was it in the game again?... oh yeah, FIREBALLS. The acting is probably the worst I've seen in a new movie in years. It was sad to see Karl Urban go from a film like Lord of the Rings to this. The Rock has never been a good actor (even when he's wrestling) and this movie doesn't redeem him at all. The BFG... sad. It doesn't even remotely look like the gun in the original DOOM or DOOM III, nor does it have the same effect when fired. *sigh* So, the plot, the enemies, and the weapons are all screwed up. Oh wait, that's everything there is to a first-person-shooter. Was it scary? Not remotely. My friends and I were laughing out loud during the ""scary"" and ""dramatic"" portions of the film. This movie was a complete waste of money. Disregard my 1 out of 10 rating because it can't go any lower, 0 out of 10 stars, hands down. I'm going back to the game to get the nasty memories of this movie out of my mind.",Doom
800,challwor,Doom movie was a tribute to fans of the game,9,25 October 2005,"The best video game to movie transition. This movie managed to be creative, suspenseful and stick true to the game in most aspects. I was expecting a movie quickly put together, sharing little with the game or what made the games fun. In my opinion the opposite was true. I don't think any movie can ever compare to great sci-fi / horror movies like Aliens, and Predator, which a lot of people are comparing to DOOM. I think people are developing such high standards for movies that movies that are fun, not perfect, or 120 million dollar blockbusters, just wont due anymore and don't get the credit they deserve. If you have played DOOM this movie will be a lot more fun for you, it was for me.",Doom
801,slickshoos,Better than expected for being a video game movie,7,24 October 2005,"Paying to watch a video game based movie is always sketchy. I was wary of going to watch another one after being disappointed so many times. Also I am a big fan of the original Doom game released by iD so many years ago. The producers went away from demons invading Mars colony, to some flawed scientific explanation for the monsters. Any fool who has taken college level Genetics will laugh at that. The cast worked well together, and characters were creative. The script was not the best written, but more than I expected. I have 5 years Army service, and I was surprised how realistic the marine tactics were. Plot twists, and scary moments seem to overshadow some of the bad aspects of the film. I would suggest anyone who has played the games to give the movie a try.",Doom

It followed the games story decently and it had good action in it. In violence, it was moderate. I liked the story, it moved very quickly. Actually too quickly. I was in and out of the movie quickly but got a good experience. I personally can't stand slow moving movies. They are too long and they get boring very easily. I really can't see why anyone thought it was bad. I thought the Rock did an bad job. I hated his role and I hate his acting. I'm glad he was only the star of the movie, not the main character. He used the ""F word"" too much and it got old quick. He was getting to predictable. Deystroyer, the battle where he died was a good part. Also, the first person view part was the absolute coolest part I have seen in any action movie. I believe this movie deserves more credit than it actually gets.",Doom
803,cdude93,I liked this movie better the first time I saw it...,2,24 October 2005,"... when it was called Resident Evil.This was a pretty shameful attempt to capitalize on the popularity of the game, nothing more. Bearing little to no similarity to any of the games, pretty much every aspect of this movie screams that they took a generic ""bug hunt"" script and tried to slap a Doom paint job on it.Honestly, when I can go watch the cut scenes from the game and get better acting, plot, and substance, the movie makers have some SERIOUS issues.I was also quite disappointed in the Rock, who I really like, but stunk it up for the most part...and just a quick, petty gripe- I know these guys are supposed to be elite and all(despite bringing along seedy drug pushers and semi-retarded kids), but can just ONE of these movies take a cue from Aliens and try to make their soldiers look, well, like SOLDIERS?? Apparently soldiers in the future don't need helmets.*sigh* This one definitely COULD have been really cool.",Doom

I think they did a very good job on the movie although they shouldn't have put so much bad language in it, there wasn't any need for most of it.Karl Urban and Dwayne Johnson did a really good job on the acting.

Even the good ones usually just get a smile and nod from me....until I watched Doom. Now I am by no means a big fan of the game I think I can count on one hand the times I've played it. So when I went to watch it I was just going to watch just another action movie. But it was the best damn movie I've ever seen. Seriously it was so cool, and funny as hell and the action was so intense. And not to mention it was nice to see a movie where people getting attacked actually put up a fight and don't just die easy. I can't think of anything I would change about this movie so I am giving it a 10.

I'm also a huge fan of the newest release, ""Doom 3"". Now....I'm going to say, on behalf of most Doom fans, that we've been waiting for this moment for at least a decade. Failure! Absolute failure. This film is nothing, but Resident Evil 3 and I'm not sorry to say that it stunk as an example of what Doom really is. ""An invasion from Hell!!"" The only mention of Hell was their ridiculous vision of the ""24th"" chromosome. ""If your a person with a good soul, then you turn into a super human. If your a person with an evil should, then you turn into a monster. I give this movie a vote of 1 (awful) because Hollywood thought they knew what we ""really"" wanted and they were wrong.

808,DLH_interface,Sad...,5,25 October 2005,"Well, where should I start. Chronologically sounds great...The beginning was decent - quick to the beginning and the story behind Grimm and co. However, their suits reminded me more of S.W.A.T., and not a Space marine from the game. No one did too bad with their character, but it was more 'over the top' so to speak - they were trying too hard with the 'crazy' look, and how in the hell would someone like ""The Kid"" end up as a friggin space marine??? The Rock was better in The Rundown in terms of an action movie, but for playing a villain, he didn't do too bad.Genetics - how much more Resident Evil can you get?? Aside from the 3 demons they used from the game, and how cute it was they kept 'Pinky' in the script, its not much more than a rip off of Resident Evil and your money. I had more fun getting the Gamboy DS from a vending machine than watching the action. The Hellknight fight scene was a great scene - I give them that, but where's the green balls those things hover at you?? Oh I forgot, the movie is not about going to Hell. I guess Universal didn't want a NC-MORAL MAJORITY rating. Hence, they lost their fan base.I did like the encorporations of 'God Mode' and 'Deathmatch'. 'God Mode' in which he's injected with the C24, fights Pinky, gets his ass whooped, and lives. 'Deathmatch' as in Grimm VS Sarge, and how Sarge kept his human form until the end of the fight - nice touch. What would have been better? A little bit more delicacy to the 1st Person Perspective, and maybe a little longer - MASH did a great job with 'Point Of View' (Season 7). Maybe the production staff should have watched how great actors and directors did it. And they should have went back to 1st Person during the death-match - that would have gotten me all tingly from what was left of my boredom. One thing I did catch on, and loved, was the cover of the theme from the very first level of the very first Doom game - coming from a musician, that was sweet. And The Rock - not bad for his first villain role. ""SEMPER FI, MOTHER F...ER!!"" - ha ha, he made a funny.I also appreciate the fact that they used less Computer-Graphically-Enhanced features than most movies these days. It would have been impossible to do without it for Pinky, but I appreciate it. I think all directors and producers should start going old-skool with their production. Compare 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' and 'Terminator 3', and you tell me whats a better movie. Cowabunga, bitch.The movie, as bad as they butchered the true story, not bad. But as a hardcore fan, it can 'go to hell'. Semper Fi that, mo fo.",Doom
809,pyro-22,Worst then expected,2,25 October 2005,"I gave this movie 2 because of two reasons: first - BFG effect was created very good (same goes to some other doom3 elements). second - at least they tried.Acting is bad, dialog's are even worse.For gods sake it's not an comedy - it's supposed to be at least as good as good was doom3.Did I tell that this movie didn't include gate to hell? Well - it doesn't. What about genetic mutations? I didn't notice them in game.This movie was cheap remake of resident evil (like deep evil).If they asked some doom fan to write the script, then it wouldn't include some really stupid bugs about doom. like the one about some weird space travel after which you must throw up, or one about stupid/too smart space marines, or one about genetic mutations, or the most funny one - nano-hi-tech-whatever-wall - wtf is that?",Doom

Complete waste of time.I first saw the billboards whilst sitting in LA county traffic one Sunday morning (yes, LA has traffic all the time, day or night, but I digress). I thought to myself, ""Hmm, so a movie about Doom. This could be either really good, or really bad."" After having played the game ten or so years ago, I considered the possibility of someone making a movie in the game-wise first-person-shooter format. Yeah, you heard me right, portions of this movie show people hacking through the (obviously CGI) daemons with a chainsaw -- just like it would be shown in the video game.Really, don't waste your money.

811,khasenoehrl,space marines kill things,8,31 October 2005,"Personally I liked the movie for the most part. For an action movie I think it did a pretty good job but with a basis for the game it did an amazingly poor job. The first person view that got all the hype was comical in my opinion, the end fight disappointed me. But if you liked aliens I think you'll probably like Doom. In my opinion The Rock did a very good job of playing the commanding officer with only the mission in mind, he also did a good job of being a bloodthirsty dude which was pretty cool. Some people I have spoken with said they liked the movie for its more violent elements, but I think on the whole the story did a better job of it and had they stuck to the game's version of the story it would have been way better.

812,IMDBwillBlock,Painfully Disappointing,2,26 October 2005,"This film can be viewed fro 2 separate perspectives. From that of a Doom video game fan, and from that of a casual movie-goer. Both will be disappointed.I entered Doom on opening night (with the help of a older friends ID) and was not expecting a lot. From what I had read prior, I was certain that this was the most accurate video game to film adaptation created and was sure to please Doom fans (of which I am). Did I ever hear wrong.From the perspective of a Doom fan, this movie COMPLETELY trashes any major story elements from the game, and what we're left with is a few blatant purely visual snippets from the game (ie: Mars, Sarge, BFG, Pinky, etc.) Why do directors/Writers think such alterations are necessary. Where's Hell? come on. How can they go to the press and say ""Im sure this movie will satisfy fans of the game."" Are you joking? How could fans be satisfied if all they get is a rehash of what they are expecting. Terrible.Outside of the fact that this film is entirely unfaithful to the game, it is simply Just a Terrible Movie. People expecting a fast, mindless run-n-gun Schwarzenegger flick can spend the first half of the movie wondering where their $10 went. The exposition in this film is so drawn out and pointless. Used entirely for cheap Doom references and painful one-liners. The introduced characters are clichés (as expected), but they are brought to a new low in this film with some of the worst dialogue and writing ever conceived. The main character(s) have a troubling backstory dealing with their parents that is built up in several sense with the sounds of children screaming. By the end of the film you may scratch your head wondering why they completely forgot to conclude this. It's almost a joke. Maybe they thought we wouldn't care after we had been enlightened by the FPS (First Person Shooter) segment of the film. This again is an over-hyped joke. It's essentially an unfun version of House of the Dead. This is of course then followed by the great showdown between the main characters. Let's just say I don't remember any wire-fu in Doom. Poor wire-fu at that.Alongside all of this, continuity errors are rampant, the 'eff' word is used so excessively in one seen which actually brought me to laughter (not unlike many other moments in this film), and never have special effects looked sadder. You may as well be able to see the zipper on the rubber suit. Other issues such as the fact that this is unarguably like the Alien films, and how, and I quote, ""they look more like office workers playing a game of paint ball than trained space marines"", make this possibly the worst video game to movie attempt. This is also of course easily the worst movie of the fall, if not of the year.For all those out there too young or un-resourceful to have failed at seeing this movie, consider yourselves lucky.",Doom
813,znewatcher,Doom movie review (May contain spoilers!),8,26 October 2005,"I began playing Doom II in 1994 at a community college LAN in 4v4 player mode in between classes. I was hooked on the First-Person-Shooter gaming genre immediately and have been a faithful fan of the Doom and Quake series since then.When I went to see this movie, I walked into the theater with an open mind and cleared all thoughts of what I would see in comparison to having played Castle Wolfenstein, Doom, Doom II, Quake, Quake 2, Quake 3 Arena, Return to Castle Wolfenstein, Doom III and Quake 4. I knew beforehand that the writers for this film were not going to follow the storyline of the Doom series, in that they felt that ""Hell"" wouldn't ""Sell."" I disagree with that, but...eh....whatever.I can tell you this: I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed sitting amongst other hard-core gaming enthusiasts laughing at the crude jokes and references to the game. Yeah, it's a gore-filled knock-down-drag-out-slug-a-thon, but so were the original Doom series of games.Although some of the plot was indeed lame, and certainly you knew what to expect at certain times, when the movie began really picking up speed with the marines searching for the infected scientists (Zombies, Imps, Hell Knights, etc) and being summarily removed from the plot, that's when i started to really enjoy the movie.About halfway through, I gave the movie a 4 because it was so predictable. The ending is what threw me and doubled that score.*POTENTIAL SPOILERS BELOW* The director and cinematographer obviously knew that many gamers out there wouldn't be happy with the movie not using the core Game concept of creatures escaping from Hell. Because of that, I think they intentionally did something else: the First-Person camera shots with John Grimm gunning down monsters and walking through hallways and doors. Also, the fight scene with the Pinky Demon and John Grimm using the chainsaw was also a nice touch to reference the chainsaws in the Doom series. Finally, the super-slow motion animation during the fight with the pinky demon is a tip-of-the-hat to low Frames Per Second gamers get on their computers while playing a game. In these few minutes of time, I felt like the people that made this movie went their own direction but never strayed from what the game was really about.Lastly, the fight sequence between Sarge and John Grimm was not only pretty good, it was also a homage to Deathmatching 1v1 in the Doom games, which is the favorite part of the FPS genre for most gaming enthusiasts.Of course, I laughed when I saw the BFG Sarge picked up and he only had one round left for the final showdown with Grimm. That was typical of running low on ammo in games and being shredded because of it.Overall, 8/10. Definitely worth seeing if you are a gamer, and if you want to see it as a scary flick with a girlfriend of best friend - hey, you'll get your moneys' worth out of it if you take time to enjoy it.",Doom

As a sci-fi space soldier blow stuff up movie it was pretty good. but as the Movie ""Doom"" it was an Utter Disaster.. and frankly a Waste of my $9.50 ... next time you go to make a movie Based on something, you Really Should consider Actually Following the Storyline / Plot of what your making the movie about. all that hype and not 1 damn demon, what an utter shame, .. someone should get Fired... twice",Doom

The Rock and Karl Urban played very good roles, and the first-person view scene after Reaper re-awakens was a very awesome effect, one I have never seen in a movie before. It made you feel like you were actually in the movie, or playing Doom. Sure, it wasn't closely based on the game, but as I stated earlier, overall it was a very good movie, with some edge of the seat moments. The action was intense at times, the plot was pretty good, especially for a game-based movie, and there sure were a lot of twists and turns.

The only thing remotely interesting about this movie was the brief section at the end shot in first person like in the games.

I swear the director tried so hard to make this movie exactly for what it is, and he hit it on the button! I am actually impressed with the movie so much I'm going to watch it again tonight for the third time.Aside from from its sheer humor value there are elements of the film that I really did enjoy (states my movie snob), Sarges characterization (not acting) for instance was actually pretty cool. Maybe Lucas could take a few footnotes on how to make some one fall, unlike the B.S. of the third Starwars.In short, The film was horribly awesome and it was exactly what it tried to be.

I had fun watching it with my three nephews. I am not saying that it is a kids movie but if you are a fan of the video game then go see this movie. At first I was kind of searching for some likeness of the game and it definitely had some key features from it, but I also had to remember that many movies from video games stray from the original idea, which isn't always a good thing. An example is x-men. but in all fairness they did what they could with what they had. If you have played the game you knew which monsters were which and who sarge was. I really like the twist to the movie and a few other aspects toward the end was really cool. I recommend seeing this movie if you want something fun and scary at the sometime.

819,swollen_vain,Doom or Doomed?,5,13 November 2005,"I asked a five word question after I sat through Doom. ""How do you F**k that up?"" The premise of the entire Doom game franchise is based on a simple idea: The bad guys are from Hell. We are talking about one the top five video game franchises... EVER! How do you f**k that up? Simple.If you can get passed the ""no hell breaking loose at all"" bit you will find that Doom really is just a simple zombie movie with bad supporting characters surrounding leads who are trying their best to prevent the ship from sinking.Speaking of the leads; Karl Urban gives us a decent performance. Even though he is playing a character who is 3D in the game, on the page and the screen the character is in fact 2D. Now i'm a big fan of The Rock, right back into his days with WWE. Even The Rock had a tough time convincing me that this was going to stand up to any standard the game had set. With that said he does do a good job playing the 2D ""Sarge"" spitting lines like ""I didn't see s**t, and I don't get paid to see s**t"" Trying to make the most of dialog like that you can tell why this films Box Office receipts dropped off after the first two weeks.Overall by taking away the ""Hell"" element from the story you have taken away a major selling point and fan boys will never forgive you.

If you just want a movie to see on a Friday night with some action, go for it. If your looking for a in depth rich story lined sci fi action combined film, go rent aliens.. The movie is great.

I was entirely satisfied. :)Action: Check Karl: Check Hellfire and Demons running amock: Hmm, what happened to that whole concept?... Guns: Check Blood and guts: Check Death: Check Mars: Check, though you didn't get to see much of it...Approved by: MeI never actually played the video games, and probably never will, but I like the movie and would def see it again. Although, I must admit, I was expecting it to be about a portal to Hell they found on Mars in which a bunch of Demons were released. Instead it was a portal they found somewhere deep underground in Nevada to Mars. They used the portal to build a science lab on Mars. Why? I dunno...The demons were instead mutated scientists and animals who attacked everyone and shot their tounges out to infect others. But, whatever...It was still kickass and I thoroughly enjoyed the slaugther fest. Kudos.",Doom
822,murcott-1,Very Good Movie,8,30 October 2005,I have just realized but i am one of the few people in the world who thought that the movie was cool and should win a couple of Oscars. You probably think i'm mad but there are lots of reasons that people don't seem to realize about the film. 1. The Rock was a brilliant actor along with that guy who plays John Grimm. 2. It had an eerie sense and. 3. the BFG The start scene is really cool with a bunch of scientists running from an unseen evil thing 1 scientist makes it in along with the arm from another scientist. We don't see that scientist again in the film but her arm makes a reappearance in a small non speaking role. In closing this is a good film and people shoud not listen to what they read in the papers or see on TV. Go and see it the BFG is really cool,Doom
823,Specter_14,"Not quite what I expected, but still a good movie",10,31 October 2005,"When I went to go see Doom I was expecting to see a movie with basically no storyline at all and just 2 hours of pure shooting and tons of action. Well, it wasn't exactly that. They tried throwing in a bit of a storyline, and I think they may have overdid it a bit since a lot more of the movie was talking and explaining the plot than action. The storyline was alright, they did change the demons coming from Hell thing like in the game to a virus type thing like resident evil which mutated the scientist at the research place on Mars. The most action in the first 3/4 of the movie was mostly just one monster sneaking around, then jumping out and killing a marine, then they shoot at it, lose it, and talk about what is happening for about 30 minutes. This I didn't mind too much though, because it is interesting enough to keep your attention. The one thing I think saved the hell out of this movie was the ending for sure though. The ending was one of the best I've seen. Near the end you get to see the main character, John ""Reaper"" Grimm go through the facility in first person mode like in the game and blow the crap out of the monsters there. This seriously was an amazing scene, and it follows an amazing fight between the super human John Grimm and The Rock. I think that if they didn't have this good of an ending the movie would have been a 6, maybe 5. So, overall I think this is a fun movie to watch. Don't expect an academy award winner or anything, but for video game fans I think this is a pretty cool movie. I'd relate it more to Resident Evil or Alien Versus Predator in terms of how good it was. I suggest seeing it at the theater, you need to see that first person segment on the big screen, and it might be worth buying when it comes out if you like this sort of thing.",Doom
824,tobias-ljungstrom,The best video game movie so far.,8,31 October 2005,"When you think Doom you don't think plot. You don't think touching story lines and clever scripting. You don't think about dialog. You think about monsters, blood, adrenaline, action, shooting, explosions, cyberdemons and the Big F***ing Gun. And in this movie, it's all delivered to you.Encountering evil on mars is as good as ever. Though to make the movie watchable there is now a team of soldiers instead of a single marine, which gives a different feel of course. This is not necessarily negative, but you wonder how a film would be if there was almost only one guy in it. Along with the monsters of course. The movie doesn't get involved in too much feelings and relations, other than rather basic and simple situations, which helps enforce the ""mindless action"" since you don't really have to think that much.There are also many lovely special effects in this movie. The classic ""window-teleporters"" from quake, here called nano walls, work nice, as does the BFG and the gory monsters. But the best part is when the whole movie turns into an actual First Person Shooter, only looking so much more realistic.",Doom
825,dleemaas,This should have been called THE ROCK: THE NEXT MOVIE,2,31 October 2005,"Anyone who has actually made it to this comment simply needs reinforcement of the fact that this was a complete travesty.They took a scant few of the concepts from the DOOM 3 video game (which was fairly different than it's predecessors to begin with), slapped them into a storyline which seems as if a bunch of a----les sat around in a room trying to figure out just how much they could change the story of DOOM and still call this abomination by the same name, then to add insult to injury, slapped The Rock in as the character who is supposed to be the LONE MAN kicking a-- in Hell, then have him get taken by what else but a bunch of zombies (not even Imps), then he turns 'evil', but not into a minion of hell, just a 'evil' guy with a BFG, then he and the 'good' guy have a 'battle royale' at the end. This... thing had nothing to do with the video game after which it is named.As soon as I stood from my seat as the credits started rolling, I tried to forget that this movie existed; however, it was such a punch in the face that I haven't quite forgotten. The only reason that I decided to give it two stars instead of one was because of the slightly amusing first person segment toward the end before the ghastly car wreck that was the ending. They could have made two hours worth of first person action, and it would have far better than this pile of turd.This comment is not necessarily meant to inform those who haven't seen it what the movie is about; but merely to let readers know that anyone who gives this movie a thumbs up just has their lips stuck inside the rectums of people who produce movies. The success rate of the work invested in this by those who made it was less than that of weathermen. At least weathermen get it right every now and again.",Doom
826,martti-roitto,"Good start, bad ending",5,31 October 2005,"Being a huge fan of the game series, I had eagerly waited to see this movie. And, I must say, it's a lot different than what I expected. I always thought the movie would follow the Doom storyline, which it really does not even come close to - this movie is much more Resident Evil than Doom, not in a bad way, though.A bit on the generic side, suspense is well created throughout the film. Everything works fine until that scene, where John awakens after being injected with chromosome 24. I don't want to sound harsh, but what on Mars were the directors thinking? A first-person shoot'em up scene... on a movie? I felt like I was watching a very, very bad demo run of the game, Doom III, full of clichés! After almost screaming ""NOOOO!"", I decided to bury my face in my hands and try to cope with it. This worked fine for a minute.And then came the superhuman/supermonster fight scene. This time I felt like I was watching The Matrix or Spider-Man! My reactions were the same as in the last scene. And then came the ending, which was a great relief after these painstaking moments of movie directing horror. How can someone as talented as the director of the first three quarters of this movie manage to botch and ending this badly? It'll be a cold night in Hell before I watch this movie again. And even then I'll be skipping that FPS scene.",Doom
827,john-timney,Perhaps the worst film I've seen for ages,1,1 November 2005,"I have to wonder if the director thinks that the people viewing this movie are just plain thick? I cannot understand how Bartkowiak, who to his credit has some fairly decent movies though that this was worthy of being released, rather than being left on the cutting room floor.The plot is so poorly related to the game someone must have just made most of it up over a quick coffee one afternoon - after a bad nights heavy drinking. There is however one crucially bad, extremely bad, poor, awful, horrible scene which relegates into the depths of films as bad as Barbed Wire and Gigli with its ridiculous attempt to make it appear like your in the game for a few minutes, viewing the action from a first person perspective. It could be the worst set of movie frames ever put into a movie by any director ever and without a doubt spoiled what would up until then have been descibed as a mediocre movie, with some fairly well executed yet very short action scenes, and lots of running through poorly lit rooms - worth watching if its raining, or your dogs ill and you have to watch him for the afternoon.So - does it have any good points. Well - The Rock, who has tried in the past to put in a decent role, gets no chance here with the plot being so poor and if he can act, the lines he has would suit an audience of about the age of 10 to 12. However, its an R rated movie clearly aimed at adults. Unfortunately, the other actors had equally poor lines and the whole dialogue comes over as unintentionally humorous or just plain odd with a spattering of serious attempts at acting in between.Special effects - OK, make up, that was OK. Explosions and guns - well they were alright, lots of dark scenes as expected, lots of running and some coolish monsters that you never really got a good look at.The film has the right name at least because I think that probably matches its prospects of being a hit - DOOMed. Stay home and wash the dishes instead - you'll have a more productive afternoon.",Doom
828,ecantarell,I'm a fan of the game and thought the movie was great fun.,8,1 November 2005,"Contrary to some of the other comments, I thought there was nothing surprising by how the various characters ""exited"" the movie. The graphics & effects were fairly standard but still nicely done. Story line was thin/simple and details were often quite unscientific, but this wasn't supposed to be a epic film - it was supposed to be fun, and maybe stimulate the 1st person perspective video game market. Could have used a few more different monsters and twists to how you stopped them(like in the game); although, that would have been contrary to the storyline(unlike the game, which really doesn't have a storyline, just a starting premise.) I thought there was no problem with the actor selections - all filled a role in the storyline. Like a real military unit - different people there for different reasons. First thing I did when I got home was fired up Doom II and put 3.5 hours in at killing zombies and monsters.YAHHH!",Doom
829,Karbunkle,Doom fans need not waste their time.,1,1 November 2005,"I agree with MxSChizo if you look at other game to film adaptations they tend to follow the core plot from the game this movie does not. If you have never played the Doom video games before and have no idea what it's about you will mostly likely rate it higher (4-6stars maybe). The Rock fans may not be happy with lots of hard stairs and emotionless facial expressions like normal but pretty much none of backward tongue and cheek comedy that his had with previous roles which make him likable. All the actors play fairly weak roles as there was no real depth to the characters, there was potential the Grimm siblings (played by Karl Urban and Rosamund Pike) but I was left wanting to know more. All in all to me it seemed like after the first 10 minutes the rest was filler till the last 15-20 minutes.It becomes obvious that no thought or regard was there for the original story (from the game(s)) or fans and that it was more or less not worth making other then to cash in on a legendary name using an inferior product.",Doom
830,csantanad,Doom got Dunked,1,2 November 2005,"Whoever has played the game in its latest installment will simply be gob smacked to see what Andrzej Bartowiak has done with it.If by watching this movie (after even having read the back cover of the game or having gotten any comments from friends) you expect;Massive alien gore ridden combats. Multitude of generous top of the art or improvised weaponry. Unraveling corporate cover ups and heartless scientific corruption. A masterful visual representation of how the ""gates of hell"" can exist and are manipulated. Myriads of fascinating looking and original aliens/creatures/zombies.Forget it, none of that is in this movie nor does it come close.With no respect to the most basic and underlying concepts of what makes the doom cult, the total lack of anything Doom (except for a 5 minutes sequence were the game is poorly emulated in its first person shoot em up perspective and the presence in the movie of 2 types from the dozen or so in game foes ), this incredibly dull movie does not bear the slightest resemblance with the rich, deep, well though out storyline found in the playable version of Doom, I would go so far as to say that some of the animation that builds up on the story has better acting material than the actual movie.The tag line ""hell breaks loose"" could easily be changed to ""We' ve had a little mishap"" without generating any conflicts of concept with the movie's content.Not only is it devoid of any real connection to its namesake, but as a movie per se Doom lacks key action movie components and is so riddled with flaws that had it been called ""ramshackle in mars"" it would still have been simply awful.Although they are supposed to be in an enclave of sorts, the feeling you get is that they don't go further than a couple of corridors away, the whole thing could have taken place in a hotel lobby.Put another way, played in a dark room with good sound, the game made me jump right off my seat more than once, the movie made me push the light button on my wristwatch more than once.I can only wonder what happened to the people of Id Software, makers of the cult game, because I am really starting to believe they must be locked up in a basement incapable of stopping this utterly senseless butchery on their hard work.WARNING TO ALL DOOM CULT FOLLOWERS: Avoid this movie at any cost. Wait for John Carmack to publicly apologize in some way or the other for this movieThis is a waste of celluloid and an insult to the cult fans. This movie shouldn't have been called Doom, period.",Doom

The best way to put it is the guys at dark castle productions should of grabbed this and ran they would of kept it real and then some. Dark castle are the pros of original horror right there with Steven king woes craven and any other scary Mithra. Well thats all stay scary baby!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Doom
832,Allanslavin,Average but with future potential,5,4 November 2005,"Basically after reading ""SnakeEclipse"" comment it summed up everything perfectly about the movie. Actually not being a doom fan maybe help you enjoy MOST of the film a little better due to the plot. However the 5 minutes of 1st person shooting really adds enjoyment if your a doom fan, certainly did when the guy fought Pinky.To snake Eclipse, I would like to hope that this is the first of a few other doom movies (haven't checked.) I personally thought if it is the first of a few then they did start with a fair amount of enemies. If not, shame on the movie creators. As adding a lot of enemies to the first movie would only spoil the 2nd movie. There being very little choice for new enemies. (As lets just face it, we'll never get EVERY demon successfully made)It was good that it wasn't one of those movies where a monster is running around chasing everyone and nobody can kill it, aka ""Alien Vs Predator."" The whole survival method worked nicely for the film and if a second is to be made all I'd ask for is to do the same. Maybe even add a few barricades of resistance fighting off a horde of varied Doom monsters coming at them. (Something I'd really like to see is a fight outside Mars in one of the land rovers with Cacodemons.) BUT, if a really good Doom 2 is to be made they have to get rid of one problem right away. This whole 24 chromosome thing. The dumbest idea ever. There ain't never been anything genetic with doom. They are Demons from hell. (If a film producer see this though its very doubtful and you badly want to shake this idea here is the golden solution now. Other user welcome to add anything extra.) The next doom film, as usual UAC find a way to cover up the accident and start their experiments again. Not with the chromosome 24 crap, but with the creatures themselves. Study them and gain their advanced strength etc. (Also good idea could be, they are successful in making such a formula from the doom creatures. The formula gives the user super strength and fast recovery for short period of time aka ""Berserker."" Could be a good 1st person scene, a human on the formula has to fight his way through, going berserk against the demons.) Anyhow due to risk on earth, they don't do Teleporters anymore from planet to planet, they do ships from Earth to Mars. And its gate type portals this time, not bubbles. Through the digs they discover that the ancient people on the planet actually got their super 24 chromosome power from creating a portal which opened to hell. Taking the demons and making a formula. Course the demons get back at them and the ancient race dies stopping them. However earth does the same, build portals to hell and all your demons can come through. Because a portal is opened this time, there no need for human hosts to make more monsters. (So we can get rid of that stupid idea.) Monsters will Teleport themselves all over the base. And we can also say the portal is the reason why the ""imps"" and ""hellknights"" can fire their energy attacks this time.From my personal point of view that and only that above can create the next doom movie which would be very peeling the fans, sensibly remove the bad ideas and replace with the real good ones. Most of all, the backbone to a good movie. From there I would leave it and you could decide what happens. Oh, finally I'd like to see at least 3 1st person scene in this one. All that not much to ask for a good movie, is it?",Doom
833,Keatep,Brief Assessment,4,5 November 2005,"This movie was a disappointment, even with not expecting a great deal from it in the first place. The movie had decent, though nearly amateur style acting (Of course with the exception of some of the actors giving a comparatively believable performance), weak plot line, terrible lines, and it's only faint redeemer was it's fairly decent special effects. While not a great movie, it wasn't terribly difficult to sit through, and it does snag and maintain your interest. I wouldn't denounce going to see it in theaters, since the special effects are often much more impressive, but those of you who can possibly resist, it may be a good choice to wait and rent.",Doom

There's no punch and inconsistencies in the storyline ( you can watch the movie after the half way and you still doesn't need to know the beginning !), unnecessary dialogs and scenes ( There's plenty of it ), the acting was sucked big time (You watch his movies and think The Rock can act? watch this and you're wrong!

835,skjamog,Amazing... simply amazing.,3,6 November 2005,"One day long ago i picked up a copy of a game called 'Doom', i was just a young boy blasting away at hellish things with all the classic weaponry. when that evolved into what doom 3 was a few years back i was delighted, recognizing all the 'imps' and 'gorrilas' that i could mow down at my fancy in real time 3d *flash and so on*. after reading the rather unknown book series following a character, the one from the game ( i think he held a name like ?'Fly' Taggart? ), i was again pleasantly delighted, it felt as if the doom series, the doom legacy was being treated quite well.i want to know who screwed up...its not like directing a big time golden screen motion picture could really be that hard, especially when you have a story already written up for you, i think the writer may have been the over achieving type as the story i was stuck staring at for 100 agonizing minutes was as far off as you could get... not far off in the theatrical sense, I'm sure plenty of people could understand the cliché plot containing the 'quick fix' of any sci-fi horror action flick, its called a virus... ahem... Doom; A... err. okay,There was a.... GENOME (sounds smart Right??) error? there are, and then... i mean... not... no... zombies... hmmm.and then there was the rock, this didn't up the dialog one bit, okay, a little bit, he was cool in movies like walking tall where situation overturned dialog. so he got some kudo points, and for taking the roll on doom, well, thats pretty cool of him to do but it didn't give the movie any more direction, the first person thing kinda took a lot of the acting material and tossed it aside anyway.one thing i noticed, as an added flaw to the first person perspective thing, the camera seemed to float at times, now i know from experience that its pretty damn near impossible to gracefully glide into combat, nor would it be practical for a marine to glide around corridors and glide into combat, if i was that marine, i would probably request a rugged third person camera, bu I'm just that cool, back down Rocky...Have you ever watched someone play a video game? DOOM the movie, it was like impersonal gaming, not only that, I actually got scared while playing doom 3, Every corner was heavily laden with horrific Zombies and Demons... compared to Doom 3, Even the movies Audio & Visuals are a tad weak.In the end i must say. watch the movie if you want to watch the movie, play the game if you watch the movie, see how much you can get out of the franchise If you want to, personally, i wish i could lett out all the false DOOMatry, but i think i caught the virus, oh golly.Peace out peeps, ~Skjamog",Doom

Then you might really enjoy it.Personally I really liked only about five minutes of this movie, the scene, where you are in doom - first person with the gun in front... But the rest - average. Like in almost every ""thriller""-like movie, the filmmakers tried to include some funny parts, which has only as result the fact that the whole ""doom"" atmosphere is spoiled. At least there's no love-story anywhere. That's a plus. Anyway, turn off your brain and enjoy, that's all I can advice you.",Doom
838,azohaib88,Movie made in a rush..,6,9 November 2005,"Doom movie was not properly thought out well, well reasons could many. But I think so 'Id' Software (makers of DOOM game series) rushed on selling the license. Well its understandable after all they wanted a movie to increase awareness and also they wanted the movie to made quickly so that it is released before the next game sequel (doom 4), I'm sure if the producers and director Andrzej Bartkowiak had more time frame they could made a much more satisfying film. As far I know Id were still looking to sell the license after Doom 3 release (2004, august) and then they finally sold the license and the movie was under planning by December 2004. Then around February 2005 doom movie script was shown to public, and fans were against it and protested. According to what Dave callaham told about the movie was that the movie was not to made exactly like a game because there is a difference between a mindless action shooter game and a movie. He also said, if I'm not mistaken that Doom movie is not going to made to satisfy mindless shooting action but to increase awareness and increase the Doom universe.After all I would like to ask the people who criticize the plot that its not like the game, there is no hell concept. I have played all doom games and trust me hell concept of doom sounded completely unrealistic nonsense, only what was great about the game was gore and action. One must understand a movie cannot be made a GAME and shooter game it may try to provide some nice action but then what would be the purpose of action if the plot is completely unrealistic and senseless. The story of doom was not bad only it lacked proper explanation and depth, again another signs of the movie made in a rush, inclusion of very limited action and monsters also suggest that the movie was made in a rush. If you look at the time given to producers which was less than a year, you will agree that doom needed more time to become a good sci fi action film, either let is be time or let it be the finance to act as a catalyst in production.In the end i would rate the film 6/10, it certainly is not bad when you consider is as a movie and the fact the movie was made in a rush.Forgive any inaccuracies in grammar or in my comments.",Doom
839,razlanmanjaji,Not For Non-Gamers Like Me,4,11 November 2005,"It was sometime after work. I was tired, lugging around my laptop and eager to go home. The train ride home was unusually bumpy and jerky. The guys were pretty enthusiastic. Reluctant to go home but not sure what to do.Eventually decided to watch a movie at Bishan. And because of the timing that we had, Doom was the only choice. Ryan told me it is a movie based on an electronic game, somewhat like Resident Evil.I know what is in store. I must be insane to have actually watch it! Doom is a typical story of a corporate science project went wrong. An archaeological dig at an unknown civilization site on Mars have revealed man with the 23rd chromosome - making them unnaturally powerful and fast. The scientists working on the project were on the brink of something something big when disaster strike. The head honcho called Earth for help.Reinforcement was sent in the form of soldiers, headed by Sarge (played by The Rock) with a few key soldiers, notably John Grimm, played by Karl Urban (of Lord of the Rings, the captain of Rohan horse riders). Somehow there is something spreading the (how predictable) underground research facility, making monsters out of some human and killing others.Many scenes of zombies, dark metallic tunnels, gory scenes and pretty lady in white lab coat later, it was a face off between Sarge and John. How come? Well, I better not give away the story here - it was a pretty interesting twist in an otherwise cookie-cutter plot.The movie effects was pretty alright, though I am not in a position to judge since I had my face covered with my fingers for half the movie. The plot was too predictable for someone with the balls to sit back and stare devil in the face like Ryan or Zor to actually enjoy the movie. The monsters (CGI, no doubt) were suspiciously similar to some other movies I have seen. Even the ""undead"" make up was oh-so-familiar.The only saving grace was the remarkable portrayal of Karl Urban as John Grimm. I always thought Karl Urban has the emotion range of a teaspoon like in LOTR, but in this movie he plays a tormented elder brother with a terrible family history, a righteous soldier standing up against his superior for better judgment.The movie also invoke my resentment towards military ""chain of command"". It was all so.... irritating, when someone has to listen to orders just because he is of some big shot of sorts above his soldiers etc. But that is for another post.Overall, worth a shot if you are Doom game player and have nothing better to do with S$7.50 on a weekday night.

And when i saw that it will be a movie on it i thought it will be a very good one.The first part was good, spooky , well made in doom atmosphere but then after they teleported back on earth it became a crap, like a low budget movie. Where the hell is Hell? where are that super monsters ? where are the ocult signs ,whipsers, things that made a super horror atmosphere. They remembered about the thing that a segment of DNA is the segment of soul but only remembered. Where that super weapon Soul Cube and Teleportation thing? The story is stupid, how could the martians,a far developed civilization, died because of monsters they created when humanity didn't? Not even in Doom 3 they were all were exterminated.Anyway is a good action movie, nice effects.But is not really DOOM we all know...And Star Ship Troopers was a better movie, in my opinion.

This movie was just not my cup of tea n hence i can only conclude that the only reason this movie was made was so that someone could spend a Lil money to show that yeah i got one producing credit what have u got...loll or someone just decided to get together some really good talent from all over like the rock from the u.s., Karl Urban from down under and that real hot chic Rosamund Pike(who was the only reason i sat watching that movie as long as i did)from england..and throw it on an hr an 40 minutes of wasted film.",Doom
842,zhugeliang_787,Remake of Doom,7,16 November 2005,"I played Doom 3, had nightmares about it lol I saw the movie the first day it came out, i thought it was the best thing that ever happened to me, but then, i started to play the game again, and i thought that the movie wasn't as good as i first thought it was. They changed around too much of the story-line and the evil critters. I hoped that at least they would have kept the original soundtrack from the game. If the movie was more based on the game, i would probably have given it a 10 out of 10, I just have to wonder why they changed the story-line? Besides, i think that a lot of people think there are too many scary action movies that have to do with humans experimenting on others and having the experiment go wrong ;) I think that if they stuck to the game's version of events, the movie probably would have scared the **** out of A lot more people. But, thats just my opinion, UP WITH DOOM!! ;)",Doom
843,IluvNubCakes,"See it, people who h8 it have played the game",10,23 November 2005,"I am an actual Quake fan, (which is next to doom series both made by the same company ID software) I have played doom3 and stopped after a while because the plot didn't really get me actually into playing the game all it was is killing zombies. I liked the movie even though it was nothing like Doom3. I am not quite sure why everyone is like ""this sucks"" if the movie had any other name it would have a better rating. The only thing they would have to change it to be unlike doom, is rename the rock sarge and take the BFG and finally rename the UAC company.Now, to get on the plus side of the movie would be the way everything fits together. The music, the characters, and a few other things. It was nice to see that the movie didn't over do anything. I was thrilled at how they redid the story line to actually make sense instead of how Doom3 did things. I will say the movie only gets a little dull when they have to explain out the story line (which is like 5min) The first person felt like a thrill ride @ Six Flags. I will say I was kinda angry that non of those zombies are smart. MY best advice is go see Doom if its still out. And Buy Quake 4 if your computer can run it. (Doom3 gets out real fast)",Doom
844,metalshredder,2 Thumbs Up,8,29 November 2005,"I have been with Doom since the beginning, all the way through Doom3, and granted, the movie did not follow the story exactly for the old games, I still thought it was awesome. It does coincide better with Doom3 than the classic games. There were tid-bits of the (old) video game all throughout the movie, you just have to be paying attention, and you'll definitely notice. If they were to follow the entire story exactly, you'd have another LOTR Trilogy on your hands. I would not be a bit surprised if they made more. I give it 2 thumbs up, and anyone who is a fan of the game rather than a movie critic will love it. I definitely plan on buying the DVD.",Doom
845,grwizard,The worst game to film adaptation and complete waste of time,1,1 December 2005,"I saw DOOM yesterday and I'm completely disappointed.There is no connection with the game at all. And who needs another genetic mutation in a movie. This is no DOOM. This is just a little different resident evil movie. And resident evil was a lot better (first part, not the second).Only one scene in a movie is good. And that is a 3D scene, but it is a shame because it lasted only for 3 minutes or so. Everything else is a complete disaster.What else could you expect from a movie that was made in two months.What a shame!",Doom
846,yinksta,A great game turned into a boring film.,5,3 December 2005,"OK. Before I talk about my opinions of the movie id like to tell you about the game.Doom was first released on the 30th of April 1995, and a game like doom was revolutionary, it basically helped catapult first person shooter (p-o-v) games to what they are today.The movie is based on DOOM 3 the video game which to be honest was much more entertaining than the film! Doom 3 is essentially a remake of the original Doom, You play as a nameless, voiceless 22nd-century space marine called by the Union Aerospace Corporation to its Mars research facility plagued by mysterious problems. You'll end up single-handedly fighting back legions of hell spawn using weapons like shotguns, machine guns, and rocket launchers.Yes this does sound like the film and ID software did keep the main theme of the game going, which I thank them for, unlike ""Final Fantasy"" the motion picture. However with in the doom game the foes are liable to strike at any time-often just as you round a corner, grab a much needed power-up, or set foot into a new area. So, while your enemies will appear without notice, and may occasionally startle you as they leap out of the darkness. This gives the game a great sense of suspense and atmosphere which the film in the slightest doesn't poses.Its boring! What should have been a film of action and jaw dropping suspense has turned out to be tiresome and predictable. And again to be honest it truly does follow in the foot steps of ""Resident Evil"" the film, except that the mutating humans aren't effected by a Virus but an extra set of chromosomes which ""chooses"" if you are good (gives you super human powers) or if you are evil ( Turns you into something that resembles a man covered in cat vomit).The first three quarters of the film are boring and many scenes do get repeated twice over, like the constant walking around the labs. ""Start kill something, any thing"" There was more focus on showing the group of marines walking around in the dark than actual story plot, Which I thought would have been a very interesting part of the film to focus on.Director Andrzej Bartkowiak ruined what could have been a great film with no imagination what so ever. Where were the army of monsters bent on killing everything in site? Where was the non-stop suspense and terrify atmosphere to make every one sit on the edge of their seats? Nothing! But not all was bad; there are some ""Good points"" He did make a good choice of actors, the Rock (aka Dwayne Johnson) played very well as the steely, callous villain, shutting down his humanity ""killing"" everything towards the end and Karl Urban known as the Reaper who in the end turned to out be the hero.The actual set used to shoot the film was very impressive, but then again so was Resident Evils! This is just my opinion of the film and the truth is I am such a fan of the game I would still by the DVD anyway.Thank you for reading.",Doom
847,noreapeatofhell,Fantastic!!!,10,3 December 2005,"so, my sister got to see the movie first... she said not to get my hopes up, how not? id been gaming for 10 years and doom was my most played game!!! so anyway, got to see it... amazing. it was so well thought out to me, how the Pinky dude turns into... a Pinky. most of the time i was wondering (at the start) wheres the CG??? its from a video game you idiots! but then i realised it was very good without it! the hell knights wold have looked pretty stupid if they were CG, after all they are human... to an extent...You have to watch this film its the greatest!!!! Even if you haven't played the game, your gonna love this! the hell knights are the best to me too! Lizzy!!!!",Doom
848,justmatt_84,Review,8,4 December 2005,"When Video games are made into films, in all honesty we only like them because we like the games. I mean Resident Evil, Tomb Raider, Street FIghter, Mortal Kombat, Final Fantasy and Doom are all pretty dire films compared to the main stream Hollywood cinema. But then again, that's what they are, main stream Hollywood.Now Doom is different from the normal 'game to film' movies. For a start, it has a clear definition of what genre it wants to be. The beginning sequences are a little hazy and if you loose interest here you'll never take to the film. It seems very far fetched and a little cheesy. However as soon as the narrative picks up it becomes obvious what the film wishes to do.OK first thing, narrative structure. The film throws you into the deep end by immediately needing the audience to have played the games and know where they are or generally have a strong sci-fi movie knowledge. Once the marines are on Mars and the story starts to develop the pace calms down and the film begins to take its time with the audience. Again if you got lost in the beginning it will be very hard to pick it up again. However, watch it a second time if u got lost the first and take your time with the film.The film might actually flow better if you start watching it as soon as the marines reach Mars. However, the film is an action horror and once the introduction is over it keeps tight within the codes and conventions of the genre. It takes its time and draws the audience into the scenes building, not much but enough, suspense to generate shock value and keep you on the edge of your seat.The movie has a strong story, no matter what anyone says. The script is a little poor as the one liners, especially from the Rock, are cheesy however the structure of the script is solid. The films has two narratives, or plots as they are called. The main plot is the Research centre being overrun by alien creatures, or mutations as they are in the film and everyone fending for their lives, fairly straight forward movie plot. The Sub plots are first the relationship between John Reaper and Dr Grimm in which brother and sister are reunited after 10 years and the planet is also where they lost their parents. The other Sub plot is the Sarge and his agenda to follow orders to the brink of his demise. Its structure works well and the only faults i could give it is the cheesy lines that the characters give out and the uncertain beginning sequence.This movie has been made by people who know the genre of the game. This is made apparent through the film by the use of music matched the feel of the game series, feeling a lot like Quake. In the high point of the film there is a segment of the game being in first person. If a little badly edited the scene gives a lot back to the gamers as its detailed enough to do what gamers do. If any first person gamer has not shot at their reflection before then they have never been involved enough in the game. John Grimm does this in the movie and we just get the feeling that 'yea, they know their stuff, well done'.Finally another problem with the script is the cheesy fight scene at the end. Although not a bad scene it just seems a pointless part to the film. The audience already get their adrenaline from the first person part of the movie and the end fight scene seems to have just been added for the part of the audience that have never played the game.Despite the beginning and ending the film knows how it wants to play out. It keeps well to the genres conventions and adds little but welcoming other aspects to the movie. There is some humour and strong character bonding parts. However the film is let down by the Rock, not that he's a bad actor in other things however it always seems that he does not take to the character very well. Thankfully as an audience we sympathise with John Grimm and ultimately root for this character.The movie is not a disappointment if you are not expecting an amazing 5 star Oscar winner. You have to take the film as what it is and to its credit, it is pretty damn good. Even if you take the other films from games as what they are they still leave you feeling a little sour and robbed of 2 hours but you love them anyway. Doom gives you satisfaction as long as you don't follow all the hype and think 'it'll be freaking awesome!' because you always go to the cinema, watch it and think 'wasn't as good as i thought it would be' and so you end up hating it. If you have seen the film once and hated it, watch it again and sit with an open mind and let the film play out, don't fight against it just brush off anything that annoys you because all the annoyance is in the beginning, the film plays very well after that.Its not the best action horror but it is a pretty good one and in my professional opinion its a league above all the other 'game to film' movies.Matt Taylor Nat Dip (BA) Hons",Doom
849,julian_neal,Doom fans- yes! Not Doom fans- maybe. Hate The Rock- no.,8,4 December 2005,"I went to see Doom a few days after it came out in the UK. By all the reviews it was getting (particularly by the great Jonathon Ross) I thought it wouldn't live up to what its supposed to, but being quite the Doom fan that i am, I decided not to abandon my fanatical ways and went to see it. And I will say now, though its been getting a lot of criticism, it really wasn't that bad. Sure The Rock is, well, The Rock, but the film had all the ingredients of what Doom should be; the screeching imps, the pinkys, dark corridors with flashing lights and, of course, actual FPS viewing. Of course some parts of it were a bit neglected, such as the rare mention of Hell and the abrupt ending, but the rest managed to keep me entertained very well.I give it a solid 8 out of 10.",Doom
850,dametona,Bloodbath with no real story,2,30 December 2005,"I was a big fan of the doom games. A shooting game with no great story getting in the way was rather enjoyable. However, that does not apply to movies. Of course ""Doom"" was filled with nice effects and I don't think I even have to mention blood & carnage... But it just isn't enough. The plot is nearly nonexistent, rather boring and stays behind the killing, the characters are similar to each other (maybe with the exception of Pinky) and underdeveloped. Seems like every one of them gets three minutes to show themselves and then they are either thrown out of the screen or just killed.""Doom"" is a movie for those, who want to see good special effects, monsters, soldier boys and slaughter because that is all this movie can offer. For others - I don't recommend.",Doom
851,streamlineracer,Did the writer ever play the game ???,8,6 December 2005,"OK- The Movie was great for what it was. Just another space zombie shot'em up. It's action with the Rock, at it's best. But beyond that...The Name of the movie is Doom, suggesting some correlation with the game. I didn't see much except for one part towards the end when the camera mimicked the first-person shooter perspective. Oh yes, And the BFG, called a BIO Force Gun, but known as something else to the gaming world. Other than that between the story, the characters, even the set design nothing was DOOM.They could have at least used the sound effects from the game.So, if your expecting the Hell-spawned fun of the video game we all know and love. It's not here. What is here is a simple, night-of-the-living dead meets Aliens shoot'em up Action with everyones' favorite ""hero"" the Rock. Some people have have the potential to be evil mutant monsters while others just become super-human, simply by getting bitten (fluid transfer to receive a 24th chromosone)... I missed that part in the game.Doesn't extra chromosones make you retarded or physically and mentally deformed ?The transporters are a REAL BIG DEAL, as in there is only ONE, it takes a huge ordeal for this weird ball of goo to suck you in and spit you out puking on the other side... Missed that part in the game.It's missing a ton of things that could have connected it with the Game, I almost get the impression this movie was ready to be made, 10 minutes from the can, but at the last minute someone decided it would make more money if they tied it to the game so they re-shot one-two scenes and renamed a few things.Again, good for what it is, a movie ""based"" on the game, it is NOT!",Doom
852,robert_dagenhart,Bad Story Line,2,22 December 2005,"This movie didn't live up to name of the original game (1993) and the novel that was published in (1995). Doom has always been about Hell and not some genetic's experiment gone wrong. The setting should have been on the moon's of Mars and not Mars itself. Not scary or demonic enough to be considered Doom. There where only 4 types of creatures also: zombies, imps, and Hell Knight, and one crippled alien that was part wheelchair there should have been more. In my opinion they didn't leave it open for an sequel also. The actors did their jobs pretty good and graphics went well. The Rock did a good role reversal of being the bad guy. If you never played the original game or read the book then you might like it.",Doom
853,pban664,"bit of an Aliens clone, the ending takes it from a great movie to an OK one ..",7,12 December 2005,"We saw this movie over the weekend, I've played each generation of the game so was under no illusion of what to expect. The main parts of the movie feel very much like a bit of a Aliens clone, this is not a bad thing ! This movie would be great but the ending sort of lets it down. It was a good idea, but when the movie moves in to first person ""mode"" the feel and the tempo of the movie dramatically shift and the film looses some of the continuity because of this. I felt that this stopped the movie being a great film, and took it down to an enjoyable one ! Although the idea of first person could have been a good one, and potentially important for the hard core Doom fans, it felt too fast paced and to ""light"" and a little unlike the rest of the movie and to an extent even the games (especially the latest incarnation).",Doom
854,quake53,Good enough to see twice!,7,13 December 2005,"There have been some good adaptations of games into films, Mario Bros was good, Mortal Kombat is watchable and Resident Evil is just *GREAT*, but this is DooM and currently, film-wise, there is this evil trend of some really good ideas in films and having them dumbed down into the dreaded PG-13 certificate to enable a greater audience.So, now, DooM was in production and I was half and half about seeing it. The DooM fan in me wanted to but the film part, having seen other dumbed down travesties, like Street Fighter, was a little dubious. The idea of seeing many of DooMs bestiary being bludgeoned by weapons like the shotgun or sawed in half with the chainsaw or even having the impression of being chased down a darkened corridor by a beastly (and bloody huge) Hell Knight - thanks to the new, and updated, monsters from the DooM 3 game being brought into the film - was just overly exciting.The monsters in the film are VERY nice, since they were done in Stan Winston's Creature Shop and enough CGI has been used, but not overly like most films who seem to go CGI crazy and ruin the feel of the film. There is also the complaint, in current film making, that not enough blood is used in certain films that deserve it, which isn't lacking in the film, thankfully! The films storyline is well written and executed, despite that it isn't the same as the game, which is slightly disappointing but with the way films are nowadays and the constant worry of the executives you really shouldn't complain. There aren't enough shots of Mars itself and the film DID take that away but please remember that this is the films first outing and first trial. There is a sequel planned if the film is successful and thats what sequels are there for. Think about it...more monsters, more FPS style shots and more shots of Mars (like unexplored complexes in Mars).",Doom
855,rodomir,Doom,6,5 January 2006,"I found this movie very amusing, using the PC game plot on certain aspects but not all of it. The main characters performance was good (the Marine role definitely suits The Rock) but I did not like some secondary characters, because they did not look like professional soldiers but mercenaries, and they made irrelevant commentaries or jokes. The movie is quite dark, they had to use their assault rifle lanterns. I mean, in the movie looked like in the future Marines do not have night view gears or something.On the other hands, the special effects were nice, specially the first person view shots. The ""demons"" looked good.Special mention to the powerful sound effects, and the gun fire sounds good (even the punches).I recommend this movie to every fan of Resident Evil saga. An amusing futuristic movie with ugly bugs included.",Doom
856,willer-killer,Play the games instead.,1,28 February 2006,"Let me start by saying that although it was a fun night, this was the worst $10 I have ever spent in my life.Even though this was a pretty terrible movie all around, complete with obvious ""what was that"" moments, ""ohmygod he just got sucked underwater"" moments, and crappy one-liners, I have one question about it that I think soars above all the others, such as ""why would they ruin such an awesome game,"" and ""why the Rock."" Despite the pertinence of such questions, there is one that remains more salient than the last two: WHERE IS HELL?!? Not only did they pick a terrible cast, include a multitude of clichés, and stretch it out for too long, but they butchered the entire premise of the original storyline!Instead of being sent from the bowels of hell to destroy civilization, the demons were explained by some laughable scientific theory. Even the tag-line of, ""All Hell Breaks Loose,"" is highly deceiving. Hell had nothing to do with the story of this worm-embedded piece of horse excrement. They even tried to fool you early on when that Christian guy blasphemes and then cuts a cross into his arm for penance or whatever - and then when he crosses himself before he dies and stuff. They tried to make all the fans of the game excited by bringing a religious component into the story. (This is all early on, so I don't consider it a spoiler). Also, the first person sequence was disappointing and unexplained. I could probably go on for a few paragraphs as if someone was actually reading this, but I'm not gonna give this movie that effort.In short, don't waste your time. It wasn't violent enough to be a decent action movie, wasn't scary enough to be a horror movie, and didn't have enough thickness of plot to qualify as a decent science fiction movie. Even if you're a fan of the game, it's gonna be disappointing. After watching it, you're gonna furiously shove this chunk of solidified vomit into the return slot of your local video store, ashamedly avoiding eye contact with bystanders, and ask yourself, ""why the hell did I bother."" If you actually were coaxed into buying it, run it over several times with your car. Enjoy the sound of the plastic shattering under the wheels.

I'm a pretty heavy PC gamer and really don't give a flying crap as to whether or not the movie portrays the PC game. DOOM was the first PC game I ever played. Now if I was a true nerd, I'd probably say something like, ""I was so upset that they took Hell out of the movie. I mean that is the most important part of DOOM. And... and.... the BFG... it actually had 6 chambers on the cannon not 4 like the movie showed... I mean.. golly.. what were the directors thinking?"" This was a great action movie and your typical movie for guys who like movies. Thumbs up! It was filled with action and funny. Funny? DOOM the PC game is not funny? YES IT IS YOU DORKS!

You've been warned.When I saw this film yesterday, I saw a problem.When the marines got back through the ARC portal they found there was only 58 min left before the lock-down ended, they went looking for survivors and found Pinky, who was promptly taken by the critter.After Reaper was infected with C-24 he went through the base killing everything he saw including the 'Pinky Demon', but when he got to the exit he found there were 2 min left on the clock.According to the video they saw earlier, the mutation took 46 min to start having an visible effect on the human body, yet Pinky could only have been infected for about 50 min.This meant there was no possible way for the virus to have enough time to mutate his body into what he had become.I found this film enjoyable, with a good soundtrack. I do agree that the plot is not even close to the games but if you can look past that flaw, it's a good use of 100 min of downtime.",Doom

I don't think other people consider this film as a horror. More like those American action films based on one those heroic incidents. One hero, one big incident and one evil.

Others like to be loud, or obnoxious, or high. Lucky for them they all have amazing scripts to read from while they battle the evil forces of the 24th chromosome. As this movie discusses chromosomes it's clearly about genetic abnormalities like downs syndrome or kleinfelder's syndrome. Given the greatness of the writing it's clear the entire creative team behind this film had at least the previous, and most likely the latter as well. That would explain the presence of brick and pipe NYC-style sewers in a weapons/science/archeology/demonology research center, on Mars.A lot of people shout and fire weapons at ugly monsters. There are many hilarious things said which would fit in just fine on any stand-up comedy special or in any other generic action movie. Whether intentional or not, this movie gets some great laughs and for that I award it a generous two stars.

So to say the least for anyone hoping for a good storyline remake of the old game Doom, this is a waste of your time. We almost walked out half way through, and only waited that long in hopes they would go through a portal to Hell. It was a respulsive attempt to make money off of the title Doom while not even taking any of the storyline from the game.Below a few spoilers.Then they go one step in the wrong direction in doing what's already been done in a few B movies (Resident Evil); they introduce some compound that turns the exposed person into a super strength evil or super strength good person.It honestly just kept getting worse and worse.",Doom

The actors could ad-lib in their own stereotypical dialogues, and the result would probably be less predictable and more fun. Doesn't sound possible? Let me demonstrate with this movie, of the sci-fi horror genre: 1) Supercool intro CG done by some superhuman 3D CG guy. Wets our movie-buds and tricks us into thinking that this is going to be super-cool and somehow different. Sometimes the studio even lets their logo be modified. Sometimes the intro scene is the only original thing in the entire movie, as was the case here. 2) Cut to scary intro in dark tunnel-like environment, lots of heavy breathing, screaming, dim light, people running, growling noises, and no coherent sequence of events. Someone falls and get sucked/pulled backwards, and scene ends with some blood and munching sounds. At this point we're thinking, ""OK, I've seen this 1001 times, but the CG intro was really cool so there's a chance it will get better..."" 3) Cut to team CO getting mission brief. The cranial-impact buzzwords ""extreme prejudice"", ""search and destroy"", ""deadly force"", etc are often heard. They're like Pavlov dog bells for those military types. 4) Cut to team scene where we view every member's quirky behavior. (great opportunity for ad-libbing as whatever happens here has no bearing on the rest of the movie) 5) Cut to CO entering and breaking the bad news that vacation is canceled. Standard moaning and whining thrown in here. Anybody with major emotional problems is told to buzz off and play with their dwadle, and they invariably disobey orders and show up at the last minute anyway. 6) Cut to mushy/cheesy goodbye scenes with spouses and kids. Thank god this movie skipped this because if I hear one more blond haired blue-eyed little girl scream ""Daddy daddy"" in her cutesy teared up voice, I'm going to lose it... 7) Gear up scene where there's lots of weapon-loading noises (more cranium juice for military types) and everybody gets to show how smooth and cool they are with the guns. Everybody has their own special weapon/equipment set which fits their messed-up quirky personality. Oh, and this movie even had ""handle-id's"" for each crew member. Makes it seem more palatable and friendly to the nerd types. Good crossover appeal decision there. 8) Transport scene where everybody gets in the transport/wormhole/magic hat. Anybody who's going to crack later starts to show it here. Throw in some macho/fatalistic comments from key characters. 9) Team arrives and is greeted by a bunch of moronic civs who are arrogant or in panic mode, and have no idea what is going on. Numbero uno arrogant civ usually introduces him/herself at this point. Usually a scientist/doctor or bureaucrat with a bug up their ass. Sometimes a low-profile smart civ character is thrown in too. This character will play a key role later and save the team's ass. Any romantic/personal relationships are hinted on at this point, along with any initial bickering or flirting. More cracks start to show in weak link members. 10) Even though they have no idea what they're dealing with, team goes in blind, full force and invariably gets split up. I mean, it would suck if the monster crushed the whole team at the beginning because then the studio would have to bring in a backup team, (more money for more actors) and repeat steps 3-8, and that would make the movie run over an hour and 50 minutes. 11) At first team finds nothing, then they start to find little pieces of flesh/blood/limbs and get the crap scared out of them by stray cats/rats/dripping ooze. Even though they're supposedly trained pros, everybody except for the CO and the first mate is screaming and firing at shadows, practically blubbering and pissing their pants. You know that everybody who is scared at this point is going to die later on. --- At this point it's obvious that the movie is not going to get any better and the brain moves onto more important topics, like, is this extra-large popcorn and super-size soda going to last through another 72 minutes of boredom. Or if one was smart enough to memorize the movie theatre schedule in advance, then cutting out and hopping over to another movie is possible. Non-movie marathoners are asleep at this point, and the little kid next to them is watching drool pool on the floor and is probably stealing their popcorn too...little brats... 12) Someone finds either an initial sidekick monster or some piece of important looking evidence which spawns a side ""search and discover mission"" or ""chase the sidekick monster"" scene. In this movie a research doctor was found which resulted in a side ""blabbering mad doctor"" scene. 13) First non-key team member gets munched at this point. Usually it's the most annoying character or the rookie. In this one it was the bible guy. I mean everybody hates religion nowadays. Team-mate is left untouched, and they don't have any idea what happened because it was dark and they were looking the other way, and it was impossible to concentrate as there were too many screaming/munching noises to listen too anyways. 14) Everybody rushes frantically to the first munch scene, heedless of danger, because everybody knows the monster is full. If there's a body left, cut to medical scene where they fail to save the first monster snack.Anyway, you get the idea. It IS possible to auto-generate this stuff. Which is why I stopped watching Hollywood movies years ago and started downloading Jap anime and Asian movies instead. The Asian stuff is (in general) so much better....especially those new Korean movies... oooooo...",Doom
867,roleplayer-1,"Doom good story, good graphics, worst director in history.",6,8 January 2006,"Well to start with i agree the directing was pretty bad but notice he also directed cradle 2 the grave which was pretty awful as well. I'll say the graphics for the doom movie are absolutely fine look just about the same as the game, the monsters are mostly identical. However the director didn't direct the actors very well, i've never seen such messy marines in Doom before. If the monsters were actually jumping out like in the game they'd all be dead before scene1 ends. I would say it's definitely worth seeing. And I would also like to add Andrzej Bartkowiak you suck go back to college and learn how to be a real director, take classes before you decide to try and ruin a title with so much potential. Sort of reminds me of when Oliver Stone tried to make a movie about the Doors, but clearly not that bad.",Doom
868,cvostinar,"Yes, it's a horror movie",1,16 January 2006,"Truly it is. It's the most horrifying movie I have ever seen. I would kindly ask the movie producers that are making movies after video games to stop torturing the audience and do something more useful with their ""skills"", like gardening. At least, did they play the game? I think Not. The idea of making a movie after video game ""DOOM"" was bad from the very beginning, but at least I expected to see some cool special FX, monsters and maybe some cool weapons, like in the video game, but NO, all of that didn't happen. The shame, the horror. The day I've seen this movie will live in infamy for a Doom fan like me, they managed to spoil a good video game by making a movie after it. However, I would recommend not to waste one and a half hour watching the movie, instead, doing something more entertaining, like going to the woods and try to find Little Red Riding Hood.",Doom
869,slowwber,Some people are so skeptical,8,8 February 2006,"When Doom first came out in theaters the bad reviews started pouring out. I debated whether or not to go to the movie which was described as another awful movie rendition of a video game. And so I waited until the DVD came out and with great anticipation I picked up a copy of the movie and popped it in.As the title appeared my expectations were neutral and I was just happy to finally watch the movie. When the first scene began I didn't understand why everyone seemed to shun this movie. The directors made use of several appropriate moments to toss in some humor that worked really well, such as Duke's attempts to seduce Samantha Grimm. The action was very well done and I thought that the first-person-shooter sequence was a great idea opening up a new realm in the action movie. I thought it was great to see Grimm attempt to chainsaw the monster or chase down a few imps from his perspective.Now for why people hated it, as I read into who wrote the reviews for the movies I discovered that it was mainly hard core gamers reviewing the movie who expected the movie to follow the plot line of the video game series exactly. I have played the Doom game before and other video games turned into movies such as Resident Evil. Please people, do not follow the advice of an old nerd living with their parents ever again. If the movie studio had to follow the exact premise of the games then I guess the movies based on video games would be five hours long as we would follow the main characters as they looked for different key codes to get to the next level.If there's any advice I can give you then just forget what critics said about this move and give it a try. If you have the unlimited rental pass for Blockbuster then what do you have to lose anyways. As always go into a movie with no previous knowledge and no expectations and you will enjoy all of your movies no matter how bad they may seem.",Doom
870,alex-stanier,"Don't listen to the critics, this film is a true testament to the game",8,20 January 2006,"I know that everyone has given this movie a slating because the plot was thin at best, and the acting was cheesy, for example: ""It could have been so much more...If it was made by a decent director it might have been the ""Aliens"" of the '00s."" But everyone seems to have missed the point. Aliens, for instance, was designed from the plot up to create an intensely engrossing and scary thriller. However Doom is based on a game. Not only that but an old-skool first person shoot-em-up. As such any plot in the game is designed only to make sure that there's plenty of monsters for you to kill and to make sure it looks damn cool while your doing it. Indeed any additional plot would detract from the purity and intensity of the gameplay. The very 2D nature of the plot and the characters lends itself to the world of the first person shooter and allows you to get onboard much more quickly and immerse your self much more deeply into the action (remember this is all these type of games are about, action action action). As such if a movie has decided to base itself on such a game and then proceeded to try and be something that its not, adding complex plot factors and arty direction, then the director would have completely missed the point and failed to do his job right! Doom emulates the game perfectly, its a mindless gore-fest which builds nicely to an awesome and exhilarating end sequence. I was on the edge of my seat from the word go. The Rock was (as usual) absolutely awesome, anyone who has seen The Rundown will know what I mean and I personally find the man as convincing in this genre as Arnie was before him.People please stop judging this film by contemporary standards, its not about to win a bunch of awards for most original screenplay, but it does its job perfectly and is a real tribute to the original concept and ideals of the game.This film doesn't pretend to be anything that it isn't, so if your a fan of arty dramas and clever plot lines then don't bother even watching let alone commenting. But if you love mindless action, gore, monsters, big f*cking guns and plenty of mindless violence then this is the movie for you!!",Doom
871,sacrifice932000,"Better than the average sci-fi horror, but not quite there.",9,21 January 2006,"For many moviegoers, movies such as this aren't viewed because of bad critical reviews, and many people who don't enjoy this kind of movie in the first place will go on internet sites, and bash it for the sake of ruining someone's day. When I saw Doom, I was honestly surprised that it was as good of a movie as it was. Actually, it was much better than I expected. I came onto IMDb, and checked everything on the cast and crew, and to be honest, I didn't expect this movie to be that great. The director hadn't directed a single movie that I liked, and the only two people that I thought could pull this movie off were Karl Urban and Rosamund Pike, and I sure as heck didn't think that The Rock could play a bad guy. However, after I watched the whole movie, I realized that I got what I look for in a sci-fi horror. You get suspense, gore (and plenty of it), cool characters, weapons from the game (BFG, Chaingun), and even the bad guys from the game (Hell Knight, Imp, Pinky Demon, Arch-Vile). To be honest, this movie is one where you get what the genre gives, but don't go expecting an Oscar movie like everyone else seems to. Take it as a horror movie with guns and set in the future, and you'll love it.",Doom

873,BigFriendlyGiant,Good film except for the first person shooter format,6,20 September 2006,"I love films such as Resident Evil and Silent Hill (mainly because I've played those games and so knew what to expect). I was looking forward to seeing Doom and I have to admit that it was better than I thought and the Rock was actually a lot better in this film than he has been in some of his others....which I won't mention here *coughScorpionKing* The choice of music was pretty good and of course needs to be played loud to make the film that little bit better, however the first-person shooter format was absolute pants. I can understand why they did it and why they thought it would cool, but it really didn't work. In the space of 2-3 minutes, this film began to take a nose-dive. If you like VG-turned-movies you should watch this film, but maybe you should fast-forward through the first-person shooter scene or you can experience for yourself what real disappointment feels like.",Doom

I recall rumours of a live action film ever since about 1995, Last year when I was finally able to confirm that the rumors were true, I was pumpedm, so I went to go check out the flick as soon as it was in theatres. At first I was somewhat steamed that they never actually went to hell, in a movie based on a game about going to hell. But then I got to thinking, maybe hell is just a metaphor, maybe they knew what they were doing after all. Props to them. Also, I was pleased to see a movie without any stupid romantic scenses. I HATE THOSE! Overall, Great movie, although maybe I'm just favouring it because I'm an oldschool fan.",Doom

876,mr-orange-5,Mmmh... I expected something' hellish!,5,8 February 2006,"To be honest, I am a great DooM fan. To be very honest, I am also a great fan of action movies. The only thing I've to complain 'bout this movie is that the original idea (and the original concept) that made DooM one of the greatest (and scariest) video games of all time were not respected. So, you will not find any demon or supernatural creature escaped from the gates of hell, but monsters created by genetic mutations (funny, never heard 'bout that... ^^) I'd have found the first idea (the original concept) more interesting and, speaking from the director's view, something more challenging. After all, this movie goes on... as an action movie it's not too bad, the scenery is pretty good (pretty dark) and claustrophobic; it's enough bloody and nervous... The spot: we've got a lot of movie like this. I have to remark that every video game-based-movie I've seen got its concept changed, despite great original ideas or great stories (something's telling' me ""House of the Dead""...) and this movie is not an exception.",Doom
877,cchristm-1,A decent movie...,6,11 February 2006,"If anyone has ever played the video game series ""DOOM"" you would have realize just how off this movie was. Don't get me wrong, some of the special effects (such as the BFG 9000) were cool, as well as some good acting, but there are still many problems with the movie. The movie itself, contained so many wrong things from the video game. Since when does the BFG blow out blue plasma? Last time I checked, never. Also, was this movie ""Resident Evil?"" Nope. And what is chromozone-24? If you can tell me where, in the game series, those words even come up, do tell. The movie hardly did any justice to the game at all. Who the heck is Sam? Everyone knows the main character went in alone, and went farther and farther into the nightmare we call hell. He didn't blow up the ARC, nor did he save the girl. Also, since when can he heal himself? I remember playing the game and getting frustrated every time I died. And he could heal? What happened to the blue, red, and yellow key-cards? And finally, How was Sarge the enemy? And after he died, the world was saved? The movie was decent, with some cool parts, especially the 5 minutes in first person shooting mode. The acting was OK, but the movie had a lot of BS the game didn't have, contained many different themes, and was weak in the action part. It was more of a suspense than anything else...One more thing...was he in love with his sister? I got that feeling, did you?",Doom
878,shaunny_boy,What a slaughter,2,11 February 2006,"Although there were some ""good"" parts of the movie, i believe that the writer had never even played a Doom game in his life or read the many Doom books. They slaughtered the plot (if there is one in the movie), the use of animatronics is 'B' rated, and I'm not sure if The Rocks acting could get any worse. oh yes, and the use of odd ""militrary"" phrases. The BFG9000 was cool and the nano-wall, so that is the only thing that brought it from a 1 to a 2.I just hope that the poor reviews (from people I've talked to) don't stop id Software from trying again with a more responsible director/writer to the REAL Doom story that should be based on horror and not something i still cant put a name to without breaking the website guidelines. This could have been a great movie, what a waste.",Doom
879,regmetoday,An away mission that went wrong.,6,13 February 2006,"The whole time I was watching the movie, I just thought how much better Captain Picard would have handled the situation.Good visual effects. The actors, The Rock and all the others - did great work. Even with a very weak script, their talent was visible. I just wish the actors spoke up and said 'that's dumb - why would soldiers NOT have night vision helmets, lights, duct tape, etc.' Basically the whole movie is just one 'away mission' that went very wrong... First off scanners would have shown where the 'monsters' are. Even today in 2006 we have robotics that could be sent into 'hot zones' to check up on what went wrong, even in high radiation areas that would kill a human in minutes.The stupidity of the characters is what will annoy you. No night vision goggles? No Nanofiber body armor? What's wrong in the future - budget cuts to military spending? Unlikely.How 'bout someone trying to get the lights on before wandering around in darkened rooms? And being a facility on another planet - would't the men have biochemical warfare suits? Or at least lightweight space suits? what if one of the doors they opened went to a room that was depressurized? Why not send in the robots and probes, map out the whole place from a remotely controlled station. Once the problem had been uncovered (the monsters), send in some spider mines to chase them down and blow them up. They would have been done with the mission before dinner - with no men lost. Just send in an android to fetch the missing computer data (what- no telnet, no backup files?) At one point in Doom, the Rock says 'You Don't Think!' - I guess he was talking to the audience.Other than the movie being filled with human stupidity from beginning to end, the total rip off of other films is readily seen. Full Metal Jacket, Star Trek, Aliens, Night of the Living Dead, Mortal Combat and many others.After first contact and the loss of the first soldier, why would you split people up? Fallback, regroup and Hold the Line. When all else failed, how about just getting sealed behind one section of the base, and cut life support to the rest of the damaged base? Wait 72 hours, turn the power back on, then go back in? Even monsters need air and heat! The one key element that WAS interesting: Nano-Walls.Walls that become semi-transparent doorways you can push through. Then with the flip of a switch, the doorway becomes a solid wall again.Nanopartical doorway walls would be a cool invention. As long as it didn't cause cancer. How do you prevent someone swallowing / breathing in particles while passing through the doorway? Wouldn't the nano particles get stuck on your skin and give you skin cancer? Most likely an OSHA accident waiting to happen (Ouch - stuck in the door!)The FPS scenes are too slow paced - it needed sped up about 20% to make it more life like. (or more video game like - to be exact.)Even Captain Kirk would have done better than these characters - and he was always getting red shirts killed. Kirk would have found a beautiful woman to make out with along the way, too.An OK rental movie if you are bored. Skip buying this DVD.",Doom

And a obviously weak rip-off of resident evil, illuminated buy flashlight. Another bra-less (and apparently, it's cold on mars), super hot scientist chick figures it all out. P-U stinker, this was only slightly entertaining, I could not recommend this to anybody unless they are in a body cast. Maybe the sequel will listen to us and change things up a bit.

The base in the game spanned somewhat about the size of New York City. In the game the main problem or conflict in the story is ""Sarge"" showing up for a routine check on the UAC base on Mars, During which they were playing around with Teleportation technology AND digging up Mars. The men dispatched through the teleporter ended up being sent into Hell. Another thing is that people weren't bitten by Imps and changed into Zombies when Hell emerged from the Center of Mars it changed all the men and women in the base into Zombies; the Demons themselves emerged from the bowels of Hell as well. There were no chromosome testing areas of Doom that i've seen.

I feel the monsters were logically developed to follow the story line and liked how the First Person Shooter sequence gives those non-gamers among us ties to the video game. Overall, there was something for everyone. A very good cast choice that gives eye candy for the women who would not generally watch this type of movie including reputable ""manly"" stars with plenty of language and gore for the guys to get into.
