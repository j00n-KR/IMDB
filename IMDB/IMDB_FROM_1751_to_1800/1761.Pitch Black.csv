0,TheLittleSongbird,"Slow first half hour, amazing special effects and cinematography, decent acting, gory second half, complex plot, some corny dialogue- you have Pitch Black",7,22 January 2010,"What were my concluding thoughts on seeing this film? Impressive, uneven perhaps but well worth the look.First things first, technically it is mind blowing, the special effects and the cinematography were brilliant, and the crash was spectacularly staged.The plot is quite complex, people complained it was illogical, but I didn't find that, it was an original concept I give you that.The creature attacks are also well done, though I will say the second half is so gory, I admit I lost my lunch.The first half hour of the film is a little slow, but the rest of the film manages to redeem itself in terms of pace and was quite compelling.Some of the dialogue was a little on the corny side, especially the monologue after the crash.The acting was decent, Vin Diesel the standout of the bunch with a brooding charisma that is quite rewarding,and Radha Mitchell is good as Pilot Fry.The music is excellent, and the direction was good.There, you have Pitch Black. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Pitch Black
1,Leofwine_draca,A decent sci-fi B-movie,9,9 October 2016,"Finally, after years of cheap and rubbish ALIENS rip-offs, comes one that is actually pretty darned good for a change. Despite being unreleased for about a year in this country, and with its fair share of plot holes and flaws, PITCH BLACK still manages to be one of the most impressive science fiction films in a long time. Although a pure B-movie at heart, PITCH BLACK impresses us with some wonderful photography, strong acting, and characterisations, and, for once, an imaginative script which throws in many inventive touches as it goes along.It's action right from the start as the film opens with one of the most tense, prolonged, and realistic spaceship crashes in a long time. The special effects here are adequate, although strained by the budget. Once the survivors group together on the planet's surface and decide to explore, here the fun really begins. The suspense is racked up to breaking point, making this relatively quiet first half pretty damn tense, as the viewer is aware that the survivors are not alone, and it takes a long time (and a few deaths) for them to realise this. Due to the wealth of action and different situations, even with a relatively long running time this stuff never becomes boring.Once the aliens show themselves (in a scene where the lead character is repeatedly put in danger but just manages to escape) the thrills and chills are heightened further. The plot twist of having an eclipse suddenly occur has already been stolen in the cheesy FROM DUSK TILL DAWN 2, but it's still a good one in any case. There's a taught NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD-inspired scene where the remaining survivors huddle inside the crashed ship as the aliens mass outside, trying to get in. The final third takes the form of an immense trip on foot through the desert to reach a working spaceship, and offers up most of the fun as our character's lighting begins to fail bit by bit, until they are left in ""pitch black"" by a string of unlucky accidents.There are some many horrific scenes in this film that it's hard to pick the best, although I did especially like the moment (shown in the trailer) where a character lights a torch quickly to see himself surrounded by the aliens, before it going out again just as suddenly. The squelchy sound effects do the rest of the work for us. The desert landscape of Australia is put to good use, with the bleached photography achieving the same realistic sun-scorched effect as in THREE KINGS. Indeed, the photography (whether in the bright light or in the dark) is excellent throughout, and one of the film's strong points.The acting, too, is pretty good, and the fact that the film lacks famous faces makes it all the better. Radha Mitchell - an ex-NEIGHBOURS actress, if you would believe it - makes for a tough, likable and resourceful heroine, and one of the best female roles in a sci-fi movie in a while. Keith David pops up in a role as an Arab, and is as good as ever. I'm happy to say that he actually survives in this film. Cole Hauser (son of Wings) creates a believable, three-dimensional bastard in Johns, the film's most hateable character. However, acting honours go to Vin Diesel, playing the imposing escaped convict. Despite having surgically-altered eyes so he can see in the dark, a shaved head and imposing bulk, Diesel still manages to make his killer a likable character with a hard edge, and succeeds as an action hero.The CGI effect of the large aliens are generally pretty good, with the well-designed creatures being most menacing, especially when seen in a half light. One thing I didn't like were the tiny flying aliens which just look like a blob of CGI in close-up. There's a fair smattering of (computer generated) gore for horror fans, with heads and bodies being ripped apart in very brief shots. There are also some fun p.o.v. shots from the aliens' and Diesel's perspectives which are nice to look at. I'm pleased to say that director David Twohy (who also make the pretty good alien invasion flick, THE ARRIVAL) has succeeded again in making an enjoyable movie; one which is suspense, horrifying and exciting in equal measures, and should be seen at once by all genre fans as a breath of fresh air in today's cinema.",Pitch Black
2,SnoopyStyle,great sci-fi horror,8,26 October 2015,"The spaceship Hunter-Gratzner crashes on a desert planet. Pilot Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell) tries to take control after the captain is killed. Bounty hunter William J. Johns (Cole Hauser) is transporting prisoner Richard B. Riddick (Vin Diesel). There are also holy man Abu 'Imam' al-Walid (Keith David) and his young charges, antiquities dealer Paris P. Ogilvie, runaway Jack (Rhiana Griffith), John Zeke Ezekiel and Sharon 'Shazza' Montgomery (Claudia Black). They discover that the planet's 3 suns align to have a nightfall every 22 years and creatures from below rise up to massacre every creature on the surface. They are forced to rely on the killer Riddick and his night vision.This is great smallish sci-fi horror. Radha Mitchell does a nice Ripley. This reminds me a lot of Alien which I consider one of the greatest movies ever. It's got good desolate settings. Vin Diesel is the Man. This starts as an interesting character that turns into something great. The creature feature plus the darkness make this even better.",Pitch Black
3,claudio_carvalho,It Is not With Riddick that They Have to Be Worried about,8,6 November 2016,"When the transport ship ""Hunter-Gratzner"" is hit by a meteor shower, the pilot Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell) is awaken from the cryogenic sleep and tries to control the vessel with forty passengers. She is forced to release a module and only Carolyn; the bounty hunter William J. Johns (Cole Hauser); the religious Abu ""Imam"" al-Walid Lewis (Keith David); the dealer Paris P. Ogilvie (Lewis Fitz- Gerald); Sharon 'Shazza' Montgomery (Claudia Black); the runaway teenager Jack (Rhiana Griffith); John 'Zeke' Ezekiel (John Moore); Suleiman (Les Chantery); Hassan (Sam Sari); Ali (Firass Dirani); and the dangerous criminal Richard B. Riddick (Vin Diesel) survive. Riddick escapes and Johns scares the survivors telling how dangerous he is. The group is stranded in the desert and find that place is heated by three suns and they team-up to seek for water and supplies. Soon they discover that there are under siege of flesh eating aliens that attack in the darkness; further, the planet will be pitch black with a total eclipse. They conclude that it is not with Riddick that they have to be worried about.After sixteen years, ""Pitch Black"" is still a great B-movie that may be considered a new-classic in the present days. The story is engaging with good special effects. But the most amazing is the direction and the perfect casting of unknown actors and actresses. ""Pitch Black"" brought the attention of the audiences to Vin Diesel in his first success; Radha Mitchell, from ""Everything Put Together"" of the same year, is perfect in the role of Carolyn Fry; and the always efficient Cole Hauser and Keith David have also great performances. The noncommercial conclusion is also a plus of ""Pitch Black"". My vote is eight.Title (Brazil) ""Eclipse Mortal"" (""Mortal Eclipse"")",Pitch Black
4,kosmasp,Mystery Man,9,13 September 2013,"I just re-watched this, to refresh my memory. Riddick 2(or part 3 of the Pitch Black trilogy if you will) was about to start in the cinema and I only had watched the first one over a decade ago. The film still holds up! It's the character portrayed by Vin Diesel that makes the movie more than worthwhile. It's actually the mystery surrounding the character, not knowing what he's really up to and if he has moral values or where they lie.While Riddick does takes stabs at religion, the director and the movie itself do not really show any indication they have anything against it. A science fiction movie that tries to please a part of the audience. But don't be fooled, this is as raw as it can be. You won't and shouldn't get too comfortable. While there wasn't any money to speak of (budget wise), the movie does look really good. The theme here is darkness. And it looks good/clear enough for my taste! Raw and violent like Riddick himself, you'll either be with him or ...",Pitch Black
5,jboothmillard,Pitch Black,7,21 May 2007,"All I knew about this film was that it was the first time you saw the bald, goggle wearing and dark loving anti-hero, and the star that made him became bigger soon after. Basically a space transport vessel, the ""Hunter-Gratzner"", has an accident in a meteor storm, and crashes on a desert planet. The remaining survivors, led by pilot Carolyn Fry (Phone Booth's Radha Mitchell), with bounty hunter William J. Johns (Cole Hauser), religious man Abu ""Imam"" Al-Walid (Volcano's Keith David), Antiques dealer Paris P. Ogilvie (Lewis Fitz-Gerald), runaway teenage girl Jack/Jackie (Rhiana Griffith), settlers John 'Zeke' Ezekiel (John Moore) and his lover Sharon 'Shazza' Montgomery (Farscape's Claudia Black). But the key survivor who has an idea of how to get off the planet, before they are killed by either the giant flesh eating alien bugs, or the oncoming eclipse of three suns (which happens every 22 years), is Riddick (Vin Diesel), a dangerous escape convict. Riddick may be their only hope though, with his surgically-enhanced silver eyes that allow him to see in the dark. I may not have payed all that much attention, but from what I did watch, there was some good action and special effects. The awful sequel, The Chronicles of Riddick followed in 2004. Very good!",Pitch Black
6,ccthemovieman-1,The Good & Bad Of This Austalian Alien-Ripoff,4,6 July 2006,"Very good special effects, decent sound an interesting Alien-ripoff sci-fi/horror story are the good points of this movie. The bad parts are the too profane, unlikeable characters. Unlike Alien, where the evil creature is inside the ship, here the evil creatures are outside the ship.In this overly politically-correct Australian story, our ""hero"" doesn't believe in God, the lead woman is a tough-talking (are all the f-words really necessary to ""prove"" that?) and, of course, the only nice person is the Muslim.For tenseness, this movie succeeds with a numer of spots that have you on the edge of your seat. Some of the scenes are jaw-dropping amazing with some great visuals. If they had better characters, this would have been a ""keeper.""",Pitch Black
7,Tweekums,Be afraid of the dark,7,13 July 2009,"It is possible to look at this film as a cheap imitation of the Alien franchise, this however would be unfair as it is a decent science fiction monster film in its own right.The film opens with a spaceship being holed when it flies through a shower of small yet deadly meteors, the surviving crew wake up to find themselves plunging towards a desert planet. Carolyn Fry, the pilot is forced to start jettisoning the cargo and would also jettison the passengers if a fellow crew member hadn't stopped her. Luckily she and a handful of the passengers survive, including Riddick, an escaped convict being transported back to prison. Once safely on the ground the survivors start to explore the surrounding desert hoping to find much needed water. They find an apparently abandoned settlement which has an escape shuttle, they also find that there is something dangerous there which attacks in the dark. This shouldn't be a problem as the planets three suns ensure perpetual daylight apart from a period of eclipse which occurs every twenty two years, one can guess how long it was since the last eclipse. As the escape shuttle is out of fuel they must race back to the crash site to get the required power cells. By the time they are ready to return the eclipse has started so their solar powered vehicle will no longer work meaning they must get back on foot, all the time avoiding the deadly alien creatures while never being totally sure which of their own group can be trusted.The cast did a good job, I especially liked Radha Mitchell's performance as the Pilot Fry. Vin Diesel's portrayal of Riddick was decent enough too. The special effects worked well, making the creatures genuinely scary. There is also a nice twist involving one of the survivor which I won't spoil here. To get the full effect of this film watch it in the dark.",Pitch Black
8,ma-cortes,"Intriguing as well as intelligent Sci-fi movie , being compellingly directed by a good filmmaker , David Twohy",7,15 July 2015,"This is a science fiction thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat . Exciting film packs intrigue , intense scenes , noisy action and astonishing suspense . Freak meteor storm cause a a commercial transport airship to make landing on an unknown planet . Then the spaceship and its survivors are marooned on a planet with three suns and apparently no life and where mysterious events spread across the land . The greatest danger facing our crew has been the planet's best kept secret...until now . Later on , the crew to be aware the planet is full of bloodthirsty creatures that only come out to feast at night . But then , they learn that a month-long eclipse is about to occur .Creepy and gory Sci-Fi with thrills , chills , suspense and some familiar elements . This is a pretty good as well as scary movie with violent events , intriguing incidents , starked outdoors , and chilling scenes . This is a peculiar rendition of ¨The only come out at night¨ in which some passengers , pilots , bounty hunters and prisoner discover that very nasty hunting creatures attack after dark and the planet is in for a total eclipse . Interesting screenplay from Jim Wheat , Ken Wheat and David Twohy . The film developed from David Twohy's unused idea for Alien³ (1992) , involving a space prison . The fantastic alien creatures are perfectly designed by Patrick Tatopoulos, they have three phases of evolution: 1) embryonic - little harmless Bioluminescent beings 2) youngish - which fly in flock to hunt and finally 3) adult - big gray creatures who are able to kill other members of the species to eat . Vin Diesel gives a hard-ass acting , as usual , as a convicted killer who has nothing to lose . Nice support cast such as Radha Mitchell , Cole Hauser , Claudia Black , Lewis Fitzgerald , Simon Burke , John Moore and Keith David . Thrilling and stirring musical score by Graeme Revell . Colorful cinematography by David Eggby who shows splendidly the desert landscapes from Queensland , Australia . In fact , the hot desert where they filmed was actually about 50F, they were misting water on the actors to make it appear as if they were sweating . As desert scenes filmed in the same location used for Mad Max , beyond Thunderdome (1985) .The motion picture was well written and directed by David Twohy , it had a 60 days shooting schedule. David is an expert writer and director of splendid Sci-Fi movies . As his first picture was the acceptable ¨Timescape¨ . He also wrote ¨Warlock¨, ¨Waterworld ¨, a script for ¨Alien 3¨ in 1988, but it was rejected . Back in May of 2000 , Fox Studios once inquired for his availability to write and direct ""AVP: Alien vs. Predator"" , but turned down the offer due to scheduling conflicts . David subsequently directed ¨Below¨, the successful ¨Pich Black¨ and its sequel ¨ The chronicles of Riddick¨ (2004) in which the wanted criminal Riddick arrives on a planet called Helion Prime, and finds himself up against an invading empire called the Necromongers, an army that plans, to convert or kill all humans in the universe , it stars : Colm Feore , Thandie Newton , Judi Dench , Alexa Davalos , Karl Urban , Linus Roache and again Keith David . Furthermore , a third installment : ¨Riddick¨ (2013) in which left for dead on a sun-scorched planet, Riddick finds himself up against an alien race of predators , it stars : Jordi Mollà , Katee Sackhoff , Dave Bautista , Matt Nable , Bokeem Woodbine , Raoul Trujillo , Conrad Pla , and , of course , Vin Diesel .",Pitch Black
9,BA_Harrison,The plot has more holes than the hull of Fry's spaceship.,5,5 December 2015,"A deep-space passenger ship is hit by meteorites that breach the hull, forcing pilot Fry (Radha Mitchell) to crash-land on a nearby planet capable of sustaining human life. Incredibly, Fry and a handful of her passengers survive the impact, including mercenary Johns (Cole Hauser) and his extremely dangerous prisoner Riddick (Vin Diesel).After investigating their new surroundings, the survivors come to the conclusion that they are on a dead world, all indigenous life having long been wiped out. In fact, there is one species still very much alive: flesh-eating, light-sensitive creatures that live below ground, away from the deadly glare of the planet's three suns. Unfortunately for Fry and company, they are about to be plunged into darkness by an eclipse that occurs once every 22 years, and which signals the emergence of the aliens from beneath the surface.The survivors only chance of making it off the planet alive involves transferring energy cells from their downed craft to a functioning ship discovered at a nearby deserted mining colony, a task that requires putting trust in Riddick, whose surgically enhanced eyes enable him to see in the dark.I'm willing to forgive the whole convenient 'breathable atmosphere' issue (as I do for one of of my favourite sci-fi films, Enemy Mine), but sci-fi horror Pitch Black throws up one unbelievable plot contrivance after another, completely ignoring logic in favour of thrills, thereby making it hard for me to rate it very highly despite some well handled action from director David Twohy, a memorable turn from gruff star Vin Diesel, and sexy Radha Mitchell in tight clothing.The silly plot simply leaves too many awkward questions: if the aliens have long eradicated all animal life on the surface, what the hell have they been eating ever since? How do creatures that burn up in daylight but which must come to the surface to feed evolve on a planet with three suns? Why do they even bother to come to the surface if they've already eaten everything? Just a few of the head scratchers that this poorly scripted flick fails to answer.",Pitch Black
10,Quinoa1984,"Another one, but not too bad",7,5 December 2000,"Unlike Mission to Mars, which had people who go to a planet and have to worry about things on it.  While that film had idiocy mixed in with spectacularly inept drama, this film is a hardcore sci-fi/action popcorn flick that hits the target pretty close if not perfectly.  The film has a group of space flighters, including a convict (played by Vin Diesel in his least performance on the chain, but only because the other ones in Saving Private Ryan, Iron Giant and Boiler Room were classics)  and a muslim (Keith David) and a woman (Randha Mitchell).  On the planet, things are quiet in light, pretty barron, but in the dark, things come out.  Like a bat story, this film has it's share of scares and scores points, but may only be brought down by some lame dialogue and some dumb plot twists.  Still a feast for the eyes in spots.

11,BandSAboutMovies,Lots of fun!,6,9 November 2020,"David Twohy started his time in Hollywood as a writer on films like Warlock, Timescape and Critters 2: The Main Course before graduating to big budget films like The Fugitive, The Arrival, Waterworld and G.I. Jane. He started directing with the aforementioned Timescape and then really kicked his directing career into high gear with this sleeper of a movie.The first of four appearances of the Riddick character* - which launched the career of Vin Diesel - this movie owes plenty to the Alien franchise but comes into its own thanks to plenty of suspense and great effects.The ship Hunter-Gratzner is transporting passengers as they sleep, including a Muslim preacher named Abu 'Imam' al-Walid (Keith David) and his three sons, an arms dealer named Paris, a teenager named Jack (keep in mind the gender neutrality of the name), some settlers named Zeke and Shazza, as well as a bounty hunter named William J. John (Cole Hauser, the son of Wings) who is transporting a Furyan alien who can see in the dark named Riddick. Meteors bring their ship down on a planet of near-constant daylight - or so it seems - yet when underground creatures attack Riddick is offer amnesty if he can help everyone get out alive.That wouldn't be easy even if the planet wasn't headed for an apocalypse that will allow the photo-sensitive monsters to run wild anything and everywhere they want to go.The intriguing part of this movie is the journey that pilot Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell, the ...Has Fallen movies) makes from someone willing to jettison the passengers to save her own life to someone who convinces Riddick to stay behind and help others, despite his criminal nature.Originally, this was a stand-alone movie and Riddick was supposed to die, but Vin Diesel and the cast and crew fell in love with the character and saw the potential for more. In the original Nightfall script, Riddick wasn't even a guy; she was called Tara Krieg.PS: If you want to see the wreck of the Hunter-Gratzner, it's still in the Australian desert and visible on Google maps. This is also the same area where The Blood of Heroes and Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome were made.PPS: The Robert Heinlein story Tunnel in the Sky has characters marooned on a planet threatened by a once-a-year danger and a character named Jack who is really female. Luckily, Heinlein wrote that and not Harlan Ellison.",Pitch Black

13,hitchcockthelegend,All you people are so scared of me. Most days I'd take that as a compliment. But it ain't me you gotta worry about now.,9,4 June 2015,"Pitch Black is directed by David Twohy and collectively written by Twohy and Ken and Jim Wheat. It stars Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell, Cole Hauser, Keith David, Lewis Fitz-Gerald, Claudia Black and Rhiana Griffith. Music is by Graeme Revell and cinematography is by David Eggby. The year 2000 was awash with sci-fi movies, not all were stellar of course, but siting at the top end of the scale was this, Twohy's super slice of action/horror/sci-fi cake. Right from the off we are thrust on board the cargo ship Hunter- Gratzner, which as it happens is plummeting through space. The ship has been hit by meteorite debris and junior officer Caroline Fly (Mitchell), after coming out of hyper sleep, manages to crash land on a nearby planet. Only a handful of passengers survive the crash, including infamous convict Richard B. Riddick (Diesel), but as the survivors struggle to cope with the threat from within the group, it becomes apparent that there's a bigger threat soon to join the party, a deadly alien species, a species that can only operate in the dark. Pity, then, that an eclipse is due... Okies, so lets get the obvious out in the open right away, Pitch Black is a variant of Alien, one of a ream of films that grabbed the coat tails of Ridley Scott's game changer. Yet this is still a fresh movie, a lesson in low budget film making with grace, style, blood, brains and balls - the execution grade ""A"" from those involved. It's maybe surprising given the synopsis, to find that it's a very character driven piece, with Twohy continually building his characters even as the carnage and terror is unleashed - and these are a very diverse bunch of characters. One of the universe's baddest criminals, a spunky lady officer having to take command, a morphine addicted bounty hunter, an Islamic priest and his young companions, a camp alcoholic and a couple of strays. It's the not so wild bunch, but everyone of them are afforded chance to impact on the story before and during the inevitable picking off one by one at the claws of the beasts. The narrative strength comes via Diesel's hulking convict, he's double jointed and has had optical surgery so he can see his enemies in the dark! The group must come to rely on him for he is clearly their best hope of survival, but can he be trusted? What is his ultimate ulterior motive? Riddick is the épée to Fry's foil, it's at times like a devil and angel trying to become one in the simple name of survival. These crux characters lift the simple premise to greater heights, that Mitchell (sexy/vulnerable/hard/smart) and Diesel (moody/beefy/gravelly/menacing) are bang on form helps no end. As does the work of the tech department. The setting created here is a splendid veer from one of the curses of sci-fi films, that of an unbelievable world. Twohy, Eggby and the art department achieve a world of 3 suns, of a scorched barren landscape, with the photography switching between bleached and metallic filters for maximum sci-fi impact. While the effects work belies the budget, check out the pre-eclipse sequence. What of the creatures themselves? They are legion, a sort of pterodactyl nightmare who let out high pitched bleats, they smell blood and move at high speeds, and like Riddick they have special vision in the dark, it's the light that they are afraid of, thus this gives our survivors a glimmer (ahem) of hope in how to stave them off... The science and logic is hokey, but so what? This is a classy and taut sci-fi film brought about by a very under valued director, one that puts many a bigger budgeted Hollywood production to shame. Come the finale, where there's still time to have your draw dropped, you may be minus nails and on the edge of your seat. 9/10",Pitch Black
14,Theo Robertson,I`m In The Dark As To Why People Liked This,3,17 November 2002,"PITCH BLACK is a film that suffers from being "" overdirected "" . Overdirected ! What`s that Theo ? Overdirected is when the director goes over the top and starts getting overly intrusive on screen and tries to be the star of the movie . Examples of these films are NO BLADE OF GRASS , THE LIMEY , the CAPE FEAR  remake JFK , NIXON and possibly THE PLEDGE and TRAFFIC but whereas these films  had their good points or at least potential PITCH BLACK is nothing more than an irritating ALIEN clones B movie no matter how much David Twohy tries to disguise it . What`s with the MTV visuals ? or the picture turning to negative ? or the blue and yellow tints ? Why`s there slo mo scenes ? Can`t we watch a film without MTV gimmicks ? And has anyone noticed the amount of scenes where Riddick is in full view of everyone but no one seems to notice him ?Talking of Riddick I couldn`t help noticing the amount of people praising his performance and well buffed physique which led me to believe the reason for the film`s popularity is down to females drooling over Vin Diesel ,ie for sexist reasons . But David Twohy evens up any sexist score by casting Radha Mitchell as the lead heroine , she`s well fit and the director knows it , notice the amount of times her character leans over exposing her ample cleavage . As a red blooded hetrosexist did I enjoy these cleavage scenes ? I sure did . Did these scenes endear the rest of the film to me ? No. PB still sucked***** MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD *****As suffocating as the direction is it`s the script that`s the main fault of this lousy film . Some reviewers have pointed out the lack of logic and plot holes and I`m surprised more people haven`t because they`re so obvious you can`t miss them , for example what were this cosmopolitan band of humans doing on the spaceship in the first place ? If there`s no signs of any life then what have these flesh eating aliens been eating all this time ? An eclipse how inconvenient . Oh hold on the serial killer has had an operation a while back where he`s able to see in the dark , hey maybe he can read the future and found out he`d be crashlanding onto a planet populated by nocturnal flesh eating monsters . How convenient  , as is the fact that these monsters suddenly turn into cannibals every time the humans are low on light and it`s also very strange the amount of scenes there are where it`s very dark and no one gets attacked compared with the amount of scenes where people are attacked when it`s not so dark . Oh and you just know that the serial killer won`t kill anyone unless they`re a corrupt law enforcer and will make it all the way to a sequel. Hmmm , just how distasteful is that ? the serial killer survives while anyone commiting the sin of wanting to stay alive meets with a brutal end .Did I like anything about this film apart from Ms Mitchell`s breasts ? Not really except the alien sound effect which seems stolen from DOCTOR WHO . Watch the 1973 adventure PLANET OF THE DALEKS and compare the jungle sound FX to the ones used here. They both sound identical",Pitch Black
15,Hey_Sweden,"Derivative, but fun.",7,25 October 2013,"Co-writer / director David Twohy doesn't set out to reinvent the wheel here with this routinely plotted but visually striking and effective sci-fi / horror picture. He keeps it interesting with his main character, an enigmatic stranger named Riddick (the well cast, imposing Vin Diesel) with a dangerous past. In fact, the main characters are all interesting in their own way, the good and the evil alike. There's some very good atmosphere to be enjoyed here - this was partly filmed in the desolate Coober Pedy region of Australia - and Twohy creates solid suspense and some good thrills.A spacecraft transporting several civilians and the ex-con Riddick is seriously damaged while in flight and is forced to crash land on a nearby planet. Among the passengers and crew are pilot Carolyn Fry (lovely Radha Mitchell), a ""cop"" named William Johns (Cole Hauser), a holy man, Imam (Keith David), and a kid, Jack (Rhiana Griffith). They're warned about Riddick by Johns, but he turns out not to be their big problem: the planet is warmed by three suns, there's about to be the first solar eclipse in 22 years, and monsters who thrive in the darkness will be free to stalk these unlucky survivors.In his first big starring role, Diesel showed that he had what it took to be a star. He has a commanding presence, as does the consistently reliable David. Mitchells' performance made a fan out of this viewer, as she spends the balance of the film trying to atone for an earlier decision she made. Lewis Fitz-Gerald supplies some comedy relief as Paris; sexy Claudia Black, John Moore, and Simon Burke round out the cast. The visual effects are generally pretty good, the creatures are imaginatively designed, and the film has a respectable pace going for it. These help to make ""Pitch Black"" a good if not great example of its genre.Seven out of 10.",Pitch Black
16,poolandrews,Good sci-fi/horror film.,7,31 October 2006,"Pitch Black starts sometime in the future somewhere deep in outer space where 40 commercial passengers are in cryo-sleep aboard a spacecraft waiting their destination. Unfortunately the spaceship is caught in a meteor storm which breaches the hull, after a bumpy ride Officer Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell) manages to land what's left of the ship on the nearest planet. The only survivors are Fry herself, bounty hunter William Johns (Cole Hauser) & his bounty Riddick (Vin Diesel) along with religious Islamic nut Abu al-Walid (Keith David), intergalactic antiques dealer Paris Ogilvie (Lewis Fitz-Gerald), Sharon Montgomery (Claudia Black), a guy called Zeke (John Moore) & some young boys including Jack (Rhianna Griffith). Together they must work to survive the chances of which improve dramatically when they discover an old abandoned settlement complete with spaceship, unfortunately it seems that the planet is infested with flesh eating creatures that can only survive in complete dark which is OK considering the planet has three suns. However by some amazing coincidence the day they happen to crash on this particular planet the first eclipse in 22 years that plunges the entire planet into total darkness occurs, now that's unlucky...This Australian American co-production was co-written & directed by David Twohy & I have to admit I liked it a lot more than I thought I would. The script by Twohy along with Ken & Jim Wheat is surprisingly good & intelligent, at it's heart Pitch Black is an Alien (1979) clone but it's certainly one of the best. The character's make this film what it is, they are very well written, there aren't any real clichés among them, they all have an edge to them & unbelievably I actually cared for these people. Because there are no major a-list actors in Pitch Black it make the who's going to die & who isn't question a lot harder to call. The film starts off a little slowly but once it reaches the 40 odd minute mark & the flying creatures are let loose it never lets up, although having said that the first 40 odd minutes are used well to set both the character's & situation up so when the creature do start to attack it actually means something. I'm sure many other's have questioned this but why would an animal such as the one in Pitch Black evolve which can be hurt by light when the planet it's living on has three suns & has an eclipse every 22 years? Also what would these things feed on since the planet is pretty much dead? Don't give me that cannibalism rubbish either, I mean eventually they would all eat each other & there would theoretically only be one left who would eventually die of starvation anyway.Director Twohy does a good job, there are no massive CGI effect scenes & he instead keeps things quite low-key & understated. The special effects that are here though are excellent & the scenes of the suns going behind the large ringed planet are cool. I'm not sure about the bleached colour in a lot of shots but at least it creates a pretty good alien environment & atmosphere. The film is lacking in gore, there is a rotten skeleton, a severed foot, someone injects a needle into their eye & someone has there head bitten off but that's about as nasty as it gets.Apparently shot in 60 days on a budget of about $23,000,000 Pitch Black is well made with that Hollywood polish to it. The acting was pretty good from a mostly unknown cast although Vin Diesel has gone on to be a major Hollywood star & I have to say I thought he was great in this & played his part brilliantly with great menace.Pitch Black is a great sci-fi/horror film & better than I had expected. In 20 odd years time I don't think anyone will look back on Pitch Black with the same regard as we do with Aien now but it's good solid entertainment that gets the job done. Well worth a watch.

Among the survivors is a criminal named Riddick (Vin Diesel) who, through a surgical alteration to his eyes, has night vision. Soon it's discovered that the planet is inhabited by nocturnal bloodthirsty creatures. Good thing the planet has three suns and it's always day right? Well, as luck would have it, these people have crashed on the planet at the same time an eclipse is about to begin so all hell is about to break loose. They must rely on Riddick to lead them to safety in the dark. The question is can they depend on a convicted murderer for help? Wonderful character-driven sci-fi action horror movie with a terrific cast. Vin Diesel's best role by miles. The Fast & Furious movies are good for what they are but he doesn't have to do much in them but act tough. Not that this is Othello but at least the character of Riddick has some depth. The rest of the cast is solid with standout turns from Radha Mitchell and Cole Hauser. The special effects are good and the action is exciting. A fun thrill ride of a movie.

Not only is the ship Hunter-Gratzner knocked out of its shipping lane, but also the captain dies. The spacecraft crash lands on a desolate planet inhabited by some weird looking creatures that can fly, resemble Pterodactyl with forked tails, and have hammerhead-shaped heads with a mouth full of steak knife teeth. These ravenous critters will munch you in a minute and they will even eat each other if the occasion arises. Our heroes are the ship's surviving pilot, Kyra (Radha Mitchell), a bounty hunter named Johns (Cole Hauser), Muslim Imam (Keith David), a little boy masquerading as a little girl named Jack (Rhiana Griffith), and convict Richard B. Riddick (Vin Diesel) who is in restraints. They locate an alternate spaceship to get them off the planet. Other than being a convict, Riddick is a little different because he can see in the dark. One by one these characters are whittled down by the ugly monsters. Part of the problem is that we never get to clearly see what the lethal bird-like monsterys. Twohy stages with action with enough expertise and never lets up on the suspense. Vin Diesel is perfectly cast as an murderer with a gravel voice.

A space ship full of people crashes on a remote and uninhabited planet. Well, almost uninhabited. They do find out that there are creatures on that planet that come out in the dark. Lucky for them, the planet has three suns so it is never dark. Well, except when there is a full eclipse which, unlucky for them, happens to be coming in a day or two. The movie goes from a ""Flight of the Phoenix"" type movie to a ""Jurrasic Park"" movie very quickly with the basic goal being to get off the planet. There are variables such as Riddick and Johns and the lack of water, but still there was nothing very suspenseful. You had large hideous creatures, you had pawns that were marked for death, you had a couple of heroes, and you had your cliché acts of stupidity that get you killed.

How about doing a science fiction horror movie in Australia with a leading man who has only ever done bit parts, and a supporting cast of mostly unknowns?"" ""What a great idea! When do we start?"" If the concept was less than promising, the execution more than made up for it. An accident crashes a spaceship on an apparently barren planet, leaving less than a dozen survivors. One of these is convicted mass murderer Riddick who is being transported to pay for his crimes. It turns out that the planet is just about to enter a period of sustained and total night, which is when thousands of pterodactyl-like blind predators emerge. Fortunately - perhaps - Riddick's eyes have been modified to allow him to stay in the dark.Of course, this is yet another take on the ""last man standing"" theme, but with some nice wrinkles. The scenario is original, there are some interesting characters, and the uncertainty over exactly where Riddick stands adds its own tension to the considerable tension generated by the survivors' plight. There are some powerful performances, particularly from Radha Mitchell, and Vin Diesel in his first leading role, oozes charisma, not to mention silky menace. The critters are memorable and the effects overall are excellent.Only one thing mars the movie slightly - what do the critters eat on the desert planet when they can't get stranded spacefarers?",Pitch Black

Boring premise regards a spacecraft landing on a deserted planet that becomes infested with nasty flying creatures. These movies are getting too pointless to attend because you can sense the marketing team rubbing their hands in greed and deceit. Director David Twohy does his best but the screenplay is just another retread of Alien. Characters are airheads who fall victim to special effects. Only Vin Diesel as a captured criminal seems fitted for better material. He will attempt to lead them out of danger while winning over the airhead heroine and her band of merry men. We know that he will survive and that many of the others will not because they are morons. Radha Mitchell, Keith David and Cole Hauser play idiots. These creatures are afraid of light so when these morons band together to haul electric lights one idiot breaks from the group thus savaging the lighting. It is not difficult to guess his fate but it is likely that he came in last in any academic programs growing up because he is bloody stupid. The special effects are the norm here and the rest of the film is something to be screened only to chuck handfuls of gruel at.

23,Aaron1375,Much better than the over the top sequel.,8,17 August 2009,"This movie had some science fiction elements to it, and it did not look cheap in any way. However, it was a much more simple movie than the sequel and to me that made it better. It also helped that this movie did not totally focus on the Riddick character. Granted he was an interesting character, but the fact there was so much mystery with him is what made him so cool. In the sequel you just found out a lot more than you really wanted to. It also helps that this movie has more horror movie in it than anything else. I always enjoy a good science fiction horror movie and this one was another in a long line of good ones. The story as a ship that crash lands on a strange planet that is very hot as it has three suns. To add to the difficulty of the situation they are transporting a rather dangerous individual. Pretty soon he escapes and soon after someone dies. However, it is not the escaped prisoner, rather there seems to be something living within the planet, something that is hungry. The good news is these whatever they are do not come out in the harsh sunlight, so no problems right? Wrong! Even with the many suns the planet is about to go into a stage of darkness and the creatures are going to come out and feed. So they now have to rely on each other to escape and that includes the escaped prisoner who has had a special procedure done to make it so he can see in the darkness.

But it's not only him, the storyline is full of plot holes, little annoying things that make no sense. I'm not going to say anything about it, don't want to spoil a movie, but you'll figure it out by yourself when you watch it. It's a mystery to me why this movie gets such a high rating.

26,MovieAddict2016,Surprisingly fun!,8,27 September 2003,"I must say that I didn't expect much sitting down to watch ""Pitch Black,"" but I got a lot back, in terms of excitement and pure fun. It's the type of flick where you can just lean back, relax, and have a great time just being entertained. This isn't a deep film by any means. Everything that it offers is either recycled or ripped off of other movies such as ""Alien,"" ""Predator"" or such. But when I watch a rip-off, I want it to be good, and this rip-off is great. It opens with a galaxy of stars. Some of the greatest films of all time open with this type of scene - ""2001,"" ""Star Wars,"" ""Alien,"" ""Predator."" A ship is cruising through space when inside the entire cryogenically frozen crew is awoken. The ship has been hit by something. They crash land on a nasty little planet with three suns. Everyone flocks out of the ship when they find that their prisoner transport, Richard Riddick (Vin Diesel), has escaped confinement. They scan the desert planet in search of him and eventually find him, but they have no way of getting their ship to fly again. They search the planet for water and civilization but it seems that everyone suddenly disappeared from the planet not too long ago.Then they find out that every 22 years the planets line up in a solar eclipse and the entire planet turns pitch black. There also happen to be hoards of aliens that thrive in darkness living on the planet - what are the chances? They happen to be on the planet right as the eclipse happens - what are the chances? And Riddick has a rare talent - he can see in the dark - again, what are the chances?There seems to be a lot of coincedence in this movie, but a film like this isn't out to get Oscars for originality or believability. It's there to entertain the audience - it does so with ease. Vin Diesel is a big gorilla of a man with no acting talent whatsoever. But I've got to say if there's anyone who can fit the part of a trashy, homicidal felon it is Diesel. Listen to him mutter, ""He did not know who he was fu**ing with."" Great stuff.The aliens in this movie are a mix between hammerhead sharks, those from ""Alien"" and Predators. They've got long, horizontal heads like a hammerhead, the quick-moving agility of the aliens, and the stealth of a Predator. I assume David Twohy (director and writer of the movie) didn't expect audiences to believe his creatures were truly something never seen before. At least I hope not.""Aliens Redux"" might be a better name for this movie, but then again, it is better than both the second and third ""Alien"" films put together. In a time when apparently ended series are getting revived - ""Terminator 3,"" ""Alien 5,"" ""Predator 3,"" ""Alien vs. Predator"" - ""Pitch Black"" stands out as a new series altogether. Two more sequels are planned. Let's just hope they don't get carried away. I can just picture it twenty-five years from now: ""Aliens vs. Predator vs. Pitch Black Aliens: *The Fight of the Year.""*Fight of the Year title may be shared with the upcoming film ""Freddy vs. Jason vs. Michael vs. Leatherface vs. Norman Bates vs. Alien vs. Predator vs. Terminator vs. James Cameron vs. Barny the Dinosaur.""4/5.",Pitch Black
27,KineticSeoul,The start of a inconic movie anti-hero,7,2 October 2013,"This is a cool sci-fi flick that still holds up today, despite the slight corniness. The main standout aspect of this movie is of course the introduction of a iconic badass anti-hero named Riddick. This film has two stages. The first is when the ship crash lands on a planet with creatures that are afraid of the light. And Riddick escapes from the ship and everyone is on a manhunt for Riddick. The main disappointment with this, is the fact that Riddick gets caught easily. Especially when most of the people in the ship are tourist. The second stage is Riddick and the crew trying the survive and get off the planet. Few parts seem underdeveloped but overall this is a cool and fun sci-fi flick. Thanks to a dangerous, formidable and interesting anti-hero Riddick. Riddick is this stealthy badass ninja like character that can see in the dark. And a lot of the interest comes from not being sure the level of his conscience. This is Vin Diesel's first iconic movie character for a reason, and Vin nails it. To be honest I wouldn't be shocked if the makers of Kratos from ""God of War"" was inspired by the character Riddick when designing the game.7.4/10",Pitch Black
28,sddavis63,A Very Pleasant Surprise; Good Performance By Vin Diesel,7,9 July 2009,"Exciting and interesting from the start, I have to say that while I approached this movie with at best limited expectations I came away from it pleasantly surprised. Vin Diesel is not really my cup of tea as an actor, but in fact he put on a very good performance in this futuristic sci-fi drama as Richard Riddick, a convicted murderer who's being transported to prison on a spaceship that crashlands on a strange alien world. Once there, the survivors discover that there are terrifying creatures who come out only in the dark, which at first doesn't seem much of a problem since the planet has three suns and is never dark. They then discover, though, that the planet is about to go into an eclipse, plunging it into complete darkness for an unknown length of time, and releasing the creatures to hunt them down.Diesel's Riddick ends up as the hero of the movie, because he has surgically enhanced eyesight that allows him to see in the dark, and so he takes on the task of leading the others to safety. This movie is at times frightening, and on the odd occasion graphic, but not gratuitously so. A lot of effort was put by director David Twohy into developing the character of Riddick, and into portraying the change as the others slowly learn to trust him with their lives. I thought it slowed down a bit in the last third or so of the movie, and somehow became less interesting once the creatures were actually released by the eclipse. There seemed to be far more suspense as the survivors tried to figure out some of the mysteries of the planet and as they faced the approaching darkness. Once the darkness came, in some ways the movie became a pretty standard sci-fi monster type of movie. Still, it was a lot better than I had expected it to be. 7/10",Pitch Black
29,paul2001sw-1,Doesn't eclipse 'Alien',7,2 October 2005,"There have been few films as influential as 'Alien' and the first thing to say about 'Pitch Black' is how closely it follows the template laid down by that groundbreaking film. An ensemble cast of characters, landed in circumstances unknown by presumed hostile, try to keep their cool in the face of a growing but undefined sense of unease, but in the finale have to fight to the death with aliens (and traitors among themselves); not all will survive. Add to that a grungy, poorly lit aesthetic and you might consider the film almost a carbon copy. But if you're going to copy a film, then copying one known for it's atmosphere of claustrophobic tension is not such a bad idea, and there's a lot of original detail in 'Pitch Black' as well, some of it good, other bits less so. For example, the central idea is of a spaceship crashing on planet bathed in near-permanent light, thanks to three suns; but on which, like a desert in the rain, all sorts of things come alive when (every twenty years or so) there's a solar eclipse. The three suns also provide three alternative colours of light (before the darkness strikes, of course), which allows director David Twohy three visions for the price of one; but he doesn't seem quite to know what to do with this gift, and while the colour of the world changes from yellow to blue to red, it's unclear what this adds to the film except for a superficial jumpiness. As for the indoor scenes, shot unfailing in half-light only, the use of semi-darkness as a cheap way of creating an air of menace has surely not been this overdone since David Fincher's 'Se7en'. As for the characterisation, the dynamics of a group whose members have their own selfish agendas are well portrayed, but the film lets itself down by making clear its sympathies for two crew members over the others, especially as the two characters it favours are essentially the least believable: vin Diesel's super-criminal Riddick, and the unlikely babelicious ship's commander, played by Radha Mitchell. While the moral darkness of the plot's conclusion is offset by the willingness to grant vin Diesel corny, Schwarzenegger-style lines, usually involving at least one word starting with the letter 'f'. Another flaw is Twohy's exaggerated preference for constant cross-cutting between scenes, which sometimes increases the tension, but sometimes makes the film appear more like a pop video than a movie. He undoubtedly succeeds in capturing an interesting look, but only at the price of also acquiring a certain corollary shallowness.In conclusion, this certainly is not a wholly original film. But it looks good, and is plenty scary. Moreover, the whole somehow feels a little more distinctive than the individual parts. Still, one can't help but feel, this movie is just 'Alien' with better special effects, less judiciously used.",Pitch Black

The plot is simple, and has logic - Survivors of a long distance space crash fight for survival on a three suns planet. They have to face unknown dangers, but also their own characters. Acting is good, violence is never cheap, and the effects prove that you can do a lot with little money. It is worth watching, and better than the sequel('Riddick', after the name of one of the main characters) which was released in 2004. The quality of the cinematography is especially good, from the filtered light of a always lit world to the darkness of an eclipse happening every 22 years. Another interesting and original concept is presenting a group of Muslims in the future - taken into account the stereotypes too often met in recent movies their presence is fresh and different here.

He's better off in smaller movies and in smaller roles. I refuse to watch utter crap like xXx or A Man Apart but he's better than average in Pitch Black. He plays Richard B. Riddick, a convict for massive, infinite crimes that are never defined in the slightest way. This was probably done to add mystery but I say it's bad writing. He's being transported on a spaceship on his way to spacejail but the ship crashes on a desert planet (as the original series of Star Trek proved, most planets are deserts) and he escapes.But hold on, the planet is just entering an extended eclipse that only happens every 22 years. And when pitch blackness falls upon the nameless rock zillions of hungry bat-type thingies come out of hibernation to gobble-up whoever they can.

This movie is essentially a movie comprised of better films! Alien comes to mind immediately when you watch this film. It does have a mind of its own, and there are things to enjoy about this movie. The production design is very impressive, as are the special effects. The creatures are unsettling and offer up plenty of suspense. They did what they could with the modest budget, and I thought they did a good job for the most part. The movie is pretty serious, but there a few times where the humor shines. My favorite is when the crew keeps looking for Riddick, but Riddick keeps one-upping them. There is gore, but a lot of it consists of CGI. I prefer the real thing. The acting is very solid. Vin Diesel will never be considered a great actor. That being said, he has the presence. Riddick is the perfect anti-hero, and I enjoyed Vin's show. His body language is perfect. He is the main reason why I enjoyed a lot of this movie. He was a blast to watch. Radha Mitchell does fine as the heroine. She showed off toughness when needed, as well as the right amount of vulnerability. She conveyed all emotions perfectly. Cole Hauser does what he does best, play a jerk. He's good at it! Keith David is very awkward as the religious person. He's annoying, preachy and has an awful accent to boot. I had a decent time with Pitch Black. It's fun in spurts, throwing in plenty of bang for your buck. Those that love the genre will likely find some things to appreciate about it. Not great, but worth a lookFavorite Quote. William J.

36,The-Sarkologist,Be Afraid of the Dark!,9,18 April 2020,"This is one of those surprisingly awesome films, one that I really don't know how many times that I have seen. I probably did miss it when it was in the cinemas, but then I also suspect that it may have been one of those films that developed a strong following after its release. In a way as a sci-fi horror film there is just so many things that it does right, from the tense scenes to the absolutely gorgeous cinematography, to the character development throughout the film.The film is about the crew of this merchant ship traveling through space, that happens to be loaded with passengers, among other things. Anyway, the ship passes through the tail of a rogue comet, which means that rocks go flying through the hull, and the ship then veers towards this desert planet, and after some heroics, the crew manage to land the ship, though not without loss of life (which is sort of expected in a sci-fi horror film).At first it seems simply like a story about a group stranded on a desert planet where we happen to have this criminal that has escaped custody, but as I suggested it quickly starts to take a number of twists. While it seems like this planet is caught in perpetual daylight, it becomes apparent that this is not always the case, and also, there happens to be all of these nasties that happen to thrive in the dark. It is just during the day (and it seems to be an awfully long day), they are all hidden underground.The characters are all pretty interesting as well, and I won't go into too many details because that certainly does spoil some of the twists that the movie is regularly throwing up at you. Like, yeah, there are some characters that are pretty straight forward, and what you see is what you get, but there are a number of other characters that have some interesting traits, and some hidden flaws. Riddick was obviously a pretty popular character, considering that there are two more movies based around him, however I would argue that he is actually one of the pretty straight forward characters - much of the concern we have with him stems from the agent that has captured him and is returning him to prison. No, it is the other characters that tend to end up throwing curve balls at you, and quite a few of them.I've seen this film a few times, and considering its age, I suspect that it is probably fairly well known, but then again, I also suspect that it has probably fallen back into obscurity with a lot of the people these days. However, I wouldn't be all that surprised if there is a cult following, and this film certainly does deserve it, that do hold it in high regards. Honestly, I'm surprised that I haven't actually written a review on it earlier, considering that it does happen to be one of my favourites, and that I did actually purchased it on DVD. Yeah, it is certainly one worth watching.",Pitch Black

Relatively simple as the premise may be, it is undeniably effective with the film's best moments coming from the crew and passengers scurrying about in fear of Vin Diesel's killer, accidentally shooting one another in the process. The tension is not quite the same once Diesel decides to unite with the group to overcome the vicious alien presence on the planet, but there is still plenty to ponder over as all concerned find it so hard to trust Diesel even in the face of a very real alien threat. As for the alien presence on the planet, it brings up a whole gigantic slate of unanswered, perplexing questions, particularly in relation to their allergy to sunlight. Then there is the amazing coincidence of the characters crash landing just before the planet is about to plunge into several days of complete darkness - but this is a pretty decent film when one focuses on trust/mistrust themes and the portrait of diverse individuals all banded together in the name of a common goal to survive. Diesel is very good too in the role that really kick-started his career; he has an awesome line towards the end about saying good night, and with his blacked-out contact lenses and designer goggles, his character leaves an indelible impression that lasts long after the movie has ended.",Pitch Black
39,Floated2,Solid Sci-Fi Film,6,14 January 2014,"Pitch Black includes a wide cast with its star coming a few moments afterwards and not making much of a presence, but once Riddick (Vin Diesel) enters, the film becomes better. Although I did not care too much for the supporting characters and thought they were in it a little too much in the beginning. If Pitch Black is a likable sci-fi thriller, it's because it has the heart of a '70s disaster movie beneath the horror trappings of computer-generated mutant bats and winged demon aliens.A spacecraft en route to a galaxy called New Mecca has an accident in mid-flight and must land on the hostile terrain of a scorching desert planet (it was filmed in Australia). Fry (Radha Mitchell), a junior pilot, is placed in command when the rest of her flight crew is killed. Just to show she's no Sigourney Weaver-like heroine, one of her first decisions is to jettison the ship's passengers to save herself. A solid sci-fi effort which one can see why people enjoy it.==================================================================== ====================================================================As a rewatch 08/12/17' Pitch Black is a mildly entertaining and interesting sci-fi action film. As we can see why this film has spawned sequels, due to the character of Vin Diesel's Riddick. Although at times this movie is quite dull and not as fascinating visually in today's time compared to when it was released in 2000.",Pitch Black
40,damianphelps,Diesel's Best,10,16 January 2021,"A totally brilliant movie!!This is a wonderful blend of sci-fi, horror and action as Vin Diesel teaches everyone not to mess with him!Diesel brings the appropriate amount of menace to the character and the story that winds around is he a good guy or a bad guy or both. You never really know how he is going to act, right up to the end. This doubt really serves the movie well. Who is the actual enemy is it the aliens or is it Riddick?The style of the movie draws the viewer in and makes you feel like you are on the ground with them, feeling their fears.Totally brilliant movie :)",Pitch Black
41,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Good directing and a great anti-hero keeps ""Pitch Black"" out of sci-fi cellar",5,5 October 2008,"Science-fiction films can be some of the most entertaining and intelligent films ever made and they can also be the cheesiest. ""Pitch Black"" falls somewhere in between, caught between the desire for alien horror flick entertainment and an intriguing concept for suspense and drama.Basically a group of space travelers awake from hypersleep to find their ship crashing. Their captain, Fry (Mitchell) manages to land them without killing them all on an unknown planet with perpetual sunlight. Man-eating aliens inhabit the underground though they are afraid of light, which isn't a problem until the travelers realize they will witness a total eclipse before they can repair a ship to escape on. They've also got a convict named Riddick (Diesel) as cargo.Riddick makes this film, in honesty. Everyone loves a good anti-hero, a guy with a bad rep that lays a beating on everyone and uses others' prejudices about him against them to look really clever. Oh, and a dude with night vision. Diesel gives Riddick the on-screen command his character requires. He comes off as brutish, but somewhat trustworthy. It's strange, but it really works.The rest of the characters aren't so great. Mitchell is a pretty good protagonist, but Cole Hauser, who plays Johns, the arrogant cop, acts like he's intentionally trying to be a poor man's Josh Lucas or Matthew McCoughnahey. It also doesn't help that the characters are under-developed, including Riddick, though that adds to his character in ways despite us wanting to know his past.The concept for this movie is cool, the way it goes from light in the first half to complete darkness in the second and the way that transition corresponds with our thoughts about Riddick is interesting. The plot, in general, is pretty lousy. For some reason, the writers opted to go with the disaster/horror movies formula of the 90s--kill off one person from the group at a time so only the characters that are well-received survive. Yes, there's that and the ""get the fuel back to the ship on time and don't leave anyone behind so we can escape"" cliché. David Twohy really saves the plot in those regards by keeping things interesting. He does some interesting shots that involve a lot of quick, simultaneous cuts and close ups--a more radical style that definitely works for sci-fi. In general, the color palette is very carefully chosen with the light and dark contrast and overall the special effects were very satisfactory for 2000""Pitch Black"" is not a consummate suspense or sci-fi thriller, but it does keep you interested enough to want to know more about Riddick or what else the imagination of ""Pitch Black"" has drafted. Basically, what could have ended up really ""b-movie-esque"" and terribly cliché and awful ends up solid thanks to some good decisions by Twohy.",Pitch Black
42,Anonymous_Maxine,"This movie had so much potential, but it wound up being just another boring bad guy hero movie with cheesy special effects.",2,11 March 2000,"There was just too much corny tough guy stuff in this movie for it to be regarded as anything more than something to keep your eyes busy for a couple hours (""He didn't know who he was f**kin' with""). Way to go Vin, you sure showed that alien who is boss. But who cares? The special effects in this movie were a terrible attempt to make up for lousy acting, and they weren't even very good. The best effect they probably had was the extremely high-key lighting to give the effect of multiple suns. But the acting and even the story were definitely mediocre.If you find yourself sitting in the theater and Pitch Black is about to start, you might as well sit through it. It's worth that much. Just make sure you didn't pay real money to get in.",Pitch Black
43,Vartiainen,Are you afraid of the dark?,6,12 May 2020,"Pitch Black is the first film in the so called Riddick saga, featuring Vin Diesel as the titular main character, Richard B. Riddick, and David Twohy as director slash producer. The films are noted for their dark aesthetic and their focus on an almost unlikable antihero, who nevertheless manages to garner your sympathy and support.And as far as debut films go, I've seen far worse. It's a niche scifi film that chooses to focus on a small crew of survivors stranded on a desert planet where night is fast approaching and hunters eagerly await the fall of darkness. No one has a clear idea of what to do and now they have a certified killer, Riddick, on the loose.Where the film shines is the execution of its main idea. Its modest budget is very well utilized and the character roster is a strong one. Diesel's Riddick has gathered a cult following, but I also really liked Radha Mitchell as Carolyn Fry, the leader of the survivors.The film also uses lighting amazingly. The title of the film refers to a long action set piece near the end of the film where the characters have wade through literal pitch black darkness while avoiding attacks and pursuit. And it is a glorious scene. One of the best of its kind.I wouldn't call Pitch Black anything groundbreaking, but it has enough style and substance to stand on its own feet and withstand the ravages of time. Recommended for all fans of darker science fiction.",Pitch Black
44,FiendishDramaturgy,I Was Surprised,7,21 March 2007,"Let's face it. David Twohy has written some good screen plays, and he has also put out some real stinkers. I didn't know quite what to expect with this work, but what I didn't expect was this gritty, fresh science fiction work. I don't know that this will make ""cult classic"" status, but in my opinion, it should.The characters, while vile-mouthed, are enigmatic; the story, which has been classified by some as a rip off to ""Alien,"" has been done before, and done well, but that didn't detract from my enjoyment of this work. The aliens themselves more closely resembled those of Starship Troopers than Alien, but I believe those other critics were indicating the plot, rather than the creature effects themselves.All in all? It delivers. I found it highly enjoyable, and quite frankly, it caught me by surprise.It rates a 7.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",Pitch Black
45,jamesrupert2014,Good science-fiction adventure,7,17 March 2018,"A crippled spaceship lands on a planet with three suns that only experiences darkness once every 22 years, things come out in the dark, and the crew must fight for survival, or die - that pretty much sums up ""Pitch Black"". The concept of a planet bathed in (almost) continuous light was the premise of Asimov's classic short story ""Nightfall"", but rather than being our own worst enemy, the ""Pitch Black"" planet is home to fierce, flying nocturnal carnivores. As space adventures go, this one is pretty good. The look of the glaringly illuminated desert planet is very well done and the various backgrounds (the bone filled canyon and the hollow towers for example) look great. The acting is what one would expect for this kind of movie, lots of gruff tough-guy posturing, semi-comic relief from the less-heroic characters, and the usual alien-chow that only live long enough to establish the threat. Vin Diesel's 'Riddick' character was so popular that he front-lined a couple of less-than-stellar 'sequels', but I didn't find that he was any more interesting that the rest of the main cast. Of course, the raison d'etre for this kind of film are the aliens, which, although usually only seen briefly, in the shadows, or through Riddick's enhanced eyes, are excellent. The plot does hang on some coincidences such as the crash occurring just hours before one of the rare eclipses and the abandoned geology base having an orrery (a somewhat archaic tool for an interplanetary mission) that conveniently explains the whole three-sun eclipse scenario, but those are minor problems in an otherwise pretty good story.",Pitch Black
46,dfranzen70,Imperfect Pitch,6,7 November 2000,"A spaceship crash-lands on a desolate planet. Now the survivors must face the unknown - and each other - in a never-ending game of terror.Sound familiar? Okay, maybe a little. But there are a couple of hooks in this movie. One is that the planet these guys have landed on has three suns, and wouldn't ya know it all three suns are about ready to align, plunging the planet into a complete and lasting darkness. Add to this creepy setting a malicious convict named Riddick (Vin Diesel) who's gone to the trouble of having his eyeballs surgically altered so he can see in the dark, the better to sneak up on you, my dear. This is explained to us rather poignantly early on, and of course his eyesight becomes useful later on.
There are two ways to look at this movie - either as generic drama, powered by a plot, or as a horror film. Those of you looking at it as a horror film already have low standards (admit it!), so you won't be disappointed. I don't mean to belittle you, but let's face it - when you want to sit down to a good horror film, the story isn't always a top priority. You want stuff that'll scare you! If you're looking at this as a drama - man versus self, man versus alien planet, and so forth - you still won't be disappointed. In short, there are two things going for this - an excellent use of special effects (and, consequently, a great sense of what's creepy) and a solid plot. You can't go wrong. To complicate matters, the remaining humans - now deep in darkness, with only flares, flashlights, etc. to help them - are besieged by nasty flying alien creatures who only attack in the dark. Seeing the ripe and ready flesh of the humans must seem like an all-you-can-eat buffet to the aliens. And if the outside threat isn't enough, our heroes have to deal with Riddick, who's released from his chains early on. Will he kill them all? Will aliens slaughter them in their sleep?I won't get into the acting except to say that I have movie posters in my house that have more emotion and personality. And the script itself - the dialog sounds as if it were written by a high-schooler. But there are a lot of genuinely startling moments, and there's a magnificent atmosphere to the whole deal. You never get to settle in to the movie, and that's key to a horror film, in my book. At no point did I have a chance to sit back and notice how bad the acting was, and that's quite a feat. So, in short, you can either look at this movie super-critically (in which case you won't be pleased, unless you delight in finding fault!) or simply go with the flow. It's a scary ride, folks, because you don't know what you'll run into when it's dark.",Pitch Black
47,dee.reid,Time for a switch,8,22 August 2004,"""Pitch Black"" is a visually-dazzling sci-fi thriller that pretends to be the same as most ""Alien"" knockoffs, but is instead something else altogether. It dares to be excellent in the face of intense criticism - those who contend that the film owes a lot to its predecessors, which indeed it does - may eat their own words when they see what an excellent job was done with the story.Though ""Pitch Black"" surprised many audiences in 2000, it was met with a lot of mixed praise; I didn't pay much attention to it and the hype surrounding the movie had soon faded from my attention. When the ""Pitch Black - Unrated Director's Cut"" DVD was released just a few months ago as to rake in pennies from the inevitable hype for ""The Chronicles of Riddick,"" my interest was renewed.""Chronicles"" chronicled the downfall of summer movies (I wasn't going to see it anyway, but the free ticket that came with the ""Pitch Black"" DVD burned a whole in my wallet; plus the movie was dumbed down to ""PG-13"" from an original ""R"" rating, meaning that more scenes of character development and graphic violence were removed to cater to teenage fanboys). The best thing to be said about ""Chronicles"" really, was that the production design and visual effects were quite impressive.""Pitch Black"" offers something more in the way of characters, that you actually care about them and when you rooted for that bad ass Riddick (Vin Diesel), those feelings were genuine. You actually got scared when all the lights went out and the small band of survivors led by Riddick and the unwilling captain of the downed spaceship (Radha Mitchell) had to make it to safety in total blackness because bloodthirsty, nocturnal creatures were on their tail the whole time.The director, David N. Twohy, created a beautiful, nightmarish place - this sun-scorched desert planet that's roasted for an undetermined amount of time by not one, not two, but three suns. Twohy was a master with ""Pitch Black,"" especially since his only previous directorial effort was the alien invasion thriller ""The Arrival,"" with Charlie Sheen, back in 1996.The characters in ""Pitch Black"" aren't fodder for the monsters; they're people with real feelings and emotions. You feel sympathy for Radha Mitchell's character, who quickly finds herself stuck in a really nasty situation and is also the unwilling leader of these survivors. And though this should be her movie, it's really Vin Diesel's, who would go on four years later to make ""Chronicles,"" which really has nothing to do with this film, as it is more influenced by the subculture (comics, cartoons, etc.) that has amassed around the character since 2000.""Pitch Black,"" despite some of its minor flaws (some pacing problems, a little uneven storytelling), is still a remarkable film nonetheless and I'm sure it's destined for some kind of cult status.8/10",Pitch Black
48,drqshadow-reviews,"A Low Budget, But High Effort, 90s Sci-Fi / Horror Combo Pack",6,16 July 2021,"Shipwrecked on a desert planet, the survivors of a doomed commercial spacecraft explore the sharp sand dunes and bleached alien skeletons of a foreign landscape, seeking water and, with luck, the means to escape or send an intergalactic SOS. They aren't many in number, and even that sum soon begins to dwindle as untimely seasons shift and the sky falls into a months-long eclipse, instantly unleashing flocks of wild, hungry native night-hunters from their subterranean lairs.Fortunately, one of the survivors is well-equipped for precisely this situation. Riddick, a violent prisoner headed for the high-security slammer, boasts extensive combat experience and a set of augmented eyes that work best in the dark. Vin Diesel is effortlessly cool in that part, one which clearly evolved during the writing process to grow from a simple, gimmicky tough guy stereotype into a well-rounded, wonderfully unpredictable instigator who throws the plot over one shoulder and almost single-handedly hikes it down the home stretch. We don't always like him, but we're constantly intrigued by him, and Diesel (in his breakthrough role) really makes the most of that duality. He's not just grunting and grinding; he's assessing and scheming, too, with the physical performance just as essential as the strong, fluid character writing.The rest of the show is a little more mixed. It's an obviously over-performing low-budget science fiction / horror film, so some slips can be expected. Much of the egregious stuff is masked with low-grade film techniques or by abusing quick jump cuts and extreme close-ups. What serious special effects there are vary from shockingly effective (Riddick's tense, quiet staredown with one of the monsters) to downright bad (all exterior shots of the ship). It's efficient, though, visually ambitious and thematically novel. Those virtues, plus one star-grade acting performance, add up to a bit better than average in my book.",Pitch Black
49,Fluke_Skywalker,Not just another an Alien knockoff,7,20 April 2017,"Plot; A ship crash lands on a planet where deadly, night roaming creatures may not be the greatest threat.There are several elements that keep Pitch Black from being just another in a long line of Alien knockoffs, but the strongest of these is the character of Riddick. Vin Diesel may have the range of a spitball, but when it's in his wheelhouse he can crush it, as he does here. His Riddick is more than just an antihero, he's the straw that stirs the drink. Riddick is surrounded by some strong characters, all with satisfying arcs and little sections of turf to call their own. The film itself is tight and lean, with no wasted motion. The f/x are shoddy at times, but that's to be expected from a low budget sci-fi/horror film from the early 00's. What really matters is the execution, and here it's nearly pitch perfect.",Pitch Black

Yes, there are some serious plot coincidences (like most movies) and you could say that this material ""has been done before."" (again like most movies) But the pacing was good, the tension level high, the creature effects decent. Good acting by a number of actors I had never heard of before. Vin Diesel was suitably menacing. And I have to give a rave about Radha Mitchell's performance. I hope she gets some more good roles, so I can see more of her. Grade: A",Pitch Black
51,jimbo-53-186511,Pitch Black is another example of a film where the special FX are the real stars of the show,3,7 January 2017,"A transport ship carrying around 40 passengers crash-lands on an unknown planet and only 11 people survive the crash. The survivors of the crash are initially concerned about one of the survivors of the crash namely Richard B Riddick (Vin Diesel) as he is a dangerous and violent criminal that they have been transporting who manages to set himself free after the crash. However, when the planet that they crash-land on is plunged into a month-long period of darkness, the survivors soon learn that Riddick may be their only hope of survival when a group of flesh-eating aliens try to take them all out one by one...To me, Pitch Black is an example of a potentially good film that unfortunately has been placed in the hands of the wrong director. In order to work, films like Pitch Black need to have tension, suspense, dynamism and strong characterisation and it's clear from a very early stage that you are not going to get any of that here.Pitch Black is clearly trying to set itself up as a modern day Alien type film, but Twohy has none of the skills that Ridley Scott or James Cameron were able to serve up with the first two Alien films. I'll admit that the first 20 minutes or so were relatively suspenseful, but it's clear that after Twohy's rather clichéd 'cloak and dagger approach' in respect of introducing Riddick to the story that he had nowhere really to go and completely fails to develop or improve upon the story. When watching Pitch Black there is just no spark, no dynamism and nothing interesting about the story or the characters. Even the character of Riddick is poorly developed and I'm sure that he could have been made more interesting with a better director or writing crew.The last few lines in the above paragraph really sum up the problems with this film; if your narrative's success is dependent on its characters then it's generally a good idea to make at least one or two of them interesting - this is what made Alien and Aliens both work because you cared about the characters and actually gave a damn about what happened, but in Pitch Black the characters are as lifeless as the planet that they crash-land on and if I'm honest I found it a bit of a struggle getting to the finish line with this one.The performances aren't great either with no-one really making much of an impact (no pun intended). Vin Diesel should have been great in this sort of role, but I felt that he was slightly hampered by being a rather poorly written character. Everyone else here was just as bland and unmemorable.One final thing that made me laugh about this film is its ridiculous plot contrivance; our prisoner happens to have had his eyes surgically altered so that he can see better in the dark after being denied sunlight for lengthy periods. He then finds himself crash-landed on a planet that ends up being plunged into darkness for a month??? I can suspend some disbelief, but that is quite a ridiculous coincidence don't you think??? Pitch Black is rubbish, but it's not even enjoyable rubbish and in my opinion you're better off watching either Alien or Aliens because they at least are both entertaining, tense and rewarding pieces of cinemas which are qualities that certainly cannot be attributed to Pitch Black.",Pitch Black
52,kirbylee70-599-526179,IF YOU CAN'T FIND SOMETHING NEW...,10,21 December 2020,"With the whole pandemic situation taking place Hollywood has halted production on everything they were creating. In addition to that, theaters were shut down. Only now are both beginning to start up again. In the meantime the release of no new movies meant that there weren't any new DVDs being released either. Sure there were some movies that had been shelved, most of them low budget flicks, but nothing noteworthy for the most part. So what does that leave to watch being released now? Old movies being given new life by companies like Arrow Video.I've praised Arrow in the past but that's because they always do an amazing job with their releases. They search for the best print available, take the time to make a pristine transfer and add on plenty of extras to keep fans happy. This week they've turned loose a 2000 release that while watching I realized I'd forgotten how good it was. The movie also featured a breakout performance by its lead actor that led to superstardom for him. The movie is PITCH BLACK.In the future a spaceship called the Hunter-Gratzner is transporting passengers in a cryogenic state. When a meteor shower rips through the hull the crew is awakened, the captain killed by one of the tiny meteors. Now in charge Carolyn Fry (Rhada Mitchell) attempts to land the ship on a planet they are cascading towards. The crash of the ship kills most on board with only a handful surviving. Among the survivors is prisoner Richard Riddick, one of the most feared murderers in the universe.The survivors split, some burying the dead while others search the landscape of this barren planet, sandy and hot, hoping to find water. As their search moves forward they discover the graveyard of giant animal bones and a base in the distance. The base gives them hope with a small shuttle there in need of power cells, ones they can transport from their crashed ship. But something else is here as well.At the crashed ship digging a hole for the dead one of the survivors finds a hole in the ground. Checking it out, he is sucked in by something, something hungry. When the others show they find Riddick there, free and telling them the death wasn't his doing. When Carolyn goes into the hole to find out what happens she discovers a number of creatures living beneath the surface and barely escaping them.It isn't long before the group figures out the creatures can only come out in darkness. At the same time they find out the planet is about to go dark during an eclipse that will last days. They rush to transport the cells to the shuttle, one by one being picked off as the darkness grows and the creatures surface. Finding they need him Riddick is freed and all of them work together. But who will survive?The movie qualifies as a science fiction film but in truth it's more than that. There is the sense of a thriller here, trying to find out who or what is killing them off. There is the character study of a dangerous man who may or may not find redemption in helping others. There is the horror element with the fear of the dark and what lies in it. All of this combines to make a satisfying movie experience for all.Arrow is not only releasing this film in blu-ray format but in 4K HD as well. But the extras...wow. They include an archive commentary track by director David Twohy and stars Vin Diesel and Cole Hauser, an archive commentary track with Twohy, producer Tom Engelman and visual effects supervisor Peter Chiang, NIGHTFALL: THE MAKING OF PITCH BLACK a new interview with Twohy, new interviews with cast members Rhiana Griffith and Claudia Black, cinematographer David Eggby, visual effects supervisor Chiang, and composer Graeme Revell. There is a making of featurette, a comparison between the CG tests and the final footage, additional behind the scenes material, archive bonus features from the 2004 release of the film on disc, a short prequel narrated by Cole Hauser as John detailing his hunt for Riddick, THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK: DARK FURY an animated short film that bridges this film with the second of the trilogy THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK, DARK FURY bonus features, SLAM CITY a motion comic from the film's official website, INTO PITCH BLACK a TV special about what took place before and after the events of the film, RAVEWORLD: PITCH BLACK EVENT footage of a dance music event held to promote the film, theatrical trailers plus trailers for the two other films in the trilogy and the video game, image galleries, a reversible sleeve with newly commissioned artwork by Luke Preece and for the first pressing only a collector's booklet with writing by Simon Ward on the creature designs, production notes and an interview with Vin Diesel.All of these extras are enough to make picking this release up worth the money. But if the movie isn't good then why bother? The fact is that the movie IS just that good. If you don't remember how good then you need to see it again. If you've never seen it you need to do so. It launched the career of Diesel but it's more than that. It's solid entertainment.",Pitch Black

It's a great mix of Horror & sci-fi with lots of suspense & a nice deserted eerie atmosphere.
Vin Diesel is Awesome & Cool as hell as tough Criminal ""Riddick"" he's like a character from the universe of ""John Carpenter"" a little bit of the iconic ""Snake Pliskin"" is in there & the fact he's an Anti-Hero with a criminal past!!! Vin is great in this role & this was my first introduction to the cool voiced future Action star, we also have an excellent ensemble cast with Vin, we've got the always good ""Keith David"" a star of John Carpenters ""The Thing"" & ""They Live"" & we have in the form of a tough chick ""Radha Mitchell"" as the 2nd main lead & she's great but for me the 2nd best character & performance after ""Riddick"" comes from the excellent Cole Hauser as ""Johns"" the equally tough & troubled Bounty hunter transporting his prisoner ""Riddick"" back to civilisation, it's a great intense & lively role for the underrated Hauser as he goes from cool,calm & in control to panicked & Angry often, he's a really interesting & conflicted character he's sly & corrupted by not totally evil, a great performance.The Creatures are Awesome looking, Night time sharp looking bat & shark type things, a really cool monster design & very creepy creatures that move very quickly & hunt in the dark.Pitch Black is an Awesome old school type of Sci-fi Horror film, it could've easily come out in the 80's as it's got that look & vibe to it, the lost desert planet they crash on looks like the wastelands of ""Mad Max"" so it's got a real cinematic vision that feels like we know it!!!
There's plenty of excellent action scenes & plenty of cool monster attacks & some cool character bits especially the fight between ""Riddick"" & ""Johns"" a cool little scene.All in all ""Pitch Black"" is a Gem of the sci-fi Horror genre, it fits in there with films like ""Aliens"" ""Predator 1&2"" & other Classic's of that genre.I've loved this since the vhs days & it's one of those films that if you haven't seen it in years, you watch it & can't believe how good it is!!!

He couldn't be more unlike the ridiculous characters of spaghetti Westerns who don't make a bit of sense. He is more akin to John Russell of HOMBRE. In fact, this movie's style is based on its strength of character development. There is a lot of action, and the characters are extremely credible, even if the plot is somewhat flimsy. But that's okay, because this is a movie which puts real people in an unbelievable situation, which is far superior to a movie which puts unbelievable people in a believable situation.",Pitch Black

58,Enchorde,Great in almost all aspects...,8,24 August 2004,"** HERE BE SPOILERS **A lonely spaceship carrying cargo and some passengers come off course and crashes upon a desert planet with three suns blazing at it. Eternal day. Naturally, the ship become a total wreck and the struggle firstly to find water and food and then rescue themselves start. In their search they find an abandoned settlement. But where did the settlers go?Pitch Black is surprisingly good. First, the characters see to be well worked out with deceptive layers and interesting past histories. I could really feel that these were a mix of strangers suddenly forced to cooperate. Most interesting of these are the characters of convict Riddick (Diesel), mercenary Johns (Hauser) and pilot Fry (Mitchell) and the tension and relationship that these evolve between themselves. The actors, those mentioned and the others, perform very well, giving their characters credibility and contributing to the story. Mix in some great cuts and edits from the director/crew and the story is told with humor and suspense. There are some gems to watch out for in the details, both in cinematic aspects and in the dialog. Even the special effects is very good, used well so that the become an integrated part of the story, not standing alone.Does the movie have any flaw, unfortunately yes. There are some purely scientific aspects that I have questions about, like the formation of the solar system, and the creation (and possible end) of the eclipse. However, even if they are a main part in the background of the story they are not rally important for the story itself. One might just ignore them as cool errors.So, anyone who like either sci-fi and or thriller should enjoy this one very much.8/10",Pitch Black
59,Agent10,Better than I expected,7,6 May 2002,"Going in, I thought this movie would be some schlockfest. Two hours later, I was rather surprised. While some will call this an Aliens' knock-off, I see as something much more. Its more jarring, just as intense, and just as unique as Alien. Every character had their little background story, which is something that is rarely ever dealt with when it comes to flashy, sci-fi epics. Vin Deisal's performance finally sold me on his talent, and could be the next Arnold Schwarzeneger (and he even has a better voice!). The scene where he is eye to eye with the flying beast is simply heart-stopping! Who would have the guts to do something like that! David Twohy made quite a gem. Now the real question: Will anyone ever remember it? I hope so.",Pitch Black
60,a_chinn,The film sci-fi/action flick that introduced the world to Vin Diesel,9,16 August 2021,"Very suspenseful sci-fi action film is essentially ""Assault on Precinct 13"" in space, but while the story lacks originality, I'd consider it the most suspenseful sci-fi film film since ""Alien"" or ""Aliens."" From writer/director David Twohy (writer of ""The Fugitive"" and writer/director of ""The Arrival"" and the underrated WWII submarine ghost story ""Below), the story involves a transport ships crash landing on a seemingly deserted planet. When they discover the planet has deadly creatures who only come out at night and that a month long eclipse is about to happen, our heroes are in for a lot of trouble. The heroes include a scrappy female pilot, the excellent Radha Mitchell, a bounty hunter, Cole Hauser, who is transporting an infamous killer, Richard B. Riddick, played by Vin Diesel in his star-making role. Diesel steals every scene and he deservedly became a star following this film's release, landing roles in ""Fast and the Furious"" and ""xXx."" Twohy's script has a number of unexpected twists I don't want to spoil, but the film has a bit of an Agatha Christie ""And Then There Were None"" vibe with a rogues gallery of characters that is a lot of fun. The most interesting of of the supporting characters is Keith David (""They Live"" ""The Thing"" ""Platoon"") as a holy man. My main complaint about the film is the amount of time it takes to get to the dark (almost 60 minutes). I also didn't care for the harsh photography during the sunlit scenes, which were done to contrast to the later dark scenes, but I didn't care for the bleached blown-out look. However, those are fairly minor quibbles for what is otherwise a smart, suspenseful film that boasts a dynamite performance form Vin Diesel. A must see for sci-fi fans!",Pitch Black
61,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Fun Little Alien Sci-Fi Horror Film,7,25 March 2020,"This film I remember when it was released to the movie channels, but didn't actually see all the way through until this viewing to be honest. I'd seen parts as well as the sequel, but never actually watched it beginning to end. This is an intriguing one that has Vin Diesel during his heyday. The synopsis is a commercial transport ship and its crew are marooned on a planet full of bloodthirsty creatures that only come out to feast at night. But then, they learn that a month-long eclipse is about to occur.We begin with some voice-over narration done by Diesel. He talks about being the animal and some other things, revealing some of his characters thoughts and how he operates. He is on a spaceship as it travels toward its destination. The crew is woke early when they run into a meteorite shower. They are pelting the ship and actually kill the captain. The other two crew members help right the problem, preventing it's destruction. One of them is Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell) and the other is Greg Owens (Simon Burke).Carolyn takes over the controls and the ship crash lands on a planet. She dumps as much as she can from the ship, trying to get it righted, but they're still too heavy. She comes to the moral decision that she is going to dump the passengers of the ship in order to save it, but there's a malfunction. It crashes and we get some survivors.Of the survivors is a bounty hunter, William J. Johns (Cole Hauser), and a religious man, Abu 'Imam' al-Walid (Keith David). There's a collector Paris P. Ogilvie (Lewis Fitz-Gerald), Sharon 'Shazza' Montgomery (Claudia Black) and teenage boy Jack (Rhiana Griffith). There is also John 'Zeke' Ezekiel (John Moore) and three boys that are following Imam. There is also Diesel who is Richard B. Riddick. He is handcuff to a post while they try to find a way off this planet. It should also be pointed out that he has escaped from prison, is a murderer and has had a surgery on his eyes so he can see in the dark.The planet is covered in desert. At first they believe that it has two suns, but as one goes to set, a third one appears. It seems that this planet is never covered in darkness. It is pointed out to everyone that Riddick is dangerous and they should stay away from him. They start their search for water and a way off this island.Riddick ends up freeing himself by dislocating his shoulder and grabbing a nearby blowtorch. He flees into the wilderness. William is upset and starts to look for him. Zeke is tasked with burying the dead and digs a hole. Riddick ends up back to where he is and watches as he is attacked by a creature in a hole that he uncovered. Jack also sees what happened.This causes the survivors to blame Riddick. Carolyn isn't buying it and wants to get to the truth. The more they explore the planet, they realize there is something wrong here and things are made worse with an epic eclipse coming that only happens once every 22 years. They need to band together to survive or fall victim to these monsters.To start this off, I have to say that when this film first came out, I figured it was just going to be another sci-fi action film, but this one is actually pretty solid. This is one of the first films with Diesel that I saw and made me like him. He does well in his role and I would say across the board everyone does as well. I really like the idea of him as a space criminal and that he had a surgery on his eyes that allows him to see in the dark, for the reason though that he is in prison where it's always dark. The core group with him is Mitchell, who I think is solid in everything I've seen her in. David is a legend for me in cinema and Hauser really just plays angry characters well. They all round this movie out for what is needed.A problem I do have with the story is the lack of interaction with the creatures themselves. We don't get to really learn much about these aliens outside that Riddick discovers they have a blind spot and he exploits that near the end. I also found it odd that only one is really killed by anybody and it is Riddick with a knife. I understand this is to show his dominance. We just have characters like William and Imam, that are played by veteran action movie actors, I think we should have gotten a bit more.I thought the aliens were scary and despite being CGI which didn't look horrible. This film does a great job at making you feel like there is very little chance of them making it out alive, which and that works. We never see them really getting the upper hand, which is something else I enjoy. I thought it was shot well in building that up and using darkness to its advantage. The cinematography is used strategically for that.I'd like to preface that I really like this film, but I did find myself a little bit bored right after the eclipse happens. It takes them a little bit before they decide to try to make it back to the ship there going to use for escape. There were also some lulls early in the film right after they crashed that had me waiting for something to happen. The ending was good for me as well. One final thing I will add here as well was that this film does a great job at showing us who is good and bad in the beginning, but we slowly see this change which I love seeing in a film.Now with that said, I would recommend this film. If you are into horror films that involve aliens and take place on distant planets, this one is up your alley I'd say. The acting is good, the concept is solid and the story isn't bad, but could have been better. There is some good action and there are quite a few deaths in this one. It does have a depressing feel of there is no way they survive, which I really liked as well. If you're a big fan of Diesel, I would also say to give this a viewing as it is enjoyable for sure. I did find this to be above average.",Pitch Black
62,Samiam3,"Enjoyable, but something's missing",6,3 August 2010,"Pitch Black is entertaining, but it feels underdone . It is a great looking film, no doubt there. Twohy has a great eye for color shape and texture, and he directs the film quite nicely, with a mindset toward mystique and subtlety, (which helps generate shock moments, because they come harder). However, there are still a lot of blanks to fill in. The storyline is shallow, and the characters (despite being likable people) are poorly defined, especially Vin Diesel. There is also a fairly strong sense of anti-climax. When all is said and done, Pitch Black is entertaining as a sci-fi, but it could probably use some energy, and a slightly stronger screenplay.",Pitch Black
63,davidmvining,"Neither scary, not involving, it's just kind of meh",5,10 May 2021,"I've never quite understood this movie's appeal. It's fine as a little sci-fi thriller. It works on a purely technical level narratively, but it's not the most engaging thing in the world. It's not terribly scary, or emotional, or thought provoking. It's okay but over stylized and unfocused.In the future, a commercial interstellar ship with everyone in cryogenic sleep and months away from their destination runs into a the trail of a rogue comet, killing the captain and sending the ship on a crash course for a backwaters planet in the middle of nowhere. The pilot, Radha Mitchell's Fry, manages to crash land the ship safely enough to save herself and several of the passengers, even after trying to dump the entire passenger compliment in an effort to even out the ship. Together with the survivors, she has to find a way to survive and get off the rock.What's interesting about the film from a point a couple of decades removed from the original release and after the release of two sequels is that Fry is actually the central character. Marketing and the sequels would tell you that it's Richard B. Riddick, Vin Diesel's growling anti-hero with sunglass goggles perpetually attached to his head. Reading up on the history of the production, Fry being the hero extended to the originally scripted ending, but as production started everyone realized that Riddick had the potential for sequels instead of Fry, and they rewrote the ending to replace the focus on Riddick rather than Fry. This ends up feeling kind of unnatural to the story.Fry has to learn to lead this ragtag group of survivors (all with different motives and desires, creating a discordant effect on the overall story that I find distracting), to go from trying to dump all of the passengers to fighting to save as many as she can. This is a strong arc to build a story on. That she's suddenly cast aside in the movie's final moments for a character that was obviously designed as a secondary character is odd. Riddick is an escaped felon and murdered, captured by Johns, a bounty hunter (""merc""), and released from his chains in a desperate effort to survive.The group finds a geological research station nearby and an escape vessel that needs just enough power from their ship in order to fly, but no one is around. Something happened to the people who manned it, and with the escape ship still there, they didn't leave. The planet is in perpetual sunlight with three suns, but they are due for a once in every twenty-two years eclipse that will send the planet in total darkness for a long time. Combined with the monsters they discover in the tunnels under the surface that flee from the sunlight, this is a recipe for disaster unless they can get that escape vessel running.This is all fine. The coincidence of landing right before the next eclipse is the sort of things that stories are built off of, so I can't complain too much about that. The stakes are clear and the path towards the resolution of the plot mechanics is unambiguous. My problems really are with the character based storytelling.I think it was a mistake to have the group of survivors being so ragtag and unconnected to each other. There's nothing connecting these people except the desire to get off the planet. Then they're all pretty thinly drawn, and the path to the resolution doesn't bring their desires together in any meaningful way. It doesn't help that this is essentially an Alien clone and the object is to pick off characters in genre satisfying ways more than telling a story. Their base desires as characters never merge in the rare instance when they even come to the surface. Sharon is a tough woman who might be going to a new space settlement. Paris is an antiques dealer with a bunch of booze (that survives the crash in a sarcophagus somehow) who wants...to die in Paris? I think. Jack is a young kid that suddenly idolizes Riddick. Riddick is a convict who wants to be free of his chains. Johns is a merc who wants to capture Riddick for the money and, maybe, another unstated reason. This is chaotic, and I think it would have been better to condense a lot of these. Make it Riddick, Johns, Fry, and a small group of settlers. Interconnect their desires so they all want variations on something similar (like freedom), and make the fight to survive a fight for that, providing a far more interesting subtext. Instead there's no subtext and it's just random people getting picked off by aliens while Riddick growls.There's appeal to that. The aliens are interesting in concept and designed well, even if the late-90s computer generated imagery can only go so far. The kills are gruesome in a fun way. The clear line of the plot keeps things from getting unnecessarily confusing. I just don't really engage with the film. It's fine, but it feels wrong in a couple of ways. I spent half the movie bored and the other half mildly interested.",Pitch Black
64,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A well developed sci-fi horror film,8,15 July 2014,"Sometimes being known for only a few things can benefit an individual greatly. Vin Diesel has the luxury of this phenomena. Most of time, when actors become known for doing the same roles, they become forgotten and non-existent. So in order to break free of that, the actor takes on new and different roles to either round out their skills or grab their fans attention. Jim Carrey was like this early on in his career. Originally, he was the funnyman with hits like Dumb & Dumber (1994), Ace Venture: Pet Detective (1994) and The Mask (1994). But then he went on to do The Truman Show (1998) which was a totally different step for him. Again, Vin Diesel hasn't had any problems sticking to what he's good at. This franchise and The Fast and the Furious (2001) series continue to cement him in Hollywood fame without having to take on completely different roles. He has tried but they never took off.Here, Vin Diesel plays his second best known character to that of Dominic Toretto - Richard B. Riddick, a convicted killer who's got nothing to lose. While being transported, the ship ends up crash landing on a foreign planet with flying Dracula hammerhead shark like creatures. The catch is that they only come out at night. And the crew that is stranded is just in luck because a full eclipse is on its way. Ahh,...gotta love how convenient these situations happen. But for writing, convenience is the only problem. The rest is a well-written script that develops its main cast to the point of where they must come to grips with certain events that possibly audiences may not see coming. I know I wasn't, the actions of certain individuals continued to keep me guessing. This is important because that means it can keep the attention of its audience with ease. Plus, with the element of the unknown and high tension continuously keeps viewers on their toes.Diesel as Riddick is convincing enough. He has snarky dialog and definitely has a presence that's hard to find boring. In charge of the rest of the crew is Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell) and although at times she's not sure of herself, she does become strong over time. Then there's her second in command William Johns (Cole Hauser) who has a grudge to settle with Riddick. His interactions with Diesel are comical at times because of how much they resent each other. Adding to the story is Abu 'Imam' al-Walid played by Keith David who adds a bit of a religious agenda into the mix. For him at least, he too as a character is tested, not only by the creatures but also by his peers. It is these kinds of moments that are critical in defining characters and not making them feel all the same.The special effects for 2000 are good at points. The alien creatures don't look recycled but visually, they do look fake at times when it came to CGI. There are physical props but most of it is CGI, which makes it less frightening. The action and gore are commendable. Vin Diesel has the chops for such requirements. The cinematography by David Eggby looks great. For the planets terrain, it looked and felt very dry. I do question the color scheme at times. It would swap between yellow and blue. Both looked great but just one should've been picked. Graeme Revell's score to the film is interesting. It incorporates tribal drums to match Diesel's prologue of animal instincts but other than that, it feels light. No theme or tune was memorable. Come on Revell, you're better than this. Altogether still a very satisfying franchise entry.The writing contains highly developed characters that will keep its audience guessing until the very end, along with its unique creatures. The only parts that feel weak are some of the visuals and Graeme Revell's musical score.",Pitch Black
65,Rob_Taylor,It makes a change to see a film where you really don't know who will survive.,10,17 December 2002,"This is a very underrated movie and worth a look even if your not a fan of the genre.The plot is rather similar to Aliens, and like that movie the cast are apparently stuck on the planet with the aliens. However, these aliens only come out in darkness and darkness on this world lasts for many years! Despite the plot plagiarism, this movie still stands up on its own. The aliens are different enough to be interesting and the characters are not just ""bug-fodder"" like the marines in Aliens. There is a plot hole concerning the ecosystem in which the aliens exist and what they survive on between the periods of darkness, and what they eat when they haven't got nice juicy humans to snack on, but one can simply say ""each other"" and be reasonably satisfied with the answer. The film is so good that this minor hole is easily ignored.The cast are all excellent, especially Keith David as the obligatory holy man who puts his faith in God to deliver him. Radha Mitchell is also good as a kind of wannabee Ellen Ripley figure. But its Vin Diesel that steals the movie and rightly so. He has as much charisma as all the others put together and the rest are all pretty good, so that's saying something. This film gave Diesel the status and stardom he now enjoys today, but I still have to say that this is the best of all his films to date.A great film to watch and for once it makes a change to see an action film where you really aren't sure who is going to survive or not.",Pitch Black
66,lewiskendell,Unexpectedly good sci-fi.,8,24 September 2010,"""Finally found something worse than me, huh?.""I'm somewhat of a rabid Radha Mitchell fan (the woman is gorgeous and talented; she should be a much bigger star), so seeing her in a solid, gritty sci-fi/horror flick like this is a pretty good use of two hours for me.The basic story is about a transport ship (piloted by Mitchell's character) that is forced to crash land on an unknown planet. A planet that happens to be inhabited by deadly, light- sensitive predators that come out to feast every twenty-two years when a cosmic event shields the planet from its three suns for a time. One of the passengers of the ship also happens to be a deadly, light-sensitive predator (Vin Diesel) on his way back to the maximum-security prison world that he escaped from. The rest of the crash survivors are forced to rely on Riddick because of his ability to see in the dark and his natural survival instincts, but will he ultimately help them escape, or leave them to their dark fates?Pitch Black isn't perfect. There are a few rather large plot holes (What do the beasts do for the rest of the twenty-two years, just hang out? And what do they live off of on such a barren planet?), but nothing that really took me out of the story. Some of the characters are overly dumb, annoying, or inexplicably antagonistic, but such story devices and character archetypes come along with the genre, more often than not. The special effects and monster designs do look their age, but that can be forgiven in a movie that's more than eleven years old, and they're really not any worse than what you'd see today on the average made-for-TV sci-fi flick. On the other hand, the filmmakers did do a good job of using visual trickery to make the outback of Australia where the movie was filmed look a lot like a harsh, alien world, and on a small budget I'm assuming. So they get props for that.As for what I liked about Pitch Black, it was a pretty entertaining ride. Mitchell was great as the flawed, conflicted pilot unceremoniously promoted to leader, and Diesel was well- suited for Riddick, who's really the main character of the movie. There are likable characters to get attached to and fear for, several tense situations (though calling the movie scary would be a stretch), and a solid amount of action. All in all, Pitch Black was a pleasant surprise. I was more impressed with Diesel than I've been at any other movie of his that I've seen, and none of the lesser elements of the movie are significant enough to stand out much.

68,philip_vanderveken,Surprisingly enough a good Sci-Fi movie,7,3 January 2005,"I had never heard of this movie when it came out, probably because no-one ever wrote a review on it in the magazines and because no-one ever paid any attention to it before. Let's be honest, who knew anything about Vin Diesel before ""The Fast and the Furious"" and ""xXx""? Probably not many of you and I'm not saying that I did. So when ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" was released I was very surprised to hear that this was actually a sequel. And of course when a sequel is released in the multiplexes, at least one TV-channel will program the first movie and this time it wasn't any different. That's how I first saw ""Pitch Black"" and even though I'm not a fan of Sci-Fi movies, I have to say that I had a good time watching this one.The story is good. A space ship has made a crash landing on some seemingly lifeless planet, scorched by three suns. One of the passengers that survived the crash is Richard B. Riddick, a convicted murderer who is feared by all the passengers. But they have to find water to survive and a base to get help and they will need all the help they can get so they release him. When they reach the base, there is no-one to welcome them. It's completely deserted. Some kind of animals, who fear daylight, have eaten all the inhabitants. Normally there is always plenty of light, but once in a few years there is a solar eclipse. And this is exactly the time that there will be such an eclipse...Overall this movie reminded me a bit of Aliens, but I'm already glad that it didn't copy it completely. Somehow it tried to be original and that's not always easy. OK, you'll still encounter many horror and Sci-Fi clichés, but it's all done in such a way that they get away with it. It's all still believable. The different characters were OK, but could perhaps be deepened more. I mean, you'll never really know who the bad guys and the good guys are, but I sometimes wanted to know more about certain people. I wanted to know why they reacted in the way they reacted, I wanted to know what drove them...However, what I loved most about the movie were the special effects and the lighting. The creatures or aliens or whatever you like to call it were really cool to watch. Same for the lighting. The idea of a blue sun was cool and something I hadn't seen before in a movie. Also the use of different shades and intensities of light, as well as Riddick's night vision were interesting.All in all this movie was certainly worth a watch, even for people like me who don't like Sci-Fi at all. If I have to recommend it to anyone than it will of course be to the people that adore this genre. I'm sure they will be blown away by it. Personally I give it a 6,5/10 and that's probably the highest score I've ever given to a movie of this kind.",Pitch Black
69,screenman,An exceptional science-fiction movie.,9,21 March 2006,"This movie came as a nice surprise. I thought I had just about sampled everything: Strange worlds, beastly aliens, and the almost obligatory morphing. What else was left? Well, with 'Pitch Black' its more of the same. But the flavour and the texture are refreshingly original.The opening moments are formulaic enough, but they're neat and accomplished. A spaceship in space - yes. Even the director didn't care for that, which is a good sign. But it's all okay, and the camera doesn't linger. There is a very well chosen music-score that has a satisfying metallic quality about it suggestive of catwalks and airlocks that bodes well for the rest of the movie. It immediately feels like a complete package - you're there, right with them, out in space. Excellent.Vin Deisel has a rare and remarkable voice, it compares with that of James Mason or Richard Burton, and his silky, cynical narration at the outset carries a chill.Things begin to happen very quickly. There are interesting angles on old effects. Tension and conflicts arise and develop well.And that's how the movie proceeds. It's the old formula again: a group of people go somewhere remote and find something nasty they don't know how to deal with. But every take has a sly, new angle that keeps you guessing.Some very clever work is done with light - there being a world in a planetary system with three suns. And the special effects, although by now almost certainly CGI, offer plenty to admire. A developing eclipse is extremely well-observed and fascinating to watch. Check-out the contra-rotating rings around the planet, and the aurorae in its high atmosphere. Someone put an awful lot of thought into this. It's one of the most visually beautiful events I have seen in a sci-fi movie. And I do assure you, I have watched it a lot of times.The sudden appearance of the aliens is another surprise and spectacle. They go on to be suitably hideous and badly-behaved.One of the other real treats is the disparity of characters and the quality of their acting. I am only slightly familiar with two of them, but they all give a sterling performance. They are the best case yet for using cheap, hungry unknowns rather than squandering megabucks on big-name stars who can ultimately do no better. The slick, terse script brings conviction to each player. You are moved to care for all of them, despite their obvious vices. And you come away wondering what you would do in their shoes.On the surface of the planet, the incidental music changes to a kind of aboriginal percussion riff. It's simple, even minimalist, yet once again it suits the circumstances perfectly well.The whole thing hangs together as a piece so well that movie-making looks easy. It's only when you see some of the other pigs that you realise it's not. This one isn't perfect, but I don't intend to nit-pick; I like it too much.Excellent directing, good story, well-chosen music, solid script, believable acting, beautiful special-effects, sound and lighting. Just add popcorn.",Pitch Black
70,Gislef,Okay concept expanded to good movie,8,26 March 2001,"Pitch Black isn't really a classic, but it takes a basic science fictionscenario that's been done to death since Alien in a lot of low-grade B- and Z-movies, and makes it a fairly high-budget decent production with good characterization of most of the players. van Diesel is the definite star and a definite anti-hero (not a villain, really, although people often confuse the two). The rest of the cast isn't really that well developed, and there are some gaps in characterizations (Johns in particular is never really drawn convincingly enough to explain his eventual betrayal).The alien monsters are well-done, although one wonders why the evolved a sensitivity to light on a light-intense planet. There are some other plot holes, such as the fact that the original colony had lights that weren't solar-powered: how'd they all get killed? And sometimes the characters can move around quite easily.  Riddick gets from the cave to the colony pretty easily with no lights, and Fry does the same with one puny little light. And they both get _back_ to the cave. But on the way back with Imam and Jackie they have no end of problems.Still, the movie moves along at a pretty good clip, and there's no character so weak that it really flaws apart. Overall, I'd recommend it to fans of the genre.  It's more action-adventure and horror with sci-fi trappings, though.",Pitch Black

Several people survive on a planet and start a bloody fight against horrible man-eating flying creatures, merciless and cruel. Nothing new? Well, Riddick makes it very fresh and upbeat. He is cool, strong, cynical and very clever. He is not daunted or haunted, he acts in cold blood and his actions seem cruel at first, but then it is him who saves at least three people and helps them escape the bad place that they had landed on.

74,Maciste_Brother,Effective B-movie,8,10 June 2004,"PITCH BLACK delivers on several levels. Imaginative FXs, thrilling concept, excellent cinematography and good actors. But this is a B-movie nonetheless, not that there's anything wrong with that. The thing that keeps this from being a grade A movie is the constant use of cheesy excuses for stretching the story, the lack of focus on certain aspects of the story, the director's attempts to make the movie look groovy (distortion in images, etc) and the sometimes cheap looking sets (for instance, some seats looked like they were bought at Office Depot). But the whole movie still works, thanks mainly to the director's respect for sci-fi genre, but more importantly, because of the presence of Vin Diesel, who literally became a star after playing Riddick. Vin steals the movie and his excellent performance elevates what could have been a standard sci-fi B-movie into an above average sci-fi B-movie. Juxtaposing the menacing flying aliens with the dangerous character of Riddick was a brilliant idea. As Riddick keeps saying, ""it ain't me you should be worrying about.""The actors were mostly all good, certainly the top trio, Vin, Radha Mitchell and Cole Hauser. All three actors made a good impression, even though the movie clearly belongs to Vin.As for the flying aliens, they basically look like THE BIRDS on steroids. They're effective but not 100% menacing. The main problem with them is they're rarely the same size throughout the movie. For instance, at the beginning, the alien creatures look very small when they killed the woman but later on during the film, the creatures suddenly look bigger and more ALIEN-like.But this is just some minor details to be expected from a B-movie. All in all, PITCH BLACK is a nifty little sci-fi movie that mostly deliver and is worth watching. I even bought the DVD after renting it a couple of years ago.",Pitch Black
75,lambiepie-2,Why Couldn't this film have been any better?,6,26 April 2003,"This is one of those films that has so much potential that never gets fully developed throughout the film. You have a few darned good actors such as Keith David and Vin Diesel, and a script that isn't sure where it wants to go or what it wants to grow up and be. There is a sequel coming out to this and for the first time, I can say, I am looking forward to the sequel....that is...in hopes that it covers the areas that were so missed in this film: Character development, story development. Now, don't get me wrong, the film wasn't terrible, but you just watch it and at some point you say...""Huh. What happened there? There's gotta be more of an explanation to this."" or ""Why did they resort to this cheap ploy?"" I liked the eerie backdrop quality of the film, they should have stayed consistant with that. My complaints were that I saw parts of ""Aliens"" parts of ""Mission to Mars""--parts of other sci-fi ""buddy-pick off cast-terrible guy with heart of gold"" films that were thrown into this film where there was no need. The production and writing crew should have been stronger (Dan O'Bannon overseeing the script, maybe????) should have let this film be a stand alone onto itself and it would have been...spectacular.",Pitch Black
76,mstomaso,Relentless and gorgeous sci-fi action film,8,10 September 2006,"Let me waste a moment of your time to explain how I approached this film. 1st I dismissed the trailers out of hand because the film appeared to be an uncredited remake of Aliens, which I consider to be one of the weakest films in the Alien series. Stupidly continuing to dismiss the film after I heard positive things about it from people whose opinions I trust, I missed the theatrical run completely. I then became hooked on Farscape, in its 3rd or 4th season at the time, and found Pitch Black on cable one night around bed time - so I said ""oh why not, at least it has Claudia Black in it."" Soon, I recognized Keith David, and began to realize that Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell and Cole Hauser could all act (why this should surprise me, I do not know). I was captivated. I have now remained captivated for four years. I just watched the film for the 3rd or 4th time, and I still love it.This is not an art film, not an independent, and its not entirely original, but where it fails to break a lot of new ground, it utterly succeeds in providing interesting, realistic characters, hard-driving action in the medium of a compelling but simple plot, and non-stop entertainment; an absolutely beautiful environment with tastefully rendered special effects. Sound to good to be true? Don't take my word for it... see it for yourself.The film also highlighted the charisma of the now somewhat iconoclastic Vin Diesel, introducing the character of Richard Riddick. Diesel would go on to star in the somewhat Riddick-ulous Chronicles thereof (which I also enjoyed, though recognizing its rather huge flaws) and is now something of a legend. Diesel is so charismatic, so big, and so interesting to watch that it is easy to ignore the fact that he is not only a talented actor, but a smart one too. Checking out the DVD version of Pitch Black, with the audio comments on might just blow you away.The film is about the crew of an inter-system transport ship stranded on an unknown planet after a crash-landing in which their captain was killed. The new commander is inexperienced but bright and heroic (Mitchell), but she is caught between two dominant and dangerous personalities - a bounty hunter with secrets (Hauser) and a dangerous criminal who has been surgically altered to see in the dark (Diesel). Is that all? Of course not - the planet is inhabited, and the inhabitants are hungry.As unoriginal and improbable as some of this may be, Pitch Black is beautifully filmed, well told, and very nicely performed. Don't expect to learn anything, and don't expect to have to think a whole lot, but do expect to have fun with this modern sci-fi action classic.",Pitch Black
77,sarastro7,A perfect sci-fi movie,9,26 May 2004,"If you're a science fiction fan, and you've only seen this movie once, please, PLEASE go and treat yourself to a second viewing. I just did, and I was AMAZED about how good I thought the movie was, as opposed to when I first saw it three years ago. The first time around I was certainly impressed by the astronomical vistas we're treated to in this movie, but by and large I didn't think that much of the movie as a whole. It was an Alien rip-off, and I thought the description of the monsters was a case of really bad science. That they were allergic to light was something I found especially ridiculous. Based on my first viewing, I recently rated this movie a 5.However, now that the sequel, Chronicles of Riddick, is on the way, and the movie poster for that one looks amazing, I thought I'd better brush up on Pitch Black once more, so I borrowed the video from a friend. I am so glad I did. There's so much of what I thought I remembered from the first viewing that turned out to be wildly inaccurate. I thought most of the characters died very early in the movie. This was not so. I thought Claudia Black's character was the first to die. This was not so. I thought Riddick was the sole survivor. This was not so. I see now that the movie works *extremely* well. There isn't an excessive, tiresome focus on the monsters. It's much more of a human drama. The main characters are appealing and capable of some convincing acting. And there are so many little details that make the Pitch Black universe coherent and believable, such as the shortage of oxygen in the atmosphere of the planet they crash on, and the fact that the monsters have eaten everything on the planet, and so they turn on each other.And I have to mention the astronomical vistas again. I mean, we start out seeing the spaceship passing through a comet's tail, with bits of spacedust zapping through the hull. Then we come to a planet with three suns. Just as the shipwrecked people think it's about to get dark, a blue sun rises on the opposite horizon, and everything is engulfed in a blue glow. As the eclipse approaches, we see the huge, neighboring, ringed gas giant rise across the sky, and in the final scene of the movie we see the ship skid closely above one of these very rings. These scenes are created with a sense of beauty, wonder and detail, and I don't think I've seen any other SF movie that really made such a point out of including these things. I hope we see much more of it in the sequel.Pitch Black now gets from me a rating of 9 out of 10. A cult classic? You bet!!",Pitch Black
78,mentalcritic,A nice low-key science fiction,7,19 November 2004,"Pitch Black was the inauspicious ramp into public consciousness for both director David Twohy and star Vin Deisel. Although nobody knew who they were before Pitch Black, nobody who paid attention during the credits would forget later. Twohy has since gone on to direct several B-level features along similar lines, whilst Vin Deisel has gone on to appear in a number of upstart action franchises, for good or ill. Indeed, one of the features planned for next year is called Hannibal. What the hell, it cannot be any worse than the last film I saw that was called Hannibal.In this rather strangely-plotted piece, Deisel portrays what appears to be a vicious criminal. It's only after we're introduced to the rest of the cast that we discover there is more than meets the eye. Once Riddick is introduced, we are given a shallow, but curiously engaging Aliens-style premise. The use of bleach bypass in order to make the desert of Coober Pedy look like an alien world was a master stroke. Indeed, Deisel aside, the real star here is the cinematography.Keith David gets an underdeveloped, underutilised turn as a Muslim cleric who, in spite of having three tenths of nothing to say, is strangely sympathetic. As tragedy befalls him, his dialogues about faith and belief with Riddick give the whole affair an ironic undertone that is strangely enjoyable in spite of being at times a little too confronting. Don't bother looking for other big names in this feature, however. I think they must have pillaged every location they shot in to find people who will play the (very) minor characters. Their artificiality makes it clear that they are from the Antipodes, and they won't be working in much else any time soon.According to the trivia entries, Pitch Black was shot in the same desert as Mad Max. This doesn't seem right, given that Mad Max was short in locations to the North of Melbourne. Mad Max 2 was shot in a place called Broken Hill, a bit of a ways away from Coober Pedy. In fact, no Mad Max film has ever shot in a Queensland location, and the only possibility would be Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome being shot in Coober Pedy, which still makes this statement a little inaccurate (apparently more shooting on Mad Max 3 took place in New South Wales than South Australia, where Coober Pedy is).Nonetheless, this film shows a clear reason why many productions are going to Australia rather than shooting in America or England. For one thing, in spite of all the horrid things I say about them, when an Australian in the film industry tells you they're going to keep quiet about your production, they mean it. George Lucas shifted production of his last and about-to-be-released Star Wars films to Australia for this very reason.Another advantage of working in Australia, locations notwithstanding, is efficiency. An Australian crew can be trusted to get things done without delays or labour disputes, provided you don't abuse them. That shooting Pitch Black only took sixty days should convince one of this fact when they consider that films like this can often take twice as long. The film's estimated budget of a mere twenty-three million is also a mild shock when the opposed impressions of the shooting location and the strangely elaborate special effects are taken into account.I gave Pitch Black a seven out of ten. It's not a classic, and it may not even be remembered in another ten years, but it is entertaining enough to watch a few times. This is an excellent example of how sometimes the smaller budgets produce better films. I'm glad I took the time to see it theatrically.",Pitch Black

Put all together we have quality entertainment.

80,vip_ebriega,All lights-off for ALIENS lite.,6,21 June 2008,"My Take: Derivative yet entertaining. Slick but inferior, David Twohy's PITCH BLACK, even with its slickness, is just another monster movie, and quite a decent one at that. Although it won't break the sci-fi barrier, even if it doesn't have an A-list cast and even without some great special effects work, it makes for a worthy twist to the age-old ALIENS formula. You know the set-up, a spaceship-load of passengers crash land on a desolate planet system. Without the benefits of communication and refuge, they are forced to fight for their lives against the planets hostile inhabitants, this in case, ALIEN lookalikes.To benefit from the charisma of the lead character of the ALIEN films, PITCH BLACK also has a female heroine to lead the brigade of survivors. She's Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell) who assists a batch of plucky to bad-ass characters, including a convict named Riddick (Vin Diesel) who plays hero later on in the picture. They arrive on a bizarre world which has a strange weather condition: It's approaching a season where everything gets dark. The time where the planet's inhabitants, strange creeping Alien-types, start crawling out of their crawl-spaces and stalk everyone. You know the rest! There's not much plot to speak of, as the film goes on as a typical creature-feature then on. But the movie is not nearly as bad as it might be. Derivative enough, PITCH BLACK still satisfies as an enjoyable attraction, even as a simple time-passer. Diesel is a satisfying anti-hero, who actually proves he can act. He's cold and emotionless, but I guess that's a plus. There's no character development whatsoever, even if the film spends enough time with them. The plot is empty and derivative, but as a creature feature, the film is slick and enjoyable. Even if it's not quite as unbearably seat-gripping as those in ALIENS, Twohy manages to create suspense in the most unexpected of places. There's enough action and decent acting to provide a sufficiently enjoyable action fare.Rating: *** out of 5.",Pitch Black
81,jhclues,"Nothing New, But Has It's Moments",7,23 January 2002,"This film may not expand the Science Fiction Cinematic Universe as we know it, but there's a couple of twists and turns and enough atmosphere to make it a worthwhile addition to the genre.  `Pitch Black,' directed by David N. Twohy, involves a commercial space flight carrying forty passengers that crash lands on an unknown desert planet.  With three suns above them, there is plenty of daylight in which the survivors can negotiate their quest for survival, and finding water is their main concern.  As they begin to explore the wastelands for sustenance, they find evidence that others have been there, apparently some years before them:  A small ship and a couple of buildings; all of which appears to have been abruptly left behind.  Lead by pilot Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell), the small band of survivors have a couple of additional obstacles in their way, as well.  One is Riddick (Vin Diesel), a murderer who was being transported to a penal colony.  But he may not be their greatest danger; because there is someone-- or something-- else close by.  Very close.  An entity that in all probability is responsible for the disappearance of those who came before.  And, if that isn't enough, Fry ascertains that the three suns above them will be setting soon; their world is about to be plunged into absolute darkness.  Soon, they will have to deal with Riddick and the entity stalking them in the pitch black of an eternal night.	This concept is nothing new, and there's a sense of been there, done that, about it, but to Twohy's credit, what it lacks in originality he makes up for in presentation by building the suspense and maintaining the tension right up to the end.  The story was obviously influenced by a number of other films, predominately `Alien,' `Soldier' and even `Rocketship X-M' from 1950, but there is a unique characteristic about Riddick and a revelation at the end (that has to do with his true nature) that secures a separate entry in the annals of Sci-Fi lore for this film.  This one definitely has it's moments, enough to take it to a level that even such highly touted offerings as `Event Horizon' and `Alien 3' failed to achieve.  	The performances, too, are a cut above the usual for this kind of fare, and while no one in the cast is likely to win an award for their work here, they do a good job, individually and collectively.  Radha Mitchell has an affecting screen presence and creates a very real person in Fry, equal to, if not surpassing Sigourney Weaver's Ripley in `Alien.'  Diesel is effective, as well, especially in the menace he brings to Riddick, which is subtly honest and believable; the understated way he plays it gives added impact to the character and takes him beyond stereotype (though not quite up to Rutger Hauer's Roy in `Blade Runner').  With Riddick, what you see is basically what you get; there's not a lot of depth or complexity to him, but that's who this guy is, and Diesel plays it well.	Also turning in effective performances are Keith David as Imam, Lewis Fitz-Gerald as Paris Ogilvie, Rhiana Griffith as Jack and Claudia Black as Shazza.  As Johns, Cole Hauser is adequate, but he fails to give his character the definition his co-stars achieved with their respective roles.	Rounding out the cast are John Moore (Zeke), Simon Burke (Greg), Les Chantery (Suleiman), Sam Sari (Hassan) and Firass Dirani (Ali).  From the beginning, you know what you're in for with this one-- it's a survival story, and few of the characters, if any, are going to make it to the end. But as entertainment, `Pitch Black' does the job; it's thrilling enough that by the time it's over you feel like you got your five bucks worth.  You may not remember it next month, but while you're watching, it's a pretty good rush.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 7/10.",Pitch Black
82,CharltonBoy,Above average Sci Fi Horror,7,4 February 2001,"Pitch Black is an above average horror sci fi that goes a little bit further than just good special affects.

84,spookyrat1,Shine a Light!,8,13 March 2019,"Nearly 20 years on, Pitch Black still shines as a compelling, original piece of science-fiction film-making, which ended up spawning 2 and a bit sequels. Of real interest is seeing the introduction and early positioning of our favourite Furyan, Richard P Riddick, as very much an anti-hero for much of the movie's length. In the sequels, the spotlight positions him more as a traditional hero. Pitch Black is also notable for both a fine performance from Radha Mitchell as Pilot Carolyn Fry and the contribution of the desolate terrain around the South Australian desert town of Coober Pedy, very effectively passing itself off as the three-sunned barren planet.Indeed though Pitch Black is ostensibly an American production, it has a very significant Australian element, besides the locations. Radha Mitchell and many of the cast members are Australian, as is musical director Graeme Revell, not forgetting the very talented cinematographer David Eggby. Mention of the cast members reminds me that Pitch Black is much more of an ensemble piece than subsequent Riddick episodes. As such the various characters are given differing back stories which do pique our interest. No one, least of all Riddick, is totally heroic. Even Mitchell's Fry (her best screen role IMHO), contemplates ditching her passengers, to better ensure her personal survival chances, in the film's harrowing opening scenes.The story, though reminiscent of parts of Alien, confidently treads its own survivalist narrative path, once the damaged space ship crash lands unexpectedly mid-journey. Good to see, the creatures when they appear aren't Alien inspired clones, like so many other examples from creature features over the past few decades, such as the very recent, disappointing Life. The spine-tingling night time odyssey back to the repaired drop ship in the film's second half is a mini-masterpiece of suspense, pitting the disparate, rag tag humans (+Riddick) against their horrendous extra terrestrial hosts.Vin Diesel arguably has achieved greater fame and financial success through his involvement in the Fast and Furious franchise. But for me, up till the present, the most interesting character he has brought to the screen is the always enigmatic Riddick, as first seen in Pitch Black.",Pitch Black
85,cchase,"""We Don't Need Another Hero?"" - Don't Worry...He's Not One...",9,5 December 2008,"People who thought that THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK sucked harder than the black hole that swallowed up EVENT HORIZON, probably didn't see the movie that spawned Vin Diesel's skin-headed killer to begin with, and probably have no intention of doing so. Too bad, because PITCH BLACK actually does kick major ass.Directed by genre vet David Twohy, (WARLOCK and the excellent but underrated BELOW) and written by siblings Jim and Ken Wheat (LIES, SILENT SCREAM), PITCH BLACK begins with an 'ALIEN'-esque prologue. When a combination cargo freighter/passenger ship is badly damaged by a freak meteor shower (in which the captain is also killed), the co-pilot, Carolyn Fry (SILENT HILL'S Radha Mitchell) has an important decision to make: ditch the cargo or the passengers? Close to picking ore over occupants, the crash landing derails her ultimate course of action.No matter, because the catastrophic landing has been made on a foreboding rock that once held a mining colony. Amongst the survivors are a couple of settlers, Shazza (FARSCAPE's Claudia Black) and Zeke (John Moore); an Imam (Keith David) and his young followers (can you say ""red shirts"" boys and girls?); an antiques dealer named Paris Ogilvie (Lewis Fitz-Gerald); a 'young boy' named Jack (Rhianna Griffith), and the most controversial members of the group: a Marshall named Johns (the excellently slimy Cole Hauser) and his prisoner...a dangerous murderer named Riddick (Diesel). How the group dynamics shake out make for a lot of the dramatic tension, especially with concerns about Riddick and how many people he might slice and dice if he ever gets away. But no one here gets out alive, as the saying goes, and the biggest twists have less to do with how they get along, than how they'll survive when they discover the unthinkable. They are not alone on the planetoid. Things that are hungry, taloned and quick are slithering around just where they can't be seen, living in the darkness where they can survive and thrive. They want the flesh of the new arrivals to sate their appetites, but they can't come out into the searing daylight to forage for food.Does the phrase ""total eclipse"" make things a little more interesting? You betcha. Hence the more-than-fitting title.Vin, more monosyllabic than Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry on his grumpiest day, dripping more testosterone than sweat, has a field day here with a character that really does seem worth a sequel or two, and Hauser, oozing menace and bile is every bit as good as his dad Wings was at on-screen villainy. Surprisingly, though, Mitchell holds her own and manages to be strong and sympathetic as Fry. You would expect no less than a strong showing from Black, She Who Once Was 'Aeryn Sun', and she doesn't disappoint. (Too bad her role wasn't bigger, but that's all I'll say about it.) And David makes his usual indelible impression as the holy man whose faith will truly be tested in the very pit of Hell itself.The pace moves faster than Riddick slipping up behind his prey with a shank in his teeth, and once the darkness descends, the terror and tension never let up, pretty much as in other classic sci-fi/horror flicks which this imitates. But if imitation truly is the sincerest form of flattery, Dave Twohy and the Wheats deserve major backslaps for getting this one right with a vengeance, and for giving us an ending that is anti-Hollywood to the max.I don't want to spoil the surprises, so I won't say much more, except that if you saw CHRONICLES first and weren't too happy, give PITCH BLACK a chance anyway. And if you've seen neither, definitely start with this one. I don't know what Vin is up to now, but he could certainly do worse than to give these guys a call again. I'd love to see what they would dream up next...",Pitch Black

87,FilmOtaku,Sci-Fi for the regular guy,6,10 December 2004,"Spoilers Sci-Fi films are pretty much anathema to me with a few exceptions (Alien & Aliens are two films that immediately come to mind), but I watched ""Pitch Black"" anyway because it came highly recommended by several people. Directed by David Twohy (""The Arrival"") and starring Vin Diesel, it was a film I ended up enjoying with little criticism.""All you people are so scared of me. But it ain't me you got to worry about now"" is pretty much the understatement of the year, uttered by Richard Riddick (Diesel), a prisoner being transported with 39 others to New Mecca, another world that is in the process of being settled. When the ship crash lands along the way, leaving about ten survivors, Riddick manages to escape his captor, William Johns (Cole Hauser) sparking a manhunt on an unknown and unusual planet that has three suns. What they soon realize is that they have landed on a planet that is about to undergo a total solar eclipse which will bring thousands of light-shy man eating flying creatures out into the darkness. When Riddick soon resurfaces and agrees to help them try to restart an abandoned ship (from the last human feast that landed on the planet) it becomes a race against time before all of the lights go out. Unfortunately, time runs out before this happens, and they find themselves prey for the creatures as they try to make it off the planet.Stylistically, ""Pitch Black"" is pretty slick. The use of the color filters was great, and the editing, for the most part, was pretty good. The only thing I thought got really old were the stupid quick edits of two people looking at one another (it was very reminiscent of bad Japanese television shows) or when someone would turn around to look at Riddick and it would be a quick edit of ""Riddick is there to the right! Now quick to the left!"" Those were supposed to be arty shots, and they fell flat  but the basics were good. I thought that the events surrounding Jack were completely ridiculous; I felt suddenly transported back to a Judy Blume novel, but again, it's Sci-Fi  I give it a little more latitude. The CGI was surprisingly good, and the actors (being throwaway characters anyway, this is a Sci-Fi movie after all) were decent. Unfortunately, a big deterrent for me is that I can't understand a damn word Vin Diesel says, so I found this completely annoying, of course. Keith David of course was totally underused, but I'm used to that by now. The shot near the end of Paris spitting alcohol onto his torch, creating a momentary large fire that lights up the dozens of creatures that surround him is the money shot of ""Pitch Black"" and is a shot that I've been told was actually an ad-lib by the actor, but it was a hit when used in the trailer and just as effective in the film. It's almost worth seeing the film just to see that cool shot and the events leading up to it.Overall ""Pitch Black"" was a good film, and I would of course recommend it to any Sci-Fi lover who hasn't already seen it, and assure most Sci-Fi haters (like myself, for the most part) that it is worth seeing, and not too ""out there"". 6/10",Pitch Black

90,rebeljenn,simply bad,1,5 March 2006,"'Pitch Black' is a science fiction thriller about a group of astronauts that find themselves stranded on a desserted planet with creatures that come out at dark and start killing off the astronauts one-by-one as they attempt to find a way off the planet. This film is a typical thriller, and if you enjoy this type of film, then you will probably enjoy this. In my opinion, the film was too slow-moving, and the action and attempt to create an emotional and frightening story just did not work. It had little to offer, and it was dull that the film took place in just one planet, in the darkness. It was also unrealistic in the sense that these creatures are living on the planet, but what do they feed on, besides the small group of stranded astronauts?

92,Movie-12,"A visually stunning piece of work, with one flaw too many. ** out of ****.",5,9 March 2000,"PITCH BLACK / (2000) **Starring: Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell, Cole Hauser, Keith David, Lewis Fitz-Gerald, and Simon Burke Directed By David N. Twohy. Written by Jim and Ken Wheat. Running time: 108 minutes. Rated R (for violence and language).By Blake French: 	""Pitch Black"" probably combines over a dozen horror clinches and surprisingly ends up providing us with a premise that is somewhat original. The only reason it fails is because, of all the recycling this film attempts, it forgets to include message, moral, and depth. The concepts are too simplified. This requires the audience to park their brains at the theater entrance before they will be able to thoroughly enjoy the production.  Whenever a story requires no logic or thought, the writers, Jim and Ken Wheat, show sings of laziness. If they cared about the film's overall theme they would have further developed certain conflicts, characters, and notions in a method that relates to the story. That would demand hard work and long hours, however, and that is something the ""Pitch Black"" filmmakers would rather replace with special effects and computer animated visuals. ""Pitch Black"" takes place in the future as a high tech space ship blasts through the outermost layers of the galaxy. This space vessel is carrying an assortment of passengers. Most of these characters have one syllable names that are easy to shout out loud. They include Fry (Radha Mitchell), a determined woman and unwilling leader after the captain is killed, Johns (Cole Hauser), a morphine addicted  bounty hunter, Imam (Keith David), a Muslim who coexists with three youthful pilgrims, Paris (Lewis Fitz-Gerald), an antique merchant, Shazza (Claudia Black), a geologist, Jack (Rhianna Griffith) an influential teenager, and Riddick (Vin Diesel), a muscular convicted killer who has night vision. 	As the movie opens, the space craft crashes on an obsolete planet where there appears to be no food or water. (We never really learn what made the vessel plummet to an uncharted land mass, or receive much character development.) The survivors then learn that Riddick, whose intentions may be murderous, has escaped from concealed captivity. The crew then discovers the remains of a desolate assortment of people who may have crash landed here around twenty years ago. Without further ado, an unknown creature mutilates a crew member. They later learn that aliens inhabit the planet but are afraid of the light. So, no problem, right. How can carnivorous invertebrate that are terrified of bright substances cause a threat in a world with three suns? The filmmakers place the characters in a time era in which a solar eclipse is prone to occur. Their only hope: racing across the planet to find several fuel cells that belong to a spacecraft that will take them out of their horrible experiences. 	Isn't it kind of coincidental that the luminous body in which the band collapses contains oxygen; the only mistrusting character is able to see in the dark as a solar eclipse befalls; an eclipse just happens to transpire at the worst time? I also question the aliens' presence. They are frightening and well crafted. However, why do they kill the astronauts? Do they feast upon their physical existence? If so, what did the creatures eat for twenty years after the last victimized crew crash landed. The selected planet contains no vegetation, recourses, other animals, or even water. It is a deserted desert-like landscape. So how do they manage to survive--especially being afraid of light on a planet with three suns? Why do they fear the light? Perhaps they chow on each other? There is a sequence in the film where the aliens attach and kill one another--but why? Nothing here is answered or clarified.
 The characters in ""Pitch Black"" are your usual monster movie characters, some lacking personality and interest, and others who have no construction of shape, all whose instincts are instantly obvious. The picture does have enough intelligence to become fearless in its victimizing. It's not alarmed to pick off any of the characters--even some of the big starring roles are killed. I am impressed to witness some decent and well-cast performances here. Although the filmmakers do not take advantage of Vin Diesel's physical composition, he handles the role of a secondary villain with endurance and strength. The rest of the cast also performs with appropriate character traits.There is a sequence in ""Pitch Black"" where a mesmerizing collage of spellbinding visual effects makes a solar eclipse. This visually arousing sequence combines of the best technology of special effects I have ever witnessed. The movie is smart with the construction of the aliens, and we are able to induce our imagination a little with those creatures. In a movie of such piercing optical stimulation, however, it should have not wasted time in developing a human conflict, although it interacts with the character twists and adds a nice touch, but evolved more on the interesting alien beings. But ""Pitch Black"" does not take advantage of either component.

The first half of the film is turgid junk, and the second half - while exciting - feels like a sub-sub-sub-standard version of ""Jaws 2."" In other words, you've seen this kind of scary movie a million times before, and it was done better 900,007 of those times.I must confess that Vin Diesel is an arresting screen presence, and Radha Mitchell is as lovely and compelling as ever. They often carry the movie when the expletive-ridden script falls completely flat.Aside from their performances, though, there's not too much to recommend this movie. The villainous creatures look like exactly what they are - modest special effects - and fail to generate sufficient tension.Really, the most intriguing aspect of the film (to me) is that it features several religious Muslim characters, which is practically unheard of for Hollywood. But, as you can tell, I'm really stretching to find points of interest if I'm reduced to remarking on that.Amazingly, this bog-standard movie was followed by two sequels - one animated, and the other a shiny CGI spectacle. Together, they form the so-called ""Riddick Trilogy"" - which will, unless I miss my guess, never become the ""Riddick Tetralogy."" We must be thankful for small mercies.",Pitch Black
96,LebowskiT1000,Pretty Good Sci-Fi Film,9,26 May 2002,"This is a pretty good sci-fi film, it is far from great, but it's pretty good in it's own right.SPOILER ALERT!Maybe it's just me, but I found it really hard to give any kind of care what happened to Riddick (Vin Diesel).  I guess the movie is all about the changes his character goes though, but I didn't really get what suddenly made him change his mind and decide to go back and rescue the little girl and the religious guy.  So Carolyn admitted that she was willing to die for them...Ok...so why does Riddick think that's a good enough reason to help her?Also, I HATED that Carolyn (Radha Mitchell) got killed at the end of the film.  I never really understand why a writer works so hard to make sure a character lives till the end of film, just to get killed off.  Of course sometimes this is very appropriate, but I didn't find this to be one of those times.  Why was it so important to kill off that character?  So that Riddick could see that she was willing to die for him...and DID!?  I guess that makes sense, but that still kind of sucks.As for the creatures themselves...EXCELLENT!  I loved the design of the animals, I loved the idea that they can only come out when there is no light, I loved that light actually hurt them, I loved the way their vision looked, I loved everything about them!  Some of the CG work was a little cartoony, but I'm not going to let that ruin anything for me.All in all, I thought it was good movie, but nothing absolutely spectacular. Although, I did think the story was VERY cool, and pretty well told.  If you're a die-hard sci-fi fan like myself, then you're probably going to want to see this, but if you're not so much into sci-fi, then don't go out of your way to see it, but it may still be worth your time.

97,Antagonisten,Decent SF,6,14 January 2005,"I saw this at a press showing in Stockholm back when it was first released. Back then i thought it was a decent Sci-fi action movie. Recently i saw it again on DVD (after seeing the horrible train-wreck of a sequel ""The Chronicles of Riddick"") and actually liked it more on the second viewing.A ship containing a mixed group of settlers, traveling businessmen, pilgrims and one dangerous captive (and his captor) crash-land on a deserted planet. The planet is a desert wasteland and the survivors try to survive first the heat and then nasty beings that awake when all the planets' three suns are blocked by a total eclipse.""Pitch Black"" is nothing special really. It doesn't break any new ground and is not very innovative. Rather the strong point of the movie in my opinion is how much they manage to make out of so little. The ingredients are simple. A crashed ship, a bunch of survivors with different skills, a dangerous convict that creates tensions in the group and finally an alien species bent on killing them. And considering how many movies are made with themes like this ""Pitch Black"" feels clearly above average. There is suspense, action, crappy one-liners and CGI to go around and it never really becomes boring.Of course there are weak points as well. I have a hard time accepting Vin Diesel who becomes almost like comic relief with his deep voice and flexing muscles. Also the story is nothing to cheer about although i think it does the job.I would recommend ""Pitch Black"" as a Friday night entertainment. It's a lightweight and entertaining no-brainer without being overly stupid or weak. But stay away from the sequel however, it's a completely different experience and shares nothing with this movie except the main character. Goes to show that a large budget can never get you farther than a good script. I rate this 6/10.",Pitch Black
98,asda-man,You want to see Pitch Black? Just turn your TV off.,3,2 August 2011,"Right from the opening I knew I was going to end up hating ""Pitch Black"" just because I have a unfair lack of interest for the sci-fi genre. So we're in a space shuttle and everything seems all futuristic and weird, the camera's making a lot of use out of the hand-held, shake to create a feeling of panic and we crash land on this deserted planet with three suns, creating an extremely off-putting filter, you'll be wishing it would just hurry up and turn pitch black! The filters are really awful and in bad taste, the range from an over exposed goldy filter to a strange black and white looking blue filter which doesn't really make sense, it's as if the directors just putting them there because he can. We are then introduced to far too many characters that we lose track of and therefore don't particularly care about! The least one being the ""hero"" Riddick, played by the lack-luster Vin Diesal who thinks that he looks cool by wearing swimming goggles in the middle of the desert! I thought he was about to jump into a pool or something! Anyway, he's annoying and egotistical there's no way we can like him especially as the other characters make out he's the bad guy anyway!After a long wait (about an hour) the film eventually revs up a bit, the planet plunges into darkness so we can get rid of the blinding filters and we're treated to poorly animated aliens and the film then plays out as one big rip-off of ""Aliens"" in the dark! This swarm of creatures attack the group as we egg them on to, however Imust admit there were times of excitement and some parts were well-paced.But when all is said and done ""Pitch Black"" is ""Aliens"" with a clunky screenplay and just plain weird directing! It's full of unlikable characters and an empty ending. Although there are times of suspense and exciting action, there needs to be more substance to find it engaging.",Pitch Black
99,Al_The_Strange,"""You're not afraid of the dark, are you?""",7,7 September 2013,"When a starship crash-lands on an arid, desert planet with three suns, the survivors are left in quite a predicament: should they fear the serial killer who's been let loose among them, or fear the monsters systematically stalking them from the dark? Pitch Black is a pretty unique thriller, and a lot of it is in its visual storytelling: it's a brutal universe with oppressive planetscapes, freaky alien monsters, and a whole cast of cut-throat characters.However, the film has always felt like a mixed bag to me. A lot of it is simply because it's split evenly down the middle. The first half of this film is a survivalist story, with the characters moping around, getting their bearings, and trying to figure out what to do with themselves. With some hushed dialogue and so many character beats to run through, these acts can be rather dry. When the solar eclipse finally hits and all the nocturnal beasties come out, things pick up quite a bit, with frequent chases, fights, and thrills. The experience is marred by the film's style though: a lot of the more exciting parts have some of the most erratic editing and flashing images ever put together, and it can be unnerving.The film does tell an inherently interesting story though. Most of the characters are pretty dry and flat alien fodder, but one character stands out: Richard B. Riddick, the strong-bodied low-voiced serial killer who doubles as both the story's nemesis and hero. His progression as the anti-hero provides the best dynamics to the story, and it is ultimately interesting how this dark character is pitted against such dark monsters (in essence, using a monster to fight monsters). The film overall is pretty decent and original sci-fi material, but aside from Riddick, it doesn't really have many characters to like or root for.This film does its best to be stylish and hip. It boasts some pretty decent photography, but it gets really erratic with the editing at spots, using a few too many flashing images and fast cuts for my tastes. Weird color schemes are also dispensed liberally throughout the film's first half. Acting is okay: everybody plays it tough in this picture, especially Vin Diesel, whose performance matches up pretty well with the character. Writing is not bad. This production has okay-looking sets, props, costumes, and locals. Some of the special effects haven't aged well, despite being well-conceived. Music is pretty standard.This film has an unrated director's cut available on DVD and Blu-Ray, which offers a few extra minutes of dialogue and character-building scenes. To me, the differences between the director's cut and theatrical cut is very slight, and I find it hard to really tell them apart.There is a lot to like about Pitch Black, except for the supporting characters, some of the long drama, and the gaudy editing. Horror and sci-fi fans should enjoy it the best, but for most, I'd recommend it as a rental.3.5/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Pretty Good)",Pitch Black

Sure, people being attacked by man-eating insectlike aliens isn't exactly the epitome of originality, but Twohy's execution is good. Also, I can't help but like a film which is so interesting to watch for purely visual reasons. The light is either an ice-cold blue, a searing yellow, or, well, pitch black. The camera angles are great as well.Like I said, the story isn't exactly original, but I liked the fact that Riddick (Vin Diesel) is a complex character until the end, and Diesel certainly is the right actor to portray the murderer. I particularly like how he says the last line which goes [something like]: ""Tell them he died somewhere on that planet.""I think it's obvious that I liked Pitch Black. Sure, it ain't no Aliens, but then this is obviously low-budget and that's even more impressing.A ""pleasant"" surprise. (7/10)",Pitch Black

He's smart, he's witty and he could be the next big action hero.  Pitch Black has some nice touches. The bleached out look that the planet has is an interesting touch, not one you usually see in science fiction films.  The creatures are interesting, and I like the idea that they only exist in total darkness.  Rahda Mitchell is gutsy and resourseful as Fry, and as I said before, Diesel is primed to be the next big action hero.

That being said, it has some strong feature that makes it impossible to ignore. Its flaws make it barely watchable.Let's start with the bad for a change. The creatures are poorly designed with bad CGI to boot. The lighting is wrong most of the time. The characters are at best unidimensional. The ""natural outdoor"" set pieces obviously fake when it comes to rock formations. The story is extremely simple, and finally, the scenario as well as its implementation have a number of logical flaws.Then, what has it going for itself? Well, the mood for one is excellent, its strange and tight. The main ideas about the setup, how the characters go there, and the environment, are refreshingly interesting. The fact that the action takes place in the dark and mostly without sets is a stroke of pure. genius. Now, if only they could have made the lighting ""real"", to correspond with the light sources available, it would have been perfect, and the mood entrancing.If you're a sci-fi lover, it would be worth a watch, it's different.

104,rdoyle29,a limited success on a meager budget,6,31 August 2003,"Screenwriter and director David Twohy has made a career out of crafting challenging, well-mounted science fiction films via limited means. With this somewhat derivative but enjoyable action thriller, he nearly succeeds. Most of the casting in Pitch Black is by type and thus instantly forgettable, though given the story's haunted-house horror movie structure, this is probably by design. The film is anchored by Radha Mitchell and the strutting, grunting Vin Diesel, relative newcomers who prove their mettle on the big screen with reflective performances marked by detailed, intuitive choices. As he did with Warlock (1988), Disaster in Time (1992), and The Arrival (1996), Twohy takes what was intended to be a straight-to-video genre potboiler and transforms the project into something at least a cut above other examples of its type.

A cast, mostly unknown, an interesting idea and a trailer full of wonderful scenes, which I thought might be the movie there and then, with creatures that reminded me of Alien. Another shoddy collection of other films into a new sci-fi I thought. Wrong.This story doesn't have a hero, it has many flawed characters, all of whom behave unexpectedly and change before you as the story unfolds. The suspense of the story is pulled from the lack of trust between these characters and the whole premise of complete darkness throughout. The idea of having the one person who could save everyone as being the one person there's no way on any planet you could trust, is ideal. It also brings forth the idea that you're behind the bad guy all the way, just like the Terminator.My surprise at the effects, the acting, the standard of filming and storyline was high.

He directed this and I must say I'm pleased to see the film is this effective. The story begins weirdly as we don't know what's going on. It is better to know as little as possible about this film before watching it, so I won't tell you too much. The spaceship crashes into a strange planet in which there seems to be sunny all the time and no nights at all. Soon the darkness begins to threaten and the real hellish nature of the planet starts to reveal and the nightmare begins.There are many great scenes in Pitch Black and especially the use of camera is marvelous. The fast edits are stylish and they are not used too much and they don't irritate. The use of light, shadow and darkness is so effective that the viewer will be on the edge of the seat. It is great to see that Hollywood still manages to release something this interesting and ""marginal."" As we learn what the real threat in the planet is, the tension just raises as the enemy is too strong (and hungry) for the crew members..Also, the sound effects are very creepy and sometimes reminded me of the power of Japanese film Ringu by Hideo Nakata. Technically this film should please demanding fans of horror cinema, too, and don't be turned off about the big studio status of the film.The atmosphere in the planet is VERY scary and the feeling of Hell is touchable. There is a real terror and horror present, and in fact, I hadn't seen anything this effective for some time, at least from Hollywood. There are few stupid cliches that should have been left away, but it seems to be always the case with these kind of films. The film is not too clever or intelligent, and it works mainly in the level of cinematic power and pure terror experience. The effects are great and gore is stylish and not too over the top or laughable. At least the ""head bite"" scene is inventive and memorable. Couple of scenes are very disturbing and scary and they only add to the power of the whole movie.8/10 rating is deserved and this should be seen in big screen (or at least in Widescreen) as that way Pitch Black would be even more effective experience.

Anyone who paid attention in school can hopefully interpret what they see on the screen, and see how much thought David Twohy and the other writers put in to how these creatures would evolve in such an environment, and how the rest of the planet-- visiting humans, or otherwise-- would react.So the premise isn't 100% believable, but that's a nitpicky excuse from someone who doesn't know what they're talking about.  Humans can't travel between solar systems, EITHER, but no one thought to comment on THAT.  It's a freakin' movie folks, certain things have to be accepted.  This ship is going from Planet A to Planet B, and they crashed on a planet that has comparable gravity and atmosphere to Earth, and it's got 3 suns.  Stranger things happen on Star Trek and I don't see a single negative comment THERE... heck, it's even more improbable that an Alien (1979) could have acid for blood, but everyone bought that without batting an eyelash.Ignore the Nitpicky comments you see on this site.  This is a well-thought out, character-driven sci-fi story that I was riveted too, both by the characters, and the amazing visual images that Twohy has brought to the screen.  If ""The Arrival"" was only a glimmer of his writing/directing talent, this is a full-on assault on the nerves of any self-respecting movie-goer... I can't wait to see what he comes up with next.Oh, and the moral lesson at the end.  It succeeded where Saving Private Ryan failed completely.  And if you don't know what that means, you're one of the people I'm taking a shot at.9/10.  Sure it's not making money, but neither did Fight Club.  History will decide.",Pitch Black
116,CelluloidRehab,Aliens anyone ...,7,22 June 2004,"This movie proves what you can do with a small budget and a bunch of people determined to make something with an idea and where profit is not the primary concern over content. Yes, the plot is not new, the aliens are definitely not new and the dialogue is Shatnerian at best. The movie as a whole still works. There are some stunning visuals along with some really good acting by Vin Diesel. Its obvious that he has acting ability, it would be nice to see him use it more, rather than settle for what he is currently doing. The movie is simply a showcase for the main character, Riddick. This movie is not Pitch Black, but Riddick. He is not the first character we meet, he is not the protagonist/hero whatever. Yet through all this, he is the fulcrum by which this movie revolves. We want to hear more about his past, and we want to see what he can do. Apart from the incredible crash scene, the fight scene between Riddick and Johns is one of the memorable scenes of the movie. The most brutal is when Riddick takes out one of the creatures barehanded.",Pitch Black
117,troyputland,Little originality but still a decent thriller.,7,23 May 2015,"Pitch Black is a decent cross-genre movie, that ups the ante the deeper it goes. Starting as a fight for survival, PB is an upheaval of frights for the marooned party we know so little about, on an unknown planet after their plane crashes. With limited food, water and no shelter, the odds are against them, especially with a known murderer in their midst. The temperature drops, sun begins to fade, and the creepy crawlies come out to play. Pitch Black holds no originality to its name, displaying facets of thrillers like Alien and Predator. The computer-generated beasts riddling the survivors' breathing space are imaginative; covered by the darkness to make our imaginations run wild, but also to hide the fact the CGI is below par. The darkness settles, scaring them and us respectively. One terrifyingly cool scene sees the group fending off hordes of monsters with big glow sticks. At the time in 2000 none of the actors were glowing stars. This means everyone and no one can survive, from Diesel's hard-edged mystery man to Radha Mitchell's likable captain. All you need to know is what's right in front of you. Like other thrillers, the who's and the hows aren't necessary.",Pitch Black

119,rollernerd,Great Furious Sc-iFi Flick,8,22 August 2020,"Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Greetings from the dark...We will have a break from Streep movies and look at a personal favourite sci-fi character of mine, the underrated Riddick....Tonight's movie review is all about survival, how to survive in a hostile, alien world against even more hostile creatures. The first entry of this series is the science-fiction horror flick Pitch Black (2000) where a commercial spaceship is transporting through hyperspace a crew of people who are in suspended animation (deep sleep) to a new outpost. After a brief monologue around animal instinct...boom! Something hits the ship and we see a cool spaceship crash-landing on an abandoned planet which has three suns so pretty much there is no night. So, the survivors try to observe where they have landed and survey the interesting landscape until one by one each survivor gets killed by a creature who lives underground. Soon the remaining survivors find out that they have marooned on a planet full of bloodthirsty creatures that only come out to feast at night and guess what...as fortune fits the month-long eclipse is about to occur straight away....The survivors are a mixture of interesting people including the only member of the crew who is dealing with her moral dilemma around leadership and overcoming her own fears, a holy man on a hajj to New Mecca, a supposedly police officer who is hooked on morphine and the prisoner he's transporting, Riddick played by the furious Vin Diesel. To me this film truly belongs to Vin Diesel as Riddick - he has the most magnetic screen presence and is a show stealer with the execution of his dialogue. As a movie goer who watched this when it first came out pre Fast and Furious days, I wasn't sure whether Riddick was a villain or the main core character who tries to do good. And still to this day I have the same feeling. Diesel plays Riddick in a creepy and dangerous manner while trying to avoid the typical hardened criminal. The character Riddick and the deal with his eyes and his development in the flick really brings out a raw protagonist.The overall acting from the others isn't the best, the choppy scenes of some of the deaths are interesting, however the colour and the tone really places this flick on a different level which enhances the thrilling, horrifying and exciting elements through the movie. This sci-fi flick is a perfect example of making a good film without having a massive large budget. Overall, this an entertaining film 8/10",Pitch Black

The fx and picture quality is also very good and this together with a great story makes one hell of a science fiction thriller.In the lead role we find Vin Diesel which I really got my eyes open for after this movie,he is a great actor which I guarantee the you will see in a lot of movie in the near future.They are now working on a sequel which is named The Chronicles of Riddick,it will be out in 2003 so you better look forward to that.",Pitch Black

122,basrutten,Pitch Black = Dead Average,5,26 October 2003,"I must say that I had reasonable high hopes for this movie, but when watching it, it soon became clear to me that it's seriously lacking in the originality department.What we have here is the tried-and-true formula of a group of wildly different and colorful characters getting stuck in a dangerous situation and then getting killed off one by one..it's been done countless times before (the Alien movies, Event Horizon, Deep Blue Sea, Sphere, Resident Evil, The Haunting and dozens and dozens of slasher movies) and most of the times a lot better. The story consists of the normal array of arguments, revelations, fights, people freaking out, comedy one-liners etc, and in this case the revelations just aren't that shocking, the one-liners aren't very funny, the enemy isn't especially memorable, and the various deaths are predictable and rather stupid (could somebody please explain to me why some characters get slaughtered, while many of the others survive in spite of the fact that they're really aren't illuminated any better than the ones that get killed?). Granted, ""Pitch Black"" is acted pretty well, and the camera work is also well-done, but for the most part it's a thorougly average, unoriginal and generally quite dull by-the-numbers movie** out of **** stars",Pitch Black
123,TheHande,"You're not afraid of the dark, are you?",9,22 August 2006,"There isn't much that I can say about Pitch Black that hasn't already been said: it's dark, low-budget and brilliant.Riddick is one of my favorite characters in cinema, alongside Darth Vader, Bond and Jack Sparrow. Vin Diesel has a type of menacing presence that only very few actors can achieve. The over-all grading of the film also gives us a nice and unsettling atmosphere, and a little bit of dark irony keeps the film alive.I guess it's a bit of a bummer that I saw Chronicles before Pitch Black since I already knew the outcome, but as a science-fiction suspense film (I don't like the term ""horror"") it is a major success as well as a bit of an unconventional drama.",Pitch Black
124,Shiva-11,"If you want to be scared by nasty monsters, rent Aliens",7,23 February 2000,"Pitch Black: A ship of interstellar colonists has their plans changed when they pass through the tail of a wayward comet.  They crash-land on a barren planet, with three suns, and no life, or at least that's what they're led to believe.  With an eclipse on the way, a killer on the loose and some scary creatures who come out only at night, things don't bode well for our heroes.I was impressed with the before-the-eclipse cinematography - the landscape was stark, blinding and essentially monochromatic, creating a feeling of desolation and desperation (I know I wouldn't want to be stuck there under any circumstances).  Second, the opening sequence is extremely well done - from the howling winds to the wild debris - the viewer feels like they are in the cockpit with the crew.   I also enjoyed Vin Diesel's performance as the murderer with a conscience.  Unfortunately, the movie never recaptures its momentum and becomes increasingly insipid. What exactly are the odds that you would crash-land on a planet with three suns, with a killer that can see in the dark the day before a total solar eclipse (that occurs once every two decades) engulfs the planet.  I'm guessing slim to none.  To make matters worse, the monsters, are without a doubt, the worst waste of computer animation I have ever seen.  Who dreamed up these walking anvils with teeth? I found them laughable rather than terrifying.  Finally, the ending was contrived and anti-climactic.

125,Bruce722,One of the best sci-fi/horror films of all-time.,8,5 September 2013,"Pitch Black meshes the sci-fi/fantasy genre with the horror genre better than any other movie, including Alien. Vin Diesel's character is amazing. His highly questionable moral compass combined with a strange sense of principles creates a very interesting character dynamic. The supporting cast is solid too, with Radha Mitchell possibly seeing even more screen time than Diesel's Riddick. The cinematic effects, however, are what make this movie stand out. The camera effects are sometimes a little overdone but the color palette used throughout most of the film is done to great effect. The plot suffers from a couple of clichéd episodes of stupidity that plague almost all movies (most notably Paris' ridiculous act towards the end). It also wraps up a bit too suddenly. It feels like the movie is building towards a climax and it ends rather abruptly. Nonetheless, this is an instant cult classic that has held up well over the years and I highly suggest checking it out.",Pitch Black
126,Mitch-38,Mediocre Time-Filler,5,3 March 2000,"Scifi ALIEN clone stirs up a couple of good scares and good big screen viewing effects.

127,FountainPen,"Irritating, boring, noisy, worthless, nothing to recommend it !",1,24 December 2006,"I know it's ""stylish"" to like and praise the ""actor"" Vin Diesel but this flick is just a mess with or without him. It started out with a voice-over that I could not understand: mumbled, low speech that was unclear. The titling was in a typeface very difficult to read. The sound effects were loud and noisy, over-blown, accompanied by flashing lights in an apparent attempt to impress (ho-hum). The photography is silly, presumably the director was trying for some kind of imagined artistic effect. Looked as though he'd used the wrong kind of film stock and/or put incorrect filters on the camera lens. Forget ""acting"", what a shambles! Complete waste of time, so no point in my commenting on the ""story line"". I think I'd rather watch ""Gigli"" again than see this movie once more.",Pitch Black

(They surprised me at any rate; the characters who survive to the end aren't the ones I'd usually expect).I thought the color filter tricks and warped lenses got a bit annoying. And also some of the arguments felt a little over-forced; but I've come to expect that from low budget fare.All I can say is I've seen a few better, and many a heck of a lot worse than this one!

131,Slarkshark,Richard B. Riddick. Escaped Convict. Murderer.,10,22 April 2021,"One of my biggest guilty pleasures. I love this movie and the franchise as a whole. I've seen all the entries and beaten the games. It all started with 'Pitch Black' and the intriguing anti-hero known as Riddick.As a science fiction film it does an incredible job on a modest budget, and looks fantastic for the year 2000. The dialogue is great, especially from Johns (Cole Hauser) who comes off being so hard-bitten which speaks volumes to his character. Riddick is a cold realist; yet still has some form of a moral code. Mostly though, Riddick is a certified badass that you don't want to mess with. Very few can compare with his wits, resourcefulness, survival instincts, pain threshold, and combat ability. It served as a catalyst for Vin Diesel's action stardom. The soundtrack is also one of my favourites.I sincerely hope they commit to making the next installment 'Furya', and delve more into Riddicks backstory.",Pitch Black
132,andy-227,Probably the worst film I have ever seen!,1,28 February 2000,"I went to see this movie, not expecting much, but still was curious and hoping for something good.  After I saw ""Event Horizon"", a film I liked that garnered an enormous amount of negative criticism, I kept my eyes peeled for something like it to resurface.  ""Pitch Black"" looked like it, and I was attracted to it.  The theater was packed, and the ads labeled it ""the scariest movie"", so I was in exceptionally good spirits.  What the projector and celluloid strip revealed was probably the worst film I think I have ever seen in my life!  Never, ever, have I been so cheated and so offended by a movie!  I'm ashamed to say that I watched it!First off, there's no plot.  Next, the casting and acting is bad. Following that, it's not scary.  It's boring, actually.  Also, it's unoriginal, whatever the point of this...thing may be.  And of course, nothing is done with the characters, so you don't care about what happens to them and find yourself enjoying watching them die.   For the first time in my life, I wanted to ask for my money back, and the hour and a half of my life.  For the first time, I felt like I wasted my time.  I was upset all afternoon after it, and I woke up this morning thinking of all the different, more useful ways I could have spent my money.This movie shouldn't have been released in theaters.  It could have been released direct-to-video.  I take it back, it's not even that good.  This should have been released as a ""premiere-TV-movie"" on the sci-fi channel, which loves illogical, mindless sci-fi garbage.  The best alternative would've been to shelve this movie permanently and make absolute certain that it never saw the light of day!The effects and de-saturation of colors are nifty, but that becomes boring in and of itself and fails to save this shit.  Hell, this movie is so bad, it doesn't deserve to be called shit.  For those of you who like laughing at bad movies, stay away.  This makes Ed Wood look like Stanley Kubrick!  I can't help but be deeply saddened by this movie.  It'll take me a while to recover from the shock of how I wasted my money, my hard earned money, so crudely and so thoughtlessly.",Pitch Black

135,fredericksmith1952,"Vin Diesel portrays a thinking killer who displays none of the classic psychotic behaviors we are used to in a ""villain"".",9,18 March 2012,"The plot in this film is pretty straight forward, and certainly not original in the scheme of science fiction. The characters are somewhat predictable, with the Imam leading and caring for his three teenage followers on a great Hadj to New Mecca, the docking pilot having her first ""command"" thrust upon her, the bounty hunter a junkie hooked on pain killers, the entrepreneur who cares more about his cargo that the situation, a kid traveling alone, a provocatively beautiful woman who is apparently traveling for work, and a hard core killer with eyes that glow and the ability to see in the dark. Okay, so that last character isn't so predictable. As a matter of fact, Vin Diesel portrays a thinking killer who displays none of the classic psychotic behaviors we are used to in a ""villain"". Instead, Riddick is a cold, calculating man who carefully reads the people around him. Radha Mitchell is excellent in her role, letting the inexperience of command shake her confidence while she attempts to lead the group into the right decisions. Keith David is the man of God, the man who always finds the hope in the situation and tries to encourage others to do the same. Cole Hauser is a perfect sociopath, coldly deciding who should be sacrificed as long as he survives. The film moves at a good pace, makes one or two logical flaws in the plot, but overall entertains and apparently creates a memorable character in the form of Riddick, who we see next in The Chronicles of Riddick, our next review. Rated R for violence and gore, and language, this film is collectible for Vin Diesel fans and anyone who likes good science fiction.",Pitch Black
136,oshram-3,Not bad for a little cheapie matinée,6,16 January 2005,"I got into this movie ass-backwards  basically, I went to see the sequel and then had someone lend it to me to watch on DVD. Pitch Black is the first movie in the 'Chronicles of Riddick' series, and while it has nowhere near the scope or vision of its follower, is nonetheless an enjoyable film, for what it is.Part bughunt movie and part low budget sci-fi matinée, Pitch Black follows the story of a group of people stranded on a hot desert planet with three suns and only intermittent periods of darkness. Adding to the threat level is that one of the characters, Richard Riddick (Vin Diesel) is a prisoner, apparently a killer of some sort who cannot be trusted. One of the younger characters, Jack (Rhiana Griffith), takes a shine to him and begins imitating his every move, much to the dismay of his would-be jailer, William Johns (Cole Hauser). The group stumbles on a deserted mining colony and soon discovers there are evil nasties that only come out  you got it  after dark. When they need to make a run to an equally deserted outpost to obtain supplies to fix their damaged ship, however, that's when things get interesting.Pitch Black isn't great film-making  it's a cheaper version of an Aliens flick, let's be honest  but the rough and gritty universe is fun, and the ambivalence of Riddick is fun to watch. As darkness sets in and his special ability to see in almost total blackness comes into play, people become more reliant on his uncaring character, which adds a nice twist to an otherwise average if serviceable script and story. Much of the meat of the story revolves around Riddick, which was a smart decision.Diesel will never be considered a great thespian but he's fine here as Riddick, his basso voice and rough edges fitting into the harsh landscape and story perfectly. Keith David plays an Imam with an appropriately reverent air, and the rest of the cast all does a fine job.Pitch Black's worth a rental, if for no other reason than to cast a little more back story on Riddick so you can enjoy the top-notch sequel a but better. It's a decent enough movie in its own right, though a little cheap and a little predictable. But as cheap sci-fi goes, it's pretty good.",Pitch Black
137,jrfranklin01,Thus Begins Riddick!,7,29 October 2004,"This story is the prequel to Chronicles of Riddick. But don't be fooled. I don't think Pitch Black was ever made with the intention of producing a sequel. I think Vin Diesel just became a big enough star that someone decided to continue the character of Riddick. This whole thing is sort of the reverse of ""Remo Williams-The Adventure Begins,"" where the title would suggest a sequel maybe even a trilogy. But no, they started off with a big-shot title that never took flight other than its original film. I never could figure out why though. I mean, it's not all that bad of a movie.Anyway, excuse my departure from the subject - Pitch Black. This film is a sci-fi/horror about a group of survivors who crash land on a deserted planet. But one of their passengers is a serial killer - Riddick. This surprised me in that I would have thought Vin to be the hero (which in a way he semi-becomes but not blatantly). Soon the unfamiliar companions realize there is something else to fear on the planet that is worse than Riddick. Bodies soon turn up missing.This film does a good job with CGI for the creatures and Vin Diesel's character, while still an enigma at the end of the film, surprisingly portrays a backward struggle to compassion. And Radha Mitchell does will in playing a starship pilot seeking redemption. While these themes transpire nicely in the film, the main focus, of course, is on the alien creatures. The gore definitely brings the sci-fi into the horror level. Some good suspense scenes too, where the director draws you in to sympathize with the stranded crew, each of whom seem to have their own conflict. Just don't be misled in thinking you'll see Vin-Riddick as the superhero that Chronicles of Riddick make him out to be. In this film, his motto is, ""When the Bad Get Good."" 7/10",Pitch Black

The characters are all stock characters - feisty heroine, Judas, coward, etc. etc. The only question really is who's next to snuff it. Sometimes this tried and tested formula works - like in this case - but more often not - like the truly mind-numbing ""Red Planet."" So why does this one work? Because it's stylish. The acting is above average. And above all it isn't predictable. The conclusion isn't sign-posted. I really had no idea how it would all end and was surprised at how it did end. That alone deserves top marks in my book.It's an intriguing and entertaining movie. And though it was never likely to change the face of cinema as we know it, it doesn't disappoint.",Pitch Black
140,QueenMakeda84,Could Work,6,5 August 2005,"I liked this film. You knew most of the people were gonna die, so you went with it wanting to find out how. It was your typical strangers encounter strange planet and find out that they've arrived at exactly at the celestial time that the planet's insane night time creatures come to attack for a spell. How predictable. Riddick is only helpful to the storyline, as he can see in the dark, as the creatures can. The most amusing point is finding out the boy was really a girl based on her menstrual cycle as a target.The acting was really good, but you were faced with the typical range of interstellar crew mates. The indecisive, yet resilient captain. The religious dude. The cop who's carrying a psycho, but doesn't do a good job as said psycho becomes loosed. The idiot who thinks everywhere in Paris in the springtime. Etc, etc. The same inane characters exist within all films of this genre. Pitch Black emerges in a different sense because it utilizes a murdering ex-convict as it's antihero and savior of the film. He has loyalties to no one and would like to help the creatures if he could, but manages to yell a monotone ""Keep up"" as his way of helping. Naturally, he doesn't help at all, but offers some strange sense of comfort for leading the way.The creatures weren't all that scary. They even bled blue blood. How's that going really raise hair on our arms? It was like watching Nickolodeon's Double Dare with all the blue goo from dead creatures, not a serious ""I gotta get the heck off this planet cuz these things will kill me"" feel. The movie's saving grace is Riddick, because you want everyone to die anyway, as you're thoroughly annoyed with them in the first 1/2 hour of the film. He feels the same way you do and isn't afraid to show it. His questioning of God is warranted, but the holy man is merely a plot device for Riddick to tell God that he's not altogether pleased with him in truck driver language. It's watchable because Riddick is watchable. The movie fails in itself without hm and that's why he got a sequel. Maybe that's why they killed off the other characters in ""Chronicles"". We just want Riddick and more of him.",Pitch Black
141,extravaluejotter,Not for sufferers of Nyctophobia,7,5 September 2006,"It's interesting to read that Universal Studios had the ending of the movie changed so that the Riddick character survived. In my opinion, it's pretty rare that the Men In Suits make a positive contribution to any motion picture. If you don't believe me, just ask Alan Smithee.Anyway, after ""Pitch Black"" Universal chucked a shedload of money at a sort-of sequel called ""The Chronicles of Riddick"". Unfortunately it wasn't anything like the original.Well, 'Original' is probably the wrong word to use if you're describing the plot of ""Pitch Black"". It's your standard horror movie premise where a bunch of people who don't really get along get trapped with a load of scary monsters. What elevates it above the mediocre is the way in which the story is told. A lot of what scares us is glimpsed on the periphery of our vision. Director David Twohy exploits this well, with many threats to the characters more suggested than actually shown. Once the movie goes into its eclipse phase, we get to see the action through Riddick's ""Shine Job"" vision and also through the sonar of the creatures hunting him and his fellow survivors.There is a creditable amount of restraint in the CGI department and the special effects work well. Any shots of the night creatures are only a few seconds long each time, so that we never get a clear image of what's eating its way through the cast.Twohy's screenplay, written with Jim and Ken Wheat, manages to create some believable characters and make the audience care about what happens to them. Well, some of them anyway. There is a good balance of humour and pathos mixed in with the bloodletting and there is very little excess anything as the story bowls along.The script is fleshed out well by a good cast. No one stands out, although Vin Diesel and Lewis Fitz-Gerald seem to get more than their fair share of the best one-liners.Universal clearly saw ""Pitch Black"" as a launch vehicle for Vin Diesel, previously a solid supporting player in films like ""Boiler Room"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"". Diesel went on to star in some big ole' blockbusters after this film, but ""Pitch Black"" is where he proves that he has genuine screen presence.

A captured convict (played by Vin Diesel) on his way back to prison, a bounty hunter (played by an icy Cole Hauser), a co-pilot (played by Radha Mitchell) who is focused on saving her life at the cost of others, and a handful of assorted voyagers are the unlucky ones.At first, Diesel is considered the biggest threat to the survivors because he is a convicted killer of many and an escape artist; but a quick exploration of the planet with three suns reveals terrifying creatures that lurk underground in the darkness, waiting for the right moment to go above ground...and that moment will come soon when a lengthy eclipse takes place.My most memorable, movie moment of ""Pitch Black"" is the scene when Diesel kills a large monster easily, then says ""Did not know who he was fucking with."" Maybe Diesel is the biggest threat on the planet.""Pitch Black"" is a low-budget, sci-fi/horror movie that definitely delivers. The story, direction, acting, pacing, and special effects are solid. The three main characters - of Diesel, Mitchell, and Hauser - have enough depth to them to add extra layers of complexity to the story. There is one bit of shenanigan that I will address: the numerous creatures are starving, and there aren't enough people to feed on, so they start feeding on each other, and one is so crazed by hunger it doesn't fly away when light - which hurts the creatures - is shined on its body as it attacks a survivor. Why didn't this happen more, especially when the light source of the survivors were weak and few?Mannysmemorablemoviemoments",Pitch Black
143,twanurit,"Dank, Rank Sci-Fi",6,30 March 2001,"This tale of futuristic space travelers crash-landing on a planet and battling vicious beasts that are afraid of light suffers from undeveloped characters, phony special effects and enough plot holes to fill a spacial black hole. Vin Diesel, while a good actor, reads with a too-sophisticated Greenwich village New York theater background that belies his character's psychopathic origins. Radha Mitchell makes no impression as the spaceship's gutsy female captain. Cole Hauser over-acts outrageously as a bounty hunter. The computer-driven special effects are, as usual, cartoon-ish and unbelievable. One character escapes from a cave with a can of worms, literally, (or florescent slugs) which the monsters resist. Other characters are so disposible we feel nothing when they are banished. To see how this type of film is done most competently, see the ""Alien"" series.",Pitch Black
144,tom_koopa,"Not bad, not bad at all.",7,28 September 2009,"Pitch Black starts out exciting, stays mysterious almost the whole time and delivers a surprising and conclusive ending.It tells about a space ship that crashes on a planet. Three suns constantly shine down on it's surface, making it a planet of never-ending daylight. The survivors of the crash make it to a base where they find out that something's not right about this place. When a few strange murders take place, the crew starts to get suspicious. It seems that strange, hostile creatures dwell deep in the caves below the surface. They cannot survive in daylight, thankfully. But then something becomes clear that will put the whole cast in great danger...I really liked this movie. It pulled me in right at the start and I was glued to the screen the whole time.There's great acting, good characters, good effects, well-directed scenes and dialog and a nicely-paced script. There aren't any insignificant scenes.When you go watch this, take extra note of the character Riddick. He's one of the most bad-ass characters I have seen in any movie the past few months. You really start to cheer for him as you progress through the movie. Strange how that works, doesn't it? Pitch Black is a great movie.

145,cofemug,One of the worst EVER,1,28 February 2000,"I saw this movie thinking it was going to be either really bad or really good.  Both would have been entertaining.  But it is just plain bad, and boring.  I saw this movie at the 8:00 showing, and fell asleep.  The first half was sooooo boring.  I caught just enough of it to catch the plot.  Then stayed awake for the second half, which made me want to leave the theater. 
The special effects were decent, but nothing really spectacular.  I could probably do that with several million dollars and a computer.  The coolest parts of the film was when you see through Diesel's eyes, and the monsters' eyes.  Although I have done the special effect of the monsters' vision with Paint Shop Pro, I have not seen it on the movie screen.  In fact, it looked like they just used PSP to get all of their visual effects. 
The rest of the movie was shoddy.  The one-liners were not that great (sometimes movies have some real winners, which this movie did not have), the plot sucked, the sub-plots were pretentious, and the story has been done.  It could have been such a cool movie if it had better directing, writing, editing, cinematography, visuals, etc.  In fact, I would not wish this movie on my worst enemy (although I could stomach forcing them to watch Deep Impact or Kazaam or Leonard Part 6 until they died) simply because it was so painful.  I kept hoping for a good ending, but it never came. 
Also, why were the day time visuals so washed out?  Was it just to create a contrast to the dark?  It was so pointless.  At least in Three Kings, the visuals were meant to look like a Xerox copy because of the news prints, and such.  This did not have a reason to look like that except it was a bad Xerox copy of other better movies.  Vin Diesal had potential in his role, but it was never reached.  Also, I should have drank some of the alcohol that they burned for fuel to get through this movie.  Snore!----------------------------1/10",Pitch Black

Yep: Aliens, Tremors,Critters, Mimic, Deep Blue Sea... We've seen it before. But it's still fun.

148,Sci-FiHorrorFan,A Great Sci-fi Movie and in my opinion it's a Little bit Underrated.,10,14 October 2013,"I Love this Film and what i like about this film is that it really sucks you in.you feel like your in the movie while your watching it. The movie has great visuals and great special effects. the only problems i really have with this film are the characters and the beginning. i thought the film had a bit of a slow start when the spaceship crashes on a strange planet. as for the characters i thought they could have been developed a little more. some were developed and some weren't. I thought Vin diesel was great as Riddick and i thought his character was cool he's an escaped convict and a killer.I also really liked Radha Mitchell in this film i thought her acting was good and i found her character likable and interesting. I also found the Riddick character interesting, the character had a certain mys-teak about him which is probably why i found him interesting.Another thing i found interesting about Riddicks character is that he could see in the dark with his strange bright eyes,i thought that was a cool idea for a movie.I liked the idea of a group of people all being stranded out on a forbidden planet and having to survive. you have these Arab men and two women a few other men,some kid and of course Riddick,and the kid seemed to like Riddick and find him interesting and i thought it was funny the way the kid kept copying Riddick and wearing sunglasses just like him. I just found this film quite exciting especially later on in the film because we are introduced to these Evil winged Creatures which i found fascinating. these creatures only come out during the night which is another good idea the writer had. so the group of people are safe while the sunlight is out but the moment the sun goes down that's when everyone is put in danger and everyone will have to work together to survive and escape and i really like that idea its a good idea for a sci-fi movie and i Love sci-fi films which is probably why this film appealed to me because it has all the right elements to make an exciting story.I thought the film was Written and Directed very well.The film is sometimes suspenseful and even a little creepy at times during the night scenes. the creatures were creepy and i thought they had a fantastic design and they looked very ferocious. all the people had to run and hide from these creatures. i must say i found the creatures very interesting and they were cool to look at.some people get killed by the creatures and some survive and the key to surviving is to stay in the light because later in the film they find out the creatures don't like light, so they carry lights around with them to keep the creatures away. Vin Disel had some really cool dialogue and some really cool BadAss moments in this movie. there was a very cool scene toward the end of the film were Riddick killed this creature when he saw it attacking Rada Michelle. Riddick just went crazy! and knocked the stuffing out of the creature! and stabbed it repeatedly! and i love the line of dialogue he gave after. (It did not know who it was f**king with!.) that was one of the coolest moments in the movie and that is definitely one of my favourite scenes of his.All in all i thought this was a Fun sci-fi movie. I like Radha Mitchell and i like Vin diesel and if you want me to be honest i think the guy is a Badass in every film he's in.the guy always plays cool characters and in this film he's kind of like an anti hero which is interesting. to sum things up is this film perfect, No but its one hell of a good Movie its one that i found very exciting and involving and i got sucked into the story,and anyone that hasn't seen this film should definitely give it a watch i thought it was a very well made sci-fi film.",Pitch Black

The story is lame, there aren't any actors in this movie, only people and it is very predictable. Vin Diesel is of course pretty silent during the entire movie. He is also a bad ass of course.

Replace the giant crabs, snakes and spiders with three heads by some great modern looking aliens and we got PITCH BLACK. With a diference...in this movie the human characters are interesting, have personality and we end up caring for them, much more than we expected, after seeing dozens of alien monster movies through the years.In fact the characters was the thing in the movie that surprised me more, after all i already was expecting good special effects. In fact i wasn´t even counting to get much more out of this movie than just some good action sequences. I was surprised to find such well writen parts for such diferent characters, in a movie that didn´t asked for it to make money in the box-office.And i loved the fact that there were no Hollywood superstars in it. Just this fact made this story much more credible, and right untill the end we are never to sure about who´s going to survive. This movie has achieved something that rarely we see in a movie. That is, inside a story that almost doesn´t exist, there are some excelent characters wich realy keep us interested and fill the usual ""empty"" bad-aliens-eat-good-dudes story with small details and characteristics. The details in this movie are another good thing, and i particulary liked the idea of using Arab characters stranded in a desert planet.There is not much to say about this excelent movie, the characters are excelent particulary the prisioner Riddick, the special effects are excelent, there are some good scares, it´s a great space adventure movie like it wasn´t seen in ages, nice little twists during the plot, fantastic sound particulary during the crash scene, it has plenty of little details everywhere on sets and script, and the visual style is magnificent. In fact i don´t care much for this type of MTV edditing style, ( i didn´t liked it in Matrix for example altough it´s a good movie), but in this case i think it works wonders for PITCH BLACK because it doesn´t exagerates, trying to give style, instead of being used just to tell a story.In fact the direction gives a nice personal feel to this movie, and we can see the director trully likes sci-fi. I never heard of this guy David N Twohy before, but he sure is on my favorites list  for sci-fi, and i can´t wait to see his next film. An excelent little movie, that i recommend to everybody who preffers substance over style.

154,Keyser Soze-12,Pitch Black is SCI/FI at its best,7,24 September 2000,"Science fiction movies are either so good they are instant classics or so bad it goes into the back of the shelf of Blockbuster never to be seen again.  The movie Pitch Black, I believe, is a classic.  It is by far a bizarre little film, but in no way is it a gory alien movie. 	The story is fairly complex.  In some time in the future, a passenger ship caring dozens of people causing the computer to fly it to the nearest planet that can sustain human life.  The nearest planet is a hot, windy planet barren of life, or so it seems.  Three suns encircle the planet creating a weird yellow effect on the camera lens.  It is easy to tell the director and cinematographer had some fun with this.  Through out the early part of the film, the camera has been distorted and creates the illusion that the actors are on a hot, sunny planet. 	After the ship lands, only a few of the crew and passengers survive, the ships last member of the crew Fry, the antique dealer, a group of Muslim priests, the Prisoner Riddick, and Riddick's guard Johns.  Riddick soon escapes.  The rest of the survivors wonder the planet for water in fear that Radik will find them, and murder them.  Eventually they find a human mining quarry that has been empty for twenty-two years.  They soon discover that the planet goes into an eclipse every twenty-two years.  Soon, the entire planet is covered in darkness, and the real fun begins. 	Earlier in the movie, Riddick explains that in prison he had surgery on his eyes to allow him to see his victims in the dark.  This seems a little too coincidental because once the lights go out, as they say, strange creatures start to fly out of the planet to kill them. This forces the group to keep Riddick around to help guide them to safety.  I'm not a physics major, but how does a planet that only sees darkness every 50 years have aliens that any come out at night?  As it turns out, light actually hurts these creatures. 	Seeing this movie, I was amazed at its special effects.  This is an independent movie, meaning some large production company like Warner Brothers or Universal did not pay for it, but out of someone's own pocket. This person must have had a very big pocket.  The camera effects I mentioned earlier guarantee this movie a best cinematography Academy Award, or it at least deserves a nomination damn it.  The acting does leave a bit to be desired, but that is not the point of this movie.  This movie surprised me also with the fact that the humans fight each other more than they fight these creatures. 	This has become one of my favorite science fiction movies, one that rivals the Matrix and the Terminator.  I highly suggest this movie to anyone who doesn't have a weak stomach, the camera does some major shaking and quick turning.  This film will make you have a new appreciation for the light. Overall, it's a fun little movie and you all should see it.My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****",Pitch Black
155,ebert_jr,"How long should a tri solar eclipse last, anyway?",7,20 February 2000,"Apparently, longer than it takes to finish a movie.  This movie tries hard to rise above the cookie cutter alien clone genre of sci-fi films, and to a certain degree it succeeds.  It does succeed thanks to its beautiful artistic vision and artistic direction.  But, its artistic merits rest atop a script that relies too much on some very traditional and tiresome sci-fi plots.The acting, especially the transported criminal played by Van Diesel (who has a great voice for the part) is above average.  The special effects have some novel and quite interesting approaches to portraying an alien world with three suns.  Artistic direction gets very high marks, several scenes seemed to be almost framed and contain a certain attention to detail that is rare today.  The aliens themselves are also very interesting, if a bit derivative from Aliens.  Although, we never do get a real clear look at them, but this ends up working well since it lets the imagination of the viewer fill in the details.Overall, a very good attempt a making a worthy derivation of the classic aliens genre.",Pitch Black
156,DoctorSkyTower,BETTER THAN I EXPECTED....,9,5 June 2000,"I thoroughly enjoyed this flick. It had some interesting camera effects, such as certain colors being tinted over the lenses. The ship crashing onto the planet was impressive. This is probably the best science fiction action movie to date since Alien, Aliens and the Matrix, and far better than Event Horizon. (which in my opinion, was a very bad movie.)WARNING: There may be spoilers, do not read this review if you have not seen this movie!Story revolves around space ship crashing onto a barren planet, (with three suns!) and the survivors discovering the hard way they're not the only inhabitants of the planet. There are thousands of nasty carnivorous critters living under the ground that come out only during the once-every-22-years eclipse!Characterization was really good! Better than I expected of a movie of this genre. By the end of this flick, no one is who they first seemed. I think the cast played their roles well. Especially the dude who was the convict. 
Special effects are impressive (as expected). You only see glimpses of the critters, although they seem to change their size an awful lot. It would be nice to see something made of actual matter instead of a computer-animated graphic. If you watch their actions, however, there almost seemed to be some kind of behavior between the creatures. I found this quite intriguing, and it would've been nicer to see more interaction between them. CONCLUSION? A definite must see! I rate this 9/10.",Pitch Black

Among them is a prisoner, played by Vin Diesel, who they fear and at the same time have to depend upon as the story develops and this makes the group-dynamic very interesting to follow. They have no chance but to trust him and still they become anxious every time he is out of sight. The fight for survival has been made with a lot of suspense and the little group faces a lot of challenges which they try to solve in the best possible way. On the planet they have crashed upon, they discover a former colony of humans that apparently was abandoned in a hurry so along with the fight for survival comes the effort to try and answer all the questions as to what happened here?I think that this movie is beyond any comparison much better than the sequel. If treated in a competent way the ""survival""-theme is always interesting to follow especially if it is combined with the possibilities and challenges of being in a group. Should I rely on the group or should I only trust myself? Should I try to become the leader or should I accept that somebody else is trying to impose leadership on the group? There are many nuances to describe in the theme of ""survivel with the group"" and I think that ""Pitch Black"" pulls this off in a both entertaining and plausible (if you accept the basic principles of the story) way.Regards SimonPs.

159,mwendel,A Hybrid Sci-Fi Flick (Possible Spoilers),8,31 December 2003,"The influences of other science fiction and thriller movies and stories are evident throughout this film.  The movies that come to mind immediately are Alien, Aliens, and Starship Troopers.  The story itself is fairly straightforward and not all that original, hibernated traveling through space, crash landing on planet with no apparent life and a ""deserted"" geological expedition - except when the lights go out, forcing different types of people to work together toward their mutual survival, while the body count mounts.  This kind of movie always tends to be fun, as long as it's done well.  I believe that Pitch Black was done well.  The characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on, and I think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it.Vin Diesel plays Riddick, the stereotypical convicted criminal who has a murderous past, physically prowess, high tolerance for pain, and conveniently can see in the dark.  You know he is going to end up doing the right thing at some point in the movie, because it's hinted throughout the movie that he actually may have a conscience about things.Cole House plays the drug-addicted bounty hunter who's probably in many ways a real bad guy compared to Riddick, as his character reveals itself throughout the movie.  It is most likely that he is most courageous when the odds and firepower are in his favor.  A very self-serving character that in the end gets what he deserves.Radha Mitchell plays the co-pilot on the doomed vessel, who is jolted out of deep sleep because the ship ran through a meteor swarm or the tail end of a comment.  Finding the pilot dead in his sleeping chamber she attempts to land the ship, which leads to our discovery of that's character's potentially fatal flaw - fear of responsibility, accountability, and being a leader.  Her character in the short span of the story probably grows the most, in that she actually grows some conviction, takes charge, and doesn't sit around waiting to be gobbled up by night stalking aliens.  She in some strange way connects with the ever-distant human side of Riddick, who in turn in the end, respects her for her choices and her sticking with them.The story in some cases plays out as you would expect it, but I think you'll be mildly surprised by which characters survive this harrowing experience. This movie is an entertaining train-wreck in progress to watch.  Go watch it!",Pitch Black
160,darkjosh,"Slow Action, Mindless Sci-Fi",3,11 November 2000,"Pitch Black can't decide what it wants to be: an intriguing, smart sci-fi film or a fun, relentless action flick.  It tries to too little to be both and fails to be either.When a spaceship carrying dangerous criminal Diesel crash lands on three-sunned, desolate planet, the crew attempts to find a way off. However, they discover the seemingly-lifeless planet is inhabited by vicious, deadly, nocturnal creatures, and they have unluckily landed in time for a total eclipse.The story has promise, since we expect the crew of misfits will band together and try to fend off the aliens in a hugely exciting way.  Instead, what we get is a film that plods along for half of its way with bantering, lame dialogue, unappealing characters and long, stretched out pointless conversations about planning and gathering supplies.  We are also introduced to the crew of the ship, all one-dimensional characters who we could care less about.  Just for the heck of it, we also see children in danger.Director by David Twohy, Pitch Black could have benefited from more chaotic, gripping scenes of the crew attempting to survive the hideous, stealthy beasts.  Instead, he tries to make the film brainy and it fails miserably. We are treated to excruciatingly dull dialogue interspersed with long pauses, outbursts of profanity, and gore aplenty.  Vin Diesel, the only actor amongst the sun-bleached cast, is the only one who comes off as somewhat intriguing and appealing, but it's mostly because of his physical attributes.  The special effects also fall curiously flat, with the aliens coming off as cartoons.Pitch Black could have been a wild, thrilling, even scary movie if Twohy had decided to make the dialogue terse, added more action sequences, or given the characterizations more weight. Instead, the film decides to plod along, falling prey to the Hamlet syndrome: that is, thinking too much and not doing anything.3 out of 10",Pitch Black

Pitch Black is the first movie in the chronicles of Riddick series and it introduces the world to Riddick.This film is not perfect, nor does it pretend to be, there's allot of bad dialog and sometimes the movie just seems to trail off in some places and doesn't follow a steady pace. But if you can over look that this Vin Diesel vehicle is pretty good.Pitch Black offers you a new insight to the creature feature genre. Instead of dinosaurs , croc's and giant bugs it gives you a whole new species to fear and loath, with that this film delivers only good creature violence and some awesome CGI but besides that it's not much more that a loud clunking action film nothing more nothing less.

The special effects made for Vin Diesel's character Riddick were awesome, as for the monsters, they reminded me of Alien in a way, but the movie was very dark towards the ending and also the ending sucked due to the last person who gets killed, that shouldn't have happened, but sad to say it did happen and it ruined the movie.I rate this 7/10, Vin Diesel was really good as Riddick, the guy you just start to like, but end up laughing at his sarcasm and then end up hating him.",Pitch Black

It's about a travel plane in I think 2020 that crashes on a planet with 3 suns. After that happens all heck breaks loose. Its an obvious rip off of Alien. There's no question at that but it's not a good one either. The style in the way the film is presented is very cool. The camera angels and the color get you into the film but it uses over done Sci-fi horror cliques that have been over done for years. The dark scenes, jump moments, no music just silence and bad alien special effects. The performances are not that well done and the violence is either not seen or clearly fake. The one good thing to come out of this film is Vin Diesel. He's great as a prisoner being transfer named Riddick. He just commands and steals every scene he's in. This guy is the next Arnold or Sly or maybe better than both. Get him some bad guys, guns and a good director and we've got the action hero for the Y2K. I give Pitch Black a 6.4, all because of Vin Diesel. Wait for this Sci-fi horror adventure on video. Even then wait.",Pitch Black
165,jofitz27,Decent action/horror.,7,5 January 2005,"When I heard Vin Diesel was in this, I decided to give it a try. He's really a great actor and no mistake. He was the the whole movie in ""XXX"", truly a magnetic force. He put a pretty good performance in for his screen time in Saving Private Ryan, and was also in the hottest movie of 2001, The Fast and The Furious. His only bad (REALLY BAD?!) performance, and movie, for that, was A Man Apart. But this couldn't be that bad...could it? Defiently not. This is not a great film, but it's a pretty decent action/horror (definitely better than A Man Apart, anyway). It's reasonably exciting as well, and it's only dragged down slightly by the occasional corny script. The fact is, although this may disappoint some horror fans, it definitely serves as a welcome antidote to a stressful day. Silly, dumb fun, Pitch Black is a above average thriller that will probably please most Diesel Fans.Final Analysis: *** out of ***** (3 out of 5)",Pitch Black
166,WilsonLau,What were they thinking?,1,27 October 2000,"This was quite possibly the worst movie I've seen this year and this is not exactly the best year for movies. The story line was interesting but the characters were one dimensional and boring. The ways the characters reacted to their spaceship crashing on an unknown planet was like they just woke up and were like, hey were on a strange freaky planet we're not suppose to be on, and oh yeah theres some booze. Like they didn't really care, like its something that occurs to them every day. That certainly was really unrealistic. I think anyone would be in shock. And they just happen to have a guy who can see very well in the dark. How convienent! Yeah I know a whole bunch of those people. And I know someone who can breathe underwater to save me just in case I'm drowning. Another part of the movie that displayed how poor the directing was handled was in one scene they are walking towards this abandoned station, theres a few buildings there and a spaceship, then they're coming back to their own spaceship and suddenly out of nowhere they have this space car that their driving around. What is this some kind of magical movie? Where we're supppose to fill in all the holes in the plot ourselves? The sad thing is that there are people who actual liked this movie. What kind of world are we living in?",Pitch Black

168,mergatroid-1,"Very original, great story effects and acting",8,4 August 2009,"First I have to say I never give ANY movies a 10 out of 10. Unfortunately, since so many people have trashed this movie just because they didn't understand what they were watching, or claim it's a ripoff of other movies, it has a lower rating than it should have.I would give this movie an 8 out of 10.Overall, excellent acting, effects, story and script.The crew and passengers of a space ship crash land on a planet with three suns. One of the survivors is a chained criminal who manages to escape shortly after the crash.The survivors find an old research camp a short distance away from their crash site (unlikely on such a large planet). Here they find a machine to reclaim water from the atmosphere, a small shuttle-like spacecraft and all the belongings of the people who inhabited the camp.By now, the criminal has agreed to rejoin the rest of the group in exchange for a promise of freedom. This criminal (Riddick) makes everyone else realize that the original occupants of the camp never left, but were killed by some animals that earlier killed another of their party.Their task is to bring back some energy capsules from their crash site to power the spacecraft at the camp.Throughout the story they discover that the planet goes through an extended period of darkness due to an eclipse every 27 years (unlikely they would crash during this time), and soon discover that sightless animals come out to eat anything they can find including each other during this eclipse. Our group has to retrieve the energy capsules while avoiding getting eaten, with Riddick leading the group.Many people claim this movie is a ripoff of the Alien series, or even Jurassic Park. This is utter nonsense. There are hundreds (if not thousands) or monster movies out there, and if this movie is a rip off then every monster movie ever made is a ripoff of whatever the original monster movie was.What do monsters do? They chase you, they rip you apart, they eat you. So, in so far as the monsters in this movie do those same things (as every good monster should) then it is a monster movie ripoff as much as Star Wars is a ripoff of Star Trek.The monsters (I prefer animals) in this movie fly, they have no eyes but ""see"" using a type of echo location like a bat does. One person asked how Riddick could stare down one of these animals without getting eaten. This person should have paid more attention as the movie clearly shows Riddick examining a skull of one of these animals and finding a ""blind spot"" where the animal could not ""see"" what is in that spot.Of course, this movie has a couple of unlikely things like most scifi movies do. One is that the planet has a breathable atmosphere, one is that the gang should crash so close to the research camp on such a huge planet, and of course they happen to crash just before the eclipse takes place.Come on people. If the story was, ship crashes, people die because of a poison atmosphere there wouldn't be much of a story, would there? Same goes for people crash, people wonder around and die of thirst. And, of course, people crash, people find camp with water, people fix small spacecraft and leave. None of those plots would make much of a movie.The way the people are portrayed is perfect for the situation they are in. The animals are quite unique and not intelligent as the aliens are in Alien and Predator. It's a fast paced intense action movie that will give enjoyment to anyone who sees it.If you are a scifi fan and have not seen this movie, you are in for a treat. If you're not a scifi fan, go watch something else.",Pitch Black
169,RunningFromSatan,"Finally, a well-rounded, satisfying sci-fi flick!",8,26 October 2000,"I was originally going to see this film when it came out in February, but I said, ""Nah, it looks pretty bad...""  When I started reading the amounts of positive reviews of it, it was already out of the theaters. So I waited...and waited...and sure enough, I waited until Tuesday (Oct. 24) to get it on DVD.  It was a $20 well spent!This is one smart movie.  The story line keeps you going, it is NOT predictable (something pivotal to this genre of movies), and have some of the coolest monsters!  The sound and visuals of them were pretty horiffic. Spectacular cinematography, too -- the work on this one is the best I've seen in a science fiction movie in a long time!  The coloring and scenery are simply amazing!  Even the light feedbacks from the CG suns behind the characters as the camera panned around was stunning. Also, the acting was pretty decent.  I mean, how cool was Vin Diesel at his role as *the* perfect bad guy in a film? (I WANT MY EYES LIKE THAT! ;] )  The casting could not have been better for this movie -- to tell you the truth, I've never actually sat down and saw a movie with either Radha Mitchell or Cole Hauser, but these actors were born for the roles of Fry and Johns, respectively. I was also very surprised at how the film turned out in the end (no spoilers!).  So, if you see this movie expecting a movie with bad acting, predictable storyline, and a no-brainer plot, go see something else.  If you want the exact opposite, see Pitch Black.  9.5/10",Pitch Black
170,Colbridge,Twohy manages to find a new angle on the premise of humans being stalked by aliens,6,9 June 2021,"Pitch Black obviously takes it's cues from both Alien and Predator however thanks to director David Twohy it manages to find a new angle on the premise of humans being stalked by alien lifeforms as swarms of vicious creatures violently devour their prey as soon as it gets dark and, unlucky for our stranded crew, a planetary eclipse blocks out the many suns shining down on it and consequently plunges the planet into darkness.Twohy gives the film a nice visual style and Vin Diesel seizes on the opportunity to steal every scene as we witness a new action star in the making as hardened criminal Riddick. However despite some tense action sequences and moments of gore I didn't find it as engaging or as exciting as it could have been. This could be down to the uneven pacing.It's certainly more action and sci-fi than horror and, while the CGI dinosaur like aliens are quite impressive and sufficiently creepy, overall the script is low on ambition and the story remains narrow with under developed characters despite everyone's best efforts.",Pitch Black
171,MadBadMovieman,"Alien meets ""The Birds"" in space.",7,20 February 2000,"This movie was like Alien meets The Birds in space.  This was a good Sci-Fi adventure.  A very tense, exciting and creative crash-landing sequence.  We were glad we sat farther back in the theater because of the shake-rattle-roll visual effects before and during the crash.  All the special effects were good to great.  Vin Diesel played his part to the max. Very interesting twists making you wonder who and what a ""Bad guy"" really is.  The Co-pilot did a good job. The bounty hunter did a good job too.Adventure worth seeing on the big screen!",Pitch Black
172,Uthman,Great production design; uninteresting plot,6,27 February 2000,"We haven't seen a really fine sci-fi flick in the better part of a year (since THE MATRIX [1999]), so my expectations were rather high for this one. After all, one of my sci-fi faves, THE ARRIVAL (1996), was made by the same director. While the cinematography and production design are excellent and even plow new fields of creativity, the all-important plot is just a monsters-in-the-dark rehash. The skillful editing gives the film a nice artistic edge, but sometimes it is so jumpy that it is impossible to follow what is going on. Still, the crash scene at the beginning of the film is outstanding, perhaps the best crash scene in sci-fi cinema to date, the relatively low budget notwithstanding.The film flirts with scientific plausibility, but deviances therefrom are jarring. For one thing, an eclipsing gas giant would not be dark against a bright sky. Since the brightness of the sky is a nearby phenomenon due to light scattering by the atmosphere, all you would see of the eclipsing object, if anything, would be a thin crescent, and perhaps some highlights from the rings, as slightly brighter structures against the sky. From a biologist's standpoint, the ecology of a planet that supports a substantial biomass of large predators with little or no vegetation makes no sense. Doesn't anyone ever think about these things?",Pitch Black
173,BibChr,"Good establishment of mood, effective shocks, involving (though not deep) plot",8,14 October 2000,"I approached this film with uncertainty, having heard good and bad about it. But I kept thinking, as I watched it, ""This is a good flick!""By ""good"" I don't mean meaningful, terribly thought-provoking, or uplifting. By ""good"" I mean cleverly crafted, well-executed, entertaining, and involving.The violence is pretty intense, the language is rough, and ""God"" (this time from a Muslim perspective) gets an obligatory Hollywood slam.  In the plus column, I loved a dozen subtle directorial touches.  When you see it, you'll know what I mean when I say ""tap-tap-tap"" and ""Don't you dare,"" plus another dozen or so quick and interesting visual cuts.All in all it's a diverting tale and a good flick, if you can handle dark science fiction.

175,mfisher452,Too many absurd premises but visually interesting and good cast,6,16 July 2001,"Pitch Black begins with the most spectacular and harrowing spaceship crash ever put on film. Unfortunately, while the film is superior to most other recent screen SF, the rest of the film doesn't quite live up to the promise of the opening. It is also unremittingly bleak and violent, and some plot premises rob the film of credibility. A long-range space transport is carrying about 50 passengers and crew in a distant region of space. One of the passengers is a captured escaped convict (Vin Diesel). The ship flies through a comet's tail (why couldn't the ship's nav computer automatically avoid this?) and micrometeorites punch holes in the hull and kill part of the crew before they can awaken from cryosleep. The docking pilot (Radha Mitchell) manages to bring the ship down on a nearby planet (where did it come from?) but the ship is wrecked, with only a handful of survivors among the passengers. The planet is actually a large moon of a Jovian-type ringed planet in a 3-sun system, so it never gets dark---they think. The ragged band of survivors discovers an encampment (lucky it was so close to their crash site) set up by mining geologists for test-core drilling, but it has been deserted apparently for 22 years. They find a small emergency rescue vehicle, functional but without power. The survivors return to the wreck for power cells when the planet passes behind its primary and ""pitch black"" night falls, which, it turns out, happens every 22 years (you guessed it, these folks arrived just in time). This is the signal for thousands of winged creatures to issue forth from underground roosts (why do they have wings if they don't come out but once every 22 years? And how does this barren wasteland support thousands of these creatures?) The surface rover is solar powered, so the rest of the film involves the steadily dwindling group toiling to get to the escape shuttle, on foot over open country, with a shaky supply of artificial light to ward off the photophobic creatures. Their hopes are pinned on Riddick (Vin Diesel), who was incarcerated on a prison planet where it was perpetual night and who had his eyes surgically altered to be able to see in the dark. The climax is not the final dash to the shuttle but what happens immediately afterward. The eyeless creatures (created by CGI that is not as good as we have recently become accustomed to in other SF offerings) are a cross between Ridley Scott's Aliens and pterodactyls, and the noises they make are quite unconvincing; they sound like the electronic music soundtrack for ""Forbidden Planet"" rather than the more realistic animal sounds of, say, Jurassic Park. The human characters are more complex than the average SF or action thriller. The two leads, the gorgeous Radha Mitchell and the imposing Vin Diesel, both play highly flawed characters; viewers who note that the film also features Farscape's foxy Claudia Black will be disappointed as she plays only a supporting role and her character's demise is rather gruesome.",Pitch Black
176,flickjunkie-3,A Gigantic Disappointment!,3,25 December 2000,"I expected Pitch Black to be entertaining, fun and horrific. It was neither of them, and it has few good things about it.After a freak mishap, a spaceship crash lands on a desolate planet. The survivors include an escaped convict (Vin Deisel), his captor, and a bunch of devout Muslims among others. This unlikely collection of people have to team up together when they realise that the planet they have landed on not only has no water, but it is also infested with a bunch of nasty aliens intent on eating them. These aliens don't like the light, so it's a good job the system's three suns ensure 24 hours a day light ... or at least, that is, until a total eclipse arrives.This is basically an Alien clone done in a dumb-ass I've-seen-it-all-before style. There is one good performance from Diesel, who was given a poor script and crap, newcomer co-stars with no potential or future. There are no scary or tense scenes in the film, just a mix of moving shadows, slimy tenticles and objects going through people's stomachs, which isn't disgusting at all, just, embarrassing, try-hard horror. The use of colour is unwatchable and the cinematography is blurry and done in a boring way, unlike most horror films. The set decoration and art direction are neither bad, but they can barely save the film.Seriously not worth your time. You have been warned.I rate Pitch Black 2 out of 10.",Pitch Black
177,MadReviewer,Decent Sci-Fi Fare,6,6 May 2001,"Like the original `Alien', `Pitch Black' is a sci-fi/horror hybrid -- a group of people in the far-flung future find themselves confront by an alien menace in hostile, unknown surroundings.  `Pitch Black' clearly owes a lot of its influences to Ridley Scott's `Alien', but it never sinks so low as to blatantly rip `Alien' off -- `Pitch Black' has a couple of neat touches that make it stand out.  However, it's typical movie cliches that drag `Pitch Black' back towards the realm of mediocrity, and keep it from being a really good film.Somewhere in the distant reaches of space, a freak meteor storm knocks a star freighter off course, sending the freighter crashing to the surface of an unknown planet.  The survivors, which include pilot Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell), bounty hunter Johns (Cole Hauser), and Riddick (Vin Diesel), a sociopathic killer who was being transported back  to prison, discover strange alien creatures lurking beneath the surface of the planet.  These creatures, which cannot stand light, have a taste for blood . . . and soon, they'll be swarming the surface, as a rare eclipse that sends the entire planet into darkness is only hours away.The story, while uneven, has some neat moments -- the inclusion of the Muslim leader Imam (Keith David) and his ragtag band of religious followers added some unexpected dimensions to the film; and the way the kid Jack (Rhiana Griffith) develops a macabre form of hero-worship for the killer Riddick, while disturbing, is probably somewhat realistic.  What truly brings `Pitch Black' down a few notches is the sheer number of unbelievable things that keep piling on top of each other.   The crashed ship just happens to have landed on a sun-drenched planet mere hours before an eclipse that only occurs every twenty-two years is set to begin.  The ship also just happens to be holding a ruthless killer, said ruthless killer just happens to have surgically-adjusted eyes that can see perfectly in the dark . . . the list goes on and on and on.  A few of these would be fine -- willing suspension of disbelief is all part of the movie-going experience -- but after the first dozen or so, it's sheer overkill.  Any small, cool original moments created in `Pitch Black' are inevitably lost amidst the big, steaming piles of unbelievable nonsense.As Riddick, Vin Diesel injects a large amount of coolness in `Pitch Black'. He gives the character enough nuances to keep things from getting boring. Radhia Mitchell was also quite good as the pilot Carolyn, who's forcibly thrust into being the leader after the captain dies in the initial crash. Her struggles in taking charge of the survivors is very believable, and very good.  The rest . . . well, they're predictable stereotypes.  They do a good job, but their every action is incredibly predictable, making `Pitch Black' a lot less tense than it should've been.  Of note is David Twohy's excellent direction:  the way the planet is initially bleached blindingly bone-white after the crash adds a real sense of desolation to the desert plant, and serves to contrast nicely, with, well, the pitch black darkness of the eclipse.  He keeps things moving along at a fairly quick pace, adding enough tension to constantly keep things interesting.  The idea of keeping the CGI creature mostly unseen in the dark is also a good one -- they're a lot creepier that way, and by using them prominently, they might've looked lame if the CGI effects weren't perfect.A pretty respectable thrill ride; definitely check it out if you're a fan of sci-fi films.  Grade: B-",Pitch Black

From the astronomy aspect of the long lasting eclipse, to the environmental details on a planet with a sun much hotter than that of Earth. The devil's in the details. And in this case, the devil is Vin Diesel, whose initially questionable morality proves to be superior to that of the rest and actually - though indirectly, helps them survive a horde of nighttime monsters that live underground during the hot uneclipsed days. Satisfying action throughout, although the effect of seeing in the dark is a little tiring. -2 for choosing the alien shape to resemble Giger's alien. They could have chosen a much scarier figure.

And there's more besides great SFX and scary moments, there are great three dimensional performances from every cast member, amazing cinematography, and a cracking score which sets the mood of the film! Oh yeah, and of course there's Vin Diesel...He's tipped to be the new Bruce Willis? Yep, I can see where that comes from. He prefers a black vest though instead of Brucie's trademark white! Anyway, judging by this film alone, Vin Diesel should be going on to bigger and better things, mind you, it's hard to see how he can better this film - he's electrifying in it!! (Fast and the Furious? o.k. I just made myself look stupid! He'll be BIG sometime soon. Is that better?)This film is a must see for anyone who likes suspense, shocks, great SFX, superb and controlled performances, and a good plot scenario. If that's not your kinda thing, then why are you on this page?!The usual plot - spaceship crash lands on alien planet, and survivors try to find a way off the planet. But, they encounter aliens which try to kill every single one of them! So, we're on familiar territory. This film gives the sci-fi horror a new lease of life though, and it's mainly due to the new alien species that are in the film.

184,NicolasCostoglou,Pitch Perfect entertainment...,10,29 March 2017,"David Twohy is one of my favourite directors/writers today. He makes only movies he wrote himself, and they are always unique in some way. He often takes scientific ideas and uses them to make movies which are in a special genre and does something different with it.And Pitch Black is one of the many times where this premise worked perfectly. It's a sci-fi-horror film about a ragtag group of survivors who crashed on a desert planet and have to survive.SOunds simple? Well it is, and that's a strong point of the film, because the premise is simple and doesn't seem that original at first, but the mystery aspect of this film is what makes it great. Nearly every character has something to hide, and so does the planet which isn't as lifeless as one might think...The actors are all very good, most of all Radha Mitchell and Vin Diesel. Mitchells character feels guilty the whole way through, because she wanted to drop all of the passengers to get a better chance to land the ship, but it didn't worked and now everyone greets her for saving them, and want her to be the new leader. And Diesels character is by far the most interesting Anti-Hero since Snake Plissken (who Diesel said he used as a inspiration. You can't take your eyes off the screen when he's there.But one of the things you have to talk about in a David Twohy movie is the unique style. The movie is edited like all of his movies in a kind of ""push it to the Limit!"" mentality, which is never too distracting, but underlines the intensity of the scenes effectively. Also the cinematography and colors are amazing. The day scenes with the three suns look like you would dry out, and breakdown instantly because of the heat, and the night scenes are fantastically realized (which is very hard to do) and the movie really earns it's title.Also very great: The movie is mostly centered around the characters and how they will get out of the situation, or even if they won't kill each other beforehand, and not so much focused on action, or horror. There are also no jump scares in the film or any other horror-bull crap, it's fairly suspenseful and character driven.That the movie was a fairly low budget doesn't hurt it in any way, the creative way the film is directed by Twohy, prevents it from looking cheap, and the visual effects are just used then needed and aged incredibly well, most of all, of the way they use them.All in all, one of the most intense, dark and unique Sci-Fi-Horror movies you'll see...",Pitch Black
185,Akira-36,an entertaining stylish movie,8,27 September 2001,"If you go and see this film without much expectation, it will amaze you, and if you do, it will still entertain you more than other horror/sci-fi movies, that came out after Aliens. Set up on a barren planet, the lighting, landscape and equipments were stylistically filmed and beautifully set up. The shades of blue, yellow, red and white, polish the film with an edge that is equally balanced with good performances from the mostly not-famous actors. Although there is not much science in this fiction, there are bits of pieces of how the world work in this alternate future. The interaction between the characters and how they quickly work as a team is very well conceived, as it also fills in the lack of background or scientific rationalization of the crew's history, the planet's or the creatures'.Vin Diesel as stated elsewhere, steals the highlight of the movie, with a charismatic presence and a cool portrayal of an anti-hero. There are surprises along the way, with little humour here and there.
It could've been longer and more gory, but I guess the director/producer didn't want to overdo it. So when you count on the low bodycounts and how people die, it is not so much of a horror movie as it is more of a survival thriller.My only complaint is that the creatures are animated, so they don't look/feel that threatening, as opposed to Alien/Aliens animatronics, courtesy of Stan Winston.Overall, this is a highly entertaining stylish movie.Log out.",Pitch Black

I liked Alien and I liked this, because of the survival plot is just so viscerally appealing. Diesel had some nice lines, and a dollop of self-realization and even a bit of vulnerability when he admits to an error in judgment; he took baby steps towards more sympathetic a character, nice and slow. He could have had them all killed one by one, just to take over of their resources, *well with the exception of Johns who may have given him a moment of struggle* but did not. The effects added a lot of rawness to the film, stark colors and dry sand. I did not quite get how the vehicle came into being, which was an important bit of plot, and having 3 suns to deal with, I had no idea whatsoever how that would play out; these were stumbling blocks, easily disregarded in view of the fascinating character interplay.

188,mercury-26,best sci-fi of 2000,6,10 January 2001,"""Pitch Black"" kicks right off with a pretty spectacular scene. In this scene a spaceship serving as a sort of inter-galactic subway train crash lands on a strange planet.  Among the surviving passengers is a convicted mass murderer, Riddick (Vin Diesel from ""Saving Private Ryan""), being transported back to prison or somewhere nasty.  There's the co-captain of the ship, Fry (Rahda Mitchell from ""High Art""), who finds herself in charge. There are about ten others to begin with, but that number of course is reduced to about four by the end.The planet is very desert-like (what world of your typical sci-fi movie isn't?) Luckily (by golly, what a coincidence!) they land near a settlement now seemingly abandoned. There's also a canyon nearby filled with the bones of alien creatures. The group sets out in search of water, concerned by the presence of Riddick. But then something else starts killing people. They discover that the planet's only remaining life forms are these nasty, hammerhead shark-looking things that fly. The planet has three suns and for some reason, these creatures can't live in sunlight. Day lasts 22 years. At night, they hunt. Thing is, night lasts maybe as long as the day (a very cool concept that put a grin on my face). Oh and wouldn't you know it, after almost 22 years of daylight, these poor people crash land on the planet only a few days before the long night falls. sucks to be you I guess.The film is actually the best sci-fi flick I've seen lately (which only demonstrates how bad the sci-fi has been this year). It's quite entertaining if you can get past how absurd it is. The trick is not to think too much when you're watching it. The script cleverly plays the personalities of the characters against each other. It plays the horror movie game of ""who's the real bad guy?"" for the entire length of the film as well as another old favorite, ""who's going to die next?"" If you just concentrate on these questions and not the story itself, which is full of holes, you'll have a good time at ""Pitch Black.""Grade: C+",Pitch Black
189,quin1974,"Cool idea, not so cool execution",7,8 January 2001,"There are a lot of people who think this a great sci-fi flick, why is that? Because Vin Diesel flexes his muscles very prominently on screen, because of the cool photography or leading actress Radha Mitchell. Or could it be that they like the idea of the movie and not so much the movie itself.I think this movie is lacking a lot of things, for one: suspense. When you call a movie Pitch Black it might be a wise decision NOT to start the Pitch Blackness 1 hour (!) into the movie and not have the story be dragged on for such a long time. After an hour the audience doesn't care anymore about creatures coming out of the ground because it is now dark. Even the great visual depiction can't help you anymore at this stage.The story starts out with a blast but after that it gets lost in its own desert of improbabilities and impossibilities. If this movie was supposed to be pitch black, then there was an awful lot of ambient lighting in the second part of the movie.A plus is the Unrated Director's Cut DVD. On this DVD Director Twohy has added a number of scenes that were not included in the theatrical release. These scenes clarify the story some, but they don't save the movie, regrettably. This could have been a great movie, let's hope Twohy does a better job next time.7/10",Pitch Black

The acting was horrible, the special effects were basic and not captivating for me to even really want more. I kept looking at the timer to see how much longer the pain would go on.
      There was no character development, no story line that keeps you wondering. HELL, YOU KNEW WHO WAS GOING TO LIVE AND WHO WASN'T!!!!!!!!!

This is not a disguised horror film, though it certainly drifts that way quite a bit. It is certainly not a science film - much is implausible - what do those tens of thousands of indigenous creatures eat when there aren't a handful of humans on the planet and mass extinction is obviously in progress? Let along how do three suns revolve around a group of planets (Newton would shudder in his grave)? But this film does the one thing science fiction is supposed to do - and does it well. It creates an alternative reality and lets you imagine real humans living in it. The alternative reality works, and the psychological elements of the drama are icing on the cake. As a lifelong science fiction fan (in written form), my disappointment at the weakness of science fiction in film is nearly endless. This film encourages me. It is part way there. I'm looking to seeing the sequels (and probably will soon). I would also rate movies such at 13th Floor, Contact, Mission to Mars (and of course, Forbidden Planet) in that class - true science fiction films, as well as the more popular and mainstream original three Star Wars movies and the Alien series.... but not a great deal else....

194,Cobbler,Screeching Bats With Anchors On Their Heads Will Kill You Every Time!,8,24 February 2000,"**SPOILERS**I was thoroughly impressed with this horror/sci fi hybrid flick, especially in its far-out visual ingenuity (sort of ALIEN 3 meets MAD MAX) and in the thematics of its script (religion, personal redemption, science vs. nature.) I felt like the writer/director tried to put his own personal spin on a story which was admittedly cobbled together from various other sci fi and horror films. For me, PITCH BLACK ended up being totally entertaining on its own terms:1. The aliens were cool as all git out. Not particularly scary, but not someone you'd want to run into in a dark alley. I loved the way they moved and screeched and such.2. The developing relationship between Frye and Riddick was interesting and added an extra dimension to the story. There was attraction, repulsion, mutual respect. Everything.3. Those poor Muslim kids kind of played the role of the old red-shirted guys in the old Star Trek tv series. In short, they were expendable.4. The folks you don't think will survive, do. I appreciated that.All in all, a solid 8/10.

195,Dkish,Pitch Black is one of those monster flicks,7,21 February 2000,"Pitch Black By Dean Kish	When the lights go out, fear smiles a little brighter. Oh so they say. 	Pitch Black is director David N. Twohy's third outing as director and second science fiction film. The story chronicles the crash landing of a passenger spaceship. The spaceship crashes onto a planet that has three suns and is inhabited by underground creatures who live in the utter darkness. The menage of survivors quickly find out that the planet will have a once in 22 years eclipse on the second day of their arrival. Upon the dawn of  the eclipse the planet's inhabitants become rabid and blood-thirsty. Now all they can do is survive the dark. 	To start off with Pitch Black isn't a perfect film or even an `Aliens' or `Terminator' but it does have a lot to offer in the sci fi movie genre. What it does serve up is an interesting look at how a movie's texture and feel can steal the show creating an interesting ride. The cast is hardly worth mentioning and the script is confusing at times but the two stand-outs in the cast and some nasty creatures makes Pitch Black entertaining. The stard-outs would be the `Terminator' presence of Vin Diesel and a `Ripley-esque' Radha Mitchell. Mitchell is particularly good shadowing the brutality displayed by Diesel. Her flawed character wrestles with the guilt of crashing which develops her character for the audience and helps us relate to their unbelievable situation. Diesel, on the other hand, is a star in the making and delivers a convincing villain with a conscience. 	 Pitch Black is one of those monster flicks that belong in the category with classics  `Leviathan (1989)', `Deep Star Six (1989)', `Pumpkinhead (1988)' and `Mimic (1997)'. These are probably little known to the masses but are horror/creature gems on video. What Pitch Black has in common with these films is excellent special effect creatures and little known stars. And they prove sometimes that's not so bad. (3 of 5) So Says the Soothsayer.",Pitch Black

But the screenplay and especially the dialogue sag at each corner.  Snappy retorts lack snap: ironic demises lack irony...the movie just isn't very clever given that it has the potential to be a great Sci-fi flick. One strong point, I will admit: the characters are complex.  The handsome hero isn't, and the brave captain isn't either.  I liked that. Anyway, some people get stuck on a planet that has three suns and creatures that eat everything in (out of) sight when it finally gets dark, and coincidentally there's about to be a total eclipse when our characters show up.

Yes, this movie is one of the decent ones in its genre, but it still fails to make my spine shiver with horror as did Alien and Aliens, the cult movies of sci-fi horror.
The twist in this movie is the murderer, who can see in the dark and how the rest of the group has to depend on his help to get out of the planet they're stuck in. Not wanting to spoil the plot for anyone, but I got serious Deja-Vu when the group of people were reduced one after another. Ok, the actor's aren't that well known (except Claudia Black perhaps, yummy), yet they do rather decent work on the film. Except when it becomes to playing shock/horror at losing someone dear to one etc. At that point the film loses a lot of its creditability. Still, if you like sci-fi, then this film might be worth watching, but have all your lights off before starting the film, you will not be too drawn to atmosphere of this movie unless you are in darkness, with only the dim light of the screen to comfort you.",Pitch Black
201,michaeljharvey,"Believe it or not, this is a good movie",7,1 June 2008,"Yes, this is a B-movie, but that doesn't mean it can't be good. The plot is nothing remarkable, but still works. A spaceship carrying a mixed bag of characters crash lands on a desert planet. Of course, the survivors are not alone and are soon in a battle for their lives against strange bat-like aliens.What works here is the writing and character development. Vin Diesel is surprisingly good as the clever and philosophical Riddick. He's a dangerous convict turned reluctant savior. The supporting cast does a great job of bringing dimension to characters that could easily have been overly simplistic. What drives the movie is the constant uncertainty about the main characters' true motivations. Riddick is particularly hard to figure out and in the end it's hard to say he's really a ""good"" guy. His character is far more complex than that.The special effects are strictly mediocre, but the director seemed to understand this. So the creatures are mostly kept in shadows, helping to avoid those, ""That looks so fake!"" moments. The actual design of the bat-like creatures is clearly ""inspired"" by Giger's design for the movie Alien. They certainly could have been more original, but they get the job done. At least the special effects people decided to rip-off an all-time classic movie monster design.The story moves along at a good pace, never feeling too rushed or too slow and keeps the viewer on edge. It's usually pretty obvious who the survivors will be in this type of movie (where characters are being picked off one by one), but this one surprised me a little at the end. Overall, this is a good effort and far better than a lot of big budget sci-fi action movies.",Pitch Black
202,tom-darwin,Nice Shine Job,8,11 April 2006,"There were outer-space ghoul stories before ""Alien"" (""Space: 1999"" had a few) and since (""Event Horizon""). Most of them are pretty bad and ""Pitch Black,"" which is utterly unoriginal, could easily have been, too. Instead it's a cool, character-driven yet action-packed, dark thriller. An interplanetary space transport crashes on a desert planet with 3 suns and apparently perpetual daylight. Like ""Alien,"" the film begins by exploring the handful of survivors. Like ""Lifeboat,"" it gradually divulges that some of them have things to hide. Not Riddick (Diesel), an escaped murderer being returned to prison by bounty hunter Johns (Hauser, effectively icy & sleazy). When perpetual day suddenly turns to perpetual night, the creepy-crawlies come out to kill, rend & chow down on Fresh Human. To survive, the others must accept Riddick, who is tougher than all of them and has had a prison ""shine job"" on his eyes that lets him see in the dark. But Riddick must also overcome the hatred he has for all of his own kind, a rage that he covers under a cool, wry facade of independence. Will Riddick eventually sacrifice the others to ensure his own survival, or maybe even just for one universal up-yours to the human race? Diesel has a star-making role, making a repugnant character sympathetic, giving us fleeting glimpses of Riddick's sadness & loneliness while never, ever detracting from his granite-souled strength. Several other actors have more work to do in this film than most action flicks, but they are all up to the task. The guilt-ridden pilot Fry (Mitchell), a dark, refreshing break from the butt-kicking babe stereotype begun with ""Charlie's Angels,"" holds the others together while Riddick comes & goes. Mitchell has a steeliness & style that belies her blonde cuteness and holds up well opposite both the brawny, in-your-face Diesel & the taut, cool Hauser. David, as a Muslim space pilgrim, brings religious faith (""Because you do not believe in God, does not mean God does not believe in you"") to counter the others' anger, despair or wry selfishness (""Look to thine own ass first""). The dark, percussion-heavy score is perfect for ""Pitch Black's"" visual effects, which are somewhat less spectacular than recent ""Star Wars"" but more effective, a background rather than a replacement for the action. ""Pitch Black"" is as entertaining as any old Saturday matinée, much better suited to our know-it-all times, without the condescension & stereotyping to which Hollywood is usually so devoted.",Pitch Black
203,Joel I,Predictable marooned-in-space entry,5,20 February 2000,"""Pitch Black"" is an undistinguished entry into the ""marooned in space"" genre.  A very mixed group of space travelers (including a psychopathic convict and a family of devout Muslims) crash land on a barren planet, only to find they are not alone.  The planet is inhabited by man-eating monsters (did someone say Alien).  One good thing is that the monsters are photophobic and can't come out into the light.  Another good thing is that the planet has three suns and is always in light (the monsters dwell bat-like in caves).  But then comes a major problem: the travelers learn that every 22 years, the planet gets thrown into a total eclipse (of all three suns no less).  And guess what!  This is the 22nd year!  Uh-oh.  This could be a neat and scary premise, but director David Twohy hasn't figured out a good way to film scenes in the dark.  The monsters look like they could be terrifying, if only you could see them better.  There is the predictable one-by-one reduction of main characters, but because of the darkness, you can't even be sure which character has been eliminated.  None of this is helped by the awful performance of Radha Mitchell as the spaceship's tough commander (there seems to be a genre trend toward female spaceship commanders).  Mitchell showed she could act in ""High Art,"" so we will charitably assume that she was just miscast here.  She seems about as tough as a val-girl at the mall.  Directors seem to think that if you just take any actress and dress her in a tank top and let her curse a lot, she will turn into macho-woman.  Not here.  The saving asset of this movie is Vin Diesel as the mysterious psycho convict, Riddick.  Diesel adds welcome depth to the character, and imbues him with an impressive Darth Vader voice. There are also hints of a back story on Riddick that seems to be more interesting than this movie.  Perhaps we will find out.",Pitch Black

Aliens, Tremors, Silence of the Lambs, Starship Troopers, etc. This film barely has an original bone in its body. But it is fun nonetheless. Much of the credit goes to David Twohy for creating a pretty interesting world for these people to crash-land on. And the middle section when Fry, Riddick, and the rest begin to realize what's in store for them is by far the best. Much more credit goes to Vin Diesel for his portrayal of Riddick - his voice is like another character in this film, and the narration is so amazingly recorded that it feels like its inside you.

Being a visually exciting sci-fi action movie from Hollywood, you would expect to be entertained. And you are, but you end up feeling like you just had a very cheap one night-stand.The elements of the story are all inferior copies (extreme dark planet cycles from Nightfall, monsters from Alien, dangerous but helpful outsider from Waterworld), there is never any feeling of an impressive imagination at work or that they sat down to work out the ideas. In other words, a copy-paste quick blockbuster.Beware spoilers: The writing is unforgivably lazy and terribly coincidental: They land on a huge planet right next to a previous colony, they land exactly at the end of a 22 year cycle, they crash land on a hard surface but survive, etc.The monsters never make any sense: They are hyper-sensitive to light but pull a man off the surface in broad daylight, they evolve on a planet that is mostly light but can't stand any light, they have nothing to eat except each other, they fight each other when in flight but somehow live in claustrophobic caverns for years, they attack only the people that the writers want to get rid of, and they give birth to light-emitting babies?

206,Joseph_Gillis,A Celebration Of Oscar Minor Categories Film-Making,6,19 January 2019,"Which shows just how much mileage you can get from top-of-the-line production design and special visual effects, particularly when combined with inventive camera angles and lighting. To be fair, in a film which relies so much on 'make-the-audience-jump-out-of-their-seats' shocks, quality acting probably wouldn't have made a huge amount of difference, but it might have made those 'internal conflicts' of the group dynamic so much more credible. Too often, those conflicts smacked too much of 'Primer' calibre 'pulled punches', which fizzle out before they've built up a sufficient head of steam, at least until the next unconvincing argument rolls around. It didn't help, also, that the group's character profile smacked too much of quota-filling and genre stereotypes.Story-wise, we've probably seen it all before, probably dating back 60 years and more: a spaceship crash-lands on an uncharted, unforgiving planet, and its motley crew - including one dangerous criminal - recognising that compromises need to be made, and unlikely alliances formed, if they are to make it off the planet alive.
Story-wise, too, you can probably fill in the blanks although, to be fair, you can probably do likewise with the best of that sub-genre.
Except that from early on, I frequently found myself comparing it unfavourably with far superior films, made by longer-established, if not also superior filmmakers: like the 1950s 'creature-feature' 'Them!' which, perhaps benefitted from being more homebound, and its creatures being a product of radioactivity, and from the presence of a lead actor of considerable and plausible gravitas; and 'The Thing', whose director, John Carpenter had acquired a certain facility in the short sharp shocks department; he was particularly well-served, though, in that film, by an ensemble of actors who knew their place and their roles, and rose to the occasion, no matter that the subject matter might have been just a little hard to swallow for them.

This movie is a breath of freshness in this genera. Although there is a spaceship in this with a not so unique fate assigned to it at the beginning but the plot changes its course to some uncharted territory pretty fast after that.The making and acting is decent. The interesting story creates a thrilling experience throughout its runt-time. Vin Disel nails his part with perfection. It was more than impressive to watch him act.There are some unnecessary events in the story that felt forced to me. These were avoidable and probably were there just to get the audience emotional(if you have seen this you might understand what I am talking about).

A killer with a heart o' gold. Vin Diesel kicks serious ass as the lead character Richard Riddick. When he's on screen you don't want to look anywhere else. The dialog is filled with lines that you'll soon be hearing everywhere. Diesel's raspy voice intoning ""You're not afraid of the dark, are you?"" puts him firmly in the One-Liner Pantheon with Willis, Stallone, and Schwarzenegger.  Other characters hold their own, (I enjoyed Keith David's portrayal of the Imam. His voice is great too, for the record.) but this is Diesel's film and he runs with it.

There is little territory here that the Alien saga has not already covered. The visual effects are of a very high standard, but that's not enough to sustain this film, nor is all-too-frequent use of the ""F""-word a sufficient substitute for dramatic tension.Vin Diesel gives a suitably laconic performance as the indestructible anti-hero, while Radha Mitchell gives it plenty as the ship's pilot.

Specially, the Muslim father and his sons who run around every where after the crash as if nothing has ever happened yelling ""Allah u Akbar"" looked really dumb and an insult to a certain religion. Other characters too (except for Riddik and Carolyn) were very uninteresting. Kid's character is so irritating. In short, most characters failed to get an impression on me.

Other points/Neither positive or negative(P) Slow-burn sci-fi thriller about a group of civilians and a convict crash-landing on a deserted planet which at first seems devoid of life - before an eclipse occurs that blocks out all light on the planet, causing murderous creatures to fly out of the ground and attack the shipwrecked survivors; focus on suspense, tension etc. rather than all-out action; in addition, despite this film being a ""slow-burn"" story, the pacing still feels brisk and avoids being sluggish or boring.(P) The story is strong enough to keep you invested in what is happening (even if the film can get a bit cheesy at times, and sometimes makes you want to yell at the characters (see the negative point below that starts with ""Several moments in the plot..."").(P) Each of the crash-landed survivors are all memorable and are performed well (Richard B. Riddick, the convict with mystery, myth and fear surrounding his persona; Carolyn Fry, the strong-willed but empathetic pilot of the crash-landed ship; William J. Johns, the 'merc' who has a history with Riddick and initially is believed to be a cop; Paris, an antiques merchant with a penchant for alcohol, luxuries and relaxation; the Imam and his three sons traveling to New Mecca etc.).(P) World-building is subtle but effective; while borrowing heavily from many aspects of a typical science-fiction story, it also employs lots of horror, grittiness, dark themes as well as integrating aspects of the modern day into it (the most immediately obvious of which is the Islamic religion that the Imam and his sons practice) - all of which helps to differentiate it from other sci-fi universes).(P) Cinematography is adequate; although specific praise must be given to the lighting as, not only is there a great deal of variety, but it's used in ways which service the film's overall atmosphere and grittiness.(N) Several moments in the plot either didn't make sense (""Wait, how did they manage to get Riddick, this highly cunning and effective killer, chained up twice? Was it part of his plan to get captured several times, or are we just going to look over this plot contrivance as it puts Riddick in a position where he's 'forced' to help the survivors get off the planet?"" Or ""Paris, the antiques merchant, is killed after crawling away from the rest of the group in a moment of panic, accidentally disconnecting the lights and putting everyone else in danger - despite knowing full well that the creatures on the planet avoid the light as much as possible as it burns their skin. Why? Why would he do that? That seems pretty foolish for a character who, while somewhat vain and lazy, has shown a protectiveness towards some of the characters (like Jack) and, at the very least, has been shown to be intelligent."") or were pretty cheesy (Riddick looking back to Jack being attacked by one of the creatures, having a change of heart and going back to save her).(N) A number of editing choices e.g. the distortion effect over the scene where Fry is crash-landing the plane, the extreme wide-angle lens in a few shots, ""flopping"" the image back and forth horizontally very quickly (?), Johns walking up to Riddick's discarded chains being a quickfire series of jump-cuts for some reason etc. were distracting and could have been handled better.Overall: 7/10, perhaps a high 6 (?) and maybe a low 8.",Pitch Black

Cole Hauser, I was sad about little space for Claudia Black though), subtle visual effects and photography in overall, believable plot (considering the genre) without a lot of logical holes, really non-predictable twists, build-up characters. These are the greatest assets of the movie. Combined with style - some may consider this movie a B-grade effort but I would disagree with that. The whole thing really is very original and stylish.And even though I'm not a fan of Vin Diesel, this tough guy role of Riddick suited him well.

This movie suffers from a severe lack of talented actors/actresses and the script seems to have been written by a 9th grader with a potty mouth. The only thing that saves this film is the visuals. The landscapes, ships, and other planets all look amazing. The biggest treat here is the aliens themselves. Unfortunately they don't get enough screen time.

Claudia Black's northern-suburbs-Sydney was particularly lyrical. Solid turns by Cole Hauser, Keith David and Rhiana Griffith and others. Radha Mitchell could have kept her accent too but it seems that films contractually require American accents from ""lead"" characters so much these days that it's become a real pain in the ear.This is Diesel's best film in my opinion and an entertaining ride.",Pitch Black

Well, excellent within its limits. The movie is an ""Aliens"" clone but it works very nicely on its own.The cinematography is the victim of the low budget. It took me half an hour to become accustomed to the almost 'black-and-white' images. The colours are very basic and general. But the special effects are flawless and scary. Another problem is the very small screenplay. Read out loud and it wouldn't have taken more than 30 minutes. Characters are more or less sketches, with one exception. The anti-hero Riddick is the only character well written. Under the very odd and evil eyes, lies a good conscience that just needs help to come to the surface. But Riddick needs help in order to do that. He is the only character that I cared about and I am very happy that he survived. The actor, Vin Diesel (don't laugh at his name) is one of the best looking out there, and I hope he is also talented. I recommend this movie entirely and I give it 7/10.",Pitch Black
226,jrkdany,Disappointed,4,4 January 2021,I know I am quite late to review this title but I watched it only recently and did not like it. It has a great premise but nothing much happens throughout the movie. The killings or the creatures themselves were not that great. No background is provided and they act so casually after crash landing on an unknown planet. No one worries about oxygen or surprised on availability of water. I guess earth like planets were dime a dozen in this movies universe. The characters also make stupid decisions. I never rooted for anybody.

They've all been complete crud and this is NO exception.**** POTENTIAL SPOILER ALERT ****Let's start with what's cool in the film. Very little.
1) The concept of the tertiary star system with the planet they're stuck on in the la grange point between the stars. (basically the point of gravitational balance so that the stars and other planets can orbit around it. certainly feasable as far as my knowledge of physics allows).2) The enhanced seeing ability of the ""prisoner"" character, which also serves as a plot device later.3) The aliens themselves. Although I look at this film and then the film ""Aliens"" and go ""rip off, rip off!"", at least they seem to act like ordinary unintelligent animals which makes a damn good change. Their POV shots so we see what they see are also pretty cool too.4) Our ""baddie"" character who through the magic of role reversal is also a ""goodie"", has very very cool eyes. Don't believe me? Check out his POV camera shots.5) The ""bleach bypass"" used on the film negatives gives a very very interesting look to the film and helps add realism to the tertiary star system concept.The rest is crap.Seriously. The rest is total rubbish. The start of the film although with impressive CGI rings hollow and the rest of the film does too. I watched the first 40 mins or so and I was BORED. I just didn't care two hoots about the characters.They spend 30 minutes or more going on about what a bad character our ""hero"" is. Great. Now show me. Oh, you're not going to are you? Right, now the suspense behind him is completely shot before you even see him in action. Just because the other characters are afraid doesn't mean we are because we haven't seen what he's supposedly done. Put up or shut up. Preferably shut up.Now it should be pointed out that David Twohy obviously doesn't know how or where to point the camera. There are a couple of interesting shots which are great if we were watching a pure suspense film. We are not however. There are scenes where I was left almost dizzy and not knowing what is going on because of the camera blur.Because of this, the story just doesn't ring true. There seem to be shots and lens effects used simply for the sake of the ""oh, doesn't it look cool?"" trap i've seen many filmmakers get into. (including myself).I'd like to have known what the original script was like. David Twohy is on record as stating he took the original script and re-wrote it in his own image. This to me is arrogance of the highest order. Didn't anyone else get to read it first? There was probably nothing wrong with it in the first place. As a result, some of th ... no, most of the damn dialogue is incredibly stilted and unbelievable.There were good moments, but not many. This film tried to be too many concepts at once and failed miserably at every one of them.So, to sum up. Don't pay money to see this. Ever. If a friend has made the mistake of renting it then watch it if only so you can laugh behind his/her back later. Cruel, but true. I wasted £2.75 on this rental.Stop David Twohy before he ruins another script and/or film.",Pitch Black
229,chexmix,all in good fun,7,18 June 2005,"I first saw _Pitch Black_ when I worked at SCIFI.COM. Attended a pre-release screening, which was a lot of fun.The movie was far better than I anticipated. Sure, in some ways it is a rip-off of _Alien_, but then _Alien_ was a rip-off of _It! The Terror From Beyond Space_ (and much more explicitly, too).Acting is across-the-board solid, though Radha Mitchell has some trouble covering her Aussie accent (it doesn't affect her performance). The effects are good: in a way I have to admire a ""little"" film that simply processes various scenes in different-colored light -- to suggest the light of different stars -- as a ""special effect."" :^) I won't say anything about David Twohy's direction except to note that I have a very strong feeling he has a desperate crush on actress Radha Mitchell. The camera quite literally caresses her body, and especially her rear end, in a way that someone (not me) could describe as ""near pornographic."" Or maybe it's just my liking of short-haired blondes.That said, there is no nudity in this film. Lots of blood and cussing and nerve wracking suspense, though. You could easily spend 106 minutes in a less entertaining way. _Pitch Black_ has more surprises and unique twists than a half dozen Hollywood films.",Pitch Black

One of the passengers is a multiple murderer, Riddick (Vin Diesel), and his captor, Johns (Cole Hauser).Your first instinct on seeing this scenario is that Riddick is going to escape and there'll be a desperate attempt to recapture him, the other survivors being picked off one by one.  But Riddick and the heat aren't the worst of the crash survivors problems.The film is beautifully shot, the lighting produced by the three suns is fantastic.  The cast, a lot of them first time in a big film are great and the script does them justice.The absolute star, aside from the planets inhabitants, is Diesel.  He has an absolute hold on the camera; it seems to gravitate to him at every opportunity.  He also doesn't let Riddick's basic character go.  Riddick is evil, and right up until the end you never feel he's changed.As a sci-fi movie the effects are another key part.  These enhance the story without being overly intrusive.  The monsters are also well produced and seem alive.The editing is tight and allows the movie to linger when it needs to and zoom out of hand at other moments.  The only slight concern is the shakey camera work.  Those with a sensitive stomach may want to look away.A very good film indeed.  Comparisons with Alien and its sequels will be made, but Pitch Black is a film in its own right and deserves consideration.",Pitch Black
231,niteman,Oops -- WOW! -- Oops.,7,27 February 2000,"Pitch Black opens with a long, slo-mo shot of a spaceship gliding by the camera.  Oops #1: obvious Star Wars rip-off.  It then presents us with a most improbable crash scene, in which the force of the landing blows out the ship's windshield but leaves the pilot remarkably unscathed.  Oops #2.  The crash scene is edited with MTV-on-Speed cuts, which are both impossible to follow and headache-inducing.  Oops #3.  By the time the spaceship actually touched down, I was regretting losing $4 on this movie.Fortunately, things pick up speed in the middle.  The visuals are gorgeous -- our heroes are on a planet with three suns, and the scenes are filmed in gorgeous washed-out blue and gold tones.  The deceptively calm surface of the planet serves as a backdrop for introducing and fleshing out characters, who are all given more depth than your average cheap sci-fi cast.  The tension climaxes with a gorgeous triple eclipse and the awakening of the underground dwellers of the planet, who look like a cross between Ridley Scott's Alien and a hammerhead shark.  As the characters scurried around huddling behind their meager and failing light sources, bickering with each other, the suspense was thick enough that it was hard to breathe.Unfortunately, the last half hour abandons any notion of story arc or plot in favor of killing of characters at random and twisting the plot in improbable directions.  The most interesting character, Vin Diesel's hulking homicidal maniac, is reduced to arm-wrestling the aliens and spouting Batman and Robin quality dialog.  By the last twist and the by-the-numbers ending, I was disappointed in the movie again.Out of the movie's two hours, the middle hour is great and the surrounding hour is average to horrid.  50% is generally an F, but for the great visuals I'll give it a C.",Pitch Black
232,imdb1,"Unrealistic, incomplete movie that fails to be what it tries to be.",6,4 July 2000,"SPOILERThe following contains information about the content of the movie.  From the tag line (fight evil with evil) we can get an idea of what was the idea behind the movie: A terrible dangerous killer, who later turns into a hero because only his ""talents"" can save the survivors of a spaceship crash. The opening of the movie starts with picturing HOW dangerous the killer is in a way that seems to be stolen directly from movies like Con Air. However, then the rest of the movie fails completely in realizing that expectation: the killer turns out not to be dangerous at all and doesn't show any special gifts except being strong and (how convenient) being able to see in the dark. Finally the movie gets very unrealistic, while at first the dark creatures seem to be able to kill a heavily armed group of people in a steel bunker, later it turns out more and more to be possible to walk outside with just a flash light and only seeing a creature once every 10 minutes or so, where are the other billion creatures suddenly? The whole movie gave me the idea of being too little of a good book to get across what the original writer much have intended. Perhaps half of it should have left out so the rest could have been worked out better.",Pitch Black
233,JimmyZappa,Pitch Black - An Enjoyable SCIFI/Action flick,8,14 July 2006,"Pitch Black is a very unusual movie. While action at its core, with Vin Diesel as Riddick (as Bruce Willis was to John McClane, Ah-nold Schwarzenegger was to the Terminator, Sylvester Stallone was to Rambo, and (more notably) as Sigourney Weaver was to Ellen Ripley), this movie somehow take a generic spin on SCIFI and make it incredibly captivating.While I thought the beginning was kind of slow to start and a little ""meh"" considering the writers threw in Muslim stereotypes and other generic spaceship cadets, with Riddick being the only one who stood out as the more interesting one out of the bunch, that all changes 15 minutes into the film. As the movie stretches out and reveals what exactly is going on, the cast becomes more captivating. Cole Hauser (William J. Johns), Keith David (Abu al-Walid), and Rhiana Griffith (Jackie) are the ones I grew to like over the course of the movie.The acting is not particularly strong thanks to the weak performances given by supporting cast members like Radha Mitchell (who's current claim to fame among fans is 'Rose Da Silva' in the 2006 Silent Hill movie) while Vin seems to come out okay and pop out the occasional 'one-liner' joke when he's not trying to be the ""cold-as-steel"" badass.One of the things that I liked were the different hues used to portray the different parts of the world (which is inhibited by three different suns). I imagine some people wouldn't like that and will find it distracting, but I wouldn't agree. I think it gives the movie an interesting ""edge"" and makes it a little more captivating to look at.By the end of the movie, I came to really like it. Despite the fact I didn't care for the sequel, Chronicles, Pitch Black actually made me walk away with satisfaction. While it's not the best SCIFI film i've ever seen, and it didn't have the best story or action either, for what it was and how it performed it...it was all worth the entire view. I recommend a rental, if anything.",Pitch Black

Quite simply, it's one of the best science fiction movies to come along in a while.The first ten minutes of the movie are completely engrossing, as the crisis that leads to the marooning of the transport is played out.  After crash landing on an uncharted world, the survivors try to find a way off the mysterious planet, where it is always daylight....well, almost always.The acting is particularly good, especially the escaped convict Riddick, played by Vin Diesel.  There's no way this movie would have been nearly as good without his efforts.  (The very sexy) Radha Mitchell also does a great job as the captain of the ship.In conclusion, if you like an science fiction, an intruiging storyline, good acting, and an engrossing plot, then see Pitch Black.

The lighting is amazing and beautiful, offering sharp contrasts that operate not only as an effective element of the plot, but also give the movie a unique feel.  While many films limit their lighting to black/white contrasts, Pitch Black employs several different colors, shades and intensities.  Vin Diesel does a great job and brings to life a character that could have very easily been run-of-the-mill. The remainder of the cast, including the gorgeous Claudia Black (Farscape), are lesser-known and very talented.  If you like Science Fiction Pitch Black is a must, but the fact that the film focuses (very effectively) on things other than 'bug-hunting' make it an excellent movie for all.",Pitch Black
238,ParanoidAndroidMarvin,An Excellent use of Sci-Fi as a story telling medium,10,8 April 2002,"While most movies that pit humans against horrendous extra terrestrials end up being cheap imitations of the 'Aliens' series, Pitch Black stands as a fine piece of Sci-Fi, and an excellent movie all around.  Perhaps my favorite aspect of the film is the lighting.  This movie beautifully employs many different colors, shades and intensities of light which set the mood and lend a unique feeling to the film itself, something different than the 'normal' movie lighting we are generally subjected to.  Vin Diesel brings his character to life in an excellent manner, skillfully avoiding the routine portrayal of the hardened criminal.  After all, the film is about Riddick's (Diesel's character) personal journey, so thankfully Vin doesn't drop the ball.  The remainder of the cast (with the exception of the talented and gorgeous Claudia Black) were unknown to me but all turned in marvelous performances, animating the diverse characters with unique quirks and mannerisms.  Pitch Black is a perfect example of making a great film with out the resources of an excessive budget.  The special effects are more than adequate, but at the same time they are by no means the sole focus, as in many high budget 'blockbusters'.  It's a great movie because it uses Science Fiction as a medium to tell an engaging, provoking story, rather then telling a mediocre story to use the flash of Science Fiction.",Pitch Black
239,Kilroy-17,If the screen had been pitch black for 2 hours...,5,18 February 2000,"I would have been much happier than I was after seeing this film.  This is the worst time of the year for movies.  Right after Christmas and before the Oscars.  All the movies being released now are slotted at this time of year for a reason;  the films are weak and would be no competition for the holiday or summer blockbusters, but you'd probably go see something new before shelling out cash to see the re-release of the Oscar nominated pictures.  Pitch Black fits perfectly into this category. 
At this time of year, I'm an easy mark.  It has been almost a month since I saw a movie at the theatre.  That's an eternity! Anything halfway decent would probably get high marks.  Pitch Black is not halfway decent.
The premise is actually interesting, and has some possibilities. Simply put, a band of space travelers are stranded when their ship crashes.  The suggestion can be inferred that the dangerous criminal, Riddick (Vin Diesel) that is being escorted may have caused the crash in an attempt to escape.Once on the planet, the people discover that the place has no life and almost looks deserted.  It's not until one of the people is killed and they get past the obvious suspicion of Riddick do we get down to the meat of plot.  There's something dangerous lurking in the caves below the surface. Things get really serious when it's determined that an eclipse is about to take place and that the creatures will have free reign once darkness envelops the surface.I won't take you much further.  Getting to this point took almost an hour, and from this point on things go down hill.  The film then takes on the standard serial killer formula.  The heroes try to fend off the killer but he's getting them one by one.No one gives any kind of notable performance, and the story quickly loses any plausibility that it may have had.  Keith David has a part in the film, and the most entertaining for us was saying ""Franks and Beans"" at inappropriate moments in reference to his role in Something About Mary.All I can say is thank goodness this was free.  I can watch just about anything for free.  Don't blow your hard earned money at the theatre on this one.  It stinks...",Pitch Black
240,ColemanDerrick,Vin Diesel Delivers!!!!!!,8,15 July 2001,"Pitch Black, as an action movie, is one of the best.  As a part of the scifi/horror subgenre, it is tops.  Coming in twenty years after Alien, Pitch Black liberally borrows from that classic, and offers viewers a solid motion picture.  If you are a fan of either action movies or scifi/horror flicks, you will be entertained. Personally, I believe this movie suffered from poor marketing.  Had the studio marketed the film as a Vin Diesel vehicle, and steered away from any blatant allusions to Alien, the movie would have provided a better box office take, and it would have received the attention it deserves. Ironically, like Alien, it will be legendary for its popularity on cable networks and video.  Hopefully, with the popularity received from The Fast and The Furious, viewers will want to see another film starring Vin Diesel, and this is the one to see!!!!!",Pitch Black
241,sibelian,Pretty Good!,8,20 September 2006,"Once you add up all the happy (or unhappy) coincidences needed to make the plot of this film work it falls over. But it pelts you along at such a pace that you don't notice! Excellent pop-corn scif-fi, intelligent enough to keep sciffy fans happy and enough action to please everyone else. Different look, too! And Vin Diesel is very good in this. I haven't seen anything else with him in it that I like, but here he is very much in his element.The characters are really perfectly written and portrayed, the special effects are in fact fairly cheaply done but but also very creatively, and the slightly moth-eaten-ness of everything actually contributes to ambiance of the movie.There's been talk about the physical laws being violated in the solar system this movie is portrayed in - there aren't any violations that I can see. The story is set on the moon of a ringed gas giant which is orbiting a star which is in a binary system with... another, smaller binary system. Binary systems are commonplace, as are gas giants with moons and suns with interesting orbital resonances leading to grand alignments and complex eclipses. Just because the orrery takes the planet as the fixed frame of reference (which is probably what you'd have to do anyway to represent such a system) doesn't mean any laws are being violated. In fact, the cosmology in this movie is really GOOD... OK... Enough cosmology...The monsters are great! Convincing, scary dumb beasties a bit like sharks and a bit like bats and a bit like snakes and a bit like pterodactyls...The plot collapses under scrutiny, but not through badly thought-through character motivation or twists that make no sense, nobody does anything *unbelievably* stupid, by which I mean everyone's behaviour is logically explicable and can be related to. It's the weight of all the coincidences that causes the collapse, but that's okay, the movie's exciting enough that you don't care.It probably doesn't carry repeat viewing, I'd guess...8 stars! 2 for Vin diesel, 1 for the sheer coolness of a story set on an interesting and physically possible solar system, 1 for the rest of the characters, all of whom are excellent, 1 for the fast and furious plot, 1 for the beasties and a whopping 2 for that lovely shot of the the suns going down behind the gas giant in the middle of the movie...WOW... that was pretty...",Pitch Black

As for aliens well it was little more than an action film, not that that is bad but the horror aspect was completely lost. Bringing me back to Pitch Black and what makes it such a good film. The one thing that scares us all when outside at night and we hear a sound. We strain our eyes to see what unknown evil lies waiting in the darkness. That is what makes this film special and keeps your attention. In alien you knew it was somewhere in the shadows and you waited for it to pop out so someone could shoot it. Pitch Black's characters only have the defense of what little light they come up with and you know at the edge of that light the creatures lurking surrounding, watching, waiting at fuzzy area where your straining eyes can barely see the outline of their movement.",Pitch Black
243,omega1,What a ride!,9,20 September 2000,"Though the story sounds pretty standard (Alien hunter chasing humans/Fight fire with fire) this movie was a ride through and through, and a darn good one. The use of lighting in this movie was done amazingly well and really helps to accent some of the more tense scenes of the movie.
People who enjoy movies like Aliens and Predator should seriously check this one out. Riddick kicks butt!! 9/10 on My Personal Scale.",Pitch Black
244,relious,A group of space Marines try to survive on a sun-scorched planet,9,27 July 2007,"Not what you would call my favorite but is very good for the time being. While Pitch Black falls a little bit in the horror section, it is very entertaining. I really liked the action sequences but it seemed that Riddick was held prisoner for almost the whole movie. I really like Vin Diesel in other movies like The Pacifier and of coarse xxxi. This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat and take you on the thrill ride of your life. I really liked this movie because it's scary, but not too scary and definitely has great taste in rock solid action. I thought Vin Diesel was really funny in The Pacifier and liked how he took care of the kids while he was on a mission.",Pitch Black
245,basemnt-dwellr,Great Movie,10,16 January 2003,"The movie starts with a bang, the crash of the space ship. The scene is about 7 minutes long and it is totally amazing. You see the crew wake up confused and not knowing what had happened. Then, when they open the window-cover, instead of the anticipated dark space they find out that they are surrounded by flames and that they are on a crash course with some planet. When they finally land, there is confusion everywhere. It is kind of realistic (as far as you can say that about a science fiction movie).The planet is scorched by three suns. The cinematography is quite impressive, the colors are totally bleached so you get a good impression on the intensity of the light. Also the points of view of the aliens and of Riddick are really wonderful.I find it fascinating how the group of survivors is composed. You don't very often see Moslems or Arabs in movies who are not portrayed as evil but just as normal people. Also I like the changes the characters undergo during the movie. Or maybe they don't change but only our perception of the characters changes. So at first you think ""well, these are the good guys, and that is the bad guy"", whereas after a while you start to reconsider your opinion.
The main character is of course Riddick, played very convincingly by Vin Diesel. In the beginning of the movie he is really scary, for example when he and Fry (Radha Mitchell) are together in the emergency ship they find on the planet, talking about Johns. They are alone in the ship, no Johns can come to help her, because they are undergoing some hull integrity check and the door has to remain closed during that test, and you find yourself thinking ""what will he do to her?"" You never get to know what Riddick is thinking because you can't read his eyes due to the ""shine job"" and due to the goggles he is wearing. So you don't know why he is helping the other survivors to get to the emergency ship. Is it out of pure necessity to get there somehow, or is it because he actually cares for the others? I like it that in the end of the movie he is still willing to let the others die on the planet just to save his own life. Only Fry's willingness to risk her life to save the others impresses him enough to go back with her. But does that really mean that he has changed?I also like the relationship between Johns (Cole Hauser) and Fry as to who is the leader of the group. In the beginning, it is Johns who they go to, but during the course of the film, Fry is more and more accepted as the leader. Of course that leads to some nice conflicts between the two characters.I like the ending of the movie.The acting is really good, better than you would expect of such a movie. Everybody plays his/her character totally believable and although some of the characters remain bland and are only in the film to get eaten by the aliens, the characters are well developed.The aliens are quite impressive too. You never see much of them which makes them all the more scarier. Unfortunately they are not as scary as for example the one in ""Alien"" but as the film is more a character based movie than a horror film, it doesn't really matter that much.There are of course some big holes in the plot, for example that they happen to crash land on the planet exactly when the next eclipse is due, that such a planetary system as depicted in the model cannot exist, and that they land within walking distance to an abandoned geologist's camp, but hell, nobody is perfect. You just have to ignore those things, and actually, they really don't matter. Great movie.",Pitch Black
246,spazierganger,"Entertaining, intelligent sci-fi",8,12 November 2000,"Pitch Black is one of the most entertaining science fiction movies I've ever seen. The script was surprisingly intelligent. It would have been easy to make a film about monsters on an unknown planet be extremely stupid, but the screenwriters managed to avoid this. Every character is well written, there are no ""cookie-cutter"" characters. They are all 3 dimensional people with good and bad traits.While all of the acting in the movie is good, no one was as good as Vin Diesel as Riddick, the escaped convict that the stranded passengers turn to for help. Even when he's not speaking, he commands attention. Diesel makes it clear that Riddick is only out to help himself. Only near the end do we see some signs of caring for others in him, but even these are minimal. Diesel never lets us forget that Riddick is a murderer.Technically, the film is also very good. The lighting was interesting before the darkness comes. There are 3 suns around the planet, so the lighting is a little brighter than normal. And at one point the screen has a kind of blue tint to it, apparently because the bluish sun was higher in the sky. It's a nice effect. Also the editing is very quick and frantic, especially during action sequences. The crash scene at the beginning is especially tense due to the editing.Does Pitch Black teach us any great lessons about life? No. But who cares? It's an intelligently written, well directed, and well acted movie. It's by no means the best movie ever, but it's definitely an entertaining and thrilling ride.Rating: 9/10",Pitch Black
247,Oreolove,One of the best Sci-Fi pictures in years.,9,17 May 2002,"Although the concept seems slightly stupid, the movie pulls you in right from the gripping beginning. It is one of the few movies where you root for the bad guy, (that isn't all bad, of course.) Vin Diesel is wonderful and intimidating as Ridick, an escaped convict that can see in the dark because of implants in his eyes. When a ship carrying him back to prison crashes on a planet filled with creatures that only come out when it's dark, he is the only hope for the rest of the crew if they want to get to safety. The movie grips you from the beginning to the end. Acting is superb and the story actually has many surprising twists that keep you in suspense. The fact that you hardly get a glimpse of the aliens makes it even more scary to watch. This is a must-see movie!",Pitch Black

The acting was really good especially on the parts of the kid, Riddick, the pilot and Johns.

250,Lobo69,"Hollywood - Get over Aliens, Please!",2,15 March 2000,"Pitch Black - Hollywood, Get Over Aliens Already!Aliens was a great movie, probably the best sequel ever and on its own one of the best action movies ever made. Having said that, I think its time that Hollywood moves on and gets over it. There will never be another movie in this genre that is as good as Aliens, so any derivative of Aliens is a pointless waste of time and money. I'd rather watch a good movie again than see a bad remake of that movie, so the next time a film like Pitch Black comes along I'll simply pull out my dusty copy of Aliens and save myself the 8 bucks.This is more a criticism of Hollywood than anything else, I'm sure it must be hard to come up with a premise that involves aliens on a distant planet that does not in some way pay homage to a movie like Aliens or Alien. For me it was hard not to draw parallels between this film and the movies I grew up with, and it was impossible for me to see it as an original plot concept. Do the aliens in these shows ever do anything besides eat people? I mean, is that their sole function in life? Lets think of something more interesting for the monsters to do in the next Aliens rip-off. Maybe the aliens aren't hungry at all, or if they are hungry, maybe all they eat is people's shoes and socks. Now we're getting somewhere.The premise.Humans in the future without enough navigational sense to stay clear of solar systems when traveling at near light speed, crash on an unnamed, unknown planet in a strange solar system that for some bizarre reason has 3 suns. I don't know why the producers went with 3 suns as opposed to 2 suns, especially considering the fact that most solar systems are in fact binary, except to maybe make the little ones in the audience say ""Aw cool, 3 suns!"" The survivors, who are not very bright to begin with, are then presented with the extra little problem of having an escaped murder loose amongst them. His name is Riddick and for the first ½ hour of the movie they look around for him instead of looking for food or water! Lets get our priorities straight shall we? First thing you do after crashing on an alien planet is look for food we all know that, then you see how much Diet Dr. Pepper survived the crash of course, then you look for the escaped murders.. Sheesh. Where did these people learn to forage?Let the clichés begin!Of course the planet is totally dead with no water and no apparent life or ecosystem, and yet low and behold there is a breathable atmosphere! What a shock. Also with 3 suns it's only just a little hotter than Earth in summer, how convenient! I'd think that 3 suns might make for some interesting plot twists about the crew fighting over the shady spot, but sadly nothing that interesting occurs in the film. At one point the survivors come across a vast field of bones, presumably from the herds of animals that once roamed this planet with 3 suns and no water. Exactly how vast herds of giant herbivores would evolve in a desert is not as interesting to the crew as how the skeletons are all lined up, as if they died at the same time standing up. Foreshadowing, what a concept! The high school English teacher of the movies writer must be so proud. Later on we find out that there is a whole species of underground carnivores who are just waiting for the lights to go out so they can feast upon the multitude of juicy humans who crash land on their nasty little planet every so often. Oh yes, I can see how 6 or 7 dehydrated humans every few years could sustain a huge group of meat eating, shade loving monsters for years to come. Humans would have to be pretty filling for that to be true, especially when you consider that these voracious creatures have seemingly eaten all other life on the planet. Wouldn't they have eaten themselves into extinction? Apparently not. The monsters are also afraid of light, or are harmed by it or something, the bottom line is they just don't like light ok? So our humans are safe as long as there is a lot of light, and in a 3-sun solar system that doesn't seem to be a problem.But luckily for us the crash happens just hours before a once-every-22-year eclipse that the beasties have been waiting for so they can get out of their shady holes and eat all the starving, dehydrated, hapless, defenseless humans that have crash landed on their dusty little planet. This eclipse does not cover just one sun, or even 2 suns. Astoundingly it covers a remarkable 3 suns, go figure. That coincidence is not as great as them crashing only a few yards from an abandoned mining camp, where they learn all about the impending eclipse from a home made model of the solar system made by the previous owners of the camp. The miners were also in the process of leaving the camp in a spaceship they had, but didn't quite make it. These people had a spaceship, A Spaceship! And they had to build a little mock solar system out of foam balls and coat hangers? Isn't this supposed to be the future, couldn't they have figured out the alignment of the planets from the computer on their.. Spaceship??? Did I mention they had a spaceship? If I had a spaceship I don't think I'd go be a miner on some weird planet with no water and lots of monsters. I'd keep looking till I found a planet with lots of water, and no monsters. Then I'd relax and get a job making web pages, or their future equivalent. This is supposed to be the future right?So the crew is then eaten one by one in various gory but uninteresting ways, and since the characters are so profoundly un-heroic and uninteresting, we really don't care. In fact we want them to get eaten so we can see the creatures do their thing some more. At one point you start rooting for the monsters so you can hear the gory body breaking noises.Here comes another criticism of Hollywood, can't they think of something more frightening than being eaten? People just aren't as scared of being chewed on as they were back in the 70's when Jaws came out, and they have been getting gradually less and less terrified of it for the last 30 years. I personally am not very worried about being swallowed whole or ripped apart by a huge beast in my every day life. Maybe if I was a Lion tamer or a Crocodile wrangler this movie might scare the pants off me! But as I am a graphic designer by trade I'd be much more scared of a movie about computers that come to life and start making artistic designs on their own, putting me out of work. Well its more likely than anything that happens in Pitch Black.How could this movie have been made better?I'm glad you asked. Well for starter lets stop making the bad guy in movies look like a wrestler. I know wrestling is very popular right now and all that, but in reality no one looks like these people. And people who look like the bad guy in this movie are generally speaking not very tough, they just work out with weights a lot. The toughest people I have even seen are bikers, and if you have seen what they look like you know they don't spend too much time in a gym. Or conversely you could make him look like a totally normal person, that way when he does turn out to be an exceptionally talented murder the audience would be forced to say, ""Gee, he looks like a totally normal person. How could he be such an exceptionally talented murderer?""Too much foreshadowing!They spent so much time at the beginning of the movie trying to make the planet look scary that by the time the scary stuff happened, it wasn't a surprise. It would have been better if there were hints of something bad that had happened in the past, but making it obvious that something bad had occurred made it very anti-climactic when it all came down. I would have liked to see the ecosystem in some state of recovery from the last time there was an eclipse. That would have given the nasty critters something else to do besides harass our hapless crash victims, they could have chased around the other animals and wreaked a little havoc on the environment rather than just play chase the humans. That might have made the creatures seem more real rather than just 2 dimensional hapless human harassers. Also, I think the creatures should have been in hibernation waiting for the next eclipse, rather than skittering around in the tunnels. How would they findenough food between eclipses with all the animals that did live on the surface being dead and all?Live humans are more interesting than dead ones.For example the people from the mining camp would have been more interesting if they were alive, like walking around and doing stuff. Maybe they would have seen the crash and gone out to rescue any survivors, now that sounds like something live humans would do. This would have been better than the cliché of ""we crash landed only feet or inches from a settlement, lucky us.""We crash-landed, we have no way home.sob, sob.This is such a tired premise, especially when 30 minutes into the film they do find a way to get home and it becomes a plot device. (i.e. we have to drag the power cells from the crashed ship to the new ship, etc. etc. etc.) Come on! Make it a scientific mission that's there to study the eclipse or something, that would have defused the cliché of ""Hey cool, we arrived here just in the nick of time to witness a once in a thousand year cosmic event"".How are the Special Effects?I have no idea, I couldn't see them. Basically the plot revolves around the fact that these nasty critters only come out when its pitch black... need I say more? Literally there is not one shot of a full monster in the light, so all you ever see is them in silhouette.In closing I'll just say this, its not a scary or entertaining movie but if you can get into a matinee for $3.00 I say go for it. You'll have fun at least trying to comprehend how anyone as stupid as the people in this movie ever learned how to fly spaceships in the first place.

251,StevePaget,Last one out turn off the lights,5,20 November 2004,"I watched this because I wanted to watch The Chronicles Of Riddick and I thought it best to understand some back story. I wish I hadn't bothered.The odd thing is, a lot of people really like this movie. They think it's a low-key, suspense-filled sci-fi classic, in the mold of Alien. They're idiots, mind you. This is just dull.The idea is that a ship crash lands on a strange planet, killing most of the crew. Among the survivors is Riddick, a murderer being transported back to justice. The planet in question has a strange arrangement of suns, such that there is perpetual daylight. The place is a constant desert. The survivors discover a ruined settlement where the previous inhabitants were all eaten. It seems there are aliens that live in the dark beneath the surface of the planet. And that's when the eclipse comes...What follows is a story where the small band of scared humans tries to harness what little light they can while trying to repair a small spaceship to get them off the planet. And what about Riddick? Is he friend or foe? Well, I'll tell you what he's not: a very good actor. Vin Diesel grunts and rasps his way through this film with little or no effort at all. Sometimes he does a sort of evil chuckle which is really quite rubbish. And, for a film called Pitch Black, there is really quite a lot of light about, despite the supposed eclipse. While frantic extras are trying to huddle around a small flame from a Jack Daniels bottle, there's loads of light illuminating the hills behind them. Where's all that coming from?Unscary CGI aliens, identikit cannon-fodder humans, poor one-liners. This is the sort of action movie I thought we had left behind. All of which makes the prospect of the Chronicles of Riddick even less tempting.5 out of 10",Pitch Black

If not, read why you shouldn't waste your time on this.This is a slipshod action/adventure science fiction movie that does neither science nor fiction right. Get this straight through you before you sit down to watch it: This movie was made for one and one reason only, which is to massage the larger-than-life survivalist persona of Richard B. Riddick (the comic character) and the bossy persona of Vin Diesel (the actor). Everything else is in deference. Fan worshippers of Riddick and Diesel will doubtlessly be enthused--even fascinated--as other things probably won't matter to them, while the rest will be disappointed.Plot: A spaceship carrying the prisoner Riddick crash-lands on an unknown planet where survivors face-off with herds of alien creatures who hunt only at night. Guess what, a solar eclipse is just around the corner.Needless to say, Riddick does the lion's work of fighting the aliens and dispatches them to their deaths with corny disdain and one-liners while others end up being meal. Invincibility is always forced upon the lead role whenever it becomes larger than the whole movie.Visual effects aren't much with first half significantly better than the second. Alien design is nothing to moon over either. For most part, the feeling that I was staring at a cardboard set and not an exoplanet hung heavy on my mind. Poor job by camera department.Most characters are boring and have nothing useful to contribute to the story. Dialog is average with few one-liner comebacks allocated to Riddick.Movie's plot is nothing fresh; entire Alien franchise was built upon it. Problem is it has too many holes. Rules are set in the beginning for planet's environment and alien creatures but are subsequently flouted with impunity. Writing is banal and barren.Worst part of the movie is its action sequences which suffer from shaky camera and too many cut scenes, making it impossible to make sense of anything on screen until the flurry of movements stops. This is a deceptive tactic that many filmmakers use to conceal their lack of skills and imagination. When you don't know how to choreograph a scene, bury the action with fast moving visuals.

But the characters were drawn so realistically (as in realistically flawed and annoying and too stupid to live), that I was rooting for the native fauna almost immediately.  For my taste, Riddick the Convict was the only likeable character.  Minor complaints about the technical discrepancies: will we still be wearing eye spectacles (like the milquetoast antique dealer) or using heavy iron chains to hold doors closed and keep convicts hobbled in an age of space travel, space mining and space colonization?

I am normally not very complementary about most of the films I watch and had heard mixed revues of the film but I must say that I thought that it was an extremely enjoyable film to watch.  The plot is definitely a no brainer, with most of the tension being character driven.  All the actors in the film are excellent, especially  Vin Diesel playing the convict Riddick, who has to be the best anti-hero since Snake Pliskin in Escape from New York. 
The films plot reminds me of two films, Aliens and Deep Blue see, almost as good as the former and far better than the latter.  Visually the film has some amazing moments and David Twohy can be extremely proud of what he has put together.  Special praise has to go to the David Eggby and also lighting department, for the excellent cinematography and lighting.  The editing is good, but their are no really scary moments which would make someone jump out of their seats.  The computer stuff is done extremely well and is never aloud to overwhelm the film or over shadow the actors.  The fight sequences are well put together and extremely exciting, especially when Riddick goes one on one, with one of the creatures, maybe the highlight of the movie. Praise, also has to go to Graeme Revell for putting an amazing score to the film, which I now cannot get out of my head.Overall, this is the movie that Alien 3 and 4 should have been, its exciting, thrilling and also stunning to watch.  Pitch Black also shows what can be done with a limited budget, take notice Hollywood.  Definitely a film to watch.  The DVD also has a couple of extremely good commentaries by the cast and crew, which are very useful to all the film students out there.",Pitch Black

I could only watch about half the movie - nothing is any fun when every strand of a film is nothing but one overworked cliché priming the next overworked cliché.it was often nonsensical as well. a body is savaged to the point the area he disappeared was awash in blood. yet the 'villain', clean as a whistle moments after, is still ridiculously and repeatedly accused of knifing the victim to death, ostensibly only because the movie's lameness required it.where I gave up is their mad dash to do something before the solar eclipse occurs. you see, bad things happen when it gets dark. so our band heads to another site (for some reason) to madly collect all their gear (for some reason), and get back to where they started (for some reason), before the eclipse occurs. why? I have no idea. I've never been in an eclipse but do know they last for minutes then viola! sun and light are back to normal. so my best guess why someone didn't just say ""hey, we'll lockdown for a few minutes and *then* at a leisurely pace go get our gear"" is because that would only use up 10 seconds of film.cliché-ridden, mindlessly contrived, a lead for whom saying he's one-dimensional is too kind; this is a 4, maybe a stretch as a 5. the current 7? not even close.",Pitch Black
267,jimmyolsenblues,Good Movie Bad Premise,7,3 June 2004,"Okay let me get this straight.  Desert Island, 3 suns , sunshine straight for 27 years, then an eclispe causes violent evil raptors to eat everything in site   What do the raptors do for 27years sleep like a sticatta bug? I mean come on. Make the premise better. Vin Diesel is excellent.  Great Acting.  Not crazy about all the references to Islam, but I accept it.  Action ok.  Could have been better plot. But Vin Disel stole the movie, great character.  Actual sense of loss felt for Diesel's realization that someone else would sacrifice themself for him, thereby creating a sense of valor or soul in him.  Good move.  Worth a rental in the genre of Starship Troopers.",Pitch Black
268,north-julie,great little horror movie,8,22 April 2006,"Pitch Black opens with the basic shot of a transport vessel moving lazily through space. Almost obscured is a huge comet blazing a trail right in front of the ship. Three minutes later the comet has ripped through the ship, killed the Captain and set the ship on a direct course towards the surface of a handily placed planet.Pilot Fry is thrown into the fray, and she has a choice between jettisoning the half of the ship containing the passengers to save her skin or trying to get the whole ship down in one piece which is impossible. She ignores the safety of the crew and trys to jettison the crew quarters, only to find that there is a malfunction and she is unable to do so. She manages to crash the ship, yet around fifteen of the passengers survive. One of those passengers is bounty hunter Johns. Another is his captured prey, Riddick.....Riddick escapes, and Johns is forced to search the surface of the planet looking for him. It turns out that there are three suns for this particular planet, which isn't the most helpful thing for Riddick because while in prison he had his eyes 'tinted' to allow him to see in the dark. This is why he wears a pair of designer goggles that keep him safe from the sunlight. Johns captures Riddick and ties him up with some metal cables, taking his goggles away to keep him subdued.With the ship damaged, the crew, led by Fry, finds an outpost with a small shuttle type ship. They need to transfer the fuel cells from their transport ship to this little shuttle in order to escape. However, while searching the outpost they discover that they are not the only living creatures on this planet and that there are some winged bat things that only come out at night. With three suns you'd be thinking that night would be impossible on this planet right? Wrong.Unluckily for the survivors there is an eclipse of one of the suns. Its unclear why the other two suns suddenly disappear but hey, this is Hollywood. Anything can happen.So the crew enlist riddick to help them survive the ensuing darkness. He helps them take the fuel cells and fights off the marauding bat things while sparring with Johns at the same time.Pitch Black is a low budget movie that looks far more expensive than it really is. The effects for the crash are superb, and the bat things are brilliantly realised. As fry, radha Mitchell exudes just enough power and vulnerability to show that she is in charge of the situation yet aggrieved about what she tried to do during the crash. As Johns, B-movie regular Cole Hauser is eerie enough and strong enough to play the role easily enough, although his trusty shotgun looks a tad on the flimsy side.The movie though really belongs to Vin Diesel. His riddick is a brilliant creation, all muscular front and steely insides. He doesn't care about anyone or anything, although he does seem to develop a lust for Fry that grows throughout the film until she is literally taken from his arms at the end of the film. He is easily able to carry the fight scenes and while not a talented thespian he does give his few lines (he doesn't speak at all in the first twenty minutes) with enough zest to carry him through.David Twohy injects the limited scope of the film with skill and grandeur, and the action has a pumped up and superior feel to it. Short and snappy action scenes fill the latter half of the movie, and the lack of really choppy editing keeps things moving at just the right pace. The performances are adequate, and while the film is never really scary or chilling, it is definitely entertaining enough to fill an evenings worth of viewing.This is proof that sometimes a low budget can really aid a film, as Twohy doesn't just throw a huge explosion or gun fight into the mix just for the sake of having one. He keeps things tight and focused, and the film is all the better for it.A brilliant little movie.",Pitch Black
269,jacobtinsdale,A Good Monster Movie,8,16 April 2015,"This movie is one of my favourites, and don't understand why it received mixed reviews. Vin Diesel portrays the character of Riddick quite well, and the monsters and graphics were quite good for its time (And likely still good today)But there are two things i need to complain about:1. The fight scence between Riddick and Johns near the end is *way* too short, and Johns was defeated almost instantly (Although when the monster bites down on Johns's head is awesome)2. I was unsure about the story at first.Okay, okay, I know the plot better *now*, but I was somehow unsure what was happening during the first half of the film until my friend explained it to me.And as I said in my Summary, *A Good Monster Movie*!!!",Pitch Black
270,Jeff G,"""Aliens"", but with an indy flavor",8,20 February 2000,"Very cleverly created, ""Pitch Black"" combines the general premise of ""Aliens"" (shipwrecked on a hostile planet at the mercy of hordes of ravenous monsters) but with the willingness to break the rules and stereotypes found in mainstream movies.The film is artfully done, though sometimes the camera work can get muddled. (I suspect that this is partly deliberate to obscure flaws in the special effects or fight choreography.)  The coloration is brilliant (often literally), and the score adequate.  The sound effects leave something to be desired.  (Every time I heard the creatures, I felt that the heroes were due to have a school of whales decent upon them ...)Still, this had the raw, quirky edge to it found in some of the lesser-known works of Australia and New Zealand, like ""The Quiet Earth"" and ""The Last Wave"".  It's quite scary for most of the film, and while it's not flawless, it deserves quite a lot of credit for what it's accomplished.Highly recommended!",Pitch Black
271,mike-1230,"Not great, but not a bad rental.",7,25 July 2004,"There was nothing particularly brilliant nor bad about this movie.  I borrowed the DVD from a friend and watched it late one Saturday night and found it entertaining.  There was a cool visual feel that sucked me in right away and the script and direction actually did a very good job at creating an eerie alien world.  It reminded me of the world that Riddley Scott created in the first Aliens.  You don't know very much about the world, but you know enough to let your imagination fill in the oh so creepy AND curious details.  Its rare these days that a movie actually assumes you have some imagination and even rarer that it tries to engage it!  Case in point, some characters don't speak English. Instead of giving them bad accents or putting up subtitles, the director intentionally keeps you in the dark.  You don't really need to know that `ensign green #1' says to `ensign green #2', `I am scared.'  `Yes, me too.' Instead, the director relies on the actors to *emote* that, and again, your mind fills in the details-far more effective.
I am not really a big fan of Diesel, and knew nothing about the supporting cast.  But they could actually act!  Even the minor characters played their `ensign green' roles well.  You know that all the characters will not make it and many will die in a morally `appropriate manner' and I get annoyed at films that try to kid us about this little fact.  The film generally does a good job not trying to play this silly game.  Overall the film is more horror than Sci-Fi but it did a good job of creating tension and is worth a rental.  If you can, watch it on DVD as there is a good visual texture to it that.",Pitch Black
272,wiredrabbit,"A lot of potential, but not well done",5,16 June 2004,"When I heard they were making a sequel to this I had a hard time believing it.  When I heard Vin Diesel was returning, I really couldn't believe it. When I heard he was producing the film and saw the work he was putting into the sequel, I got it.Riddick is a great character and a great concept.  The production and direction of this film, however, were rock bottom. I really didn't like the writing either, but what can you do when the writers suck (It came from outer space II, The fly II) and the screenwriter is directing (GI Jane, Terminal Velocity, Warlock).  Combine that with a lousy producer (he did Terminal Velocity and last samurai - need i say more?) and you have a recipe for suck-xess.It has some high points.  It was OK.  Fun to watch, certainly worth renting if you have nothing better to do.  If you like the kind of film it is, and can get over poor production value, then you might really like it. 
It's a B movie that tries too hard to be a big blockbuster. It comes across cheap when it could have relied more on thought and acting. It had good acting.  Vin Diesel puts in quite a performance and it is the movie that launched his career and the rest of the cast does quite well.",Pitch Black

275,Scotthannaford1,Excellent camera work and characterisation,9,29 August 2006,"Now I have to start by admitting that I think Vin Diesel is a decent actor. Yes, so he always looks like someone who might pop in to Miami Ink to get a new tattoo of an eagle on his back and then ride off on a Harley.... but he is very watchable. He is no Larry Olivier or John Hurt... hell, he's not even as good as Tom Hanks or John Goodman... but he does have a charisma and personality that fills the screen. He was great in boiler room, and with Riddick, he is good yet again.I wasn't expecting a lot from the film - it has had some mixed reviews, and comparisons to the Alien series is understandable (even if the types of films are very different), but I have to say that the cinematography is on a par with (well recently) Three Kings and the special effects are pretty much flawless.The story is... well... to be honest, secondary to the characterisation and the look of the film, but then, isn't that true of so many sci-fi efforts? Most of the characters are well developed, if a little ""typical"" at times, and it made a change for some of the peripheral characters to actually survive.Oh, and yes, the whole thing about a species that can only come out to hunt every however many years.... and the fact that no other species on the surface would have survived without sunlight... let's ignore it!

A group of very... unusual characters get together and crash on a planet infested of flying, nocturnal, man-eating creatures and, of course, terror ensues. Yes, yes, the plot has been done, but still an entertaining flick. What really saves this film is the group of un-likeable characters. Basically, there is not really a character you find yourself cheering for... and I find that a big plus. You have a criminal with cats' eyes, a pilot who'd realistically save her own ass before thinking about anyone else, a cop-like character who's almost as dangerous as the criminal he's captured, and several other disposable characters that predictably turn on one another as soon as the suns go down. The special effects are good, but I preferred how they didn't focus to much on them. What gives this film the bit of creepiness it has is what you don't see hiding in the shadows. To think of it now, you don't actually SEE the monsters all that much. What you have is a ""Blair Witch"" element of ""sometimes it's what you don't see that scares you."" In any case, not a bad movie, but I can't help but feeling like I was watching a direct-to-video flick that got mixed up with a film with better production-values.",Pitch Black

Overall, the movie is an intense experience -- from the opening crash scene to the final surprise.  Listed below are a few of my favorite scenes:1)  Riddick ""dancing"" directly in the face of the creature to keep inside its ""blindspot."" Very well done, as was the whole special effect of the creatures' sonar ""vision.""2) The washed-out colors during the daylight sequence -- definitely gave you the feeling of being in a glaring, sun-baked desert.3) Of course, the great eclipse scene.4)  Riddick killing one of the creatures, and his retort ""Didn't know who he was F**KING with!""5) And of course, the white-knuckled crash-landing scene -- I was digging my heels into the floor trying to get that ship to stop!The only two nitpicks I have are (1) the ecology of the creature -- there are far too many of those large predators to be sustainable in that barren area, and (2) the double sets of rings around the large planet -- should not have been parallel, should have been concentric. I'm sure someone out there will be happy to go on about all the ""obvious"" scientific shortcomings of the film, but these were the only two that occurred to me while watching it.I saw it at a bargain matinee, with DTS on a decent-sized screen, and I think that makes a big difference.

284,aro-2,"Good, effective Sci-Fi/Thriller...",7,19 February 2000,"We begin with the standard view of a ship drifting through space. A voice-over gives us a little background as we're slowly taken into the ship. Comet fragments begin piercing the hull(and one or two people) and the cryogenicly frozen crew is woken. So begins the ship's decent. During that decent the pilot(Mitchell) attempts to jettison the passenger section in order to land safely, but a malfunction prevents her from doing so. Nevertheless, they manage to make a rather ugly emergency landing(played out with awesome visual effects). The Captain is one of the unfortunate souls who dies in the crash. Now that everything's calming down, the passengers begin to assess their situation(not at all promising). Given that the planet has three suns(it's a giant desert, basically), some of them set out looking for water and stumble upon an abandoned mining outpost. A survey turns up no signs of life, just a lot of solar powered machinery and another(functioning) ship. Obviously they have a way off the planet. Kind of odd, though. Why would someone prep an evac ship and then abandon it?The setup is probably the greatest asset of ""Pitch Black"". A standard Sci-Fi plot, heightened by the pacing of Twohy and a few genuine people mixed in with the fodder, is all it takes to create a good, if unexceptional, Thriller.As I mentioned, the setup is superb, building tension by developing the current and forthcoming situations. For instance, the clues to the miners' disappearing: the final update in the research logs occurring 22yrs ago; the mobile that shows the alignment of the planets to be a 22yr cycle; the preped ship; the numerous animal carcasses scattered about. They all lead one to the conclusion that the miners didn't simply disappear, and that whatever happened 22yrs ago is about to happen again.The films only major fallback is the hyper-active camera movement of Twohy. I don't know about you, but I got tired of it during the crash, but that's not to say he doesn't do a good job of putting the film together. On the contrary, he paces everything perfectly. He does a wonderful job with the latter half, where all the action is shrouded in darkness. The problem is, he doesn't change his tactics much in the light. Though there are some impressive visuals(kudos to Eggby for the beautiful coloring) Twohy never seems to take full advantage of his landscape. This is just a difference of artistic opinion, though. The only real complaint I have is the sometimes shaky camera work. It's become a trend of the Action genre in recent years and I don't care for it. Used sparingly, it can work, but constant use(like the crash) looks haphazard.The final examination is of the actors and their characters. To be honest, I don't expect much from this genre in terms of acting, but every once in a while I'm pleasantly surprise. This is one of those times. The majority of the cast is expendable, so their characters aren't given any attention. On the other hand, there's the three leads, Mitchell, Diesel, and Hauser. Mitchell was willing to kill the passengers at the beginning of the film and she's faced with a similar choice later. Diesel plays a murderer who wants to get out alive as much as everyone else. It's not the typical ""bad guy turned good guy"" scenario we've seen countless times before. Instead, we have man who's struggling with the idea of leaving the rest of them to die, or risking his own life and it's not as predictable as you'd think. Last, we have Hauser, a drug addicted bounty hunter who's caught Diesel after chasing him for years. Their history will come into play, as well.All together, ""Pitch Black"" is worth at least a matinee viewing. If nothing else you're going to enjoy it. Good Sci-Fi films are rare these days and it'd be a shame to miss this one.",Pitch Black
285,636,A very unsatisfactory film,5,23 February 2000,I have always been afraid of the dark and have always been fascinated by monsters. That is why I went to see this film. I just found the film poorly executed. The washed out colors was particularly annoying to me. The absolute stupidity of some of the characters was beyond belief.The alien like monsters that could fly were acceptably competent as sinister adversaries but the story was extremely plodding and there were not enough scary scenes. The cinematography was not very well done. There was grade B movie dialogue executed poorly and with an accent of some sort. The special effect that you saw when the creatures were viewing the victims was tiresome and cheesy. Before people knew what an eclipse was here on earth they thought the end of the world as they knew it had happened. In this film even though most of the characters died at the hands of the malevolent creatures I still felt it was boring in comparison with other films of this genre. I can say that I found this a very unsatisfactory film on many levels but most of all was that it was not that scary. The only really powerful force in the movie was the character played by Vin Diesel. I believe he will be a force in future movies.,Pitch Black

Whilst some of the direction and plot had originality to it, and the characters were mostly watchable (Vin Diesel notably), I was disappointed that the story which starts out so promisingly in terms of its sense of danger and eerieeness, decays so easily into yer average monster shoot-em-up flick.SEMI-SPOLIERS - It would have been great if the monsters were much more insiduous, intelligent and scheming as a collective in their dealings with the poor trapped humans. That is most significantly why the Alien flicks are truly terrifying and this is just average.It would have been really entertaining if the pitch black of the title led to some greater unseen evil-from-within kinda of thing, but as it is once you've seen the monsters, that's all there is to it.5/10",Pitch Black

290,Einsiedeln,An impressive homage to the genre,9,24 February 2000,"Truth to be told, I went into ""Pitch Black"" unsure of what to expect.  I'd read a couple of reviews in the paper, largely forgotten shortly thereafter, and naturally seen the previews and ads.  Given how movies have disappointed in the past, these days I go into theatres with as few expectations as possible.I was thoroughly impressed by this movie.In the tradition of Aliens, Predator, and the like, Pitch Black makes a fine addition to the genre.  All such films share some common factors -- unknown beasties, a limited area in which to move, and people getting killed off in sundry nasty ways.  But although the basis is similar, the plot and implementation was still impressive.  The cinematography and imagery were superb, the acting excellent, and the special effects impressive.  (My primary concern with effects-generated beasties is whether or not you can tell it was effects-generated, that is, does it look like a Harryhausen stop-motion beast.  Pitch Black passed that test with flying colours.)I have to give a nod to Vin Diesel, who probably was a significant part of why this film was as good as it was.  Each of the main characters had their flaws nonetheless, Vin stands out above the rest of the pack, and not merely in physical stature (though that certainly was a part of it).  In sheer presence and in deeds his was the character that had the audience's attention.  The entire theater was clapping and cheering at one point!This movie portrays an interesting trinity of protagonists and how they react to the situation they've been placed in.  The ""taste"" of the movie, if you can consider it so, was savory and thick.  It's certainly the best sci-fi movie I've seen since ""The Matrix"" -- ""The Phantom Menace"" was shallow and ephemeral, ""Galaxy Quest"" was decent but too much of a satire to find a place in my memory, ""eXistenZ"" was too bizarre, ""The Astronaut's Wife"" possessed of a weak storyline, ""The 13th Floor"" not bad, but too predictable- you get the picture.  And let's not even talk about ""Supernova"".The only real difficulty I had with it was the choppy editing during the first 20 minutes or so.  A few more moving shots, used to emphasise transitions, would have upped my rating that final point.Overall:  9/10.",Pitch Black

The acting is decent, the low budget is not a problem, and the dialog....well, it sure doesn't zing, but I don't remember groaning aloud at any point like I did in Mission to Mars.  The creatures are not badly conceived and have some cool special effects in their perception of light. 
Unfortunately, there are some stupid moves on the part of almost every character except Riddick (Vin Diesel steals the show), who is the consummate survivor.  He maintains your interest throughout -- you are never quite sure if he has redeeming qualities, besides some reflective stuff on his eyeballs, physical courage, strength etc.  Not that he is in any danger of breaking out in a spot of bon homie.A boon:  The ending is actually not predictable.   Try guessing if any of them survive, and if so, which.  Well, its clear some of them are just not gonna make it, but after that, try guessing.  Low points you can pass over: What lousy luck arriving at just exactly this point in the 22 year cycle. Why doesn't somebody figure out how long the eclipse will last?  How did these dark-adapted creatures evolve on a planet with decades of intense sunlight. How is it that barely fluorescent worms work as a deterrent?

293,Puregold,"Superb set up, stunning delivery.",9,28 February 2000,"I had been wanting to see this movie from the first time I saw the trailer. Being a HUGE fan of the Alien series, this film seemed right up my alley, and it didn't disappoint. This movie has so much to offer and delivers beautifully. After seeing the movie and giving it some thought, I can't help but rave over the set up. Everyone has a good idea what the film is about from the previews, but getting there is half the fun. The story starts with a bang and continues to build your interest and anticipation. I also have to add, that this is one of those movies that have classic images that will remain in your memory forever. Brief but brilliant shots, camera angles, and stuff that will just stun your senses and give you chills of excitement. And finally, but not in the least, Vin Diesel. Where did this guy come from? He is brilliant in his role, and became the complete anti-hero that you want by your side any time you fight light-fearing alien beings. From beginning to end, this movie has just a perfect feel, and is a great time at the movies. Enjoy it!",Pitch Black
294,mg!,How can a simple movie bring out such hatred?,6,29 February 2000,"Seeing some comments, I really wonder how a simple sci-fi movie can bring out such anger.  It's just a movie - and they have made worse (remember The Avengers?; now that's a BOMB)It is true that Pitch Black is not for those who seek originality.  It is filled with extremely one-dimensional characters and a thin premise.  But non-campy, sci-fi movies are so rare that any credible attempt should be appreciated. (Unless you think Mars Attacks! is the highlight of film-making).I was not disappointed because I paid a rush-hour price.  But I understand those who were let down if they stood in line and paid a full ticket price. I give it a 6/10.  As a side note, I liked the direction when the movie was in daylight.  It was different, and fast-paced.  However it was a different movie in the dark. As if the director got tired.",Pitch Black
295,Aang14,A great start,7,31 January 2021,"This is a great start to what will become one of the biggest sci-fi Movie series 'The Chronicles Of Riddick' . This movie is really well done even though the special effects weren't the best but overall it was good, there were even a few edge of seat moments throughout the movie. Also Vin Diesel did a really good job at playing Riddick the escaped murderer with Gray/silver smoke eyes. If you like movie franchises like Resident Evil or Blade you'll like this one so I definitely suggest it.",Pitch Black
296,gundamgirl2386,Really it's not that bad,10,28 December 2002,"I found Pitch Black to be a refreshing change from the horrible sci-fi flicks we have gotten in recent time.  As a girl I admit that I was first interested in the eye candy that is Vin Diesel but as the movie played on I really got a good glimpse that it is still possible to make a good science fiction movie.The one problem with this story is that we are led somewhere and then totally jerked in another direction.  What i'm talking about is about 20 or so minutes into the film we are believing that we are going to get an awesome insight into the mysterious Riddick and then all of sudden it's ""WTF it's dark and aliens are eating the crew!"".  Granted no the aliens weren't uninteresting or anything but Riddick was what got me interested, and I don't mean Vin I mean his character.  I wanted to know what he had done, and wanted to hear more about him (BTW I hear they are making a Riddick movie sometime in the future sort of a prequel).There are some good characters that I cared about and then there are some ""Oh well they're dead.""  I never got around to caring about Fry so the ending didn't hurt me none.  Despite the fact that no the movie didn't go where I wished it would have it was still a great movie and enjoyable.  Though you do have to overlook some parts, like how they so conveniently landed on the planet on the one day a year there is an eclipse.  I think if you don't dig too far into it you'll find that you'll enjoy it.  It is really quite a simple movie and you won't forget Vin Diesel's Riddick.9 out of 10 stars.",Pitch Black
297,HighlanderArg,I think I am going to puke....,1,25 January 2005,"""Pitch Black"" was on TV. Cool, I will have a sample of what the newest Riddick film is about. After seeing this, definitely, I am not renting it.The story is basically like this: a ship carrying a top-security prisoner (guess who?) somehow falls on a deserted planet, and soon is cornered by creatures who live in the dark and like to eat flesh. Oh, how scary! The movie in itself is FX. The rest is a ripoff of ""Red Planet"" (but without Carrie Anne Moss walking out of the shower), ""Star Wars"" and ""Men In Black"" (the creatures...), and some dreadful b-sci-fi movies.Diesel pulls out some sort of Dom (the guy he played in ""Fast & FUrious""), while the rest of the cast spend their time trying to justify their being in this film.I never thought a movie would deserve a 1. There's something always worth remarking. Well, it's not enough with FX, and the movie is too sorely bad. COnclussion: 1/10",Pitch Black

To me, there are a lot of similarities...both are rough, gritty, original, pretty much made you feel like you were there with them, and made you care about the characters.For the same reasons Mad Max was not a 10, this is not, but it is still a very good show that would be a great addition to your video collection.

299,Fractalizer,An OK Sci-Fi Horror Flick (if you're into that kind of thing),6,31 July 2001,"(Might contain minor spoilers.)Watched this on DVD last night and really enjoyed it. Don't expect this to become a classic or in fact be anything more than a rather unoriginal yet entertaining and rather well made sci-fi horror experience.This film does have many weaknesses. You can tell right from the start who's cannon fodder and who's not, some of the effects are a bit cheesy (the creatures POV was irritating to say the least), and there's heavy borrowing from films like Alien, so no points for originality.Pacing is quite off at times, but the film always manages to get back on track before this becomes annoying. Unfortunately this makes some of the scenes meant to be suspenseful fail embarrassingly.I liked the performances. Yes, the characters are stereotypes, but this is how it works in these kinds of films (see Alien), and the actors deliver these stereotypes convincingly (if this isn't a contradiction in itself).Vin Diesel plays the see-in-the-dark tough guy in a wonderfully over the top fashion. In fact, this is one of the most enjoyable tough guy impersonisations I have seen in quite a while.Dialogue is what you would expect from a film like this - it mainly propels the story. There are a few memorable lines, mostly for ""coolness"", and always delivered by Riddick (Vin Diesel).Expect to see a nice amount of eye candy, both in terms of CGI effects and photography.All in all, if you're into Sci-Fi I would say that you should see this film. If it's not your preferred genre, stick to the classics instead.I rated this at 6. But strictly within the realm of Sci-Fi I would probably give a 7.",Pitch Black

The first 3rd is MTV-like and can almost be mistaken for the commercials if you are watching it on cable. The ending shows it was made in the Marilyn Manson age. But, they had the guts to end it this way and I liked it. Most of the plot is totally unbelievable, but it's OK for the mental popcorn it is.",Pitch Black
301,TrickyTheHorrorFreak,Really good science fiction film made better by the character Riddick.,9,22 September 2006,"""Pitch Black"" is the perfect example of a film that clones most of its elements from a previous classic (in this case it's ""Aliens"") and yet still manages to be entertaining and amazingly appear somewhat fresh. Both movies involve a group of people stuck on a distant planet being hunted by an extremely dangerous species. After the initial onslaught, both movies then see the remaining characters attempting to survive while desperately working to get off the planet as soon as possible. So how can ""Pitch Black"" possibly seem fresh despite all these similarities? Well, the difference is in the details.When a spaceship is critically damaged by some sort of asteroid storm, the pilot is forced to crash-land on a desert planet that has three suns. Due to at least one of the suns being above the horizon at all times it at first appears as if the planet exists in constant sunlight. Soon after they arrive it becomes apparent that the survivors are not alone. A species of creature takes a few of them out before they have a chance to figure out what's happening. This reptilian looking animal appears to have a severe reaction to light of any sort and so the climate seems to be ideal for the marooned travelers to avoid contact. But when the three suns and a planet all align in a massive scale eclipse, the creatures are free to roam the planet, attacking any life-forms that they come into contact with. The crew will soon come to realize that they need to rely heavily on a convicted killer they were previously transporting if they are to have any chance of survival.The setup is a good one. The suspense builds dramatically as the light begins to fade away. But the thing that takes the movie to another level completely is the cast and the special effects. The effects are awesome, particularly when you consider that ""Pitch Black"" did not have a huge budget. In particular the initial crash scene is grippingly intense and kicks proceedings off with one heck of a bang. The creatures look real and frightening and the use of light and shadows works well for both the story and the budgetary constraints. The movie was filmed in Australia yet the planet appears alien due to the strange overexposed lighting used throughout the daytime scenes as well as the alien looking skeletal remains that dot the surface. Each member of the cast has a distinct persona as well as their own story to tell. Carolyn (Radha Mitchell) is an attractive young woman that comes awfully close to intentionally killing most of the crew during the crash landing in an attempt to save her own life, only to be considered a hero when they all live to see another day. She struggles throughout the movie with this cowardice and the undue praise that followed. William (Cole Hauser) is a morphine addicted mercenary intent on making sure a convicted criminal comes to justice. But the star of ""Pitch Black"" is undoubtedly Vin Diesel as Riddick, an escaped prisoner that the rest of the crash survivors rightfully fear. Diesel doesn't say an awful lot during the movie, yet every time he is on screen, he simply demands attention. I do feel that the creators tried perhaps a little too hard to make Riddick appear insanely dangerous, yet it's a credit to Diesel's performance that the audience still finds themselves in awe of him as well as hopeful to see more of him in action. The character was so successful that there is now a sequel called Riddick as well as a computer game based on him alone.""Pitch Black"" is most definitely ripping off previous films as stated above, but it does what it does tremendously well. Considering the amount of dreadful monster films that have come out in recent times, the grittiness, setting and Riddick make this movie a complete success. I highly recommend it to any fan of science fiction and horror.",Pitch Black

I heard of 1 or 2 folks who had seen it and made a decent comment on it.  After watching it (for the 3rd time now) I would definately recommend this movie to anyone else.  I've seen better movies about ""evil in outerspace"" but I've also seen alot worse too.  This movie had a decent plot and an excellent cast.  Not only did they have the nocturnal aliens to fight with, but there were excellent conflicts created within the group of humans trying to get off this planet.  I especially like the conflict built up between Johns and Riddick.  Vin Diesel was an excellent choice for the role of Riddick.If you're looking for a good sci-fi movie, definately pick this one up; although, not for the kids.

304,eagle1-8,Wowser!,9,1 August 2001,"Yep-this was good. It's not ground breaking or anything (how many movies ARE?) but it's very entertaining for what it is- a romp through the world of SciFi. The characters were planned very well; because of this, the writers were able to make complex twists in the script based on the humans, and not just on the aliens (the humans were their own causes and effects, essentially). That's quite unique in the movie world- usually, characters are designed to REact, and never to actually think. Besides the writers, a lot of credit must be given to the actors (Vin Diesal especially; his work was, and still is, amazing). If the actors had failed to bring strength and attitude to their characters, all of the writing in the world would not have been able to save this movie.Go rent this movie if you like Scifi, psychological thrillers, etc. Vin Diesal fans will also get a kick out of this! (spoiler) I might have solved one of the plot holes: What would the flying aliens eat if the humans hadn't shown up? Answer: themselves! They cannibalize, remember? They probably ate all the other inhabitants, so, now, they have to eat themselves! And, from the numbers of them, it wouldn't affect their population too much.",Pitch Black
305,BuffySoprano,Outstanding!,10,1 July 2002,"I could never truly express how much I love this film.  I have seen it almost 10 times, and still grip the sides of the chair when watching it. There are a few flaws in the plot, some were mentioning the crew not freezing at sundown, and the likelihood of the crash occurring at the same time as the eclipse, but hey, just go with the flow.The special effects they used for Riddick were exceptional, and the tone for the planet was just as effective.  The stark contrasts in colors gave the mood, and added to the creepiness factor.Vin Diesel was excellent in this movie, and the script was cleverly written. You see his and the captain's internal struggles over the importance of their survival in contrast to saving the others.I was very impressed with this movie, and I would recommend it to anyone.

306,timesplitterz,Wow what a great Sci-Fi horror.,8,17 June 2008,"Pitch Black is the first film in the Riddick series and wow what great film it is. Now I saw the chronicles of Riddick before seeing this one so I learnt the story backwards which was interesting. so I couldn't say I was too excited to watch it but I was given it for Christmas and thought I'd give it try. And it was nothing like I imagined it in fact it was the almost the complete opposite. I had a rough idea of the plot or so i thought, my idea of the plot was that a small crew along with Riddick himself were stuck on a planet with a bunch of man eating aliens and it would roughly be quite simular to Riddick 2. Oh how I was wrong in stead it turned out to be a Sci-fi horror! with a crew that gets nearly all picked off! Brilliant i thought and as soon as I got over the stunning opening scene i knew i was about to watch something completely different to Riddick 2 and overall and greater film. Vin Diesel's performance as Riddick is better than the second film but only just. He really makes you fear him as a character with his unnerving and random personality as he changes from funny to violent with out warning. All the actors do a great job playing their part and story has more surprises and the characters are deeper than normally horror films. overall Pitch black should be watched by anyone who loves sci-fi or horror or even both. if you enjoy a good action film then you'll be treated by this excellent sci-fi classic.",Pitch Black

He's just cool about everything,even when he's an inch from death. A bit like the characters VinnieJones plays, but I cannot see Vinnie Jones playing Riddick.I have seen scarier movies than this, but it is truly a scary movie, inthe style of the monsters leaping out of the darkness, anddreading and not knowing who will die next. Definitely the scariestscience fiction I've ever seen.The aliens are truly brilliantlyanimated, and you would expect them to shriek, but they do not.The sound they do make actually makes it more frightening than ifthey did shriek.The only drawback is that if you have a favourite character, he/shewill most probably get slaughtered at some point.I give it 9/10; it's a great popcorn flick!",Pitch Black

Riddick is this bad guy, but he's also the hero who tries to save the slow-paced folks.

I left considering it an equal to the majority of poorly written science fiction movies.There were some nice shots and the colour filter effects are quite nice. Visually I thought the movie was average overall but certain shots had the promise of better things in the director's future.The script is terrible, however.  The ""science"" of the movie is laughable - it lost me early on when the WINDSHIELD breaks while in an uncontrolled descent through the atmosphere, and the pilot just sits there and shields her eyes.  I don't think anyone gave any thought to the development of the creatures or their ecology - comparing this to Alien is an insult.Vin Diesel was not bad, but if I hadn't seen him do some actual acting in Boiler Room I wouldn't have thought him anything special.",Pitch Black

That's probably because it isn't technically a hollywood film. Vin Deisel's performance is really what made this film, he played his character beautifully (if someone can play a convicted murdered 'beautifully'). The movie was made on a fairly small budget but since there aren't any really big name actors in the cast, they were able to spend more of the fx, and generally they did a good job. The eclipse scene is really beautiful. Also, I'd like to compliment the design staff of the film on creating a monster that wasn't generic.

312,slam163,"Weak in places, but with some redeeming virtues",6,1 August 2000,"A curious little movie, this one. It seems to hover between the world of 'straight to video' derivatives and something rather better. Perhaps it deserves to be classed with ""Slipstream"" - a low-budget SF film with plenty of failings but enough interesting features to make it worth a look.On the face of it, the main theme of the film - stranded space travellers on an alien planet must struggle for survival against nasty local creatures that eat them one by one - has been done to death. The ""Alien"" series pretty much wrote the book on this one, and by reinventing the theme slightly with each iteration, more or less exhausted the possibilities of the idea. The makers of ""Pitch Black"" also deserve a hefty virtual slap for using another of science-fiction's tired cliches, the dreaded meteor storm.One thing that redeems ""Pitch Black"" is the focus on characters. While the characters are cliched - plucky but vulnerable pilot, superhuman serial killer, tough-guy bounty hunter, serene holy man, and a handful of the usual monster fodder - the director allows each of the actors room to work with the material that they've been given and the results are surprisingly good. Vin Diesel's sardonic Riddick is ""Hannibal Lecter"" Lite, but with greater room for depth and development, while Radha Mitchell turns in an impressive performance as the young pilot pushed into taking command in an impossible situation. Between them, they establish an intriguing and often plausible human dynamic that is rarely seen in similar films. That ""Pitch Black"" is able to rise above the level of the usual ""eat-'em-one-by-one"" picture (something that, for example, ""Event Horizon"", with its much larger budget and celebrity cast, was not) is because it becomes a film not about monsters but about flawed humanity, and the largely unknown cast are good enough to make their characters - even the most minor - believable and often likeable.The picture also looks better than you would expect. The cast wear their clothes and equipment as if they lived in them, and the back story hints at a complex, multi-faceted civilisation (albeit one without any wild leaps of creative imagination: the technology and concepts are all fairly twentieth-century). The spaceship sets have a gritty, workaday feel, while the bleached, washed-out tones of the daylight exterior scenes actually make the alien setting seem real. When the characters emerge from the dark confines of the hull into the glare of day, your eyes narrow in sympathy. This is a Star Trek universe, where crash-landings are always made on planets that have breathable air, water and (usually hostile) life, but for all that, the nameless planet of ""Pitch Black"" is as barren and brutal as the plot will allow.""Pitch Black"" is not without serious flaws: there's much, beginning with the main plot premise, that's hackneyed or unconvincing. But at the same time there are definitely things to like about it and food for thought. The fact that it is ultimately a film about the best and worst in human nature makes it deeper and more gripping than the broad outlines of the story might suggest.",Pitch Black
313,draftyrafters,Perfect Pitch,9,20 February 2000,"A new sci-fi thriller was released this past Friday.  It stars nobody famous, was directed by David Twohy (who is responsible for some pretty major flops, like G. I. Jane, The Arrival, Waterworld, Critters 2 and Terminal Velocity), and was written by the brothers Wheat, Jim and Ken, who have also spent most of their time penning some pretty dreary stuff (Birds II, The Fly II, and Nightmare on Elm Street 4).  Aside from the fact that Twohy once directed The Fugitive, this movie has nothing going for it right out of the starting block.	It's called Pitch Black.  And, as my dad always says, ""This movie will eat your lunch.""  That means its good, for those of you who don't speak the language of my dad.	Let's talk plot.  Taking place in the distant future, a space ship is carrying some passengers to an unnamed planet.  Among the denizens is a dangerous convict, who is our narrator.  For no explained reason, the ship's hull is punctured full of holes, causing an understandable and intense crash, depositing the surviving members of the group on a large deserted planet that has three suns.  Unfortunately, a major solar eclipse is on the verge of occurring, and the planet just happens to be infested with a horrifying race of aliens that can only live in the dark.  Needless to say, the aliens begin feasting on the poor survivors like they're Human McNuggets.  Pass the popcorn!	Perhaps the most admirable trait of the movie is its patience.  It jumps into the story with just enough exposition to keep it sensible, but it doesn't rush anywhere from there, doesn't make any excuses, and doesn't explain itself any more than it has to.  Each element of the story (including the nicely designed and unobtrusive sub-plots) achieves a mythical quality within the confines of the well-measured story. 	Of course, the cinematography helps.  The first half of the movie, establishing the mood and situation, is almost over-exposed, glaring a hot white.  The three suns (one of which is a silver blue) shine beautifully on the shimmering and humming planet, and everyone's faces become bleached masks.  And then, suddenly, it's dark.	There's nothing devouring about the film.  It certainly doesn't swallow the audience whole, the way Aliens did.  But it does provide a context and a story that, in its own element, is believable and suspenseful, the way Alien did.  Sure, Pitch Black has its cheesy moments, but it's the type of cheese you don't regret, and most of it provides a welcome relief from the constant swarthy forms rushing by in the darkness.  Balanced out by moments of intense creepiness, the cheese helps keep the movie from falling into total self-importance.	But what makes the flick (despite nicely underplayed acting all around) is the visually enchanting tricks the director opted to add.  The convict narrator spent most of his life in a prison with almost no lighting.  Upon his release (i.e. breakout) he got a doctor to give him night vision. (C'mon, it's the future)  At many points the movie adopts his point of view, which is simultaneously gorgeous and chilling.  Add to that the alien point of view (which is an array of crystalline shards, intended to represent the way they ""see"" things in a manner similar to bats: via echoes), and you have a flick well worth just watching, if not experiencing.	It's hard to know who'll like it and who won't, but I don't hesitate to say this is a good movie.  Playing out like a live action version of Myst plus Doom, this show has its weak points and its strong points, its silly moments and its strong moments, but doesn't disappoint.  And although some of it may be gross, some of it disturbing, and some of it a little dopey, it's an engaging story without a predictable resolution, tuned to an almost perfect pitch.	Get it?  ""Pitch?""  Pitch Black?  Just go see the movie, for crying out loud.",Pitch Black

Vin Diesel is perfect as the villain as his voice is cold and his acting is dark. You couldn't help but to cheer for the villain. The story is similar to Alien but expanded to a greater scale. The killer aliens didn't look threatening at first but after a while their deadliness was up there with the alien from Alien. Cole Hauser's performance would make anyone hate his character. The chemistry between Hasuer and Diesel in their fight scene reminded me of the ""grudge match films"" such as Demolition Man, Face/Off, Broken Arrow, Universal Soldier, and Virtuosity. The film itself had a shock ending, but I'm not gonna tell you, just go watch it. Better yet, just go buy it. It's worth it.",Pitch Black
317,Rodney613,"Incredibly Satisfying, Above Average Sci-Fi Horror",9,19 February 2000,"This movie, which is essentially Alien Meets Midnight Run Meets The Birds, is the best sci-fi/horror in a long time. The plot, involving some unlucky passengers crash landed on a planet with some ugly little creatures, who must trust a serial killer to save them, is a bit thin, but creates some genuinely suspensful moments.     No real big name actors here, except for Vin Diesel, who does a fine job in his performance here as the killer. The director picks some odd camera angles and weird shots, but I think it pays off. He lets see from the viewpoint of the killer/hero, the viewpoint of the weird alien bats, and he actually makes you a little afraid of the dark.     The noises of the creatures are very frightening, but sound a little grating after a while. Other than that, and the fact the movie is about 10-15 minutes too long, its really worth your while.

Now it has been surpassed by Pitch Black, received the US DVD last week and so far watched it 5 or 6 times and the film just gets better and better.So where to begin, the start is excellent full of action not the usual eerie pan around the spaceship interior. The bodycount also starts pretty quickly. This leads into a very fast pace for the whole film all the way to the end.The sound (on DVD) is excellent and the visuals (although not scientifically accurate) are a wonder to behold, with lots of freeze framing going on. Characters are well in two camps ( those who survive most of the time and those who don't ), Riddick, Fry, Jack, Imam, Johns and to a lesser degree Paris all have some development throughout the film and add some interesting plots.The acting on the whole is very good and Vin Diesel deserves to increase his Hollywood profile following this film. The DVD offers a lot of information with the commentaries sections and would recommend checking these out. I look forward to 10th November when Pitch Black is in UK cinemas ( yes that is 9 months since the US release and some one should face criminal charges of cruelty for that ) as it will be a visceral feast to enjoy on the big screen.If you liked Predator, Aliens, The Hidden, Independence Day, The Thing or any other leave your brain at home and enjoy the ride movie then you MUST see Pitch Black.",Pitch Black

322,erasmus-4,Pretty Darn Good,8,7 March 2000,"While not being the best or most original movie, I really feel this movie has been unfairly lambasted by critics. There's a ton of cool effects, the characters are not one-dimensional as a whole, and there's some dark humor to keep things going. I think that as long as you buy into the horror formula of that when you think things can't get any worse, they do, and don't mind the fact that it's a little derivative of its predecessors, you're going to have a good time. Incidentally, without giving anything away, I think the movie does break one cardinal rule of the genre towards the end - I think you'll know what I mean when you see it.",Pitch Black

The story was basically flawless as sci-fi goes(Making up inventions so forth), the acting solid and well done, this film had excellent directing, my only complaint was that during some of the action the camera was to close and I could not really tell what was happening.

324,Dark Hellion,Good movie...,8,18 May 2000,"Pitch Black isn't supposed to be believable. I mean, honestly, what do people make movies *about*? Not boring, ordinary everyday events, that's for sure. If the ship had crashed far from anything, what would there have been to make a movie about? Nothing. There wouldn't have been one. And it *is* possible to have a system with three suns. Only problem is, it's impossible to predict the movement of the bodies in that system. The only other gripe I had is that Riddick's eyesight didn't seem to be constant...and there was an awful lot of light around at times for a total eclipse. But let's ignore all that. Problem: Not scary enough. Too few genuine scares. Problem: Riddick isn't frightening enough, and is too obviously the 'good' guy. Problem: We don't get enough information on the characters - I didn't get attached to anyone other than Riddick. And Fry, a little. Aliens was much better in this department. Good: Character *development*, even though we have nothing really to start with. We see Johns sink from the good guy to the merc, Riddick almost redeem himself, and Fry face up to who she really is and try to do something about it. Not to mention Imam's faith. Good: The aliens. They're cool, and even fight each other like they should.
Good: Riddick is not a superhuman indestructible superhero. He gets hurt like everyone else. He just has certain...advantages. Good: The ending. See that for yourself. Good: There are no clichéd 'I'm gonna die! We're all gonna die!' characters. I'm sick of them. Even the scared guy is kinda like Purvis from Alien: Resurrection. Well, that's about all. Recommendation: Go see this if you want to spend a couple of hours thinking about nothing in particular, and you can suspend your disbelief enough to overcome the problems I mentioned and the rather improbable starting point for the plot. If you can do all that, you'll like this movie.

The creatures harken toward Alien and the directing makes sure you don't always see what's coming next.  To be honest...this is much more of a tie-in to the Aliens series than Alien Resurrection ever was.  Vin Diesel is most likely the next great action hero - and by all appearances - he's got a brain on him. Thank the maker!  Excellent",Pitch Black
326,evenbetter,"A Movie with heart, soul, and a Shine Job!",10,11 January 2003,"""Pitch Black"" is one of those movies that comes along once in a Triple-sun: it's action-packed, thoughtful, and gripping.     Riddick, are favorite maniac with a Shine Job, leads a pack of crash-landed survivors through the Valley of the Shadow of Death on a planet populated by nocturnal carnivores.  Along the way we find out that Riddick is a tortured soul; on the brink of genius, but riding a fine line between good and evil.  Is he helping out of kindness, or is it a means to an end?     ""Pitch Black"" should be considered a Movie-With-Action; that is, it's action scenes and special effects are used to support the theme of Riddick's inner turmoil.  The aliens that the beleagured crew encounter are eeriely menacing, much in the same way that the aliens in Alien were.  Riddick seems to be working with and against the alien antagonists; using them to deal with the enemies amongst the group up until he discovers that life has meaning if someone believes it does.     Vin Diesel is awesome as Riddick; as many have said before, he's the best reason to root for the bad guy in a long time.  The cinematic style is impressive, and the plot is intriging.  Check it out; it's no Fast and the Furious.... and that's a good thing.",Pitch Black

Then I got to then end and thought I liked that movie. Then I rewatched it and thought I really like this movie. The ones to follow didn't capture for me what this movie did.

328,stephie-12,Best sci-fi movie ever!,10,22 February 2004,"This movie is about the crew of a spaceship who crash land onto a strange bright planet with three suns.  Among the passengers is convicted serial killer, Richard Riddick (Vin Diesel), and his nemesis, Johns (Cole Hauser). While the survivors of the wreck are getting their bearings, an eclipse of all three suns happens.  Shortly afterwards, scary creatures begin to appear and start to pick off the crew members one by one.  During the eclipse, Riddick comes into his own, as his eyeballs have been surgically shined, giving him night vision.  The crew have to rely on him to try to get them to safety.This is a very stylish film, with the colour of the sky changing scene by scene, giving it a very strange look.  Vin Diesel is brilliant as Riddick, truly menacing but forced to help people who otherwise would only see him as a threat.  There is also an underlying humour in his performance as well, which adds another dimension to the character.  This is the sort of role that Vin excels in, the anti-hero, whos character is not as one-dimensional as first appears.  I can imagine no-one else in this role, it could have been written specifically for him.Roll on Chronicles of Riddick!",Pitch Black

I was not a fan of Vin diesel before I saw Pitch black, but after seeing Pitch Black my respect for Vin Diesel has gone up. He did a great job playing Riddick a man wanted for many murders. His character is cold and makes many decisions that surprised me, like near the end Riddick was going to get on the ship and save his own ass leaving everyone behind to die. I like this movie and how it deals with human instinct. This movie is low budget but this movie goes to show you don't need amazing special effects and lots of money to make a good movie, I think all the characters made this movie.

333,Anthony-41,classy,8,8 April 2001,In this day and age producers of sci-fi films think if you stick in some good special effects then you have a good film but miss the point that the story comes first regardless of genre.  Thankfully this film has a cracking storyline and a very good cast which is complemented by the excellent use of special effects.  This film is both entertaining and scary and also demonstrates why Vin Diesel is going to be such a big star.,Pitch Black
334,endowed,Excellent Sci-Fi flick that doesnt bite Alien too hard....,9,18 February 2000,"I had my doubts. Another space movie with people trying to dodge bloodthirsty aliens. I kept thinking back to Outer Space movies like Event Horizon and Alien 3 and wondered why I was giving this tired genre yet another shot at winning me over. I must admit that I was more than pleasantly surprised after I saw Pitch Black. My first thought upon sitting down in the theatre was that the 3 or so movie previews that I saw would have summed up the best parts in the movie, but not in this case. The movie doesnt fall prey to starting slowly and ending quickly as most Space thrillers do (Before you shake your head no, think of the last couple space movies you saw...zzzzz) Pitch Black jumps you right into the action.. Good performances by a virtually unknown cast (at least to me). With the exception of Vin Diesel and Keith David, I didnt much recognize many of the other thespians' roles in movies except for some bit parts. The movie has some excellent special effects but doesnt fall prey to overusing them like in Event Horizon or (to a lesser extreme) Supernova. Overall, this movie has repeat watching written all over it. It isnt the best Ive ever seen, but it did what most others fail at doing.....It entertained me.",Pitch Black
335,jim.adamson,A Text-Book Example of a Top Quality Sci-Fi Action Thriller.,9,27 March 2002,"This movie absolutely kicked ass. I had no fingernails left by the time the credits rolled, and felt like I'd just been on a rollercoaster ride. What's more I didn't have to disengage my brain to enjoy it. Compared to what was realised on the screen this was done on a shoestring budget and was full of invention and superbly written and directed. It puts to shame many films that were done on five times the budget, and should act as a lesson in film-making for this genre.Lesson #1. The scenario and scary creatures may be slightly reminiscent of other movies, but you can put an interesting spin on the idea which justifies your film being made. In this picture there were various elements which had been seen before, but the mixture of stranded crew, desert planet and hidden danger is presented with a new spin which is a perfect recipe for suspense and thrills. The opening sequence sets up the scenario nicely and as the seriousness of the situation unfolds, a queasy sensation of mounting horror takes over. From then on I was squirming in my seat thinking ""Wow, these guys are screwed"" and wondering how anyone would survive.Lesson #2. Limited resources and lack of big star names can be turned to your advantage. The makers of this film have concentrated on writing a good script and using what resources they do have to make it look interesting. There isn't much in the way of flashy CGI effects but it looks superb, and the director has used some excellent photographic effects to depict the planet and the Riddick character's unusual vision. The writing is excellent and I notice some of the best dialogue has been given a deserved web page of its own on the IMDB site. This combination of good writing and inventive direction makes the whole picture work better, in my humble opinion, than many a film whose special effects cost ten times as much. This is the essence of good sci-fi, because the genre often doesn't get the resources required to realise an ambitious vision and even when it does, it's usually wasted on brainless popcorn-fodder like the Fifth Element.Lesson #3. Characters. The makers of this movie have fortunately realised that it never hurts to come up with interesting characters and creating an ensemble with some interesting chemistry. The leading players all have a slight edge to them that makes them more vulnerable and more interesting than a clean-cut action hero. The pilot haunted by her decision to try and save herself at the expense of others before the crash, now trying to save everyone, the murderous convict who no one can trust, the shady law enforcement officer - all makes for a bit of added spice and makes everyone seem more human and sympathetic. The supporting cast have all got slightly different viewpoints and motivations and this means people can act in different and conflicting ways. It's not Shakespeare but it works well and gives the story the ability to take different turns due to the characters' actions. Vin Diesel is the best thing in this movie with a terrific performance as the convict, but all the actors performed quite well in their various roles thanks to the characterization and good judgement by film-makers who clearly understand what works in a sci-fi movie.Lesson #4. Set up the situation, pile on the problems, and then let the characters try various ways to dig their way out of the hole. The story advances, as do the characters (the surviving ones anyway), as they keep moving on. Pile on a few more problems, suspense and shocks, and plant the characters tantalisingly close to the chance to succeed and stick one last frightening danger in their way. This movie was so gripping and clever I was rapt throughout. The ending was a bit abrupt and inconclusive but perhaps in keeping with the hard-edged, almost bleak mood the film had conjured up until then,Overall, an absolute cracker and worth watching. I expect I will buy this on DVD to keep as one of my favourites of the genre.One criticism: While not giving this movie a massive budget to play around with, which might have been a millstone around everyone's neck, was not necessarily a bad move, the studio should have given this movie much more support than it got. Surely when they saw what was in the can, the suits should have given this better distribution and promotion, and taken the opportunity to clean up at the box office with what was the best movie of its kind in years? I saw one trailer for this movie, which didn't do the production justice and made me think it would just be another rip-off of Aliens et al. I waited for the video as I simply don't have the opportunity to see that many films at the cinema and limit myself to the unmissable releases, and then kicked myself black and blue for not queuing round the block in the rain to see this. In the end this movie nearly doubled its money at the US Box Office but this deserved to be a $100m grosser. When you've got something this good, make the most of it.",Pitch Black

The CGI and effects serve the plot, and not the other way around.The critters are fantastic (although I have to wonder what they eat when there are no hoomins around).As with all films like this, there are a couple of troubling plot holes, but far fewer per running foot of celluloid than the average George Lucas movie, and far, far fewer than average. The direction is taut.Quibbles. Soundtrack is very derivative in spots. To keep the George Lucas comparison going, it's partly dumbed down John Williams. That said, the score has some great creepy parts too. Science quibble.. Low oxygen results in non existent flames and complete inability to run. Character quibble... Vin Diesel's character Riddick's unusual skillset is not explained enough for my satisfaction.But heck, none of this was enough for my willing suspension of disbelief to get more than a few spare cables cut. If you don't normally watch SF movies this is definitely one to consider, and if you like SF horror this is a must see - in fact true horror buffs might find it tame.I am variable in how squeamish I am. Some days I can handle pretty disgusting stuff and other days I can't. This movie has a couple of pretty scary scenes, but I didn't find any of it particularly disturbing, and Vin Diesel made the whole trip worthwhile, in this, his breakout role.",Pitch Black

The action will be nonstop and I just bought the special edition DVD with the animated background story similar to the Animatrix. This will put Vin Diesel back in the spotlight and hopefully get him the coveted role in Spider Man 3 as Venom. He would be the most logical choice for the role. Back to PB this movie even though it is a indie thriller, it has a great story and characters with backgrounds that scream for you to want to learn more.

Forget the massive coincidences (that shall remain nameless) and forget the two-dimensional crew and just focus on creatures that seem to be the ONLY food chain, that fear sunlight, that know, during an eclipse, when to hoard enmass and when to give our heroes a break when the plot-line seems to need it.

Pitch Black is what every sci-fi and horror fan has been expecting ever sense that horribly disappointing Alien Resurrection.  Yes I know it's the same old opening sequences.  A deep space vessel crashing on an alien planet which happens to be a desert.  Don't let the stereotypical opening to this film frighten you away, wait for the real frightening, when you get involved with the main story.  Specifically it is the great dialog that drives the story so well.  You have interesting characters, and the tension they all exert plays well against the situations they all become entangled in.  There is even some religious debate that added the the characters depth that I found quite entertaining. SPOILER ALERT Vin Diesel plays an extremely enthralling character named Riddick, who's an killer/escapee being brought back by bounty hunter Johns, played by Cole Hauser.  After the shipwreck Riddick escapes.  The tension of such a savage killer running around scott free creates turmoil between the other survivors of the crash, and before they can get comfortable with Riddicks presence it turns night.  In a desperate attempt to leave the planet our heroes keep on hurdling obsticals one right after another.  Yet the dark proves not to be without the boogie man.  As blood thirsty aliens come out to have a mid-night snack our heroes turn to an unlikely hero, Riddick.  Riddick happens to be genetically enhanced to see in the Pitch Black, making him a very important asset in the others survival.What I absolutely loved about this film was Vin Diesel's physical presence, on top of having a great performance as a dark anti-hero. Having a character scarier than the aliens killing everyone off was a neat twist that I enjoyed most of all.

One man being religious, the other a crack doing cop who would sacrifice other lives just to bring in a murder convict.

348,thro81,Enjoyable film with interesting characters,8,7 June 2012,"Pitch black tells the story of a group of 12 people who survive a forced landing on a deserted planet. It's about survival and trying to escape a hostile environment. This plot has been used often before, and one could compare this film to The Thing or the Alien quadrilogy. What makes this film work are well written characters and great casting.This particular group of people consists of individuals with widely varying backgrounds and mentality, which makes trust a big issue. Not only do they have to deal with the situation being stranded on a strange planet but the biggest threat could be their fellow survivors. You can really feel the anxiety building up during the movie which is augmented with a number of highly tensional scenes between characters.As mentioned earlier the characters are what makes this a good film. Early in the movie the audience gets to know the characters enough to have feelings for them. Vin Diesel plays one of the main roles as Riddick, the physically strong, bad ass, prisoner, anti-hero, who still seems to have some leftovers of humanity. Cole Hauser plays Johns, a mercenary with a medical drug habit, who is responsible for Riddick, and the tension between those two is exciting to follow. Then we have Radha Mitchell playing the vice-captain of the ship who has to step up as a kind of a leader and keep the group together, while struggling with her own conscience. Other characters get less attention but are important, the most memorable ones are three Islamists who believe god is responsible for every happening but have to admit that god isn't always nice even if you pray; Jack, a boy with a secret and a rare items collector who is not exactly the kind of person you would pick in your survival team.The cast fits very well into the characters; they look believable in their roles. Especially Riddick, who comes off as a bad person but still you oddly start to care for him. You get really drawn into the storyline and can easily picture yourself there with the survivals. It has a nice build up where you get to know the characters as they try to understand the planet they find themselves stuck on, followed by some faster-paced, exhilarating scenes where you don't want to look away. There are no scenes in particular that stand out, but you can find some clever dialogues. The visual display is nice, with nice looking scenes ranging from intensive scenes happening in complete darkness to very bright POV's. The editing is very tight, including no scenes that don't matter or last way too long. Sometimes you need to do something else while watching, but this is not the case with this filmTo summarize this review: This is a film that no fan of Sci-fi movies should miss, or anyone who enjoys action thrillers in general. Not the most memorable of movies but who was expecting that? A good movie with a great cast and interesting characters. In one word: ""verymuchenjoyable"". - 8/10",Pitch Black
349,kdcarver,Classic Sci-Fi with a good dose of action,7,9 February 2003,"I am in a technical profession, and enjoy thinking about the possibilities of science fact and fiction.  However, in my opinion, Science Fiction is at it's best when the technical aspects are not dwelled upon, and the development of character takes over.  This is the case with Pitch Black. Passengers of a transport vessel find themselves marooned on an inhospitable planet.  Fear, trust, and characters coming to terms with their own weaknesses are intertwined with the basic suspense of a classic horror picture.The film has some rough spots, but for the most part, great science fiction. I think this did not do as well in the theatres as it could have due to the lack of sophistication in today's audiences.Vin Diesel is great in his role, as is Radha Mitchel.  David Keith's character lacks a bit of depth, in my opinion, but is interesting in the role of a holy man that doesn't have ALL the answers, yet is still faithful.

I was delighted to find that it is a movie of extreme depth about the redemption of a human soul.  This is a movie which surprised me and that doesn't happen very often.  It flouts convention and presents characters that are quite well rounded especially for this genre.  I feel that this is one of the best movies of the year and a must see for everyone who enjoys either a good sci-fi flick or a powerful drama about the inner workings of the human mind.,Pitch Black
351,mesia,Science fiction with a brain!,8,28 June 2001,"I can't say enough good things about this movie. I saw it twice in the theater and bought it as soon as it was out on DVD. The director's cut has some great scenes that didn't make it to the big screen, which gave additional insight to some of the character twists. This is my favourite science fiction movie since The Abyss came out.",Pitch Black
352,Zhuge,A good sci-fi and horror blend,10,21 February 2000,"I'm really surprised to see as many negative comments about this movie as there are.  Overall, the movie isn't going to win any major awards, but it's damn good for what it is.  Vin Diesel does a great job as Riddick, and the plot, while predictable for the most part, still has many little twists and turns that most people would not have anticipated.If you're a fan of sci-fi/horror, then I think you'll like this.  If you're looking for some sort of artistic and deeply meaningful film, then this isn't the one for you.",Pitch Black
353,hartje,"A few good ideas, but VERY inferior.",4,20 February 2000,"A passenger vessel becomes damaged (how is never really explained) while the crew and passengers (except the locked down criminal) are in cryogenic sleep (during which they're not frozen). The crew wake in time for one of them to land on a desert planet, where the lone remaining crew member must deal with her own demons, around 9 survivors and the deadly inhabitants of the planet they are now stranded on. On the plus side, the creatures seem to be averse to light and this planet has multiple suns. The bad news? The lights may be about to go out.This movie has some interesting ideas, and there is even a little surprise at the end, but the story is basically rehashed and tired. The effects are good, but you do see the same ones over and over. It would also help if you could understand what the criminal was saying. His accent (?) is a slightly more lucid version of Lou Ferigno.There are other moments when the suspension of disbelief just can't be maintained. The pilot lands the ship when apparently the windshield is out, taking the heat with her face as they burn on re-entry. Not even a case of chapped lips. Then there's the fact that the transport they're taking seems to be made to completely fall apart upon entering the atmosphere of a planet.There is no real depth to any of the characters, and the only ones that seem to have any consistency to their actions are the ones who become Pterodactyl Chow before they have a chance to ""evolve.""This is average fare, and if you simply want to sit in on a sci-fi movie, you won't leave totally disgusted. But I'd save a little money and go to a matinee. At least then the price of admission is equal to the shot down the front of the crewmember's blouse as she crawls into the hole. I must admit that was rather pleasant.2/18",Pitch Black

I really liked this movie, however, and it has been on my mind for several days since seeing it. If you like sci-fi/horror movies then I recommend this one. What I really liked about this movie was the lighting, awesome! I also liked the ending of the movie b/c it was somewhat unexpected.

It was packed from beginning to end with suspense and good acting.  I came out of that movie saying, ""wow, that was my kind of movie.""  Being a chick, I will warn - it is not a chick flick.  It is not for the faint of heart.  And it is not for those easily offended by profanity (had too much for my taste - some that was completely unnecessary).Vin Deisel was fabulous.

I guess Vin is hip, Radha is sexy and, gee, maybe the aliens are scary? Duh...I was entertained however... nice special effects. But the editing in this movie was deplorable. Very confusing with the way it switches back and forth from different locations and characters. Stupid plot devices stolen from other movies. (Oh... the boy is really a girl! That twist made THIS boy want to cry. :P )I think the director of this movie, himself, was probably as surprised as anyone that this movie was a success at all. Of course with the junk hollywood has been kicking out lately it's no surprise. People have to go somewhere on a Saturday night with their dates.A 'B' flick at best. Probably okay on video rental for $3 or so but if i had spent real money seeing this in the theatre this review would be far more scathing. For Pete's sake it was an Aliens ripoff!",Pitch Black
358,shastar,The Best Sci-Fi of the year 2000,10,20 December 2000,"*Minor spoilers ahead*All I can say about this movie is WOW! this makes my third viewing of it and it is still as intense and suspenseful as the first.I have seen Pitch Black described as formulaic. Well, it's a formula that works.After crash landing on a deserted planet, a small group of civilians, the only remaining crewmember left alive, a Bounty Hunter, and Riddick, a convicted killer being sent back to the slam after an escape. They have to figure out how to get off the planet which has three suns in different orbits around it, so they are constantly bathed in scorching light. Adding to the complications, Riddick (excellently played by Vin Diesel) has escaped and is sneaking around the wreckage. Soon however, they find that Riddick is the least of their worries, when one of the survivors, while digging a mass grave for the dead, is dragged underground by some nightmare creatures. Through their investigations, they find that the creatures cannot be exposed to light, so they stay mainly underground, you would think that a plan to simply stay in the constant sunlight provided by the three suns would be a good idea, right?Unfortunately, the find through use of a model of the solar system that they are within days of a total solar eclipse that happens once every 22 years, cutting them off from all the light. They work to get a rescue skiff ready for launch, but the eclipse is closer than you think. They fail to get the final component (some fuel cells) for lift-off out of the crash ship before darkness finally falls and the creatures come out.The movie is neatly divided into two parts: Before and after the eclipse. Before the eclipse is the setting up of the characters, the psychological Riddick and Johns (the bounty hunter) play with each other. How the characters are actually human, not your typical Sci Fi archetypes.After the eclipse, it becomes a battle for survival. Characters change into ruthless 'every-man-for-himself' types, quivering cowards, or true heroes. There is no true good guy, just an antihero and the rest trying to survive as they are picked off one by one.The ending is surprising and terrifying at the same time, and Riddicks cries of ""Not for me!"" will go with you long after the final credits have rolled.If you have the means and ability, get the unrated directors cut. it flashes out the characters a bit more, and you get a better feel for them.One of the great Sci Fi movies. Give it a 10.",Pitch Black
359,malmroes,Good movie which takes a new approach to the sci-fi genre,7,4 July 2008,"Even though this movie starts off with the usual: something goes wrong, spacecraft crashes, people are stranded etc. it still pulls off and introduces the viewer to some new ideas. Riddick is somewhat of a bad-ass convict and has modified his eyes so he is able to see in the dark which is a much sought after ability due to the situation the ship-crew and he gets in. The cutting in the movie is very good and emphasizes the mystique that shrouds around the anti-hero and male protagonist: ""Riddick."" The story in Pitch Black is, as already mentioned, to some extent very unoriginal and dissatisfied, but the clipping and cutting in the movie blended with some surprising elements which has been added to the story helps it to still support itself very well and one is afterward left behind with a hybrid feeling of satisfaction and hunger for more. Vin Diesel acts really well in the role as Riddick and even though his character is a hardcore, tough survivor he still takes morale decisions almost on the verge of good, but that does not mean his decisions do not turn in his favor at the very end... Why destroy an already perfect reputation? All in all this is a very good movie though not perfect. The story seems very unoriginal at the surface, but underneath it shines with enough originality to entertain. Some scenes has that wow factor while it as a whole is a bit better than average. It could maybe be described as a cult movie and it is definitely a recommendation for people who wants a spiced up sci-fi story blended with some minor psychological moments and an intriguing protagonist, namely Riddick.",Pitch Black
360,la-31,A unique pleasant surprise - highly recommended,7,12 January 2006,"I saw this on video - and was pleasantly surprised. The sci-fi/horror genre is very tired and trite - but this film managed to take a pretty standard premise and give it some interesting and creative twists. I also like the fact that the actors are not big stars (which obviously changed for Vin Diesel). Unique to have some Muslims in the future - what a concept. As a Muslim, I thought that was dope! This movie is far better than the sequel, the Chronicles of Riddick, which is visually more stunning and complicated, but absolutely lame in the plot department.What really makes this film unique is the alien/monster. Highly recommended.",Pitch Black
361,alex-brooks6,A good prequel.,8,17 October 2006,"I'll begin with a brief outline of the general storyline.A transport ship, known as the Hunter-Gratzner, while travelling through space, is hit by a sudden meteor shower, and is forced to crash-land upon a desert planet. A scorching-hot planet with three suns, no water and no apparent wildlife. Just barren rock for miles, and eternal light. The few survivors from the crash (a group of Muslim pilgrims on Hajj, a jump-pilot, a mercenary,a band of settlers, an alcoholic entrepreneur and an escaped convict) salvage what they can from the ship, now damaged beyond repair. During their explorations of their surroundings, they discover the planet is scheduled for an eclipse, where an orbiting planet crosses in front of the suns, casting the world into pitch-darkness. I won't spoil the rest for you.The surprising thing about this film is that it was produced under quite a tight budget and schedule, yet it yielded extremely good results publicly. Scoring no marks for unpredictability, yet 10/10 for originality, this movie introduced the deep and mysterious character of Riddick, and acts to fill in the background and history of this certain individual. Unlike its unplanned and extremely overrated sequel, this film earned Vin Diesel the reputation he deserves, along with its Director David Twohy.8/10 in my opinion.",Pitch Black
362,Xenophore,Just when they're about to lose you...,8,19 February 2000,"I went to see this movie with two friends of mine and was not sure what to expect. I got the feeling during the whole movie that, just when I thought, ""This could get cheesy really quick at this point,"" I was pleasantly surprised to find that it didn't. This could have been a really bad movie with very little effort, but, instead, it turned out to be a good, solid piece of work that kept me interested in what happened to the characters the whole time. Granted, there were a couple of characters that I hoped wouldn't die but did, but there were also a couple of characters I ended up hoping would get horribly eviscerated and, thankfully, they were. I'm confused as to how this movie gets called ""scary"" by some. Full of nasty, dangerous situations at practically every moment in the movie, yes, but scary? Anyway, it's definitely a movie worth seeing.",Pitch Black

This movie received lots of bad reviews, but I think they missed the intent.  This is not a deep thinking science fiction movie.  This is nice effects, cool looking creatures, good sound effects, and a pretty decent cast.  The acting is definitely carried by Vin Diesel; however, since the other characters are (at best) supporting characters - who cares.  If you want sci-fi high cinema, watch 2001.

Instead, it actually had some decent character development.  Although, I do admit that some of the characters were a bit transparent.

He has great lines and most importantly does a great job playing his character Riddick. Go see this one, certainly not the greatest Sci-Fi film, but definitely a good one.",Pitch Black

Good sci-fi films are few and far between. Naturally when the dvd was released I bought the director's unrated version since it supposedly contains 3 additional minutes. Bad choice. And not the case. For some reason Twohy decided to remove key scenes and portions of scenes in his cut that create a total lack of continuity. There is less gore, less action, less of everything that made the film one of my favorites. In this case, the R rated version delivers much much more.",Pitch Black
368,nickdove,"Magnificant, awe-inspiring, but by no means scary",7,15 August 2002,"*Spoiler Alert*The main review on the front of the DVD says ""...scary As Hell!"" Nothing could be farther from the truth. This movie has some excellent special effect, and the cinematography is supberb, but if you have seen Event Horizon, Sleepy Hollow, What Lies Beneath, etc. than this will be all about a great movie and no suspense. There are several rather disturbing scenes of a human being eaten alive by vicious bat-like creatures, and very computer-generated beings following them in the shadows, but it will scare only the weakest hearts. There is no more gore than the Mummy series.The story is magnificant, though not totally original. Several people taking a trip on a spaceship to some distant planet crash-land into a mysterious world where it only gets dark every once in a great while. It just happens to chance that they arrive just in time for the solar eclipse that provides the only darkness to the planet. Only then do they realize they are going to be eaten alive by an unknown yet terrifying (to them) breed of creatures that only comes out in the dark. This is where the movie gets good. Vin Deisel plays a very believable Richard B. Riddick, a convict being transported to another prison. Very similar to John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars. But the Similarities end there. Deisel, his eyes having been modified by an underground ""doctor"" in his previous prison, is the only one who is able to see the monsters. Everyone is forced to rely upon him to lead them to safety.The movie's script is a little wanting, but overall did a fair job of conveying the point. The humor is decent, with a few funny quips coming from a British passenger. This movie shows that sci-fi films can still be made without being overly geeky (Battlefield Earth, Wing Commander) and poorly acted. It shows that sci-fi films aren't all show and no story. It shows that films can give the effect of claustrophobia and intensity without being overly gory and grotesque.

And when the film was over..I had a tear in my eye..(which is uncommon for a film) but I am not gonna spoil anything.  I hear people say this film rips off ""Alien""..I DON'T THINK SO..""Pitch Black"" actually had characters in it and the monsters were at least seen in this film.

If you're a sci-fi fan who liked Alien, you should love it.  With the exception of the Matrix and Star Wars, science fiction just doesn't get any better than this.  Packed with tension and not completely predictable, I found it scary and not at all boring.  Clearly some deep thought went into the morphology and habits of the aliens.  The main human characters were more than one dimensional stereotypes, as you get peeks at details of their personalities that conflict with your first impressions of them.

However, while it may not be the most believable set of event the people in this film are very believable. Each individual character undergoes intense changes under the pressure of this alien situation. The exploration of how people act in survival situations is brilliant, and it provides a superb backdrop to the intense action that this film is full of. Its easy to call Pitch Black a dumb movie, because of the terrible sequels and the quick pace of the film. If you look closer though you can find a rich set of interactions with complex emotions being displayed. Its a lot more than what you might expect out of an sci fi action film, and still stands up as a classic in my books.

Although when watching through it I found myself very intrigued in hindsight the movie was quite shallow.Don't let that discourage you though, I have given the movie the rating of 7 for a reason. Vin Diesel is perfectly casted for his role and the mysterious man he plays really makes the film alot more interesting.The movie feels like an episode of Doctor Who, without the Doctor. I think it could very much pass as one. The movie is very Sci-Fi but still remains quite down to earth. It's sort of a double edged blade in that sense.All in all I really wanted more from the movie. There isn't really much at all to it. The things it does, it does really well.

I have two words for you: Vin Diesel.  Watch him -- he makes this movie more than just another stalk-and-slash exercise.  Some people are calling this ""Scream in Space,"" which I think is unfair.  I loved Scream, but I didn't find this movie to be jokey or littered with pop-culture references.

And why can't people just enjoy the darn flick?  People say the science is bad.  WRONG!  Gravity is what holds planets around a sun.  If the planets are dense enough or big enough and the suns are small or less dense, than they very well CAN rotate around planets! Nobody even mentions the glow-slugs later!  Of course it makes sense that on a planet like this evolution would create phosphorescence as a defense mechanism.  Lovely detail! And quit whining about contrived plots and ripoffs!  You CANNOT make a movie today without ripping something off! For everyone who called this movie a wannabe or compared it to Aliens or the Matrix, I hate to break it to you, but the critters from aliens were almost IDENTICAL to a critter in a novel called Voyage of the Space Beagle by AE van Vogt written at least 20 years before Alien came out.  Likewise, the Matrix was ripped off from an RPG called Shadowrun which was released in the mid 80's!  And yes, it seems a little hokey that they just happened to crash in the 22nd year when the darkness came, but you'll notice in Alien that out of the whole gigantic refinery ship, the creature just happened to hide in the little teeny-weeny lifeboat ship.  And the queen in Aliens just happened to hide in the one place where they couldn't get her without killing themselves  And finally as for those who say the characters are shallow. When was the last time you saw a character admit they did something stupid? (Fry crawling down the hole) or when survivors thanked the pilot for the extremely tough job she did of keeping some of them alive in the crash instead of ""oh, great babe! ya really screwed us over with that pro landing!""  And Riddick was still a nasty guy at the end, he was just starting to change and soften a little.  Kurt Russell overcame 35+ years of ironclad conditioning and mind control in just a few weeks in Soldier!  So everyone out there that keeps complaining about unreal this, and shallow that, save your money and watch ""The Real World"" on MTV.

That being said, it's also important to note that Pitch Black is still a very entertaining ride, even if you don't remember why you liked it after the film.This film, directed by David Twohy (The Arrival), has a very good concept but it is executed in a way that makes the film fall below what it should have been.  The film has an odd mix of trying to flesh out each and every one of the characters while trying to keep the momentum of the film going.  Suffice it to say, that doesn't work to well, at least not in the context of this film.Unfortunately I missed the first ten minutes of the movie, due to the fact that I was in line picking up a large soda, who knows those 10 minutes might affect my review, but I doubt it.  When I got into the theatre, the main vessel carrying the cast of this film had just crash-landed onto a barren planet and the passengers were just noticing their surroundings. It appears that the ship was carrying passengers to the ""New Civilization"" in addition to carrying a maximum prison escapee Richard B. Riddick (Vin Diesel), but because of the crash, everything is messed up.  The new captain, Fry (Radha Mitchell), is very unwilling to fulfil her newly appointed post, the officer that captured Riddick, Johns (Cole Hauser) is a hot-tempered morphine addict, and the aforementioned Riddick has escaped. Not soon after the crash, there is a huge twist.  One of the crew members goes to explore a suspicous cave, and gets killed by something that isn't human.  This begins to bring a whole new slant to things in the film and it introduces the nocturnal, carnivorous aliens.  Even worse, to benefit the nocturnal aliens and to horrify the crew members, it has been 22 years since the last eclipse on the planet, and therefore, its about time for another one.  From here on in everything goes crazy.  The aliens appear on the surface, an allegience (or is it?) with Riddick must be made, and something has to be done to get off the planet before everyone gets killed.I'll hand it to Twohy and Ken Wheat, the concept of the film is very good.  On the other hand the direction of Twohy is very lopsided, the first 20 minutes are trying to flesh out characters and setup the rest of the flim, but it is a series of bizarre shots and milling around.  From the first attack on, the film loses the look it had for the first twenty minutes and becomes a run of the mill action film, but with some very cool set pieces.  The same could be said for Wheat's screenplay, which is lopsided throughout the whole film, giving some excellent lines to the truly menacing Vin Diesel, or giving cornball one-liners to the various others.  The acting on the whole doesn't benefit the film either.  Radha Mitchell, last seen in the great Ally Sheedy film High Art, gives a performance that could be comparble to Sigourney Weaver's Ripley from the ""Alien"" films.  Cole Hauser, from Good Will Hunting, is the dark law official who gives the deepest performance of the film, but that isn't saying much.  Far and away, the best performance in the film is Vin Diesel's.  Well actually, it's really just the character that Vin plays that makes him standout, along with his gravelly voice and incredible strength.  All in all, Diesel's Riddick is one of the most indelible sci-fi characters in quite a while,possibly since Schwarzeneggers Terminator.My final say on this film is that it is recommended to someone who wants to be entertained by a movie that doesn't make one think that much, but to just witness explosions and violence.  I would say to catch this film at a matinee bargain price, but it could be enjoyed just the same if you waited for it to hit DVD or VHS.My Rating : 6/10",Pitch Black
386,superbu1,"Bad dialogue and acting, but good special effects!",4,3 December 2000,"My neighbor told me ""Pitch Black"" had been well reviewed, so we were both looking forward to it.  Within half an hour of the start of the film, after we'd both started snickering at the trite dialogue, unnecessarily flashy cinematography and editing, and mediocre to below average acting, he admitted he must have been thinking of a different film. ""Pitch Black"" feels like it was written by talented 18 year-old boys. While the plot is fairly complex, the characters are one-dimensional and cliched. Their motivations are sometimes incomprehensible, often engaging in the most irrational behavior simply to further a plot point.For example, when the villain of the piece is bound and gagged, he seems to be capable of talking people into coming within arm's reach of him -- people who are then surprised when he attacks them.  Ding-dong!And when two characters suddenly crawl out of their safe circle of fire and out into the dark, where they are attacked by the wild creatures that are chasing them -- why on EARTH would they do such a thing when they know their only safety is the light?  And the motivation for their doing so is SO WEAK as to seem contrived.  If you are surrounded by thousands of creatures nipping at your heels, and your only safety is the torches held by the rest of your group, there is NOTHING that would make you leave that group for even one second.  The stupidity of it all took me right out of the movie.The dialogue was... well, it WANTED to be clever.  But you could FEEL it trying to be so.There was also a definite lack of originality in some of the dialogue -- ""the 'company' wants us to do so and so"" seems to be lifted straight out of ""Alien.""  The tied up villain telling the female captain of the ship to ""come closer... closer..."" seems to be stolen from Hannibal's line to Clarece in ""Silence of the Lambs.""  The half-in-shadow lighting of the villain's bald head in the same scene, combined with his monotone mumblings, takes me right back to ""Apocalypse Now.""  Maybe this was supposed to be a ""tribute"" to these films.  My advice the filmmakers is to make their work good enough so other filmmakers will want to pay tribute to THEM.The one saving grace -- although it doesn't quite save the picture -- is the special effects, which really are well done.  The pterodactyl-like creatures are quite well executed and genuinely creepy, and they were the sole reason I did get somewhat involved toward the end of the picture.Had it not been for them, I would have given the picture 2 stars instead of the 4 I gave it.",Pitch Black
387,Scourgeofomnius,The glorious three percent,10,27 January 2007,"97% of all sci-fi is pure crap, but that 3% is what I live for. Pitch Black falls into the later grouping, and is one of the best sci-fi movies made. It's all about character or if convincing enough lack of character. Expecting the run-of-the-mill alien world survival story, I was very elated that it exceeding my expectations. Fry(Rhada Mitchelle) as a very self centered(you can't blame her) cargo pilot thrust into a position of authority wrongly accused of doing her best to save lives. Cole Hauser as a Bounty Hunter with no concern for anything but his cut and his drugs. Vin Diesel as a very cool and dangerous killer with little interest in anything else besides his survival. Vin Diesel is the highlight of this movie, with a complex character. He does an outstanding job and exceeds expectations. This was the role he was made for. Excellent movie for anyone-Except maybe little kids, but hell I probably would have loved this movie as a kid.",Pitch Black
388,Mumblyjoe83,Visually Creative and intense,10,21 June 2001,"I, surprisingly, truly enjoyed Pitch Black. It was an exciting, well-acted and visually impressive film. I was particularly impressed with newcomer Vin Diesel. His strength, both physically and in presence, carried the film in the few scenes without the monsters. Which brings me to another point: the monsters. Those just blew me away. They were truly intimidating, creativly designed, and well animated.

I've always thought his voice sounded cool ever since I saw Fast and the Furious. From when I found out he was as criminal, I thought the movie was going to be cliche. It was. It was very cliche and fate seemed to be against them at every turn. Black out every 22 years. Lucky them, they land on that day. Aliens can only be in the darkness, hey it's a solar eclipse. As much as I thought it was too easy and just a cliche, the movie pulled through and kicked major @ss. I even went out and bought a copy of Pitch Black after seeing it.

392,bridgesofsighs,"Interesting idea, poor execution",4,2 March 2018,"The premise of this movie had a lot of potential, but it didn't meet my expectations.The characters were either completely forgettable or annoying. Some of them died because of their stupid decisions as if the characters only existed to embody negative character traits. For example, two characters started fighting each other while being surrounded by aliens. Another character went crazy from fear and messed up the lights that were keeping the characters safe. I didn't feel scared at all, because I didn't care about what happened to the characters.In fact, I kept hoping someone would kill Riddick, because he was so unlikable. I feel like I'm missing an inside joke, because there are so many reviews praising him. He crashed the ship, killing most of the people on board. His lines were cheesy and edgy, his glasses looked silly, and his night-vision made him an obvious plot device. Even at the end he was still playing mind games with the female lead (whose name I forgot) and wanted to abandon the other survivors, showing that he hadn't got redeemed at all. The worst part is that his casual attitude made me feel like he was never in any danger. He was a male Mary Sue who had the plot revolving around him. Characters in horror movies shouldn't seem invulnerable.Also the planet didn't make any sense. Why would the dominant species on a planet that experiences constant day be scared of daylight? The planet didn't get enough eclipses to let the aliens come to the surface to hunt regularly. If they hunted all other species to extinction, what were they eating between the crash-landings? Each other? Then their population should be shrinking and not be so massive. The problem could have been fixed by giving the planet extremely long days followed by extremely long nights, like some real planets have.",Pitch Black
393,amurdock-59817,Ridiculous,3,7 September 2018,"Am I the only one who thought this was a ridiculous movie that is not even science based even though they call it sci-fi. A dominant species that never comes above the surface except once every 22 years? What did they feed on in between? I highly doubt a species evolved on a planet with 3 suns and stays underground, and there's not a species alive that can feed for 1 month then hibernate for 22 years. No. And no water? The only water on the planet comes from a man made machine. So these aliens dont need to drink anything apparantly. Also, a planet the size a Jupiter would have a HUGE gravity pull on this planet, making it more likely to be a moon not a planet. I felt like they threw every scientific principle out the window here and I hated this movie because of it. Give me one single plot point I can believe in the story!!",Pitch Black
394,kongstad,Tour de Force - Heart stopping action,9,19 December 2000,"The one thing you'll have to remember when seeing any kind of film, is just what kind of film you are seeing!This is a Science fiction / Horror movie, and my review is based on it being this genre. So Expect some of the characters to be a little one dimensional, and the script to contain a contradiction or two.All that aside ""Pitch Black"" is a very good movie!If you liked Alien (the first) you'll love Pitch Black. A cargo ship carrying 40 passengers crashes to a desert planet. In the crash a killer in the same weight class as Hannibal (if not in sophistication then certainly in blood lust) escapes. We soon see that he is the least of the survivors concern.The characters work well together. Our heroine seems a fragile little woman, but her dark side is exposed in the beginning of the movie. The killer is frightening, but his polished roughness brings to mind a feline, or almost feminine quality.The most refreshing about the movie is the lack of heroes. All characters have their heroic moments, but at the end there is not one individual who saved the day (and goes to sleep to awake in Alien # ?).All survivors are flawed and have failed in critical moments, which makes you love them even more!The script does lack a little originality, (you can't help to think about alien) and there are some Discrepancies which are just a little to big to swallow, so all in all I'll give it a 9/10My recommendation is : Rent it, steal, or go see it in a movie theater, if you like science fiction/horror movies!",Pitch Black

Cinematography is a real plus; and makes the locale very believable.You might find yourself questioning the basic eco-system of the planet. That seems to be hidden from our view, underground. . .   cause it sure isn't above ground.The cast kept my interest up, and although I hadn't seen them on film before, I'm positive I will see them again in the near future.  The suspense was well done. (Without the usual prolonged, ""walk-a-mile-down-the-hall-and-get-startled"" things.)  I also did not dwell on gore.

But the first time I say Pitch Black, it seemed familiar and the second time it clicked.  This was a story of personal redemption and spirituality.  Riddick admits early that he believes in God, but believes that God hates him.  He ridicules (Riddick??)the faith of the moslem crew members and taunts their suffering as evidence of God's absence.  His survival is paramount, but his increasing interest in Pilot Fry is balanced against her responsibility for the entire group of survivors.  He is willing to save her, but she is only willing to be saved, if all of the survivors can be saved. Riddick is drawn back into human society by Pilot Fry and ultimatly when she is drawn away at the moment of death he exhalts ""NO!, not for me!""  Her death, for the sake of the others, including him, causes him to realize that others are willing to die for him.  He becomes a human, and is 'saved' by her death.

It is a Science-Fiction film with elements of action and horror. With Vin Diesel in one of his best performances, David Twohy has achieved making it, in my opinion, one of the finest action movies of year 2000. Probably the biggest advantage of this film is it's original story and pretty cool visual effects. If you'are not expecting a master-piece, you might just like it.

Bah! What do they know.The opening sequence is simply great cinema. Like the recent Mission to Mars and Red Planet the space ship runs into a meteor shower in the first frame and must land on the nearby planet(this plot device I hereby declare off limits for the next ten years). Of the three films, Pitch Black handles this event by far the best. This is real exciting movie making reminiscent of the plane crash in Alive! or even the first twenty minutes of Saving Private Ryan. It's that good.The alien planet and the monsters have real punch. It's true that ecologically speaking both make no sense whatsoever, but you must overlook that little detail just like you overlooked all the extra water in Waterworld. Pitch Black is miles better than Waterworld.One of the joys of this film is that it stars mostly unknowns. It introduces the new star Vin Diesel. He is dynamite. He just oozes menace. In Waterworld the over exposed and ever so sensitive and sympathetic Kevin Costner tried to make us believe he could be cold and heartless. It didn't work. There is some internal resource that Costner lacks that mere acting can't simulate. In the old days Robert Mitchum could do menace. Robert De Niro has made a big career out of his small allocation of natural menace. Diesel is the real thing.This is essentially a 1950's style ""B"" movie made with state of the art special effects and excellent production values. Just great. A hoot.",Pitch Black

And that is exactly what I had in mind for Pitch Black when i bought it at Best Buy. I had never seen but I figured that i knew what i was in for when I saw that it only cost $9.99. So I picked up a copy, dragged it home, and thoroughly enjoyed the next hour and forty minutes. The beginning is a little thin and extremely circumstantial, but it is easy to get past that because with out it there would be no movie. Despite periodic inacuracies with lighting, the rest of the film works well and is consistant. Vin Diesel's acting is not terrible and he is one bad mofo too.

407,BooFez,I can't recommend Pitch Black enough!,10,2 April 2013,"The opening scene starts off action filled as we watch a cargo ship carrying a group of diverse passengers run through a meteor storm. Its all the assumed captain Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell) can do to try and land the ship in one piece. While the passengers gather their wits they learn they are stranded on a desert planet with a convict, Richard B. Riddick (Vin Diesel), a cop, Johns (Cole Hauser) and no water. After a death and a sighting they realize they are not alone on this planet and trying to find a way off becomes a priority. As the story unfolds they learn that every 22 years the planet goes through an everlasting darkness and as fate would have it, that time is now. The crew not only struggles with what the darkness brings but they struggle with themselves as they fight to survive, with their hero coming from an unlikely source.Every actor fit their respective characters to a ""T"". They portrayed exactly what director David Twohy was trying to get across. They each have their own little story surrounding them and integrated it into the flow of the movie spot on. The character development is so in tune with the events of the movie you feel a connection with the characters as they progress. You watch as they all start out as somebody but transform into somebody else at the end of the film. The cinematography and lighting throughout the movie is exceptional. The planet they are stranded on actually has three suns, each with their own set of colors mixed on the different pieces of scenery.Onto the aliens. They are original, creative, well designed for their environment and extremely ruthless. Their origin is unclear but their intentions are well known. They destroyed everything on the planet and are blood thirsty for more. Their mouth full of large teeth, ability to fly and movement/echo based vision easily put them at top of the food chain.Pitch Black quickly entered into my top 15 of favorite movies after viewing it.

He is massively calm  and he brought some complexity to his character.The lighting of the film was marvellous and created a sense of a real alien landscape, much better than the Paramount lots in the ""Star Trek"" movies.Mitchell was in ""Phone Booth"" and seems to be getting a lot of parts.

The decision whether to see a movie in the theatre orwait for VHS or DVD depends on personal priorities. In my opinion this is one to see in the theatre.

If they'd stick with the one against the aliens and develop it a bit more, I'm sure we'd see something A LOT better. The acting sucks, the effects blow, and the first 30 minutes lick. I have no idea how this got greenlighted and I have no clue why this didn't go straight to video. I advise you to wait for when it comes to primetime TV...

413,utica,straight up sci-fi actioner whose quality belies its meagre budget,10,11 January 2000,"Saw this movie at a preview screening last year.  I don't think is was the final cut, but pretty close to it.The basic scenario is quite familiar - a disparate group of space travellers is thrown together when their ship crash lands on a seemingly desolate planet whose barren exterior hides a nasty surprise.  However, this film has a gritty edge more reminiscent of independent ""cinema verite"" than the glossy coating applied to standard mainstream fare.  This ""down and dirty"" approach is if anything more evocative of Alien than any plot similarities. The dialogue is sparse and terse and generally manages to stay away from the cliches which so many other films in this genre seem so ready to embrace.The greatest strength of this film is its relatively unknown cast.  The anxiety of this group who don't know or like each other is palpable. Their grudging agreement to work together under the direction of Fry, the sole surviving ship's officer (played by Radha Mitchell) is borne of necessity and practicality - there is no attempt at ""chemistry"" here, just the believability of desperate people facing the facts.  The resolution of clashing personalities as the situation rapidly worsens forms the meat of the story and exposes the character's weaknesses and - more importantly - their true motivations. At the core of these revelations is the relationship between Fry and the convicted criminal Riddick (played with muscular vidour by Vin Diesel), everyone's survival will ultimately depend on whether these two can resolve their distrust of each other.The film is well crafted. The effects work is excellent but never obtrusive, serving the story well.  The cinematography adds a truely weird feel to the alien desert landscape.  For a film that in total cost around what Shwarzenegger gets for a single movie this is an impressive offering from director David Twohy.",Pitch Black

419,hkhor,Thumbs Up if you don't go in with too high an expectation.,8,23 February 2000,The Sci-fi Channel did not do this movie justice with their one hour promotional special of the movie. They gave away too much of the best scenes in the movie and they added information that is not in the movie that would mislead viewers' perceptions. The actual movie itself was a fairly entertaining package. Don't build up too high an expectation and you will enjoy yourself. I heard that the movie was made on a fairly low budget and I am glad to see for myself that you don't need big budget productions with big names to entertain people.,Pitch Black
420,sundejr,Is it as good as Aliens? Not quite but...,9,10 October 2000,"Okay, I've seen it four times and it's pretty clear to me that the persons making this movie didn't want comparisons to other movies.  So what happens? Same thing that happens to every movie that comes out, it's compared to the classics.  *sigh*  This is NOT Aliens by any means.  Sure, it has alien critters taking the cast out one at a time (the only comparison that it's fair to judge by) but these creatures aren't as menacing as the creatures from that movie.  These creatures are more like buzzards than calculating terror.  Anyhow, it's got a VERY UNIQUE feel to it and feels like two movies in one.  The first half is science fiction and the second half is horror. A rather pleasing aspect is the utter gloom I felt when the cast lost their daylight.  Very ominous, indeed.  But, to sum it up: Vin Diesel's character is an instant legend.  This character belongs in the same file folder with some of Arnie's and Sly's best personas.  The special effects and plot were fine.  The real joy really came from how ""old school"" this film felt, though.  This was a tribute to the pacing and predictability of some of the best movies in the genre, all while abstaining from directly ripping any of them off.  See this one with the lights off and the sound up for the full effect.",Pitch Black
421,Maria-77,Very Well Done!!!,10,22 October 2000,"In the late 1990's and early 2000's some movies had been made which seemed to try to imitate the greats of science fiction, Lost In Space and Supernova are just two examples of these poor copy-cats.Pitch Black just sitting there on the rental shelf seemed to have a dangerous chance of being one of these duds, but I took the risk anyway.  I am glad I did, because I was dead wrong.Pitch Black is one of the best sci-fi movies I have ever seen.  Combining great acting, great storyline, and great action, Pitch Black makes for a high quality, satisfying, non-cheesy, flick.  Cheesy being what so many sci-fi movies have come to be.Up-and-coming Vin Diesel as Riddick quietly steals the scene.  An escaped convict being taken back to the slam, Riddick begins the film with his narration, his cyro-sleep speech, if you will.  Diesel's deep, almost mysterious voice absolutely sucks you into the time and place, setting the stage beautifully.  And when he escapes after the crash landing, one thing everyone wanted to do was find him, not necessarily to meet him, but to lock him up again.  At one point our dear friend, Paris, is driven, for certain reasons, from his comfy lawn chair.  As he is talking to the others you suddenly notice that Riddick, unbeknownst to the others, is sitting in Paris's lawn chair, enjoying Paris's beverages.  It was Riddick who told Fry to look deeper in the hole for Zeek.  It was Riddick who had the simply spoken statements bringing what the others dared not think, to words (All you people are so scared of me, most days I would take that as a compliment, but it ain't me you gotta worry about now.)Fry was great.  A courageous young woman trying to, at all costs, get of the desert planet.  Her guilt for trying to drop the live cargo (namely human beings) to save her own skin is what motivates her to do everything in her power to save the survivors.Johns, who was taking Riddick back to the slam, was a flat out jerk, or as Riddick put it ""a blue eyed devil.""  He was meant to be a jerk, and boy was he ever, a well acted jerk at that.Shazza, Zeek, Paris, and the Middle Easterners were very well acted, as were all the above characters.  All of them well developed, well portrayed people.Don't get me started on the kid, Jack.  Jack tried too hard, but you will find Jack very interesting.The storyline held my attention, I didn't find a need to ask myself any questions as the video was rewinding.  The plot was airtight.The movie belonged to Vin Diesel, Fry or no Fry.  He didn't take over the movie, making the others appear miniscule, as could have easily been done. He was fantastic.  I do believe that he just might be the next Arnold, who didn't exactly play a Conan the Destroyer in his come-back movie, End of Days.  His character, Riddick, was very believable.  Gore was minimal in the rated version  What was there was not bad, granted it was gross.  A friend of mine, who has seen Alien numerous times, always starts watching it pretty early on in the evening, so she'll have time for the second movie she always needs on Alien nights just to go to sleep.  This is nothing like THAT.  The one scene that made me go all out and declare ""Oh yuck!"" was when, or rather how, Riddick escaped the second time.  Tied, hands behind back, to a pole that didn't quite reach the ceiling, there was only one means of escape.  Purposely dislocating, then relocating, his shoulders, I believe, up and over, he was free.  (Oh yuck!)The editing was beautifully done, quick, not dragging.  One minute you see Shazza staring at the general place in the hole where Zeek met his end, and where he no longer was, the next minute you see Riddick looking emotionlessly at Shazza, and the next minute you see Riddick racing away.Pitch Black is a GREAT movie!!!  Totally worth the rent, or buy, or whatever.  Just don't watch it in the pitch black.",Pitch Black
422,Ian Jones,Great film.,7,26 November 2000,"I though this was a great film, setting the atmosphere brilliantly by hardly showing the creatures until it was too late.Ok, some of the actors weren't too good, and the scientific aspects were a little dubious to say the least, but it's still a very scary movie that grips you from start to finish.Vin Diesel is very good in the lead role, showing that not every main character has to have impeccable moralities, and the special effects make the film even better (eg. Riddicks special vision and the view of the aliens).Not brilliant, but Hollywood does worse with 99 out of 100 films.  Hey - and I didn't even notice one piece of Americanized soppy pap!",Pitch Black
423,bwilcox,"Concept, Story, Execution",9,26 September 2001,"All of these elements make ""Pitch Black"" an extremely praiseworthy title. David Twohy takes a fairly formulaic but highly engaging script, and infuses it with a brilliance and energy that the cast does a fine job upholding. And speaking of our players, the headliner, Vin Diesel, is on the verge of superstardom -- there's too much charisma smoldering behind that rippling frame for him not to go on to bigger things.Notice I didn't say ""better"" in that last sentence. That's because it's going to take an awful lot to outstrip ""Pitch Black"" for style and substance. It's one hell of a way to spend a couple of hours.",Pitch Black

I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the Alien films or Red Planet, as it is a kind of cross between the two. David Twohy has definitely won back me as a fan after Waterworld!

425,punk_gee,New contender for booooooooring film of the century...,3,26 July 2004,"Wow. Where to begin?Awful. Terrible. Abominable. Deplorable. Depressing. Atrocious. Dire. Makes-you-want-to-gouge-out-your-own-eyes.None of these describe how bad this film was. Actually, that last one isn't far off. It also makes you want to eat the fecal matter of a dog, purely in the hope that you'll pass out and miss the remainder of the film. But that's not important right now.What is important is that anyone who has so far survived the horror that is watching Pitch Black needs to be warned of its terribleness, just in case someone tries to rope them into giving it a try. Be warned, this film is on a par with suicide. Okay, my first gripe with this 'film' - for lack of a better word - was Vin Diesel's 'acting' - for lack of a better word. Diesel played Riddick, your average meathead/murderer/rebel/loose cannon/outlaw character. A generic Hollywood schmoe, Riddick was a convict, whom the crew of a crashed ship had agreed to free on the condition that he helped them escape the strange, hostile planet. He sulks around like a bitch on her period, acting tough and spinning cheesy one-liners. Yawn.So, how much did this film want to be Alien? I score it 7/10 on the trying-to-be-like-Alien scale. I would give it full points, but the other three points were spent trying to be like Sphere. Man, this film just wanted to be every good sci-fi film, and instead just ended up recycling typical science fiction B-S. The writing was just lazy. I can only imagine the plot was conceived by people that still use crayons and think it's okay to bite people that steal play-time snacks. To writer/director David Twohy I say this...welcome to Yawnsville, population: You. Seriously, well done on making quite possibly the most boring and crap film I have ever seen. It takes real stupidity to make a film this bad, and boy, do you have stupidity in abundance. I salute you, sir.If generic, recycled, unimaginative, unoriginal, crap science-fiction (with no basis in scientific facts, but plenty of basis in fictitious nonsense) is your thing, then check out this movie.",Pitch Black
426,Homerspy,"A ""could have been great"" movie!",6,22 February 2000,"I went into this movie thinking that it was going to be a rather typical special effects sci-fi flick trying to get money without having to write much of a script.  To my surprise I was right for the most part, but there was something in the movie that made it a lot better than the regular no plot sci-fi movies. Usually I dont go to Sci-Fi movies for the direction but the way this movie was directed intrigued me.  The lighting was perfect, there were many cool shots and camera views, and great integration of special effects and characters.  Which brings me to the characters in the movie...they were great.  It would have been nice to get some more character development for most of them but the ones that did get some charcater development made terrific characters...and the actors did well playing their characters which helps.  Van Diesel especially...I'm sure we'll be hearing from him in many more movies in the coming years. So much potential in this movie that just didnt get used at all.  At the end it felt like it was just a bunch of stuff that happened.  I didnt see a point in it...nothing really tied in to anything else.  I gave it a weary 6/10 because it did intrigue me...and I suggest that if you really like Sci-Fi you should check it out.

Vin Diesel was terrific, as was the actress who played the pilot. The creatures were pretty good, if reminiscent of Alien with the wide carapace heads. The different lighting to show the three suns effects was clever. The use of music heightened the nail-biting suspense. I never could foresee who would get it next. I felt the aridness of the landscape and thought the costume department did a great job of dressing people like real people dress.It was a good escapist movie with a lot of clever and intriguing touches. Don't try to compare it with '2001' and you'll enjoy it just fine. Remember that when Terminator came out, Arnold was just another body builder doing muscle movies with grunts for dialogue.

She's quite cute, so the entire movie I was hoping she wouldn't become someone's dinner. As for Vin Diesel (Riddick), he plays a hardcore criminal who killed many people, but he looks and acts like a teddy bear. Someone you want your daughter to marry. That was a big minus, I think. Also, lots of profanity spoken by small kids. I was sort of offended by that. It wasn't as gross as in Bullworth, but still was absolutely unnecessary.

The story of this freight (space) craft that has a ""malfunction"" in deep space and crashes on an unfriendly, no, make that hostile, planet - leaving a couple of survivors stranded to fight it out with the ""restless natives"" - isn't very new. But the way it's told! Wow!The characters don't really grow too much during the movie's run time, but their hidden secrets/angst is well written into the various personalities that are tossed together at random after the crash landing. Some pretty good acting helps here as well.What really made this movie a 8/10 for me, was the pace, the cinematography, the editing and the breath taking visuals (CG and others). This movie is an example of making good use of small means - ""Pitch Black"" uses the desert planet to great effect, and the idea with the three suns is perfect. Not to mention the wonderfully aggressive monsters...It's also eventually the success of the truly collaborative (and creative!) effort by all the involved people, from director Twohy and on.

Extremely weak performances by much of the cast, excluding Vin Deisel (who portrays Rennick, a notorious convict)leave much to be desired.

Superb action, outstanding photography and great actors - and tension, tension and tension for one and a half hours. Vin Diesel id undeniably the central figure of the movie and plays his part as it is written in the book for a runaway prisoner. Yes, it is similar to the Alien series but the climax of the movie is different: the hero here proves sooner that he is able to cope with the seemingly invincible mutant creatures that eases the tension and gives the audience a final relief and faith that all will come to a happy end after all.",Pitch Black

I haven't seen that since ... actually, I've never seen that ever, unless you count embarrassing high school ""Now You Have Become A Woman"" movies.Also, Vin Diesel has never been hotter. Call me shallow, but those arms make me (when I'm not actually menstruating) (ok, I lie, pretty much all the time) those arms make me go squee. I'm only human.Anyhoo, I'm sure that there are people who will compare this movie to Alien, but really, it's completely different, and it's well worth seeing if you enjoy the SF thriller genre, or, indeed, if you just enjoy your basic thriller that's well paced, has hot guys, chicks who kick arse.One small criticism: I felt that it was a little bit anti-Australian.

Unlike a ""Final Destination"" movie where you know they are going to get killed off and you know who will live. I like how the move doesn't tell you anything about what really is going on in the future, which make it easier to watch. If they had told us the year, the place and if aliens life had been found yet then it would have been harder to take in.Riddick is rather a show off at the start of the film when he sneakily hides behind a bone and comes right up close to Fry without her knowing just to cut of a bit of hair. Also when he steals the seat from Paris (Lewis Fitz-Gerald) and drinks his drink.The aliens in the film are quite amazing in the way they look and they way they move.

The actors all do great, especially Vin Diesel who completely captures the screen with his confident act, he is full of the good old fashion attitude we have only seen so often, the only one I have seen displaying this kind of attitude is Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator. Diesel is fed with lines which are on the borderline of being cliches but he makes them pure bad-ass. I have also seen Keith David before as an extra in like a gasillion movies. What impressed me also very much about this movie was the use of colors and the lighting.

I wasn't about to pay $7 bucks to go see what would probably end up being a campy sci-fi flick with cheap effects and bad acting.All I can say is WOW! This is the kind of movie that I plan on buying. Pitch Black was from being the cheesefest I expected from a film I had heard very few positive things about and starred people I knew next to the nothing about.The effects were above-par although the aliens looked strongly influenced by the all-famous Aliens. Nevertheless their movements were realistic and creepy.Despite a plot which could have been summarized in a single sentence, the character development and strength of acting was superb. One of the things I found the most visually pleasing (besides Vin Diesel - yum!) was the hue and contrast of the terrain. Turning what would be a normal ""rocky desert"" scene into something that looked truly off-world and baked bones under the triple heat of its suns.I'm very pleased that I wandered into the movie and was treated to such a gem that I feel this film has redeemed my opinion of Hollywood's recent sci-fi flicks since seeing that waste of film, Wing Commander.",Pitch Black
452,Tiger-71,"Eh, it could have been much better..",7,19 February 2000,"I've seen sci-fi thrillers and I personally thought this one was at the bottom of my list. Yes the acting was great, the animation was great, but certain parts of the movie could have been different.A quick summary: the crew of a huge ship suddenly awakes to find that their ship is going hay-wire. After trying their best to land the ship, the ship crash lands on a seemingly deserted planet. However, as the plot unfolds, they find that they're only real danger is the darkness which is like day time for the evil aliens that live on the planet.My, it sounds like wonderful right? Not entierly true. As the plot unfolds more and more, you only learn about the escaped convict which they rely on to escape. Everyone else, it takes you almost half the movie to learn their name. Some of the characters I didn't even know until the credits rolled by. It gave you no background on the characters except for the ""cop"" and the ""bad guy."" Everyone else is hard to get attached to except for the main character, Fry.Of course, the whole crew of the ship relies on the macho ""bad guy"" to get off the planet. He figures out everything, everyone else follows him almost without questioning him. The characters don't think for themselves except for the very beginning where they are forced to make a choice without him.Well, ""Scariest Sci-Fi Movie of the Year?"" Not really. Although one part made me jump, others made me nervous, and the simply amazing music (no sarcasm there folks ; )) tries to tie it all together it simply doesn't seem to work. I think because of how short the movie seemed, they never had time to build you up as you went through the movie. Perhaps they could have made it so that it goes between night and day and the characters slowly get picked off rather than having a few hours of an eclipse every 22 years. They could have made this movie a lot better.The ending, I hated, because of what the writer of the movie did to a certain main character. If you saw the movie you know what I'm talking about. I hated that part. When movies do that to me, they drop down a few points on my, ""List of best movies"" list.Overall, it was a fine movie. It was not in the least scary. I am a four-teen year old and guess what. I could have fallen asleep if my care for what would happen to the characters did not keep me awake. Do not expect this movie to be a nail-biter. Do not expect that what you think the movie is about, that is what it is about. It isn't. Would I recommend it? Yes...but from there you have to tell me your opinion. 7 of 10 stars.",Pitch Black

Some of the effects were very innovative, the cinemotagraphy was creative and unlike  anything I've ever seen. However, there were major holes in the plot, major errors, some of the actors were horrible, and it was a complete ripoff of ""Alien"". If you enjoy watching blonde, blue-eyed model-looking women scamper around in outfits that look like they're getting ready to go dancing at a club, you'll like this movie. There were parts of the movie where it was supposed to be completely dark, (like the title) and yet you could see light on the horizon, or there would be overhead lights coming from nowhere.

I have no problem suspending disbelief on Sci-Fi movies, but that goes only so far. There are a few things that made this movie really lame. First of all, they crash-land on a planet with three suns. This is simply impossible. If a planet orbited three suns, it would have one hell of a bizzarre looking orbit, not to mention some really screwed up gravity. Second, let's not even get into the odds of a nitrogen-based atmosphere way out in the galactical boonies. In other words, how could they breathe? Finally, I loved the wonderful ""Soylent-Green""-esque camera tinting. Please, hollywood, or wherever these half-baked movies come from, stop.

The photography/effects were interesting at times, but most of the time it seemed to be there just to say ""we're so cool, we can shake our camera and do flash edits!""  The worst part of the movie was the writing.  Every single piece of ""dialog"" was an idiotic one-liner.  The characters were one-dimensional, and some of them were even less.  The Muslim kids served no purpose except to act as ""red shirts"".This is a movie that had it been well written and shot with a little more restraint, could have been up there as one of the best sci-fi movies.

Even the opening scene becomes striking in its unique beauty as you see the ship moving towards the trail of the comet which will lead our friends into disaster and shipwreck them on the alien-infested planet.Radha Mitchell is a magnificent star, with the beauty to make you underestimate her and the acting and kick-butt ability to make her seem both strong enough to drive our characters to salvation yet fragile enough to make you wonder if she can pull it off.Vin Diesel has a reputation as an egomaniac, but after this film you'll wonder if it isn't deserved. He has the strength (both the physical and the onscreen presence) to carry this film alone though I'm glad we still get to enjoy the great ensemble around him.Thanks to great writing, the main characters never remain the way you expect them too. Before we know her as the hero, Radha is willing to sacrifice the lives of everyone to save her hide. When you believe Diesel, though a psychotic killer, at least has a sense of honor, the director pulls a fast one there, too.And though this movie, like many others, begs you to scream ""Run!"" to the characters on the screen... well, that isn't always such a good idea either, even in Hollywood.Pitch Black gives you just enough look at the aliens to know you don't want to mess with them.

Aliens fits this profile with utmost excellence.  Begin by incorporating all positive aspects of Aliens.  The cinematography, the cast, the excellent special effects, everything.  Next, take all that away. Take the worst 5 minutes of Dunston Checks In, noteably, the bathtub scene.

461,sweatm,Amazing,10,21 February 2000,"After walking out of the film, I had the feeling that followed first viewings of films such as ""The Matrix"", ""Dark City"", or ""Aliens"".  Yes this is a formula film, in its most basic overview. People are trapped in a confined location, not able to get help, and must survive attacks by an alien force.Though the plot is formulaic, the execution is anything but. The first 10 minutes of the movie, as many have pointed out, is a sensory overload. You feel the excitement and confusion that would result from a crash landing of this nature.In the time before the blackout, the director makes great use of lighting, filters, and wide angled lenses to portray the desolation of the desert. I never thought that watching a movie could actually make me feel the heat of a desert. This is probably the best use of color and lighting I have ever seen. (Plus, it is somewhat ironic that this has some of the brightest scenes ever filmed, and the movie is called Pitch Black)The characters are great too.  The team is filled with anti-heroes. They are not the people you would expect in a blockbuster film, but are similar to people you might meet in real life. Also, the choice to not use marquee actors and actresses makes the characters that much more believable.",Pitch Black

I was angry because I chose between seeing this movie and The Whole Nine Yards, and without seeing The Whole Nine Yards, I know I made the wrong choice.  Anyways, the movie starts off ok, and I was able to ""suspend"" my disbelief that anybody would survive the nasty crash they had, and all the other stuff that you just have to go with.  And for a while, it had me going.  There are really some great visuals in this movie, and if you are an effects buff, you might actually want to pay money to see it.
----Whoever planned this movie must have thought they had a winner, and I can see why.  The visuals were awesome.  The basic plot has a couple of good themes (the animals are cannibalistic, which kind of reminds you of the humans - also there is kind of a question of whether the characters, or humans in general, are good at heart or not), 2 pretty decent characters (the ""pilot"" and the criminal).  So, the plan was there.  The execution was just flat out awful.----All this movie needed was someone to write dialogue, which really is what defines a movie.  Some of the lines are just so awful you can sometimes see the actors force them out of their mouth against their own will. Riddick has a line at the end that is pretty much the line Eddie Murphy was searching for in ""Bowfinger.""  It's supposed to be like Arnold saying ""I'll be back,"" but I hope to never see this guy again.----The specific plot is pretty bad as well.  There are always some characters that you know are going to die in movies, but just once I would like to see the ""British antique collector"" character not act like an idiot who deserves to die.----This movie had so much potential to be an excellent movie, but when the writers got down and dirty they came up empty, and they really missed the boat.  The effects do save this movie from being a complete flop - they are some of the best I have ever seen.

It is pretty rare that this happens to me though.Maybe that's why I liked Pitch Black so much even though the acting was sub-par, it was a little corny and farfetched at some points, and the plot was kind of dumb (a lot like Tremors).It was the visual affects that got me. They were great! Pitch Black has been compared to Matrix in that respect, and you'll find out why once you check out the film which I strongly suggest that you do.

There were, of course, a couple of cheesy lines, but I think that's kind of tradition in horror and sci-fi flicks now anyway, isn't it?  Other than that, the special effects were, no doubt, superb and the cinematography and camera angles were fabulous.  The beginning starts out the way I think ALL sci-fi movies should start out.  PURE ACTION!  I can see how some people MAY not like this movie, but I can also say that I thought it was excellent.  I know it's sometimes hard to go by what other people say because everyone has different tastes, but if you are un-sure, then at least go to see it at the discount theater. I don't think it will be AS good if you wait for video, but you won't be disappointed either.  I just think this is definitely a big screen movie. Vin Diesel is going to be big (as an actor).

Unfortunately, despite an intriguing story line, I have to say it came up short in my estimation.I guess I expected more suspense, more white-knuckled moments, but they were few and far between.  The visuals and graphics were good.  The monsters were quite believable and realistic.  I didn't think the characters were especially well-developed, however.  I didn't find Radha Mitchell's character, Fry, especially captivating.  Keith David was wasted in his role, and I felt nothing for most of the rest of the characters; in fact, we knew their fates..  Vin Diesel was certainly the best of the lot and he portrayed the criminal Riddick fairly well.My biggest complaint was all the ambient light during the eclipse.  I was expecting virtual darkness and there was far too much light in certain sequences toward the end of the film.  Obviously, from a visual standpoint, you can't have total darkness, but give me a little bit more -- it would heighten the apprehension and terror.  But it was to the extent where if their lights went out, they could still see..  If that's the case, at least show a moon or something to indicate that's what's happening.In all, some parts of the movie were good, but with the expectations I had for this film, I was left feeling a bit disappointed at the end..",Pitch Black

Make your own Pitch Black!Ingredients: 1 blanket, 1 flashlight, 1 pair of swimming goggles, 1 disgusting plastic cockroach that shines in the dark, 1 large popcorn and a coke.The making process: Get under blanket, pretend that you're five and you're hiding from aliens.Turn on the flashlight and put on the goggles. Spend 1 hour and 58 minutes of boring quality time with yourself.Eat the popcorn and take a zip from the coke.After precisely 1 hour and 59 minutes  turn off the flashlight.Wave the cockroach in the air and make scary noises. Take the goggles off, finish the coke and go home you sick pervert!Now, if you didn't understand any of the above it means that you belong to the large group of people which have a life and were fortunate enough to miss this abomination called: Pitch Black.Two major rights were violated during the making of this movie: first the basic human rights of the viewers who had to put up with two hours of this c**p, and various Copy Rights.Pitch Black is an obvious rip off from two major science fiction sources, Isaac Asimov and the 'Alien' series. The idea of a destruction which comes on a planet in cycles of a few years, every time an eclipse takes place, is a shameless rip off from Isaac Asimov's famous book 'Nightfall'.The stranded spaceship, the crew who finds a deserted colony on the planet, the presence of dangerous people on the crew and the endless wondering whether they are trust worthy or not - all this bear a close resemblance to the 'Alien' series.In spite of all the great stolen ideas in it, Pitch Black is still a bad movie. There is no backbone to the story. They just crash on the planet and immediately they begin their rescue. Not much dialogs either, you could probably watch the movie silenced and still understand a great deal.The main theme of confusing between light and darkness and between good and and evil is emphasized in the sudden change of roles between the 'law enforcing' man and the dangerous murderer. Yet instead of adding depth to the movie it lacks reliability and something called 'acting', and ends up adding nothing more than the element of surprise to the movie.Of course one could claim that since this is a horror movie that is exactly what its makers wanted to achieve. But it's very clear when you watch the movie that Pitch Black was intended to be a cross between Science Fiction and a horror/thriller.

The opening scenes instantly gave me a bad vibe about this film - o.k it is a low budget film but that doesn't  stop it from being good - but the ham acting and bad dialogue does.  This film also tries to win the audience with some badly thought out humour which wasn't close to being witty or sharp.  Allright I hear you say it's just a sci-fi movie but it could have been so much better - what seemed a good idea (spaceship crashing on an unknown planet with several survivors trying to re-launch before the planets 3 suns eclipse and unleash winged beasts who only come out in this period of darkness to kill and destroy etc ), this film tried to play with this idea and failed.  I felt cheated by seeing the trailer before-hand, which showed probably the best clip which lasted 30 seconds (honestly), and had to suffer the remaining 1hr 29 minutes and 30 seconds.  The characters I found laughable; the convict (wanted for murder - which by the way is glorified sadly throughout the movie) who is bad-guy turned good-guy , the English antique dealer ???? (thats what I thought!!), the totally unconvincing captain of the ship - I could go on but I'm not going to.  I honestly am a big sci-fi fan but I would class this as a straight to video release from the eighties ( YES that bad!!) and find the only thing  frightening about it is how this movie has become so successful. The special effects are rubbish and look like  rejects from the Starship Troopers studio and that along with a pathetic script ruins what seemed to be a pretty good idea.

However, when you dig a little deeper, you can see that there's a lot more to this film than appears at first glance. Pitch Black is a story about humanity itself. It shows us one of the truest glances into the depths of human nature we've ever been given in popular culture: when people are pushed to their limits, there's nothing that won't do to survive, but they will *only* survive if they work together. Though the plot is a little lacking (and a bit cheesy at times), the filmography is wonderful. The cameras are used in much the same way as a master artist uses their brush - as a means to make the viewer see what was going on in their head. Pitch Black's camera styles range from jerky, blurred action shots - often shooting back and forth between the eyes of two people - to sharply-contrasted color-toned shots of the harsh desert climate. The movie is, quite simply put, beautiful. I give Pitch Black a solid ten out of ten. Not only is it one of my personal favorites, but it's an excellent film as well.",Pitch Black

In the previous years, I was repeatedly disappointed by all the lame sci-fi movies (Ex: STARSHIP TROOPERS) and thought that this movie wouldn't be any different. But to plainly put it: This movie freaked me out... in a good way. I wasn't aware that I was still afraid of the dark till I watched this movie; I must have buried my fear in the back of my subconscious when I was a kid and it rightfully deserves to stay there.The alien creatures sent shivers up my spine; the individual(s) who designed them have a twisted but brilliant and creative imagination to come up with something so impressive and grotesque. I loved how the writers gave each main character a history and showed their flaws and strengths without much confusion.Riddick's (Vin Diesel) gift for escaping out of any impossible situation and putting up a hell of a fight was jaw dropping. At first, you figure him out to be a coldly intelligent villain but in some brief moments, you can see something humane behind his animal side. But as soon you discover it, he does something maliciously devious. He certainly keeps you guessing right up to the very end. I didn't know whether to despise or admire him... he's definitely a love/hate type of character.Johns (Cole Hauser) was a perfect example of a character that puts up a good front but through a need for greed, shows his real intentions and what he's willing to do to survive. John's knack for knowing what buttons to push and the right words to say makes him as devious as Riddick.Fry (Radha Mitchell) is a character who, as Johns so nicely expressed, looked to her thine own ass first before considering the consequences. But what's endearing about her is that she quickly realizes the errors of her ways and tries desperately to pay penance, even while endangering her life when others discarded all human values and went for the dark hills running.Jack (Rhiana Griffith) simply wanted to have a hero and was the first one out of the whole group to look for that hero in Riddick; through a child's eye, good can be seen through the thick clouds of evil. I thought it was absolutely priceless when Jack shaves his head in ode to Riddick; you know what they say: Imitation is the best form of flattery.Imam (Keith David), like Jack, has the ability to see good in any evil. He uses philosophy to carry him through the hardships that he meets and when time permits, he rationally grieves his losses and then soldiers on. In a way, he served as a morale booster for the survivors even though most of the characters acted as though they weren't listening.The casting for this movie was positively perfect. Each actor shined brightly in their role and their talents blended wonderfully on-screen.This movie may have had a small budget but the director's leadership and the actor's performances made the movie work and allowed the audience to use their imagination instead of letting some outrageously expensive Special Effects do all the work for them. This movie is a definite Sci-Fi classic. Watch it and judge (with an open mind) for yourself. It will be well worth it.",Pitch Black
484,ghostingthevoid,A Most Perfect Movie,10,9 March 2017,"Vin Diesel's best movie past and present, no refutation required. He is not a great actor but this movie was his to own and he did. All the actors did their parts to perfection, but this was a diesel powered vehicle.ANY person who gave this less than 7 out 10, truly does not understand great movie-making and should be ignored. They do not understand the subtleties of the script and direction, or the nuances of acting. It builds, it teases, then it executes. In my estimation it was more worthy of an Oscar than Babel and so many other worthless and forgotten titles. Seriously, I can't remember any others and I can only remember Babel because it was so boring and bad, and I watched it, which is time I cannot get back.This movie only has one flaw that I will not mention, because lefties will have a fit, but other than that, enjoy and appreciate this fine film.",Pitch Black

THIS MOVIE WAS ONE OF THE WORST I HAVE SEEN FOR A LONG TIME I LEFT HALF - WAY THROUGH AS IT WAS JUST SO TIRESOME.WHOEVER TOLD VIN DIESEL THAT HE COULD ACT WERE LYING.The film was slow and did not keep me interested at all.I very much enjoy Sci-fi films but this was not one of them and it shouldn't even be getting a 1 out of ten but a minus 10. I don't know how it went on at the box office but I waited for it to come out on DVD and glad that I did as I would have been gutted if I would have had to pay to get into the cinema and watch this utter rubbish.,Pitch Black
486,dr_coma,Lights Out on Pitch Black,6,19 February 2000,"After reading a few of the comments made by people who'd seen advance screenings of this film, I had a glimmer of hope that Pitch Black might be decent enough to recommend.  Well, that hope waned considerably thirty minutes into the film and disappeared altogether before it was even half over.  I have no idea why this film was released in its current state.  It has an annoyingly unfinished quality about it, and comes off looking more like an extended trailer than a finished product.The premise of Pitch Black is as basic and linear as you can get, which is actually a good thing because a more complex storyline is too restrictive for this kind of film.  What we have are a group of crash survivors stranded on a barren planet who must now find another way home.  Their dilemma is compounded by an untimely total eclipse, which releases legions of hideous nocturnal aliens from beneath the surface of the planet.  Now, this situation could (or rather should) make for some real suspense, but Pitch Black fails to mine it to its full potential and consequently the scare factor goes way down.The acting in this film is mediocre at best.  Since most of the characters are expendable (ie: bait) they are pretty much spared any characterization. Personally I don't care for this.  It would be much more effective, I feel, to have a well-developed character or two die than half a dozen static ones. Sure it takes a lot more work to write this kind of script, but the result would be far more rewarding.  As for Vin Diesel being such a good actor in Pitch Black, anyone could play Riddick's character and stand out simply because his is the only one that's fleshed out to any degree.As for the special effects in Pitch Black, they are strangely minimalistic for this type of film.  The creatures are pseudo-Giger and ultimately very unscary for we don't really get to see them until the very end, and even then it's more of a prolonged glimpse than anything.  The only effect that really impressed me in this film was the actual eclipse, with the hordes of aliens erupting from their subterranean lair against the backdrop of fading light.  Very cool.  But overall, the effects were nothing to scream about.
So I left Pitch Black disappointed.  And so did the people sitting around me.  I overheard one of them mutter, ""I knew I should have gone to see the Boiler Room instead.""",Pitch Black
487,goose-35,Very original and very good!,8,19 February 2000,All the actions scenes were broken up into random split second scenes so you couldn't really see what was going on. I found that a little disappointing. The characters were ok and predicatable (except for one part in the end which got me by suprise) but the story itself was definately something different. I would definately recommend the 8 bucks to go see this in the theater!!,Pitch Black
488,Puff Master,Totally worth seeing!,9,19 February 2000,"I watched Pitch Black yesterday and it was great!  I thought it would be just some low budget sci-fi flick, but I was totally wrong.  It was downright freaky with those alien creatures.  The characters in the movie were well developed and there were so many great one-liners.  It is really worth seeing if you like sci-fi or action.",Pitch Black
489,racerx-9,no need to see this movie...,3,26 February 2000,"...if you've seen the following:  Alien, Silence of the Lambs, and Boys Don't Cry.  Pitch Black takes elements from each of these films and combines them with poor acting, a horrible screenplay, a stupid storyline, and cool special effects.  It was also too long, and not gory enough for a movie with killer aliens as an integral part of the plot.  If you need a sci-fi/horror fix rent the Alien series on DVD, dont waste your time with Pitch Black.",Pitch Black
490,SFMC-2,"""Scary movie"" ain't the half of it.",10,25 February 2000,"Trying to outdo any or all of the Alien trilogy is a daunting task for any movie. Pitch Black takes a different tack, spinning the underlying mythform into a fresh, sexy thriller that leaves you reeling from moment to moment.The most spectacular success of Pitch Black is the cinematography. Clear, superbright shots of the band of survivors are intercut with cool, danger-filled shadowy caves and buildings, and the pervasive heat and light is so perfectly captured by David Eggby you can feel yourself sweat in sympathy.David Twohy makes deft use of a time-honored thriller/horror movie technique: hiding the killers as much as possible to heighten the eventual terror of seeing them revealed. In Pitch Black, the killers are huge, nearly silent aliens which hunt the darkness with sonar (another brilliantly translated visual by Twohy and Eggby).Unlike the usual Sci/Fi fodder, Pitch Black's band of heroes are effectively weaponless, unskilled, and burdened by a host of liabilities, not least of which is the oncoming total eclipse and an escaped murderer in their midst. They rally as best they can, given the massively stacked odds against them, but real triumph of the movie comes not at the climax, but short seconds before, when the (uneaten) characters' development becomes fully realized. This is a movie not about spacers, nor terrible aliens, but about the horrible decisions we all make and their even more horrific consequences. For all its stunning beauty, the setting and circumstances are almost trifling next to the astounding acting and conviction of the cast.Some of the best acting comes from Radha Mitchell and Vin Diesel, as Fry and Riddick, respectively. Fry, a cargo pilot, third in command, has leadership thrust upon her after a devastating accident and crash leaves her ship scattered over a mile-long track of debris. Riddick, an escaped criminal, escapes from his confines during the crash, and proceeds to wreak havoc with the other survivors until he is captured and pressed into service as an equal by his jailer, a mercenary named Johns. Mitchell and Diesel are utterly believable in their roles, one a ragged but determined savior, the other a bemused and savage killer. Diesel is particularly enjoyable to watch as he plays the quintessential evil villain to the hilt, terrorizing the others until the discovery of the more deadly and savage resident monsters. After that, he's merely the most bad-ass human being on the planet, a role Riddick seems to enjoy.Sadly, the bulk of the cast fades into the background (or is killed messily) within the first half hour, and the audience can't really begin to care about the remaining characters until the final minutes of the film. This distancing works magnificently with the storyline which builds the action to an intolerably tense level before releasing the audience's tension in a brutal and gory climax. The point at which you begin to want the characters to live, their lives become inordinately imperiled. It's an elegant blend, and the cast is clearly up for the challenge.See Pitch Black before it leaves theaters...it's too big a movie to appreciate on a television.",Pitch Black
491,Skew-2,Same Old Same Old,6,19 February 2000,"Pitch Black reminded me of Aliens for some reason.  The creatures have the same look.  It had nothing that was spectacularly new.  Pitch Black has the same tired, predictable science fiction plot.  I had some friends that liked it but I guess I've seen better.  The movie, however, was well directed but gaps in the plot made me lose interest.  It's okay for a movie to be unrealistic because that's what makes a movie good in most cases.  On the other hand, if a movie states criteria early on about certain unrealistic things, then later on breaks that criteria, then the movie loses credibility.  It's not a total loss though.  If you've been really looking forward to seeing Pitch Black and you like Sci-Fi then I say, ""GO."" Otherwise, think twice about spending the hard earned cash.",Pitch Black
492,omega-22,A good hearted Sci Fi film,10,16 June 1999,"I just came from a free screening of this film and I must say I was pleased with it. It's a story about a ship transporting people to a distant planet. Just to tell you of some of the characters there's a convicted killer, a bounty hunter, the ships captain, a kid, ect. Well the ship gets into trouble and is forced to crash land on a dead wasteland of a planet which has three suns and no night. After the character introductions (which I'm not going into because there's too many and their pretty deep characters which you can't explain that easy) one of them is killed by these strange underground creatures. They learn that the creatures can only survive in darkness and figure that as long as they stay out in the eternal day of this planet their safe. Well they thought wrong. Soon they discover a mining facility that is deserted. They find out that everybody in this place was killed by those underground things. To make matters worse they also find out that an eclipse is coming and is going to cover the planet in complete darkness. Well, it does, and thousands, yes, thousands of these very scary and violent creatures take to the sky and start to hunt them down. Do they survive or do they perish? I'll just say that it's worth the price of admission to find out. There's great characters, super special effects and a great story in this film that will make it a sure hit.",Pitch Black
493,curved,About as good as sci-fi can get now that the genre is getting crusty.,8,5 June 2000,"I have heard so many people say ""I didn't want to see this,"" or ""I had low expectations..."" But I have a different outlook when it comes to sci-fi films. Yes, most are boring pap, and, yes, most aren't worth the time or the money, but I can still hope, can't I?!Director Dave Twohy's The Arrival is certainly one of my favorite sci-fi/conspiracy films ever made. Interesting direction, a great, tight script, and good acting (yes, you heard me: Charlie Sheen does a good job!) put it way over the top. So it disappointed me that it didn't do so well at the box office. Twohy's back in the director's chair again (although with Nightmare on Elm Street 3 scribes the Wheat brothers this time.) I placed high expectations on Pitch Black after seeing one TV spot; after hearing Twohy's name, I knew it would be great. I wasn't disappointed!The premise is as follows: a ship full of people in deep-freeze (including one cunning, violent criminal,) are being transported through space. After crash landing on a strange planet, the tension builds. I know it doesn't sound too engaging, but it is. Upon landing, murderer Riddick (played wonderfully diabolically by Vin Diesel) escapes. The crew finds that they have even larger problems to deal with when the three suns of the planet go through an almost month-long eclipse and seemingly nocturnal alien predators come out to play.As I mentioned before, I really liked Twohy's direction in The Arrival. But it looks childish compared to the techniques in Pitch Black. The three aforementioned suns are different colours and, depending on where the camera is facing, so is the film tint. Twohy also gets some rather good performances out of Vin Diesel and Radha Mitchell (Fry). I had never heard of Mitchell before Pitch Black and came straight home to look her up here on the IMDB. I was surprised to find out that she was the naive-yet-grown-up first time lesbian Syd in High Art; what a stretch! She's great in High Art being the uneducated underdog, and seems comfortable and natural in Pitch Black as the take-charge Fry. But we don't care about sci-fi films for the acting, do we?The Wheat Brothers' script is well-realized and adds a small but welcome plot twist near the end. You will expect certain characters to die and you will probably be wrong since the film is more worried with getting the protagonists off of the planet than with what ""type"" to kill off in order. The film also has a wonderful, surprise climax that, in my opinion, turns these annoying Alien comparisons on their head (really, the men do most of the fighting, not the in-charge woman.)Certainly, the sci-fi genre is running shallow. With the exception of The Matrix, it's getting to be about as fun as playing with a used condom. And there are certainly many Alien (or Aliens) clones, but I don't believe that Pitch Black is one of them. It may have a strong female lead, a good, cohesive script, and excellent direction like Alien, but it still holds up as rather fresh and individual. And if you don't walk away with a crush on Radha Mitchell, than there's something VERY wrong with you!",Pitch Black
494,Tabby-23,NO FLAMETHROWERS!,10,22 February 2000,"By now, everyone knows this is part of the Alien ""Puny Human"" genre, where a group of people are forced to face an alien threat of the like never seen before. The difference here is that the director worked hard to get everything he could out of the limited budget. The nerve-wrackingly desolate landscapes are effectively turned into purely claustrophobic corridors of dark by what has to be the most spectacular eclipse scene ever in cinema. The special effects are either subtle or over the top, but they always achieve the effect on the audience the director wanted. Despite limited dialogue, the actors throw themselves right into character, explaining nothing that they can't demonstrate with their performance. Vin Diesel, in particular, makes himself an irresistably fascinating amoral predator, who deals with everyone at face value.What really impressed me, however, is that there were no flamethrowers. In his illustrations for Species, H.R. Giger kept scribling notes saying ""no flamethrowers"", which were ignored. In fact, the flamethrower has become the worst cliche of the whole Alien genre, appearing everywhere from undersea mining facilities to L.A. sewers. Pitch Black avoids this crutch, impressive since flamethrowers would be doubly useful for the night-blind survivors fighting albino predators. The whole crew worked hard on this film, avoiding cheap tricks like this, and it shows.",Pitch Black

He's amazingly captivating as Riddick, a convict. You keep wanting to see more of him.Second the story is amazing. I'm quite a sci-fi fan and i've seen quite a few cheezy scripts but this was truly first class. Each character has something hidden from everyone else.

The Aliens movies (Alien, Aliens, Alien 3, ect. ), The preditor movies even possibly ones that have made a large impact on the way movies are made, ( Star Wars). The Twists and the action dragged through out the whole thing pulls you to the edge of your seat every time you watch it, wether it be the first or the tenth. And Vin is just awesome to say the least the way he portrays the escaped murder ""Riddick"" and in away the characters evolution. As expressed in other comments about the small flaws conserning the suns  it proves that some people don't think with an open mind. the wonders of space are still developing so that the human mind can grasp it. Just because our solar system is postioned around a sun doesn't mean that the one in the movie had to. Our sun is the biggest piece of matter in the area making it have the biggest gravitational pull, rotating the other planets around it. Its possible that the suns in the movie weren't the biggest piece of matter in the area and the sun, as well as the planet they had crashed on rotated around a very large planet that held a bigger gravitational pull then any of the others.

For those that don't know the premise, a space freighter carrying an incredibly dangerous criminal crash lands on a desert planet and finds out it is inhabited with ferocious flesh-rippin' critters that hide in the darkness. Well, what happens when said planet, usually brightened by its three suns (no Fred MacMurray jokes), has a total eclipse?  Wackiness ensues!  For such a simple plot, this movie plays out with so many twists (what do you expect from the screenwriter of Elm Street 4 and the Fly 2?  Kidding.) and even more style to boot.  Vin ""Zoo-perr-mann"" Diesel, who plays the criminal Riddick here, is simply a bad-ass and makes this movie his own.  I would love to see a prequel or sequel involving his character, but ecccch, now I'm just sounding like a geeky throwback from the Ain't It Cool News website.

His voice over sets the tone early on in the film, and distinguishes him as the major player.""They say your mind shuts down during cryo-sleep.... All but the primitive side, the animal side.... I guess that's why I'm still awake.""Pitch Black is more about the development of a few of its characters as they learn more about themselves and others, than it is about surviving an alien assault.Sure, the story is pretty stock, but it's driven by believable people, people I could identify with, people faced with fear, distrust, prejudice, and an army of creatures that forces them to open their eyes to each other, lest they be devoured from without and within.Impressive special effects, little things like sepia toned lighting on the desert planet that shifts hues as the world's three suns rise and fall.

507,sfarmer76,You'll Never Guess Who Makes It Out Alive...,9,18 February 2000,"I would have to say that this movie is outstanding! The first 45 minutes of this movie are totally gripping. Visually, I have never seen a movie like this before, and that's a very generous compliment.This movie has outstanding special-effects. Even though this is a sci-fi spectacle.. there are some outstanding performances here. Australian actress Rhada Mitchell commands your attention as the strong but sometimes insecure Second Commander Fry. You may recognize this actress from the movie ""High Art"", where she also nearly dominated the movie. This movie proves Rhada Mitchell is every bit the leading lady, and I look forward to seeing more from her in the future.Vin Diesel, under-utilized in ""Saving Private Ryan"", also proves he has real acting chops with his performance in ""Pitch Black"", and he has some of the best lines in the movie. I can't quite place the actor, he looks a lot like Matthew McConaughey, but I think his name is Cole Hauser, and he turns in some excellent supporting work in a thankless role where he is primarily the challenger to Second Commander Fry.Sadly, several of the more interesting characters die as the movie progresses, certainly not the ones I would have picked, and the movie ends cynically and on an unpleasant note designed to keep everything open for a sequel, but overall a fantastic and gritty sci-fi actioner that does not let you down, that does not disappoint, that has the real feel, texture and taste of a possible near-future.Whoever handled the cinematography here is worthy of an Academy Award, and would be my ideal selection to film adaptions of any books by Bruce Sterling or William Gibson that ever have the fortune to make it to the silver screen.

So I bet your saying ""seen one, seen 'em all"". Well don't be quick to judge this movie. There are a lot of different elements that come into play that I think work well to keep you on edge and guessing.You probably already know the plot so I'll skip that part. The opening crash landing of the Hunter-Gratzner is well done. All the characters come together to take stock in their situation. Right at this point, their biggest concerns are finding water and the escaped criminal Riddick. Very soon it becomes apparent that Riddick is the least of their worries.I 'm not going to disclose anymore story details because I think that anything else would take away the question of ""what do they do now?""
I liked the characters and appreciated the little twists of ""appearances can be deceiving"" atmosphere that slowly developes. Even Vin Diesel's character of Riddick could easily be played over the top in so many different ways - to the point of annoying distraction - but that doesn't happen. You'll end up liking him without a doubt.The SFX is about what you would expect for a movie of this type. The planet's indigenous life forms are mostly CGI rendered and I think were designed by Patrick Tatapolous - of GODZILLA fame. They are nasty creatures and with the addition of lightning fast speed, they have voracious appetites for crash survivors. My only complaint about the movie is:{SPOILER ALERT}There are thousands of these creatures out roaming the planet during the eclipse. At first, they are always near and harassing the survivors, but later - they aren't even around for the many times that a survivor puts themselves into a position where they are vulnerable to attack. It seemed a little inconsistent to me. This was probably due to the fact that there were several ongoing character conflicts that were adding to the tension. In a way, this made the threat of the creatures less significant to me, and less scary as well. When I think of ""terror in the dark"" I think of scenes like in the movie THE RESURRECTED where the dark dungeon swallows up the light and conceals the real danger until it jumped out at you. To me, I don't think that movie played with the basic human emotion of fear of the dark - enough.{END SPOILER}Other than that, I enjoyed everything else. I also loved the fact that the film was 2 hours long. It seems like lately 90 to 100 minutes was all that people were making.On a scale of 1-10, I give this an 8.

Ripley and company had some high tech weapons and the Pitch Black crew do not...and therein lies the strength of this movie.  This movie is about characters and characterizations.  Most notable was Vin Diesel as Riddick. I didn't really pay attention to him and his character in Saving Private Ryan but I sure paid attention to his character in Pitch Black!  I thought he was excellent in his portrayal of an amoral murderer going through a metamorphosis...becoming someone with a consience.  If you go to this movie looking for a high tech thriller then don't go see this movie.  If you want to go to a movie to see solid characterizations of people stranded on a planet with little water, few weapons, and a pretty ferocious predator stalking everyone after dark then this is the movie for you.  Some scenes were predictably pat i.e., Riddick grabs one of the creatures before it can get him...you know one predator against another?  Other scenes were rather riveting i.e., Riddick tries to convince Fry to just get on the transport and leave the others behind.  Some aspects of this movie do evoke images from the movie ""Alien"" (the first one) such as sounds and atmosphere (remember the clinking chains in Alien?).  When you hear those scurrying sounds you know its not the pitter patter of little feet. I'd give this movie 7.5 points out of 10.  I'd go see this movie again in a heartbeat.",Pitch Black
512,dnlatimer,"The Good, The Bad, and The Reasons You Should See This.",8,27 February 2000,"Pitch Black isn't without its plot kinks and deficiencies, but the good definitely outweighs the bad. Those who are not sci-fi fans may not appreciate it enough to be impressed, but fans of the genre will be overjoyed to see a decent movie in their arena for god knows how long.The Good: The opening of the movie features the crash-landing of a cargo ship which is nail-biting and extremely well done. The actors and their dialogue are all competent, with Vin Diesel (Saving Private Ryan) almost single-handedly elevating the film to greatness as an escaped convict being transported by the authorities (His character, Riddick, is one of the most memorable bad guys I can think of). The movie also ends in an unexpected way that manages to humanize some of the characters without seeming overly cheesy.The Bad: No matter how sound of a plot this film has, it all boils down to a group of isolated humans being stalked by carnivorous monsters, just like in a thousand other movies. Some of the sets (The prospector villages and the 'skiff') are pretty flimsy looking. Some of the technical details (How did the ship crash in the first place? How do the creatures survive by just eating each other? Why did they grow from being bat-sized to elephant-size all of a sudden? What kind of a dumbass drinks whiskey in a desert underneath 3 suns?) might irritate plot dissectors like me.All in all, I like sci-fi and hate movies that give it a bad name. This one is definitely worth seeing.",Pitch Black
513,esbailey,A Great Sci-Fi movie until the last 20 minutes.,5,10 March 2000,"This film had HUGE potential for USA studios... however, the way the writers dealt with the ending was really crappy.

514,atalanta-3,"Complex, detailed and immensely satisfying film",10,6 June 2000,"This is without doubt the most exciting and satisfying film I've seen in years!   The plot seen in print is almost banal- a ship crashes on a desert planet with three suns, the survivors have to adjust to the landscape and each other, then darkness falls and the monsters appear.   Pilot Fry, after a moment of cowardice during the descent through the atmosphere when she almost jettisoned the passengers, takes charge of the group and enlists the help of convicted murderer Riddick to lead them through the darkness to the escape ship - he's the one with surgically enhanced eyes that can see in the dark.   But it's really not that simple - every character is complex, three-dimensional, with conflicting traits so you never quite know who's good and who's bad.The performances are uniformly superb - Radha Mitchell shows Fry steeling herself for leadership, overcoming her own fears, and trying to prevent further bloodshed, while Cole Hauser, as the man taking Riddick back to custody, shows he has his own agenda and his own idiosyncratic standards. But the film belongs to Vin Diesel as Riddick - he has the most magnetic screen presence I've seen in years.   For much of the film his face is in shadow, and he doesn't actually say a great deal, but he draws your attention all the same.  Sometimes he draws your attention by not speaking - or by not moving.  And Diesel doesn't trivialise the character, as could so easily be done, by giving him a ""heart of gold"" - Riddick is still one mean and vicious man as they approach the ship - he just lets us glimpse those first tentative steps from caring only for the self to caring for others.Technically the film is very good.  The lighting effects are excellent at both ends of the spectrum - the overbright triple sunlight and the pitch darkness.   Special effects showing both Riddick's and the monsters' points of view add to the suspense, as do sound effects of the monsters flying and using ultrasound to ""see"" (the monsters themselves are anatomically plausible and suitably frightening).  Editing is so tight it's almost jarring at times - there is literally no padding in this film, no fades, no time to re-orient yourself.From the opening shot to the end of the credits you have to keep your wits about you.   Every scene, every line of dialogue, every single camera shot is important.   See it three times to understand it all.My only caveat is about the science - the solar system as shown in the model is impossible (planets revolve around suns, not vice versa).   However, that doesn't affect the human story, so I haven't taken points off for it.",Pitch Black

It's not the most original movie ever created.  At times it can be far from scientifically accurate.  But it's a Sci-Fi movie, so who cares?  Just because a few things might not be possible, doesn't mean it ruins the movie. If you really stop and think about it, half the stuff in most sci-fi's are impossible.Ignoring the complaints, I rented this movie and highly enjoyed the whole thing.  Start to finish I was paying great attention to the movie.  The actors and actresses did an amazing job and it shows.  The use of light isn't always perfect, but it can be stunning at times.In my opinion, to really enjoy this movie wait until you are in a good mood and have time to set back and relax.  Then, just enjoy it.  Don't try and pick out all the little details that's wrong, and don't spend the whole time comparing it to the sci-fi movies that came before it.

I thought going in that the movie was supposed to be scary but it wasn't in the least.  The scariest scene in this movie wouldn't have made it past the Alien' cutting room floor.  There was very little in the way of character development and none of the characters were likeable.  In fact, the cast of characters is quite ridiculous and the dialogue is even worse.  The way in which Riddick, convict turned nice guy, confronts these aliens is an absolute farce.  The effects were alright, but I regret having paid money to see this film.  All this movie did was help me appreciate the 'Alien' series all the more.  If you liked 'Sphere' or 'Event Horizon' you might enjoy this movie.   If you didn't like either of these two movies, avoid Pitch Black' as if it were the black plague.  3/10",Pitch Black

I'm a fan of Claudia Black, and I was so p***ed that she died so early in the movie.... if only she had stayed down.... (sigh)  The acting was great.  I am now a fan of Vin Diesel because of this film.  I don't know what some of you other people are talking about, but I think the aliens looked very real.  The only bad thing about the movie, was that it left a lot of questions unanswered.  Mainly being how did they crash there on the exact day of the eclipse (well, technically, we don't really know how long they were there, since there is no day and night).  And did the aliens build the tunnels and caves themselves, or were they just there.  And if they made them, how could they be in the sun digging them.

Pitch Black has a couple of things that makes it stand out. The movie has a great story (although it reminds a bit the Alien and Aliens). There are a few surprises in the plot. Directing and special effects are great (The night vision shots looked fabulous). Cinematography was great too with its blue, yellow and black colors. Atmosphere in the movie is tense throughout the movie.Acting isn't anything special, but everyone does his/her job. Only Vin Diesel as the murderer stands out.

I last saw it when it came out and thought it had a nice flow to it, nice development and evolution of character and plot line. I enjoyed it even more this time around. But I had this eerie feel of déjà vu! No, I am not mistakenly posting a review for the wrong movie, please bare with me. A quick search on IMDb and I came up with this: the writer for both movies, Waterworld and Pitch Black is the same one!The rest is quite easy to follow. The unlikely hero, an outcast from the society, crosses paths with a party in distress. Reluctant to even approach him, they find themselves in the need to ask him for help. Our hero meets the innocence, the child, the only one who will truly see inside his soul and will see him for what he really is: the man and not the beast. Through the child's eyes, the others and the audience will grow closer to this character, who will lead the worthy to the salvation.OK, there is a tiny hint of sarcasm, because I felt a little disappointed when I realized the story was recycled A to Z. And yes, I know what you are going to say, they are two completely different stories. A giant deserted planet without so much as a drop of water could not be any more different from the planet covered with the vast seas (and not a drop of fresh water). But all jokes aside, both narratives are great none less. They hold their own and have many layers and depths to discover. I guess in this time and age of the Hollywood recycling machine I was craving for the rare spark of originality, but I will let this one slide since they can both be accredited to the same brilliant writer.",Pitch Black

I awaited suspense and was delivered none, I awaited action and got a few pieces. The only slightly jumpy pieces were obvious and almost had a tag line warning you.The director appeared to be quite please with his 'changeover' personalities, 'good person actually bad', 'bad person can be good and bad!!'. David, this has been done before and was no surprise.I really sorry David, I know what you have previously directed, so perhaps now family movies might be a better avenue? It had the feel of a family movie to it. Heck I don't mind of any of my kids seeing this and they certainly won't be scared of the dark afterwards.The 'monsters' had a very good premise to them and I think of this film as a 'Dark City' sort of film....

One feels no sympathy for the characters at any moment in the movie, because the characters are not developed to their fullest!The movie is very predictable, and the scary aspect of the movie does not make you jump so you may as well consider this movie a thriller and not a true horror/gore/hack and slash type movie.READ NO FURTHER - SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!Do not read further as there are spoilers ahead.  Now what I dont get about this movie is why the most obvious is ignored..  A sort of solar eclipse thing happens, and boom, all darkness, no sun whatsoever... everyone is wearing tank tops, but NO ONE IS FREEZING.  The movie gives absolutely NO explanation as to why this is so.  In the normal desert of Earth,  when the sun sets the temperatures can drop to sub zero, yet there it seems to remain all the same.  I can understand that they were excited so sweaty, generating a lot of heat etc but it makes NO sense why they felt no cold whatsoever.

530,flecktone01,Completely Disappointing *spoiler*,2,18 August 2002,"***Spoiler ahead***This movie was so disappointing that I'm actually mad that almost 2 hours of my life were waisted on it.For starters, the pilot should NEVER have survived the entry into the planet.  She's entering a foreign atmosphere with red heat completely enveloping the ship.  The window breaks and glass shatters all over her. There's no air, she recieves NO injuries, and she survived a super heated entry.  I know it's sci-fi, but COME ON!Complaint #2- We never figure out why all these different types of people are on this ship together.#3- It took an HOUR to even get to the aliens. Even then, there were only 2 or 3 decent scenes with them.#4- What's up with making Jack a girl? If they wanted her to be a female, they should have kept her as Jackie from the beginning. This revelation came out of nowhere, had no point, and gave no positive contribution to the movie whatsoever.#5- The pilot, Carolyn, used a LOT of foul language. I wasn't offended by it, but it looked COMPLETELY forced. She does NOT look like somebody with a mouth like that. They would have been a lot better off if they either 1) Left the profanity out of her dialogue or 2) Had a ""harder"" looking woman play her role.

Lighting is fun, especially in the beginning with the use of the blue/yellow suns, and of course the Predator-esquire look through Riddick's eyes, or the aliens' eyes once in awhile adds to the life of the movie. Special effects aren't mind blowing, but they do suffice nicely. Vin Diesel isn't a great actor, but unlike most other muscular bad-boy types, he's not terrible either, and he plays his character pretty well.Overall, the only thing the plot really lacks is some extra development. Characters have lots of different personalities, but I think I could stand to see more of their quirks, so that I became a touch more invested in them before they all die off. I also think its too convenient that the same day they are hit by a rogue comet they also experience a once every 22 year event. I would have really enjoyed another 30-45 minutes of movie developing a short stay on the planet, maybe covering a week or so before the eclipse starts.Overall, watch or buy this movie.

536,dave_gene_pico,A great movie.,10,22 July 2005,"This is one of my favorite movies. David Twohy does a great job of setting the environment to make you FEEL like you're on an alien planet. The plot is, a spaceship carrying cargo and a few passengers goes off course and get into an asteroid belt, and then crash land on a desert planet. Vin Diesel does a great job acting as Richard B. Riddick, the cold, ruthless, heartless killer. Cole Hauser makes a great performance as Johns, the black-hearted Bountyhunter, along with Radha Mitchell as Carolyn Fry, who's stuck in the middle between Riddick and John's fighting. My favorite, though, was Kieth David (Imam). Kieth David has played in ""John Carpenter's: The Thing"", he appeared in ""There's Something About Mary"", and has narrated a few things as well. I think he delivers the best performance, followed by Cole Hauser.There's a lot of speculation that this is a rehash of ""Alien"", but IN FACT, ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" was a novel written by Alan Dean Foster in the early 1970's, BEFORE he wrote ""Aliens"". ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" novel had an opening like this (it wasn't an entire separate book called ""Pitch Black"", but it had a prologue like this.) This is a great movie, and has great performances, and all the actors/actresses fit their characters. This is a great movie to watch the the lights off, and while snuggling something.

Usually in this type of movie, producers, trying to sell an extra scene of gore, sex, or fright, will allow some bad writing or trite cliche to spoil the story. But Pitch Black is relentless in its integrity; it's lean and mean and it doesn't waste time being anything other than a horror/thriller.Pitch Black takes place on an alien planet where the bones of land leviathans lay in the desert. Passengers on a wrecked spaceship must survive the planet's heat, an escaped violent prisoner, and whatever terrors might be found on the planet's surface.In everything it does, Pitch Black is successful. For example, it opens with a crash scene, and the ""special effects"" are very well done. The effects were clearly not expensive, but they were effective, melding editing, acting, and sound into a tense, plausible scene. The cinematography of the film is an interesting cross between Saving Private Ryan (with strobe-like footage from a fast-shutter camera) and Three Kings (giving the alien planet a bleached, sun-baked look). Finally, some very good sound editing makes the film seem just otherworldly enough to remind you the setting is not Earth -- like the simple sound of a gunshot sweetened with an eerie bird-shriek.Pitch Black quietly opened in early 2000, then quietly faded away. Now that it's on video, perhaps it will get the audience it deserves. Unless you're squeamish, give this horror/thriller a look.",Pitch Black

I admit I have now seen it 6 times due to Vin Diesel fandom, but the film itself is really excellent.It isnt some big budget lets blow stuff up/spend big on special effects movie, its a story of people in a nasty situation - the basic premise of any good scifi story.In fact I remember after the second time I saw it the thought I had was that it was like watching a scifi book at the movies - with character development, good pacing, etc. I then later refined it to being like a good scifi short story because it is only a dip in the ocean of a larger story I think.I loved the story, I loved the look of it, I loved the characters - my faves (other than Riddick) were definitely Jack and Fry. And Cole Hauser did a great job as Johns - ewww I hated him! LOL!My list of peeves is short. 1)Certain people died or died first that I wasnt impressed about. 2) Fry stating the obvious all the time ""they're hollow"" and ""the light hurts them"" after someone just said the light is scolding them.But apart from that - a great film!!",Pitch Black

The actors are amazing, Radah Mitchell (High Art, Love and other..) as Fry is truly a joy to watch on screen, while Vin Diesel as Riddeck is so captivating that you are dying just to hear him speak again.The look of the movie is breath taking, the contrast of blues, yellows and oranges due to the three different suns is amazing.

This movie is a taste of Vin Diesel's future.One question... Has the appearance of Keith David on the marquee of any sci-fi Horror project guarenteed its Street Credibility?",Pitch Black
545,Kare-7,Vin Diesel and Cole Hauser steal the show,8,19 February 2000,"Finally, a movie where Cole Hauser isn't playing  ""the background guy"" or ""the friend"".  His talents were definitely not wasted in this film. Johns (Cole Hauser) and Riddick (Vin Diesel) are the best reasons to see this movie.  The aliens, although a great special effect, are almost a distraction when these two characters are on screen. The film tends to have cheesy dialogue at times but the one liners are great.  The plot was easy to follow and the film as a whole was very entertaining. I recommend this movie to everyone over 16 and anyone who loves looking at Cole Hauser as much as I do.",Pitch Black
546,A.M.P.,Best Sci-Fi Movie Ever,10,20 February 2000,I just saw the movie and it was great. I read the book first and I couldn't believe the similarities. In some parts it was word for word. I loved Vin Diesel. He was great as Riddick(a escaped convict). I also thought Cole Hauser ruled playing a Butt-Head cop. It was interesting seeing the aliens because they were exactly the way they described them in the book. I recommend this movie to anyone who seems even vaguely interested. I give it a 10.,Pitch Black
547,rhodes48,"Solid Sci-Fi, with a weak ending",7,20 February 2000,"Pitch Black is a healthy dose of Aliens with a twist of Mad Max thrown in to boot.  The plot was solid - a ship crashlands on the surface of a forbidding planet where darkness means death from the creatures who live underground (or aboveground during total eclipses).  The characters were simply developed, yet interesting enough to provide surprise for some of the movie's character development twists.  Vin Diesel as Riddick is a true movie tough guy who saves the day, and Radha Mitchell plays the softer side of Lt. Ripley from the Alien series as Cpt. Fry.  A solid supporting cast is assembled as well, but this all gets lost in an ending which becomes formulaic and anti-climatic.  Special effects were also well done, which makes this a good Sci-Fi/Horror movie, but not a great one.",Pitch Black

Part science fiction, part horror, part thriller, it works well in all three areas.  Highly recommended.",Pitch Black
549,eric-215,Huh?,4,21 February 2000,"If you want to see a movie that is a cross between Stargate and Conair, with one-liners and a crappy cast, then this is your movie.

550,jeannie369,Very Good,9,16 January 2000,"My family and I recently went to the annual Fangoria show at the New Yorker hotel.  I had never been to that type of show before and enjoyed it.  They gave us free tickets to see ""Pitch Black"".  We were a bit skeptical about going to see it because we got to the Fangoria show late and missed the preview for ""Pitch Black"" and several of the actors guest appearances. After seeing the movie I regret getting to the Fangoria show late.The movie was suprisingly good.  Everyone's performance was convincing. Especially Vin Diesel.  Perfect choice for his role.  I know he will have many more female fans when this movie comes out.  I was at the edge of my seat the whole time.  I even screamed at one point.  Embarrassing!  The special effects were pretty good.  I will definately let everyone I know about it and I would pay to see it again!",Pitch Black
551,golo19,"The hype and advertising they used alone will draw you in, and leave you with a bitter taste once you see it.",6,20 February 2000,"Pitch Black seemed like a great movie to go see.  One main thing that will attract me to a movie is the advertising.  Sometimes I will refuse to see a movie if the advertising is poor, even if my friends tell me it is a good movie.  Well the advertising for Pitch Black got me, sadly.  I did not know what to expect going into the movie, but after the first twenty minutes or so, I pretty much knew how I was going to be disappointed.  The characters are all very weak, do not expect any great performances, or good development of any of the characters.  And the character that made me want to see the movie, the creatures or big chickens, thats what they looked like to me, were not any better.  The main problem I guess that made it bad was the story and flow of the movie.  It seems like it is not going anywhere, just dragging along.  For once and for all, it is not scary at all, please ignore the horror description of this film.  The only horror I felt was sitting through it.",Pitch Black
552,avatra,"Great, great sci-fi thriller.",10,27 January 2000,"I know that it's just one more crash-land-and-fight-monsters movie, but it's a very, very good one.  Vin Diesel is simply incredible, he totally makes the film, and everybody else is almost as good.  The movie doesn't ram cliches down your throat or clumsily dodge them until you can't follow the plot.  It was just very well done, top to bottom, and Diesel is absolutely amazing.  A must see.",Pitch Black
553,Da3dalus,"Great movie, but destined to be a 'B'",7,19 February 2000,"I'm a sci-fi afficianado, and I really liked this flick- even though I'm really picky!  It was technically tight- not too bogged down though- and had an original plot.  The visual effects were equally original, especially in the ""sunlight"".  It drew a great deal from the Alien aesthetic... expect H.R. Giger to be raving mad! However, it was indeed a ""B"" horror flick formula, with a motley group of strangers unable to stay organized against what's ""out there"".  See if you can pick out the Red Shirts early... and oh yeah... guys, you'll want to be seeing this heroine!",Pitch Black
554,Jef-K,Wow! Talk about a surprise in finding a movie!,10,3 November 2000,"A few co-workers had seen this film in the theater and gave it ho-hum reviews.  It was not really one of the ""must see"" movies on my list, but one night at BlockBuster to get a DVD, I picked it up.Surprise! Surprise!  The DVD menu was interesting, and especially the featurette from ""raveworld.net"".  I'm not quite sure how this scene got involved with the movie project, but it's a nice pieace of footage with some great music.Well, the movie was gripping in the character development.  Vin Diesel as ""Riddick"" is possibly one of the most intriguing characters to hit Sci-Fi, if not movies in recent years.All in all, a very satisfying movie.  After renting this, I intend to purchase the DVD ASAP to add to my collection.It's nice to find a movie that catches you off guard and leaves you with a lasting impression.",Pitch Black
555,essex_73,I know of better ways to waste 2 hours,3,25 February 2000,"I went to see this film with a hope that I might have been surprised. For the first half of the film I was. I credit the production team with making a great looking first half of a film. The washed out colours and hews helped create an incredible landscape. Unfortunately, once the lights went out this film tumbled into second-rate sci-fi. Pitch Black was not suspenseful. It was not scary. It was laughable. There has to be someone in the entertainment industry that can come up with a better creature than a cross between a hammer head shark and a rooster. The only reasons I gave it a '3' are because of the first half's look and feel, and the credible performances by Vin Diesal and Radha Mitchell.",Pitch Black
556,Tha Artful Scrybe,An interestingly diverse group of people crash land on a planet infested with nocturnal predators...,7,18 February 2000,"This movie was surprisingly good.  The cast, although not super star-filled, was very high in quality and did an excellent acting job, without which, the movie would've been ruined.  Another feature that made this movie a must-see is the superb directing from a man whose name I didn't recognize (sorry). His sharp movement of the camera, captivating and stunning transitional shots, and unique motion clips made this movie one with which the audience can really interact (and not to mention get frightened).  The screen play was great as well, with some twists and unsuspected turns that will keep you failingly anticipating what's to happen next.  This aspect was enhanced due to the lack of stars....without stars, anyone and everyone is fair game to get killed.  This beautiful blend of elements made for a very entertaining and scary movie.  Thanks and good job to all that participated in its production",Pitch Black
557,pseudo9,"The most suspenseful science fiction movie since ""Alien""",10,16 February 2000,"WARNING SPOILERS THROUGHOUT REVIEW!!!I was fortunate enough to see a screening of ""Pitch Black"" last night, and the overall impression I left with was astonishment.  Not since I saw ""Alien"" have I been this involved in a suspense, and it is suspense not horror, movie. It starts off quietly enough with the ubiquitous shot of the ship passing through space.  A nice effect in as it's quiet, simple, not flashy and noisy (this is space you know).  Vin Diesel has a narrative voiceover that introduces us to some of the other players in the movie and helps establish the tone of the movie; dark, edgy, and menacing without being directly threatening.  Diesel's ""Riddick"" is definitely not the type that you'd ever want to cross.  Most people would get nervous being in the same hemisphere, and Riddick likes that.  He's a loner, a survivor and definitely not a hero. He doesn't concern himself with questions of right or wrong, but operates at a more primal level that doesn't recognize the need for social niceties. The ship is pierced by meteorites, causing catastrophic failures and forcing them into the gravity of a nearby moon.  The chaos and confusion of this scene is extremely well filmed.  As crewmembers fall from their chryo chambers they are confused, scared and bewildered, a palpable air of panic is established.  This leads to the crash sequence being one of disorganization as nothing can stop the ship from going down.  The use of the personal point of view for this scene really helps to amp up the tension.What ensues next could easily have been the stuff of cliches, a group of survivors of different ages, sexes and backgrounds gathers around the remains of the ship and begins to assess their situation.  What keeps this from becoming trite is how well the characters are created.  We have Fry an inexperienced pilot who's forced into decisions she's not prepared for, Abu al-Walid a Moslem and his charges who are on pilgrimage to New Mecca, Paris a hedonistic importer/exporter, Riddick a convicted murder who escaped from maximum lockup and is so dangerous that his jailer keeps him manacled hand and foot, blind-folded and gagged, Jack  a young kid who's impressed with the menacing Riddick, Johns the man charged with bringing Riddick back to the slam, and a couple of incidental characters who aren't fleshed in as well.  What facts we do gather about the group are picked up on the fly as director David Twohy doesn't allow a lot of wasted time for long character explanations before he starts cranking up the suspense.As things would go, the survivors soon come to realize that they have limited options, negligible rations and are trapped on a dessert world in orbit around three suns.  The use of sepia tone during the exterior shots on the planet creates a definitely distinct look and feel to this movie.  As the other suns rise the color changes and the effect is startling and eerie. They also soon realize that they aren't alone and that something nasty is hiding under the surface.  This is one of the more stock moments in the movie, when one of the characters goes tunneling after one of the survivors disappears.  Perhaps they stopped watching horror films in the future and don't know any better.  Twohy manages to keep this pretty spooky, though, and gives us our first glance at the menace that lurks below.The alien creatures are used extremely well in this movie, and as the moon begins to fall into an eclipse (a beautiful effect) they come up to the surface like demons erupting from hell.  This forces the crash survivors to change their frame of mind from escape to survival.  This is where the writing of the characters begins to really shine through.  Each one is a representation of a different aspect of human nature and as the crises worsens those traits come more to the front of things.  Riddick and Moslem each wrestle with issues of faith and belief, and we wonder if the allegiances of the characters are what we think they are, or even if they are who we think they are. As they literally race through the darkness trying to reach their ship one can't help make the comparison of Ripley racing through the Nostromo in ""Alien"" trying to reach safety; but again,  Twohy is ahead of us on that one and manages to plant some nice surprises in the plot for us to find.Whether or not they make it I'll leave for you to find out.  And believe me it's worth finding out.  This is a movie that I went to expecting to merely be entertained, and I was, but what I didn't expect was to be dazzled, frightened, and intrigued.  Credit has to be given to the entire cast, though Diesel clearly stands out, for creating a group of people that you're interested in and root for. Some problems exist in this movie, such as their initial need for using breathing devices that quickly seem to be forgotten and disappear, but the overall style, story, character and level of suspense more than make up for any trivial faults.  A highly enjoyable movie that rates a high four out of five.",Pitch Black
558,Scott_is_here,Really Cool,10,5 April 2000,"I walked into the theatre thinking that this would just be one of those big budget-effects parade (not saying that those movies aren't good). But it wasn't. the characters were really cool, especially Vin Diesel, who was probably the coolest movie character in years. Plus, the effects weren't overblown, or was it filled with gore. I recommend this movie to people who loved the Alien series.",Pitch Black
559,mfinknu,Loved it,9,17 February 2000,"This is a great movie.  I've been drooling for months waiting for this movie to come out, and finally it's here.  It's a great SciFi flick.  It's fast paced with great action sequences.  Trying not to give away too much about the movie, the lighting is extremely cool, and the darkness is terrifically scary.",Pitch Black
560,ddufiend,Pitch Black,10,17 February 2000,"If you are pressed for time, let me sum it up.  You need to see this movie, if no other sci-fi this year.  It puts Starship Troopers and Stargate both to shame.  If you'd like to know more, read on.I knew this would be a fantastic movie the very second I saw the preview. The one thing that I didn't like, was that in the beginning, there are quick, short bursts of white light, that almost strobed 5 at a time with a second or two in between of actual shots of the movie.  Don't worry though, this only happens for maybe 20 seconds and doesn't detract from the movie one bit.  Pitch Black is non-stop action from the minute you see the USA films logo appear on the screen.  Vin Diesel plays one of the best characters I have seen in a movie since Ray Park played Darth Maul in The Phantom Menace last year.  In fact, as a big Darth Maul fan, I might even venture to say that Riddick is even more of a bad-a** than the Sith Warrior. This movie will be just as good if not better than the Matrix.",Pitch Black
561,Candace-3,"Cool, cool, really cool...",8,19 February 2000,"You can't help but get into this film.  The characters really pull you in and you can't help but like (bad boy) Riddick.  The filming and special effects are unique throughout the movie, constantly changing your mood and reactions (no cheap shots).  Anyway if you like sci-fi, particularly the ""Aliens"" trilogy, you'll really enjoy ""Pitch Black"".",Pitch Black
562,Apocalypse-4,Excellent Sci-FI movie!!,10,19 February 2000,"I had been waiting for this movie since the trailer on ""End of Days"".  I'll say I very impressed with what I saw.

Do your self a favor and go the the movie right NOW!!",Pitch Black
563,RalphE,"Good story, great cast. Best space movie since Alien.",7,18 February 2000,"The main reason I went to see it is that I've been a fan of Vin Diesel ever since I saw 'Iron Giant' (He hosts the making of on the DVD).  Pitch Black is a little darker than most movies I see, but it was very good.  The cast was excellent, especially considering I knew none of them except one.  In my mind, it was similar to Alien.  A struggle to survive against a species that views humans only as an organic food source.  I actually liked it better, since after the blood was shed, and the last survivors escape, one has been profoundly changed.",Pitch Black
564,ainya,A good Thriller..not quite a horror flick,8,18 February 2000,"I was a bit dubious going into the movie, the ads on tv sounded good, but it had a lot of hype, which I feared would lead to an anticlimatic ending..ie a mediocre movie. Now if you can stomache the many gaping plot holes and quite a bit suspension of disbelief ..which I can....It was really pretty good. I was pleasantly surprised though.Overall, It was more of a thriller and action/adventure rather than a horror flick. It kept me on the edge of my seat with a few eeks for good measure, but when i left the movie theater, I didn't have to go sit in a well lit cafe if you know what I mean.General Opinion: Not as good/scarey as Alien, Not as creepy as Event Horizon, but not half bad either.Lasting impression: Van diesel's Riddick makes the movie.",Pitch Black
565,daveboy-3,Not a 'bad film' by a long shot,8,19 February 2000,"The other posters have summed it up pretty well, but I'll add a bit. For the amount of money spent on this film, it is amazing. It is fast paced and action packed. All of the effects work is done well. All of the actors are perfectly cast. Everything works well. If you can simply suspend your belief and accept the 'coincidences' that the director throws at you, the movie is enjoyable. If you're some sort of realism freak (i.e. you were mad at Face/Off because EVERYONE KNOWS YOU CAN'T TRANSFER FACES BETWEEN PEOPLE) then I recommend you avoid this film. Everyone else is in for a good time though. This is a good, fun movie.",Pitch Black

Here are my qualms:**SPOILER WARNING** the storyline was weak (""We can't leave this planet because..... if we try to leave the evil criminal we brought with us who I don't trust will kill us all and leave without us"" - yeah right...), and the death of some characters was sometimes a relief for the audience! And wtf, the ending was so forced, they could have ****HUGE SPOILER****taken off in that damn spacecraft and drove down to that cave to rescue the last 2 survivors, but no.. they had to WALK there stupid butts down there.. jeeeez!!*******MORE SPOILERS***HOWEVER, I have to give major props to the storyline writers, it truly is fight evil with evil, from the evil co-pilot who wanted to kill everyone just to save herself in the beginning, to the evil druggie bounty-hunter, to the ultra-evil Reddick (and cute wannabe tagalong). The ending on a sour note was excellent, as I am always glad to be surprised, as I'm sure you'll be to.Bottom line: This movie may have its faults, but the continuous turns for the worst for the cast and the CG make up for it!",Pitch Black
567,DJG414,Much Better than expected.,8,19 February 2000,"This film was much better than I expected it to be.  It contained many elements not usually found in Sc-fi or any Hollywood films for that matter. The first quarter of the film contains many elements which could be considered 'artsy', almost experimental in nature.  Many shots experiment with color and light not often seen in big budget Hollywood films.  The film itself is not bad either, with a good story and great cinematography it overcomes its sometimes lousy dialogue.  I really enjoyed this film as a a great semi-change of pace.  I recommend seeing it, and definitely in the theater, not video.",Pitch Black
568,monster_joe,I really liked this film,10,20 February 2000,"man, seeing the previews made me think this movie would be extra cheesey. However, I thought it was really first class. A basic sci-fi story line is made credible by a wonderful ensemble cast portreying interesting characters. Some of the little plot twists were obvious, but were redeemed by fine acting, and the not over killed special effects. in fact i was rather impressed that they didn't use the movie as an excuse to go crazy with the computer generated effects. every effects shot was crafted expertly into something the film makers should be proud of. in a lot of sci-fi movies the film makers tend to over do it, and to go cheaply and quickly jumping into the effects like it was a bag of halloween candy, and the movie goer ends up with a stomach ache the next morning. this one however, did not over exagerate its self. it made its point clearly, and used the effects to its advantage, and not just as a filler. i'm proud to say i've seen this film, and will probably see it again asap.",Pitch Black

Cole Hauser is a wonderful actor and in this role, he makes me believe it even more. He makes his character so real and intriguing, you barely even notice anyone else (only as to how well they compliment him). Vin Deisel was a great anti-hero. He even pulled off the ever elusive one-liners, without sounding too practised. The aliens were breathtakingly horrific. The computer graphics were seamless.

Good special effects and interesting characters (Vin Diesel, you don't know if you want to like him or hate him) are what make this movie.  However, the storytelling seems a little ""made-for-TV-movie"" to me.  But overall, an awesome flick.

Still, the movie had room for a couple of my complaints.  I thought the movie could of been scarier, or more suspensful. I was expecting to be jumping throughout the movie.  I thought the CGI was good, but not ground breaking.  It looked kind of fuzzy sometimes, and you could tell it was CGI most of the time.  I thought it was a good movie, but I wouldn't call it a Sci-fi classic.  Still, these are just little complaints.

Like most sci-fi movies the character development is a little lax, but it provides enough to keep the storyline going.  The use of effects in the dark was very good.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who simply wants to go see a decent movie and kill some time.  If you are a hard-core movie fan that requires very minute details and excellent character recognition, you may want to pass this movie.",Pitch Black

Great movie...can't wait to see it again!",Pitch Black
575,robert_travis,Nice pick me up after Supernova.,6,20 February 2000,"This movie certainly isn't the holy grail I have seen some people make of it, but it is a solid, competent effort. The biggest thing I would change about it is replacing the female lead with Claudia Black instead, who I think would have made it more compelling, but what can I say, I'm a Farscape fan.The movie definately is influenced by the Aliens canon, but doesn't reach that level of greatness. It does however, despite a small budget, feature solid acting, some originality, and a nice little theme of redemption.One interesting note I read on here, and I would agree with it totally, is that I was never really 'scared'. Sure, I'm used to these types of movies, but the aliens did leave me with a pedestrian sense of deja-vu. The aliens seemed to be clones of the ones in Starship Troopers. Predictability is often the pitfall of these types of monster fests, and this one suffers its fair share of it.I give it a 6, for a solid hour of sci-fi diversion. Think of it as a really good Sci-Fi Channel original movie (a rare beast), which in the end I think describes it's level of quality best.",Pitch Black

I plan to see it a third time.Okay, I will admit straight up the movie is heavily derivative of the Aliens movies.  There are some obvious plot device moments, and yes, there is that moment when our hardy band of adventurers is in a bad situation, and one of them does something incredibly stupid, turning the situation from bad to desperate.So why did I like this movie? Charaterisation.  None of our 3 main protagonists is a fully likeable person -- a real risk to take.  It's good to see characters with flaws.  I loved watching Riddick, Fry, and Johns plot and try to outflank each other. I found each of these characters so fully realised that I wanted to know more about their lives previous to this adventure.It's no The Road Warrior (one of my all time fave movies) but it's certainly worth watching.",Pitch Black

578,boohboi,a type of film we haven't seen in a long while,10,21 February 2000,"Have we all slipped so far that we fail to acknowledge actual meanings in movies? Have we forgotten that not all movies (specifically sci-fi movies) are restricted simply to tell a story? I think we have had too many films that are simply that-just a story (be it simple kid stuff like Independence Day or even ""adult"" stuff as .say, The Boiler Room).no actual theme. We thought that meanings and ideas are only conveyed in silly pseudo-intellectual [inmho, anyway] spike lee type movies. Well, I for one applaud Point Black for being that different-a deeper film with monster-action visuals that seems to distract most. Watching story-only movies has caused us to forget to actually even realize that there is a deeper meaning in a movie we watch.especially a ""silly"" science fiction movie.Well, simply put, I believe this is one of the best science fiction movies (if not movie period) to come along in a while. I simply love the characterizations that were shown...how we see actual growth. The characters are not all that they were or what they were portrayed to be in the beginning. The central characters are all vividly depicted, and with exception to the obvious monster-fodder, we actually feel content with how they mature. I guess what I liked is how the archetypal roles (the leader, the gun-toting hero, the bad guy, the idiot, et al) of like monster movies weren't always who you pegged them to be in Pitch Black. Anyway.I really like THE major growth of Fry and Riddick. I like how it all came full circle for her especially.And again, while there were the obvious monster-fodder, the film completely lends itself as an ensemble movie that instills the idea that each castaway was important. Because of this, I think the casting of relative unknowns was in fact justified. A review I read referenced John Carpenter's Thing remake as correlating to this idea of the characters not being expendable, as they most often are in like movies.There were comparisons to Mimic and Leviathan.but I don't believe those comparisons were justified. Again, I believe those comparisons are an example how the setting and the visuals were in fact distracting. I'm not saying the visuals weren't bad in the least, or even anything less of great. but I'm thinking people focused on that and only saw that alone. In my humble opinion, they could have taken away the spaceships, the monsters, the aliens, the surgically enhanced night vision eyes.and it still would have been the same movie to me. It could have easily been set on Mt. Everest with a modern-day plane crash, instead of a wayward spaceship, and it wouldn't have been a different movie. I resent the invalidation of this film as being just an Alien-type movie.Well, basically, Pitch Black had the old idea of survival, with an incredible, interesting  and refreshing portrayal.

Different looking aliens, different effects, and some unentertaining acting at points, combined with the fact that the storyline really brings nothing new to the screen, left me wanting much more.Vin Diesel (Riddick) was the only saving grace for this movie to me, his character development, and role was entertaining.This movie may have been toted as a combination of Alien and Predator, but falls a little short of the mark in comparison to both of these classics.",Pitch Black

Vin Diesel was good in it, but that's about where it ends. the effects were good for the most part, but when looking at the neighboring planets, it looked as though it were a cheesy 1960's sci-fi thriller. it was too predictable, and i found myself yelling at the screen A LOT. Did i mention that Vin Diesel as Reddick was good? Okay. Because that's all i have to say about this movie. Vin Diesel is cool. He might get a career. But the others?? You'll recognize them next as a waiter at your favorite restaurant. Because although they could be good in better conditions, no one would hire someone that would do a movie like this.

The creatures were well done ( I especially liked the little bit of biological study done by Riddick ).  There were some things about the movie that are borrowed from other movies and stories.  I can't fault anyone for being displeased about that.  But I found the plot to be stimulating anyway. I had vaguely known about Vin Diesel from other work he had done, but I was impressed by his performance in the film in that he literally made the character line every crack and seam of the movie.  I found myself waiting for him to give me a little more of the character.  I will be looking forward to him in other films and I will make it a point to watch what he has written and directed.

585,pauline-7,A very pleasant surprise,9,29 February 2000,"When I first saw the previews, I was thinking 'oh no, another cheap sci-fi horror flick'...along the lines of, say, Supernova. But, after reading some positive reviews, I decided to go see it.Personally, I enjoyed it quite a bit. Even though it was an action flick and alot of the focus was on the action and special effects, I felt some of the characters were quite well developed... especially Riddick (Vin Diesel), Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell), and to an extent, the kid.Riddick was my favorite character, and was quite...captivating. I'm curious about how they did the special effect of the character...the eyes are quite interesting, and some of the contortions made me wonder if he was actually doing that or if it was special effects. The character itself has a very nice, dark sense of humor; and the interaction between him and Fry was, to me, almost pivotal to the movie.He was the type of character I would love to see more of, past the story on the planet. I'm curious if the actor is good in his other movies also. It might actually get me to go see Boiler Room.The photography was interesting also...almost too bright/washed out at times, truly giving a sense of how bright it was on the planet.The storyline itself is interesting, although at times it seemed a bit inconsistent and implausible (though, because of the speed, you may not realize that until you think about it later)...but the real value was the characters.I beg to differ with the cut line 'It takes evil to fight evil', though...personally, I didn't think the creatures were evil, merely reacting in a natural fashion in a way that was quite unfortunate to the human population. And I didn't consider Riddick evil, necessarily, either...underneath it all he was human, someone who may not have the same moral values as society is 'supposed' to have, but who did what he had to survive and prosper, in some very harsh circumstances.Altogether, a very pleasing flick...and one that I may just pay for again.",Pitch Black

Unlike other sci-fi's released around the same time, Pitch Black strays from any set formula, which in my opinion, makes it the most innovative film in the sci-fi/horror genre since Alien and Aliens. The acting is also top notch, the cast was well chosen and does not disappoint. The camera work was refreshingly different and highly energetic and adds to the breakneck pace of the movie. The plot twists are unexpected. Discard any preconceived judgements you've made on the sci-fi/horror genre because Pitch Black will shatter them all. Trust me, go see it!",Pitch Black

Such examples include ""Godzilla,"" ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace,"" and the recent example of cinematic stupidity, ""Supernova."" Those who felt completely ripped off by ""Supernova"" should go to see ""Pitch Black.""  The ""Pitch Black"" experience will remove the sour taste left by ""Supernova."" In an age where character development has been all but forgotten, ""Pitch Black"" returns to us our ability to develop a kinship (or in some cases, disgust) toward the actors on the screen.  Another selling point for this movie is a genuine trace of realism; although the story doesn't necessarily turn out the way you'd like it to, it concludes in a way that is believable and reasonable, with just a hint of Romanticism.  Vin Diesel, Rhada Mitchell, and Keith David are superb. All in all, an extreme movie experience for any fan of the ""Alien"" series or ""Starship Troopers.""

590,kennethm-2,Entertaining,7,13 March 2000,"This movie was more entertaining than I expected.  The basic premise -- a starship runs into trouble, crash lands on an alien planet, and the crew is eaten one-by-one by the locals -- is hardly original, but the execution is good and the result doesn't feel cliched.  The movie maintains tension throughout and manages to shock occasionally, something horror movies often find hard to do these days.The characters are more interesting and have a little more depth than usual. Radha Mitchell does a good job of conveying the vulnerability of the pilot, though she does seem a little miscast at times (isn't she a little too, well, blond for this kind of movie?).  Vin Diesel has a lot of on-screen charisma, although his character is a too unflappable to convey the emotion that would have made the ending stronger.  Nevertheless, I thought it worked.  Perhaps the director didn't want the movie to be /too/ dark.I could quibble about the world conveyed here -- why, for example, is there a breathable amount of oxygen in the air without plants or seas to maintain it?  What do all the predators eat?  And what do they do in-between eclipses -- watch cable TV?  Why does that gas giant have two sets of rings and how does the second one stay in orbit at a higher latitude (not inclination) than the equator?  (Or did I miss-see something in the effects?)  That said, this movie still doesn't strain credulity the way others have.  The visual and lighting effects convey an effective sense of being on another planet (as opposed to, say, being in Queensland Australia).  The aliens are mercifully unhumanoid and even appear to have complex behaviors other eating starship crewmen.So if the previews for ""Mission to Mars"" had you psyched for an SF movie, skip that one and go to this instead -- you'll be less likely to be disappointed.  I actually felt like seeing it a second time, though at $8.50, it's hard to justify.",Pitch Black

Finally, it came to my University where I can watch it for free...and thank goodness it was free.There were many promising characters and a very promising plot.  However, this sci-fi movie fell into the hole of a horrible 'B' movie.  The special effects were great and the action was decent.  The problem lies in the badly developed characters...except for Vin Diesel's.  There seems to be a character to fit every niche of society.  Dialogue between the characters seemed to be forced and rather boring...once again the exception being Diesel.Then there is the over simplified plot.  There is absolutely no thought required to view this film.  As long as one can tell the difference between a human and an alien, you're all set.

You are taken on a rollercoaster ride of human emotions.  It has everything, from religion to winged creatures of the night. It was interesting to find a myriad of one liners in this film that actually make you laugh out loud.All the characters are well defined but the jewel in Pitch Black's crown is Richard B Riddick played by the multi-talented Vin Diesel.  It is his portrayal of the pre-judged and mis-understood convict that leaves the biggest impact on the viewer. Even when he is not in camera shot you can feel Riddick's presence.

So there aren't many movies that surprise me or impress me. The latest scifi movies like Supernova or the disappointing Star Wars didn't kick me out of my chair.So why the hell did this movie does that to me. The story is bogus to me, a ship crashes on a deserted planet (they always do) and they remaining crew are all stereotyped figures (hero, looser, murderer, chicken, etc).The fun part is that the movie went unexpectedly from a `how to survive on a planet' to a `how to survive an killing alien colony'. The idea with the eclipse, returning once every 22 years, was very unexpected indeed en turned the movie from an over-lighted to a dark horror like movie. At that point the movie became really interesting.The FX we're very good and made the creatures reminded me of the once used in `starship troopers'. The cast was very diverse and the murderer `Riddick' played a impressive role. The storyboard was simple though because off the turningpoint (light to dark) enough and catching.Well let me tell you this, if you're a scifi-horror fan like in the Aliens trilogy, rent or buy this movie. If not, don't bother, this will only annoy your dislikes for scifi movies.Later, Dennisp.s.

He did a great job of turning a drawing of a monster into a 3d virtual moving creature that starves for blood.I think Vin Diesel did a great job of being his character, Richard B. Riddick. I also liked how Radha Mitchel really got into the film.The lighting on this movie was excellent! They put in just enough light so you could see the outline of each object or character. I really enjoyed all the slow motion action that was inserted into the film. The monsters looked very realistic. They didn't look as if they were added in, but as if they were really there attacking the small tribe of survivors.The only bad thing was I had no idea what slam city was until I looked it up on pitchblack.com but if I watched the movie again I probably would have figured it out. I think everyone did a very good job of acting their character. The casting was great. Even though I didn't know the cast, I'm sure this film will make them well known.

It seems that Jim and Ken Wheat spent a lot of time working out the most convoluted way that this film could be presented.A freak crash-land on a desert planet, devoid of life... only it's not devoid of life it has millions of horrific flesh-eating creatures living under its surface.  Hang on though, they are afraid of the light and the suns never set on this planet.  Phew!  Uh-oh, once every 22 years a conjunction of planets means that the planet is plunged into pitch black. Big problem.  What they need is someone who can see in the dark.  Luckily they have someone who can.  Unluckily he is a re-captured escaped convict who has committed many mass-murders.  Things are not really easy, are they. Take away any weapons or real means of power and they are all in trouble.
The first half of this film is excellent, with a good command of suspense. I watched this film late at night in the dark and it was very effective. The second half (you know how it is with horror: the bit where they show the monsters) was not quite as effective, but had some reasonable action to keep the plot moving.  Competent acting from another ex-neighbours cast member, as well as the rest of the cast.The other thing I liked was the use of colour in the photography for the different colours of the suns.  It looked really nice in the first half before the suns went down and it went all black.In summary:  Worth watching.  Competent and good fun, but will not be a classic in years to come.",Pitch Black

I was extremely and pleasantly surprised and satisfied with it.  The cinematography played a great part in the effect of the film.Since sci-fi is an underrated genre in both fiction and film (with a exceptions, of course) it can often fall prey to the cliches that are often the main structure of it.  But not with this film -- again, I have to agree with EW, that Pitch Black takes the classic cliches (the crash onto a seemingly dead, desert planet, the usual mixture of survivors, the threat of an unknown alien presence) and -- just as they are becoming apparently cliched -- twists and spins them off into a very different angle.

And a good indicator (for me), to what is a bad film, is when I just want it to end, and that's exactly what I thought, not even halfway through watching this.It's hairthin plot, - spaceship crashes on a desert planet, and the survivors attempt to find a way off it by endlessly traipsing across sand dunes and deserted townships looking for another ship to fly home in (which is conveniently provided for them).  And then there are the alien creatures (uninventively handicapped by an aversion to light) who pose a constant threat to the would be space travellers during the night.  But in comes Vin Diesel (whom I havent seen in a decent film yet... yes, XXX sucked) who, averse to the light but, attired in his shades that look more like diving goggles, eventually comes to the aid of the others with his ability to see in the dark.Anyway, in a nutshell, Pitch Black suffers from a poor script, a substandard cast (Radha Mitchells' American accent is one of the worst I've heard), but most importantly, an unoriginal premise, unsuccessfully rehashed.  It is substandard fare, prosaic with very little going for it except for some nice special effects here and there, but ultimately hard to sit through to the end.",Pitch Black
621,dexMilano,Very enjoyable movie even if the premise are from a B movie,8,13 February 2011,"This movie is based on a classic stereotype of SciFi (unknown planet, alien monsters, a hero, ...) but special effect are not intrusive at all; from many points of view it remembers to me Alien saga and there is a good level of tension. In the story high importance for women roles: an action movie for female public? I don't like Vin Diesel as an actor and this movie is not an exception (even if it is his first relevant movie) but the story and the directions are very good and make this movie very interesting. Interesting are also some ideas: the dark sight, the monsters (even if the way they see is really weird), the bad guy that became ah hero and save everyone.",Pitch Black
622,billyboy81,"Vin Diesel, as we all remember him, Tough, hard and without mercy, the bad guy you hate to love or was it the other way around?",9,10 June 2003,"This is no ordinary movie, not one bit. In fact, it is  one of the most exiting movies I have ever seen in quite some time. It starts when a ship filled with convicted criminals and tourists crashes on a lifeless planet with three suns. They are forced to adapt to the harsh planet fast, or they will die. Even after they adapted themselves, their continuance of life is not a fact. When darkness falls the monsters appear. When mysterious deaths and the use of every possible help they can get, they release the chains of convicted murderer Richard B Riddick ; Whos eyes was surgically enhanced when told he was never to see light again so long as he lived ; Played superbly by actor Vin Diesel which made a real breakthrough with this movie. This saga contains everything, betrayal, plotting, and the uncertainty of which really the bad guy is. This movie is borne by the magnificent work by the director David N. Twothy. It never grow dull or predictable. Techincally the film is very good, the three suns shining bright, the pitch darkness and the monsters that overwhelm the planet with their horrific sounding ultra-sound they use to 'see'. It fits under the genre Horror/Sci-Fi/Thriller which in other words mean that it is extremely thrilling and entertaining. The elaborate special effects,amazing story and great acting makes this movie a must see.",Pitch Black

The movie was B movie quality at best. The plot dragged, Diesel came off as one dimensional and Radha came off as whiny. I didn't want to root for either character and I didn't care what happened to either of them. As the movie progressed I became angry at the performers and the filmmakers; I felt like they were subjecting me to some form of sick torture and I never so desperately wanted to walk out of a movie before in my entire life.",Pitch Black

625,TallBlackNCrazy,Vin Diesel's Only Acting Role of Merit,9,21 April 2006,"I'm a guy. And as a guy, I generally dislike Vin Diesel. Seriously, every guy dislikes Vin Diesel. You can't help but dislike him. Seeing him destroy planes, cars, and the like, and then hearing his ""i've been trained in the fine art of acting"" commentaries makes any guy of any sort completely and totally sick to his stomach. This having been said, Pitch Black is without a doubt the best vehicle he could have acted in.Pitch Black is your basic ""we're trapped somewhere with an ominous overtone"". Like all movies of this type, something horrible happens, in this instance, a spaceship carrying them on one leg of separate journeys, a handful of people survive, and they strike out to find out have to get off of the rock they've been stranded on. The catch? One of them is a stone cold killer, who has no regard for human life, and will kill them before he even introduces himself to them or the audience.I know, that's a cliché of the most intimidating proportions, but you have to understand, the evil man that kills people isn't their biggest concern. Being stranded on a deserted planet with no signs of civilization isn't their chief concern. While digging graves for those who didn't survive, they stumble across what causes the desolation. That's when things get good. You see, Diesel's character, Riddick has a unique ability which, coupled with his incredible abilities to kill, can save everyone, or doom everyone.Ultimately, this twist, along with a superb acting job from Vin Diesel, Cole Hauser, and Radha Mitchell. I know, Vin Diesel isn't known for his acting, but this role suits his skills. Namely, looking and talking tough.All in all, throw in a superb unexpected ending, a thorough fleshing out of characters, and you have this little gem which almost launched a trilogy. Fortunately, the second iteration was so grandiose and extreme, it failed miserably in the box office. I say fortunately, because I sincerely don't like Vin Diesel.",Pitch Black
626,NGMAPS,Fill your minds with intensely beautiful horror,10,13 November 2003,"(VERY mildly spoilerish)I must start by saying that I'm not usually impressed by science-fiction, so Pitch Black (2000) was a pleasant surprise. It had me hooked from the very beginning with rhythm, intensity and visual outburst that left me fascinated and glued to my seat. I'm very happy to say that this movie was the best (okay, at least *one* of the best) science fiction piece that I've seen in a long, long time.The plot in short might sound simple -- a (space) ship crashes on a supposedly deserted planet and the captain, Caroline Fry (impressive Radha Mitchell), must lead the survivors to safety. At first, a cold-blooded murderer, Riddick (Vin Diesel, who plays the role with very believable spare style), might seem like the group's biggest problem but as the dusk starts crawling in, the creatures of the night start awakening... This leads to a desperate attempt to escape from the bloodthirsty predators, which, as we all can guess, does not lead to a happy family picnic.It's not the plot itself that makes the movie worth watching -- after all, let's face it, if you strip it down to the basics it's not *that* original -- but the skill in which it's told. The story flowed forward, didn't leave me yawning (at least not much) in any point. The directing was fabulous work. This was a very visual, even beautiful movie; the purple night view was a real treat. Although, 'beautiful' might not be the right word to use; yes, the images shown were candy to the eye, but they also added a touch of unspecified grotesqueness, eeriness, as if something was just about to burst out from under the still surface. (Not to mention that the monsters were really well done, they looked realistic, which seems to be rare nowadays [maybe people just can't be bothered to make them look real...])I did not only enjoy the visual side of the movie but also the psychological aspect of the story. During the movie we get to see the characters unraveling -- some of them fall, some of them rise -- but what fascinated me the most was the developing of the character of Riddick. I enjoyed watching the change in him throughout the movie. To go even further, the other thing I enjoyed a lot with Riddick was the incredibly well and originally executed UST (Unresolved Sexual Tension) between Fry and him that ""didn't"" (you'll get what I mean once you see it). [One can't deny that they had chemistry. Don't even try or I'll seek you out and make you listen to me playing Chopsticks until you scream *grin*] It was fresh. As Radha Mitchell once put it (a modified quote), ""Pitch Black is a really sexy movie with no sex"", which is what makes it even more so interesting.So, to summarize, I recommend this movie -- even if you're really not a fan of ""space stories"". The suspense was kept until the very end and, what's important, we were (or at least I was) left wanting for more. If you can't be bothered to think about psychology, subtext and such (as is my bad habit), you'll still find Pitch Black highly entertaining. Just kick off your shoes and enjoy.",Pitch Black
627,lrkmead,I was pleasantly surprised.,6,22 December 2003,"Having seen the coming attractions for Chronicles of Riddick and learning that the main character is based upon the main character in Pitch Black, I rented it having never heard of it.  Never expecting much from Vin Diesel, I was very surprised to have really enjoyed the movie.  In some ways reminiscent of Tremors, I thought the story was gripping, character development was better than average, direction was excellent, and Vin actually brought some credibility to the character.",Pitch Black
628,ParisHilton0422,What I thought of this movie...,10,30 May 2004,"Oh my gosh! this was one of the best Sci-fi movies i have ever seen, and quite frankly i can't stand Sci-fi films.Vin Diesel and his co-workers made this movie really enjoyable!!I also must say that Vin diesel is by far the most sexiest and most talented male actors i have seen. Keep it up Vin! your doing great!! As for everyone else good job. i thought the drama and suspense kept the viewers really intrigued. again, great job everyone and i 'm rooting for you Vin.Sincerely yours, Alexandra",Pitch Black
629,fractalmama,delicious thriller,10,30 June 2004,"As a dyed in the wool sci fi fan it has been years since I've seen anything come out of the Hollywood machine that was so smart and spine tingly at the same time (Carpenter's The Thing comes to mind). The CGI is great - mostly seamless, Diesel is a real sexy anti-hero and the dialogue really keeps things moving. Vin Diesel is a rare one that can pull off the stunts of an action sci fi thriller and not come across as a large block of wood with a toothy smile. I went after this movie when it came out following the career of Claudia Black from Farscape and found a new favorite in Diesel - but still waiting to see Black in a more substantial role. Now all that being said no film is without flaws and if you have watched enough sci fi or horror then the 'plot twist' at the end was lined up for us from the beginning but I for one didn't care in that I fell hook line and sinker for Riddick and wanted to find out what he would and wouldn't do and it was such a delicious way to get there. I'm greatly looking forward to Chronicles of Riddick and if you have the where with all to follow a character and not just a blockbuster then go check out Dark Fury too. It is a great segway and though brief is a good character study.",Pitch Black
630,hostagtj,Less (FX) is more....,10,8 July 2004,"Like Spiderman 2, this movie succeeds because if focuses on character development and emotion. FX and action do not overwhelm the story, but rather serve to advance the story and our investment in it, as good cinema should. Too bad Pitch Black 2 moved away from this formula! Radha Mitchell makes a substantial impact in a Sigourney Weaver (Ripley/Alien) role. But this is not an Alien knock-off.... Real, flawed characters in a morality play touching on issues spanning the existence of God to the redemption of even the most cold-blooded of killers. On more superficial levels, Pitch Black also serves as a good popcorn movie, with funky lighting effects, good tension, and cool creature FX....",Pitch Black
631,tasteless-honey-736-36938,Average and quite disappointing,5,26 November 2013,"Let me be specific why i called that disappointing movie because its story is quite boring n plain with no twist at-all.it could be ignored as there are many films with simple plot.but id film is carry star names like Vin Diesel etc then u expect a bit more.few people are stranded at some new planet after crash and only there hope is to escape through space craft abandoned by some early settlers.the alien predator are same like we have seen in some ""crash and survive"" type of alien movies.scenes were pretty bad directed some times.it does not have any interesting element.quite boring concept ""person with no faith + person with faith"" was repeated again.so if you guys are Sci-Fi fans you will be very very disappointed from this.so i will recommend you to avoid if you have some other option.",Pitch Black
632,eljmsn,so horrible it was actually painful...,1,6 March 2005,"I'm not going to beat around the bush here, so I'll just start by saying that this is the worst movie i've ever seen. I've watched some pretty horrible movies but watching Pitch Black was the closest I've ever come to actually walking out of the theatre (prevented only by my refusal to pay for a whole movie and only watch half (and my fear that if i walked out i would miss the only good part.... which incidentally never arrived...)). Forget about the second rate trying-to-be-a- sci-fi-short-story plot, the horrible acting and the un-pronounceable/easy to confuse character names. Though they all contributed to the ""awful""rating what really took the cake was the actual physical pain caused by the movie. When I go from no light to blinding brightness, it causes my eyes more than just a little bit of pain. So we get either ""can't see because there's no light"" or ""can't see because I'm BLIND"" ?... great film making, good job. I get that its called ""Pitch Black"" but if i wanted to sit in complete darkness and listen to people talking I could just turn off my living room lights and turn on the radio. Though i suppose if was to properly simulate the experience of watching Pitch Black, i would have to get a friend (or enemy) to stand right in front of me and (at random intervals) flash a thousand watt light bulb in my eyes. good times... though i suppose at least I'd never have to sit through the pain of accidentally seeing vin diesel again and reliving the whole horrific experience that was Pitch Black.",Pitch Black

The storyline was great and they picked the best people to play each character. This is a must see for sci-fi lover's! It's filled with all the futuristic qualities it needed to be a good show. 1. crash landing on unknown planet, 2. death of the leader and subsequent promotion of the next in command, 3. bad guy turning into the saving grace, and 4. eventual escape of the survivors. It has mystery, speculation, faith, and makes you root for the ""so-called"" bad guy in the end. Of course, there is the disappointment of losing one of the starring characters (Radha Mitchell) but that's what makes it great! The good guys can't always live!",Pitch Black

636,NightfallRaven,How to survive in pitch black?,8,10 May 2005,"Pitch Black is a survival story. It's about how to survive in an hostile, alien world against even more hostile enemies. The task gets even more difficult when the nearest enemies can be found within your own surviving group.The plot of Pitch Black is quite usual and has been seen several times before in different variations. But what makes this movie shine above others, is it's well-written characters.The group consists of very different people with few more interesting than the others: Jack, a boy with a secret; Fry, a pilot having hard time with her own conscience; Johns, a bounty- hunter with a drug-habit; Imam, a holy man facing the fact that God is sometimes cruel and Riddick, a convict and a murderer learning to value others, not only himself. Characters start to live in the movie. They aren't only paper like in many other movies of this genre. You start to care for the characters, especially for Riddick though that feels quite odd. He is supposed to be the bad guy. In this movie, the line between light and pitch black is very thin. All characters are familiar with both.Other thing that works in this movie is the casting. Rarely do actors fit to their roles this well. Radha Mitchell is suitable for Fry. Cole Hauser brings the right amount of cruelness and sense of responsibility for Johns. But the most impressive work is done by Vin Diesel. He does great job as Riddick. In his hands Riddick is quite creepy, definitely very dangerous and also deep character, just as he is supposed to be.So, how do you survive in Pitch Black? Keep your friends close and enemies even closer.",Pitch Black
637,pop_yes_pop,Great movie,6,20 January 2007,"I'm not generally a Sci-fi fan, but i watch this movie whenever it comes on. It sets an unusual, and at times haunting tone, where you are often unsure who or what to root for with an element of simplicity that it's sequel was sadly unable to capture. First of all, it is not (as some sci-fi films *including it's sequel* can be) overly reliant on complicated governmental or moral systems, in fact, if it wasn't for the space travel and what not, the movie would be largely plausible if it were set in the present day. It is human, and you don't have to worry about understanding anything but being human to watch it.Also, considering that it's a ""b-movie"" it has some really excellent performances. Obviously, diesel steals the show (in what i would argue is possible his finest acting work to date), but all of the cast does well at portraying their varied and quirky group. Don't base your opinion of this film on it's successor, they are totally different pursuits. If you're sci-fi fan you'll like it, if you're an action fan you'll like it. It's a great movie.",Pitch Black
638,efrench,a captivating film,10,15 February 2007,"This is an often under-appreciated film. True, it's a sci-fi/horror film, generally not a genre which churns out many great movies. Also true, the sequels - Dark Fury and Chronicles of Riddick - aren't killer films. The concept, as far as science fiction goes, isn't that original either. The core of main characters and atmosphere of the film however, are why I rate it 10/10. Radha Mitchell plays the convincing protagonist ""Fry"" with great emotional involvement, drawing in viewers' sympathies along with their respect. Vin Diesel seems so natural as the cold and cynical prisoner Riddick it's almost frightening - Diesel was born for this role. Cole Hauser completes the trio of characters with an exceptional job as Riddick's captor Johns, a truly multi-dimensional and conflicted character whose interaction with Riddick makes for the most intriguing aspect of the movie. The atmosphere of this film is likewise exceptional, especially with regard to the contrasts presented between light and dark, and between the openness of the desert and the claustrophobia conjured up by the canyon. What a movie.",Pitch Black

The movie starts out with a space ship taking off with a monstrous criminal on board (Riddick). The trip is going OK until they crash land on a planet that seems deserted. However, they find out that the planet is rare in the fact that every 22 years the planets line up in a solar eclipse and the entire planet turns pitch black. Seems believable...... until they realize there also happen to be hundreds of aliens that thrive in darkness living on the planet - ironic? Well, that's possible too, until you factor in the chances that they happen to be on the planet right as the eclipse happens - which is a .0037% chance..... Oh, and one more thing..... Riddick has a rare talent - he is one of few people in the history of the universe that can see in the dark and must lead them to safety. - Yes, this is a science fiction movie, but I felt the story was written very poorly, with outlandish ideas and it wasn't helped by the horrendous acting by Diesel and his fellow co-actors.",Pitch Black

I didn't know Vin Diesel then, I just thought I was going to see another sci-fi ""Alien"" type movie with no-name actors. I enjoyed it at the time, thinking it was cool how the movie was so dramatically different having the beginning so light and the last so dark. The character of Riddick was cool...about as cool as a bad-ass tough-guy can get.Now, having seen the movie countless times, preferring the director's cut I enjoy the movie for three primary reasons: 1. Dialogue - Not many Sci-Fi movies have good duologue. Pitch Black has very good duologue with some moments of pure brilliance, in my opinion. 2. Character Development - Sure, the movie has its share of flat background characters...meat for the monsters if you will. But a few are developed nicely. Riddick, Carolyn, Johns, Imam and even Jack are all developed with some depth. You might even argue Paris but he was just an idiot. hehe 3. Story - It's just a cool story! With a great anti-hero...Riddick!",Pitch Black
