0,SnoopyStyle,faith-based tear jerker,7,22 November 2017,"Christy (Jennifer Garner) and Kevin Beam (Martin Henderson) have daughters Anna (Kylie Rogers), Abbie (Brighton Sharbino), and Adelynn (Courtney Fansler). They take care of animals with a giant dead tree in their yard. They attend the small Texas town church of Pastor Scott (John Carroll Lynch). Anna suddenly comes down with a mysterious illness and is in constant pain. Eventually, she's diagnosed with an incurable digestive disease. They are directed to specialist Dr. Nurko (Eugenio Derbez) in Boston. In desperation, Christy and Anna go see the doctor without the impossible-to-get appointment. Anna is shown kindness along the way like Boston waitress Angela (Queen Latifah). This is a real tear jerker especially with the suffering of young Anna. The acting is solid all around. I can do without the extended montages. This is a faith-based film. It gets a little heavy handed in the end. It would function more effectively by letting Anna's storytelling room to breathe. It tries to force it which diminishes Anna's tale to only the believers. This almost transcends the genre which could have been great.",Miracles from Heaven
1,tavm,"Miracles from Heaven was another touching true-life, faith-based movie",8,18 March 2016,"This was yet another true-life, faith-based movie that I decided to watch with my movie theatre-working friend since there wasn't anything else that's out right now I wanted to see. Jennifer Garner plays the Texas mom of a pre-teen daughter whose stomach has some kind of virus that causes it to be bloated. So she goes to an expert in Boston to try to find out what's wrong with her. But it's what happens when they come home and this girl then gets into an accident that the title is earned...I'll stop there and just say this was quite touching especially when something is revealed at the end involving a reporter who met both the mom and daughter earlier. So on that note, I recommend Miracles from Heaven.",Miracles from Heaven
2,sunwarrior13,Focusing On Motherhood And A Child's Struggling With A Fatal Disease,10,23 July 2016,"Jennifer Garner stars in this film entitled Miracles From Heaven that was based on the memoirs of Christy Beam that tells the story of how her daughter Annabel got miraculously cured from a fatal stomach disease when she accidentally fell head first thirty feet from a tree.Director Patricia Riggen gives us both an interesting and entertaining story that would probably touch many people especially mothers whether they maybe classified either as religious,non-religious,non-Christians,antagonistic non-God believers alike.The screenplay by Randy Brown starts the movie with focus on the Beam family - Christy and husband Kevin together with Annabel and sisters Adelynn and Abbie - living a well-to-do life at Texas and exhibiting characteristics of a great Christian family.Later,we get to see Annabel become gravely ill which was later discovered as pseudo-obstruction motility disorder.We witness Christy's ordeal as a mother as well as the pains and sufferings that Annabel has to go through from her disease being unable to be discovered by Texan doctors until she gets taken under care of Dr. Samuel Nurko of Boston Children's Hospital.Then the miracle takes place when Annabel and Abbie climbs thirty feet high in a tree in the backyard with the former meeting an accident by falling head first and later being discovered to be free of broken bones and scratches as well as her motility disorder.Just like what I have stated in the first paragraph,the film was definitely touching film regardless of how one identifies his/her belief towards God or Christianity.Garner did a wonderful job of portraying the mother Christy as the viewer will definitely cheer for her character as she goes through many struggles in helping her Annabel go through them and finding the best cure for her. Added to that,we also get to feel happy for her in the end after her daughter's miraculous healing. Although I must say that there were some parts of the film that was preachy about faith in God and Jesus as well as melodramatic moments with the amount of tears that Garner had to shed,I felt that they were done in good taste and were less manipulative unlike a typical Christian film or a Hallmark TV movie. Riggen did a good job of highlighting the issue of motherhood as well as the child's fearful experiences having a fatal disease.Finally,it tells us to never lose hope and always remain optimistic no matter what situation one is dealing with in life as ""miracles are everywhere"" and goodness is everywhere in life.Truly,an inspiring movie!!!",Miracles from Heaven
3,oscaralbert,Even the Miracles are bigger in Texas . . .,8,21 March 2016,". . . Sony Pictures Corp. informs us with its latest effort to apprise their share-holding owners in Japan of America's Religious Beliefs. The world certainly remembers that earlier Medical Miracle from the Lone Star State, in which an unknown bike rider contracted testicular cancer and nearly died. Yet this American Hero (named Lance Armstrong) was provided with a Miraculous Cure from Heaven and went on to win the world's premier endurance event, The Tour of France bike jaunt, 7 TIMES IN A ROW, something that has never been done before or since. Similarly, MIRACLES FROM HEAVEN (based upon a True Story as debuted on Fox ""News"") recounts a more recent Act of God, in which 10-year-old Anna Beam fell 30-feet down inside a Heavenly Hollow Cottonwood Tree and suffered a Spontaneous Remission of her genetic Intestinal Pseudoobstruction Disorder. (Kudos to actress Jennifer Garner, for managing to look so grievously pained throughout MIRACLES as Mom Christy Beam that viewers just KNOW that young Anna Beam must be a chip off her genetic block!) Sony's rendition of Anna's Butterfly Heaven featuring Monet's Lilypads is particularly well done. Sony is letting the World know that one needn't go back to the 1800s and stories of golden scrolls deciphered inside Magic Top Hats, or even the 1900s and tales of UFO landing spots to deify the RISKY BUSINESS dancing queen to access America's current Religious Superiority! Also, it's crucial not to overlook the Financial Miracle resulting from Anna's Trip to Heaven, because without it there could NOT have been a book OR a movie, and the Beam family would have been financially ruined due to the cost of Anna's illness. But, as it must say somewhere in the Holy Bible, ""Another day, another dollar!""",Miracles from Heaven
4,StevePulaski,Miracle on the dirt street,4,18 March 2016,"With Easter showing up a bit earlier this year, the local multiplex has once again resorted to looking like a lineup of Sunday mass topics, with The Young Messiah and now Miracles from Heaven. Despite making up the majority of believers in the United States, up until a few years ago, no studio was willing to go near faith-based property, but after the Kendrick brothers brought monstrous success to the genre, and God's Not Dead followed in its footsteps to utterly extraordinary earnings (so extraordinary you can look for the sequel in theaters on April 1st), the market is now being recognized by more studios like Pure Flix and even mainstream Hollywood.Miracles from Heaven was apparently a story that T.D. Jakes, with his production company, and executives at Columbia Pictures found so wonderful and potential-ridden that they had to pick it up for a wide release a week before one of the biggest Christian holidays of the year. Taking a first look at the film's trailer, concept, and poster, it immediately looks like the equally bad sister film to Heaven is for Real, that nauseatingly saccharine mess that came out two years ago. However, while Miracles from Heaven essentially levels the playing field for being about as cloyingly mawkish as that film, it admirably tries to focus on the characters that make up the story, in addition to their relationships with one another during certain calamity.The film, based on a true story, as you probably could've guessed just by the statement's ubiquity in recent years, revolves around the Beam family, a tight-knit bunch in Burleson, Texas with Christy and Kevin (Jennifer Garner and Martin Henderson) at the helm and their three girls. The prime focus, however, is on their ten-year-old daughter Anna (Kylie Rogers), who has been having extreme stomach pain and prolific bouts of vomiting for weeks on end. Repeated doctor visits diagnose relatively mild to moderate cases of lactose intolerance and ulcers, but Christy knows in her heart that this isn't something so simple. Call it mother's intuition.It turns out, Anna has a rare digestive disorder called pseudo-obstruction motility disorder, where the body thinks there is something obstructing the intestinal tact but there is no such blockage. It comes from the body's inability to properly breakdown and digest food, with the only solution being for the stomach to vomit the food back up. Of course, there is no known cure, but out of desperation, Christy and Anna fly out to Boston to meet Dr. Nurko (Eugenio Derbez), a doctor at Boston Children's Hospital who specializes in pediatric gastroenterology. For months, Anna is sick and in constant pain, to the point where she tells her mother she'd rather be dead. Miracles from Heaven directress Patricia Riggen (director of last year's miner drama The 33 and screenwriter Randy Brown do a great job at conveying the helplessness that plagues both Christy and Anna throughout the entire course of the film. However, one thing that keeps both of them strong to a certain degree is their faith and connection to the Lord. While Christy's dwindles as Anna's situation looks bleak, Anna, her father, and her sisters keep that sort of faith all the way down to a truly terrifying moment that changes the course of Anna's life forever.The incredulity is high in this film, but what would you expect from a film titled Miracles from Heaven that's also based on a true story? However, that doesn't justify the film's almost sickening emphasis on the sad and the melancholic through every scene. Even worse than sermonizing the word of God or some moral about absolute faith, Riggen and company decide to embellish every scene with a frothy musical score that practically works to extract tears and sentiment from the audience in the most unnatural way. For a 110 minute film, the result is a wearying example of what it means to really sentimentalize every little thing in movies, to the point where you imagine the film crew themselves shedding tears at the story and just wish they and the film itself would get a grip.There is also a conflicting narrative here that disturbs me, and the fact that it's glossed over so casually is also problematic. Part of Christy disassociating herself with the church comes after a group of churchgoing ladies suggest to her that Anna's suffering may be a result of Anna or both her and Kevin sinning. The scene is sickening in the sense that it looks to emphasize one of the many reasons why so many people are so disgusted with the church - the way it casually blames victims for their own suffering and has some assuming that if their lives are good, why can't everyone's life be good? This is a very real issue that should infuriate Christy, and while it does for a little while, it also doesn't stop her from eventually recommitting her life to the church. Even if you're going to shamelessly dub Miracles from Heaven a propaganda film, which it kind of is, to be fair, talk about going against your own propaganda.Miracles from Heaven's performances are all on-par with those commendable for basic melodrama that somehow bypassed being an Up TV favorite and got the privilege of a theatrical release, and the fantastical aspect Heaven is for Real chose to make a one-hundred minute film on, Miracles from Heaven chooses to make most of the third act about, which is another positive in that it doesn't lose focus. As faith-based films go, this one definitely realizes that the human side of things is what gets it the respectable points as a film, but forgets that the mawkish and over-sentimentalized route is another route that can make one entirely forget the important aspects of the film they just saw.",Miracles from Heaven
5,DKosty123,Inspiring & Too Amazing To Be Missed,8,25 October 2016,"I have often felt that everything happens for a reason and that reason is beyond reason. This film, based upon a true story, powerfully puts this message home. Jennifer Garner plays Christy Beam, mother of an ill young daughter who no one seems to be able to help. Her love for her daughter leads her and her family everywhere looking for help. There seems to be no solution.Finally, the family, after exhausting all avenues of hope, prays, and doctors comes home to face the end of her daughters life as best they can. The long road to nowhere has stretched the family to its limits and there seems to be no hope. This process runs more than 3/4's of the movie.On the way we meet Pastor Scott (John Carroll Lynch) who seem a lot like a Dr. Phil in the pulpit. Between the Pastor and the folks in the congregation, Christy Beam goes from loving God to questioning her faith in them. After they arrive home, with no hope, an emergency happens and everything changes for the better.The cast and direction is very effective here. Kylie Rogers as Anna Beam, Martin Henderson as Kevin Beam, Brighton Sharbino as Abbie Beam, Courtney Fansler as Adelynn Beam and Queen Latifah as Angela, a most unusual human angel fr sorts are all great in their roles. If you need an amazing thing, so real that the real people do cameos at the end of the film, you must catch this one. In these times when we often are brought into impossible situations with little hope, it is nice to feel good when something happens that can only be described as a miracle.",Miracles from Heaven
6,sddavis63,It Struck Home,7,14 July 2016,"I'll state right off that I'm a pastor. So I certainly have a bias in favour of faith, God and miracles. I've seen miracles happen - people who recover from illnesses after being told that there's no hope, with doctors who can't really explain why. And in all honestly, the vast majority of the time there is no miracle. People die of diseases after being told they have no hope. And as Christy Beam (played by Jennifer Garner) said as this movie came to a close - I don't really know why one person gets a miracle and so many others don't. I just know that they happen. I'm grateful for them. They do reveal to me that there's more to life than what we can see or touch. There's a dimension beyond anything we can fully understand, and whose workings are a mystery to us. So, in a sense, there's my disclaimer; a clear statement of my bias. And having said that, the strange thing is that I don't usually like these faith- based Christian movies. They're generally too formulaic, with the people of faith trying to convince the people without faith to have faith, and there's always some obnoxious atheist character who has to be convinced. But this movie went beyond the formula. Maybe that's why I liked it.The main characters in this true story are Annabel and Christy Beam. Mom and daughter. When just a little girl, Annabel was diagnosed with a terrible disease that caused her great pain, made her unable to eat, and basically left her slowly dying while she suffered. Annabel was played by a young actress named Kylie Rogers, who was superb. She portrayed Annabel in pain so believably, and yet she also captured a little girl's innocence in the midst of it all. I was extremely impressed. Garner as Christy was also very good. I liked Christy. Bursting out of the normal formula, Christy doesn't just believe that a miracle's coming. She questions faith. She questions God. She gets angry. She gives up on belief. She was real; a genuine person dealing with a horrible situation as best she could and as most people would. Garner has been credited with a great performance. I agree with that assessment - although, frankly, I thought Kylie Rogers was the highlight of the movie.What to make of the miracle? I honestly don't know. Kylie fell down the centre of a hollowed out old tree and landed head first. When she woke up, she was fine. Not only uninjured from the fall, but with her disease gone. While she was unconscious after the fall she says she had some sort of vision - visiting ""heaven"" and being told by God that she'd be fine. And she was. The specialist she was seeing in Boston said that it was possible that the fall essentially re-booted her central nervous system and got her digestive system working again. Could be. That could also be a miracle in itself. As far as her claims to have spoken with God are concerned? Might have been real; might have been a dream or hallucination. Only Annabel knows. All that really matters is that a little girl who wasn't supposed to get better got better.Researching the story, I found that for the most part the details of the movie are accurate. A few things have been added for dramatic purposes, and perhaps to acclimate the viewer to the possibility of miracles. For example, Christy and Annabel did in fact have an appointment with Dr. Nurko in Boston. They didn't just show up unannounced. But it all still comes down to this - a little girl who wasn't supposed to get better got better. Who can argue with that. How you believe it happened is a matter of faith.This is a decent movie. It drew me into the story and touched a chord with me. (7/10)",Miracles from Heaven
7,Hellmant,One of those rare Christian movies that's worth the time to watch!,7,3 August 2016,"'MIRACLES FROM HEAVEN': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A faith-based Christian drama flick, adapted from the memoir (of the same name) by Christy Beam. Beam tells the story of her 10-year-old daughter; who suffered from an incurable disease, and then was suddenly cured from it (after having a near-death experience). The movie deals with Christy's struggles with her faith, while coping with her daughter's tragic illness. Jennifer Garner stars in the film, as Christy Beam, and it costars Kylie Rogers, Martin Henderson, Eugenio Derbez and Queen Latifah. It was directed by Patricia Riggen (who also helmed 'THE 33', last year), and it was scripted by Randy Brown (who also wrote 2012's 'TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE'). The movie only received mixed reviews from critics, but it did surprisingly well at the Box Office (where viewers raved about it). I enjoyed it as well.The story takes place in Burleson, Texas (in 2011). Christy Beam (Garner), and her husband Kevin (Henderson), are devastated to learn that one of their daughters, 10-year-old Anna (Rogers), suffers from pseudo-obstruction motility disorder. The disease makes it so Anna is unable to consume food, without tubes. It's also deadly, and incurable. Christy doesn't understand how this could have happened, to her Christian family (that always goes to church regularly). She struggles to keep her faith, and then is amazed to learn of her daughter's miraculous recovery (possibly because of it).I was raised strictly Catholic, and I always attended church regularly (as a child), so I'm always interested in any movies that deal with religion. I'm not usually that impressed, with the average 'overly preachy' ones (that mostly just 'preach to the choir'), but this one is really well made. Garner's performance is amazing, and Riggen's direction is equally as impressive. The movie seems a little clichéd, and gimmicky, but for the most part it's pretty emotional (I cried multiple times). It's also kind of inspiring. The film is actually one of those rare Christian movies that's worth the time to watch!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/UotWSwc37KA",Miracles from Heaven
8,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,4,6 July 2016,"Miracles from HeavenThe problem with God performing miracles is that he automatically expects you to return the favour.Which means the cured kid in this drama has one whooper of an IUO.Stricken with an ailment that prevents her from digesting food, 10-year-old Anna Beam (Kylie Rogers) undergoes rigorous testing at the behest of her mother (Jennifer Garner) that ultimately concludes that Anna has intestinal pseudoobstruction.It's not until she falls 30-feet from a cottonwood tree and has a near-death experience that Anna finds relief from the excruciating pain. Even more astounding is Anna's account of her encounter with the big man upstairs.Christian propaganda masquerading as wholesome family entertainment, this mawkish mockup of the mother's own memoirs emulates movie-of-the-week acting and storytelling with a side of Sunday school sermonizing thrown in for good measure.In fact, Millennials would be more inclined to attend Sunday services if church had an omelet station.

9,ops-52535,a happy story,8,1 April 2019,"I shall not nag to much , but this was a film that gave warmth and safe feelings to watch. even though smeared in with a gospel like glory of religion, it worked. basicly its because what the actors does, and secondly, i guess the basis for the whole production, a good book. it seems like we all need hope in our everydaylife, and miracles from heaven may be a good prescription, wether your a believer or not.having had a seriously ill child myself,that are sound and well now, who struggled with a smile every day from aged 0,5 to 4, sends me right back to then., i wont say that it was a miracle that saved him, but you can for sure tell we asked for one every day for 3 years(and still do....).its a film that can be seen by everyone, i'm sure even the dead would find this film comforting whereever they are somewhere, so i, the grumpy old man , put my recommendations to this film.",Miracles from Heaven
10,digitalbeachbum,Another publicity stunt for religion,1,21 November 2017,"When I saw this movie I was reminded of ""The Blind Side"" which was completely fabricated to fit the narrative of the family involved with the story.A movie which is filled with lies and fabrications of real life events of a sick little girl who falls down a dead tree which she never was upside down the entire time as the movie misleads the viewers. She was actually right side up and was able to lay down in the fetal position.The story of their Jesus is an afterthought and added to fulfill their self sustaining prophecy that their religion is the best and you need to believe in it because look at what our god did. Well why did your god give your child the condition in the first place? Just so that at a later time events like these can happen? What a crock.So called ""miracles"" like this happen all the time and not only with christians, but hindus, muslims and buddhists. It happens all the time, in every country and with every belief system. When they do happen they always give credit to (insert religious icon)The acting is horrible, the direction worse and the script is a complete lie.I look no further than the scene with the father watching television where the commentator says ""climate change is false..."" The second example is the father (Ben) who stands up in church to speak about his daughter who had cancer (which isn't real). This is one of two examples in the movie where I find the story is designed to fit a narrative for the familie's views.",Miracles from Heaven
11,matthewssilverhammer,No,4,2 April 2016,"There are certain movies that are catnip for the American Bible Belt: faith-centered family dramas based on ""actual events"" that have a thick undercurrent of patriotism (Dolphin Tale, The Blind Side, Simon Birch, Soul Surfer). Miracles from Heaven, an ABC Family movie-of-the-week masquerading as cinema, is the latest in that trend. And while it may be one of the better films aiming for the Christian-demographic, that's like calling a tune the happiest Nickelback song. It's a (mostly) harmlessly bad outing whose most egregious sin is its incessant pandering. This true story is every parent's nightmare: a little girl inexplicably contracts an incurable disorder, and the faith of her family is understandably tested. Rogers, as the sick girl, is actually really good and provides some of the only gravitas in a movie otherwise filled with feather-weight ideas on faith and Christianity. Garner, as the mother, continues to prove she should stick to lighter fare, as her dramatic chops are just plain not there. Even with the shameful yet effective manipulation, her inability to get beyond soap-opera melodrama too often distracts from the tragedy. Not that this is purely a downer of a movie, in either quality or content. Despite knowing (just from the title alone) that something good will change this family's circumstances, director Riggan does a decent enough job of keeping us in the family's mindset, especially during the climactic tree sequence. It even makes up for some of its indulgent tendencies with a message about looking for the little miracles we all experience. Unfortunately, it's all readily shaded by blatant manipulation and unbelievable stupidity in the minor characters, sins that are hard to forgive.",Miracles from Heaven
12,lisafordeay,A miracle it sure is,6,26 February 2021,Miracles From Heaven is a 2016 Christian Drama based on the true story of a 10 year old girl named Annabel Beam who suffers from an incurable disease and has months left to live. So her mother Christy would stop at nothing to save her little girl even if it means travelling to Boston to find a cure. But will Annabel get cured or will she be saved by God?.Jennifer Garner is a very good actress. I've always loved her since 13 Going On 30 and have been watching her evolve ever since. The climax to this film was very far fetched as spoilers Annabel falls off a tree and is stuck there for hours unconscious. But when she miraculously recovered and was cured from her disease thanks to God who she claims met her when she left her lifeless body for a while and he cured her. Half the time I was thinking was this a hoax or as what the film suggests a miracle from heaven.Queen Latifah and Eugenio Debrez stars.Decent film,Miracles from Heaven
13,subxerogravity,The Miracles are not just from Heaven.,5,18 March 2016,"It was a well done movie, that pulled on the right heart strings to get your emotions running. Anna Beam's story is a heartwarming one. sometimes It was hard to watch this girl's story unfold on the movie screen, it was painful watching her go though her illness and watch her realize nothing can be done and almost give up. You could not help to be touched by it no matter what your belief system.It was a good leading role for Jennifer Garner. She did a great job as Christy Beam, a mom trying to cope with the fact that her daughter is not coming back from an illness they have no cure for, and wonders why God would allow this. While everyone is telling her to have faith she finds it hard cause the situation is out of her control.Speaking of faith, this story is a lot about how it takes a village. The Miracle from heaven is actually coming from right here on Earth. It was about how everyone in Anna Beam's life and the people she touched with her story came together and embraced her with positive vibes, which always helps.I'm not a religious man, but I saw this movie as more than just a film about Faith in god, but I saw something the proves how good the church can be. It's all about not just one persons faith, but everyone together that creates the Miracle. Very nice!",Miracles from Heaven

The story took place in Burleson, Texas. One of Jennifer's 3 daughters, 10 year old Kylie, gets deathly sick-a parents nightmare-and is taken to doctor after doctor, with no conclusive answer as to why she is sick. Martin plays Jennifer's husband. Finally, a doctor in Boston tells them that Kylie has a rare, incurable intestinal disorder that is a death wish-I did mention it was incurable, didn't I? Queen is a local Bostonian waitress that befriends Jennifer & Kylie when they are in Boston getting treatments. After going back to Texas, Kylie has an accident that should have hurt her pretty bad, but instead, it cures her-I am not giving too much away here because you see this in the trailers. The acting is good, the story is good, and most importantly, the preachy attitude is minimal. There is a nice message at the end about how miracles can be found almost everywhere, if you take the time to look for them. They also show the real Beam family, just as the end credits start. It's rated ""PG"" for thematic material, accident & medical issues and has a running time of 1 hour & 49 minutes.

The themes of faith and prayer are not something she's shown interest in before, so it was a surprise that she ended up liking it as much as she did. I liked the fact that this movie challenged her thinking a little bit. If the child was sick, then fell 20 feet and got trapped in a tree, how do you account for her recovery?

18,truemythmedia,Actually a Movie,7,26 April 2019,"I was dreading this movie. On the surface, it is everything I dislike about Christian film. By what it emphasized, the marketing made me think that I was in for a film where the struggles of life, while real, would be quickly gotten through, and the film would be mainly focusing on what happens after God has answered our prayers and we refuse to hide our light under a bushel. Granted I had not seen much of the marketing, I tend to avoid trailers and hype, and I've been burned by Christian film more times than I can count.So let's just say my expectations were low.This film surprised me though. That isn't to say it's all good, but I would definitely take the pile of films put out by Christian studios and imprints and put this one near the top of the stack. It certainly is more deserving of a theatrical release than most.",Miracles from Heaven
19,rannynm,Loved it! Makes you think about the miracles in your own life!,10,30 March 2016,"I love this movie! Miracles from Heaven is very inspirational, very religious and all about miracles. It really makes you think about all the miracles that are happening in your life. Miracles from Heaven is about a young girl named Anna Beam (Kylie Rogers) who has a very rare stomach disorder. Her family pulled out all the stops to help her. When an amazing event happens it changes everything. This is a real story and it is very heartwarming. The Beam family's faith in God is undeniable. They are very religious and go to church every Sunday. Even if you are not really religious, I still think that you would enjoy this movie.All of the characters in Miracles from Heaven are likable, but especially Christy Beam (Jennifer Garner). She is very believable and makes you feel really sad when she is sad and happy when she is happy. She is a mom that a lot of people would want to have as their own, because she would never give up and she works very hard. The dad, Kevin Beam (Martin Henderson) is a very good dad and cares a lot about his kids. My favorite character is Dr. Nurko (Eugenio Derbez). He is very funny and he works very hard to make all the kids in the hospital happy. And if I was ever really sick I would want a doctor like him.My favorite scene is at the end of the movie where it is showing all the miracles that happen in their lives. This scene really makes you think about what miracles could be happening to you and it makes you feel great about other people around you.The moral of the story is never to give up on hope. Even though Anna struggles and she ends up in the hospital many times, her family never gives up and tries to help her. You learn to love Anna and root for her along the way. This movie made a lot of people in the audience cry and tear up. I rate Miracles from Heaven five out of five stars because it is very inspirational and it makes you really think about what miracles you could be having in your life. I recommend the ages 7 to 18 because there are some surgical procedures, but they're not that graphic. Go see this movie on March 16 in theaters near you. Reviewed by Mia A., KIDS FIRST!

Luckily, it was a discounted Red-Box rent, and at $0.27 maybe a fair price.

Fast-forwarding got employed quite a bit on cheery,sappy music montages. The story intrinsically has an interesting core, but the religious need to explain the unexplained saps that interest right out to the point of folly. It may be true that the family themselves are religious, which makes the movie more accurate, but it doesn't matter - the movie is kool-aid for the kool-aid drinkers. By the end of the movie all that matters from the director perspective are that the family are good Christians again with faith stronger than ever. Heck, a Pagan even joins the bus by the very end without his daughter also unexplained, but he's in Church (finally). Had the creators toned down the blaring ""faith"" horn by a large degree, it might've worked. 4/10 - not recommended for Pagans.",Miracles from Heaven
21,krocheav,Some Situations Just Challenge Explanation,8,8 December 2016,"Having been initially wary of how well this film would play out - I ended up surprised at just how successfully it was handled. To begin with, it features a sterling performance by American Jenifer Garner. She absolutely shines in her difficult role as mother to young daughter Anna Beams. Anna's story could too easily be palmed off as clichéd but, being based on factual situations makes it considerably different from other movies with similar content. It tells of Anna's astounding life changing experiences while fighting off a rare, deadly digestive disorder. Young Kylie Rogers as Anna, proves herself to be quite a formidable star.The screenplay by Randy Brown is adapted from Christy Beam's (Anna's mother) factual book. Christy examines the many challenges and inspirational experiences shared by her daughter and family. Garner plays Christy, while New Zealand actor Martin Henderson (""Little Fish"" '05) turns in good support as her husband. The family have all moved to live on his newly established Veterinary farm in Texas and are set to be sorely tested, emotionally and financially. Another noteworthy performance comes from multi-talented Eugenio Derbez, playing a highly interesting character who's based on real-life specialist Dr Samuel Nurko. Other cast members in supporting roles also execute their characterizations very well indeed. And, that surprising 'Tree' scene is rather unsettling.American based Peruvian cinematographer and director of photography Checco Varese (AKF: ""The 33"" in 2015) supplies a wide array of glorious visuals. These are accompanied by a worthy music score from veteran Roman composer Carlo Siliotto. The whole work is nicely tied together with great flare by talented Mexican director Patricia Riggen, who keeps this true story running at just the right tempo. Viewers with tendencies towards little or no faith, or those who maybe cynical towards situations involving the inexplicable - might find this movie could be wasted on them - however, no matter what your view, it is difficult to dispute the confirming evidence of documented medical records!. If your'e looking for a faith-lift based on actual events, then you won't be let down. Introducing the real-life characters over the final credits is a master touch. It's good to know this movie was so successful - it actually made a well deserved profit. It's certainly a refreshing break from the assorted porn masquerading as 'entertainment' on today's market. Congratulations all involved and Sony/Columbia.",Miracles from Heaven
22,jacobs-greenwood,I wanted to like it more than I did,6,13 August 2017,"As a Christ follower, and one who enjoys uplifting and encouraging films, I'm always looking for faith-based movies to see. I've seen some good ones, but also (unfortunately) too many - though sincerely made - not so good ones. This one was not only highly rated on Netflix, but it features two well-known actresses (Jennifer Garner and Queen Latifah) and a couple of recognizable character actors (Martin Lawrence and John Carroll Lynch) as well. So I thought I'd check it out.Firstly, I didn't know the story of the Beam family as told in the book which shares the film's title; it was a New York Times Bestseller written by a Texas mother named Christy Beam (Garner's character) a couple of years ago. I also didn't know it was about a young girl's claim that she went to Heaven and returned. This non- Biblical concept was exploited a few years earlier in a film I definitely avoided. So, I wouldn't have 'rented' this one if I'd have known in advance that it was going to promote the same heretical concept.However, since this part of the plot isn't revealed until late in the drama, I watched it unaware of what was going to happen, like anyone else unfamiliar with this purported true story.It's actually pretty good, for the most part. It realistically portrays the family's struggles through the hardships and inherent suffering when dealing with the torturous medical condition of one of their three daughters. Anna, played by Kylie Rogers, who is essentially terminal, though - unless I missed it - no doctor says anything like ""she has 14 months to live"".I certainly hope that there really are doctors like Dr. Nurko (Eugenio Derbez), the busy specialist in Boston that treats Anna's condition(s). What a bright light of joy amidst such difficult circumstances. He's one of two characters - the other is played by Queen Latifah - that exhibit Christ-like behavior without explicitly being identified as having faith in Jesus.In fact, there are several other characters who profess to be Christians that espouse misguided Pharisaical beliefs: that Anna's condition is due to sin or a lack of faith in the Beam family. Fortunately, Christy's Pastor Scott (Lynch) later says to Christy: ""Kevin (her husband, played by Henderson) told me what those ladies said to you, and ... I sure wish that I could give everybody a spiritual IQ test before they walk in the door.""I'm really not sure if the mixed messages of these characterizations - in addition to Christy's inconsistent faith throughout - were intentional or just symptomatic of the flawed Prosperity Gospel to which producer TD Jakes subscribes.Finally, actress Garner didn't deliver the emotional depth that was required to carry the picture. This was surprising given that she also has three daughters and her director, Patricia Riggen (who ably conveyed the drama of The 33 (2015)), is the mother of a daughter herself.",Miracles from Heaven

Unpredictable, with most amazing being uncovering of little details in form of good deeds that have been happening throughout the movie, but which are not shown before end. Unlike other movies, this one is at the same time magical, yet leaves us with feeling that it is nothing unreal compared to real life, like we have not being in another reality or dimension, but in same existing one, just explained deeply.

25,Benjamin-M-Weilert,"Overall, a realistic film that will have you literally crying tears from every emotion (sadness, joy, etc.).",8,8 March 2019,"Normally, I'm pretty hesitant to watch any movie that's overtly marketed as ""Christian."" The truth of the matter is, while I'm a Christian myself, these types of movies normally make me cringe at how cliche they are. When their message is continually shoved down our throats, it's hard to focus on anything else. I am all for inspiring stories of faith, but when the main thrust of your plot feels like a poorly written after-school special, it's hard to take seriously. Case in point: I really didn't like War Room (2015) not only because of the aforementioned qualms with the genre as a whole, but also because the characters and their actions felt completely unbelievable (and for a film about belief, this was a big no-no).Now, as you're aware of my stance on these types of movies, please note that I prefaced this with ""normally"". There are some films in this genre that do a good job of presenting men, women, and children of faith without making it the supreme focus of the film. For example, Soul Surfer (2011) was an excellent film in this genre because it focused more on the girl's faith that everything would turn out OK, even if she just had her arm bitten off by a shark. It's in these scenarios, where everything seems to go wrong, where we find the best stories about faith, perseverance, and God. This is why Miracles from Heaven (2016) is now my best example of this genre.Not only did this film cover the mother's fall away from the faith in the light of difficult medical circumstances (as most people would do), but it wasn't heavy handed about the faith aspect of the plot at all. In fact, the continual string of events leading to worsening conditions for her child played out much like they would for anyone who has had to take care of someone with a serious medical ailment. There are no answers as to why the family had to go through the ordeal, no answers as to why God lets this happen, and no answers as to how He was able to miraculously heal the girl, even in the midst of another tragedy. Because of these lack of answers, the other lives touched by the journey, and the lives who touched the family during the journey, Miracles from Heaven provides an incredibly realistic view at a situation that can only have one answer: God.Overall, a realistic film that will have you literally crying tears from every emotion (sadness, joy, etc.), I give Miracles from Heaven 4 stars out of 5.",Miracles from Heaven

So what if there aren't surprises, enjoy the story telling and the happy ending.Jennifer Garner is believable as the mom. Kylie Rogers is convincing. The remainder of the cast are all good. There's a supporting role played by Queen Latifah that seems like a time filler after the writer painted us into a waiting corner.Be warned, not all sick children are saved.

27,dave-mcclain,"""Miracles from Heaven"" tells a great story, but sends mixed messages.",4,18 March 2016,"I love words. More specifically, I love finding just the right word or combination of words to effectively communicate a very precise thought or even a complex idea. Of course, for words to function as I just described, they each have to carry a consistent meaning – whenever someone speaks or writes the word and whenever anyone hears or reads the word. Take the word ""miracle"", for example. Although definitions vary, they can be summed up the way the voice-over does at the beginning of ""Miracles from Heaven"" (PG, 1:49) – an event which does not have a natural explanation. One of the problems with this film is that it doesn't stick to its own definition – and confuses the meanings of other words as well.There's no way to talk about this movie without mentioning how the story comes out, so consider this sentence your spoiler warning. This movie is based on the 2015 book ""Miracles from Heaven: A Little Girl, Her Journey to Heaven, and Her Amazing Story of Healing"" by Christy Beam. The book and the film (with only minor differences between the two) both tell the story of Beam's 12-year-old daughter, Annabel, who developed an incurable and deadly digestive disorder which suddenly disappeared after she fell 30 feet head-first through the hallowed-out trunk of a dead tree. Christy suffered only minor injuries and says she went to heaven and spoke with Jesus during the hours she lay unconscious before being rescued.Homemaker Christy Beam (Jennifer Garner) and veterinarian Kevin Beam (Martin Henderson) live a happy and quiet life with their oldest daughter, Abbie (Brighton Sharbino), middle daughter, Anna (Kylie Rogers) and youngest daughter, Adelynn (Courtney Fansler) in a suburb of Fort Worth, Texas. They have a good-sized house with a little bit of land and Kevin has just opened up a veterinary hospital, for which Kevin and Christy took out a second mortgage on their home. The family goes to church regularly, as we see in the movie's first big scene (where the band ""Third Day"" sings). The Beams have close friends in that church, including the kind, funny Pastor Scott (John Carroll Lynch of TV's ""American Horror Story"").The night after a church picnic, Anna is lying in her bed when she suddenly feels ill and calls out to her mother. Anna remains sick and in pain over a period of weeks, in spite of multiple hospital visits and consultations with several doctors, until Dr. Blyth (Zach Sale) makes the correct diagnosis of Anna's condition – pseudo-obstruction motility disorder. With Anna's digestive system unable to function properly, she begins a daily routine of feeding tubes, medication and restricted activities. Dr. Blyth says this condition has no known cure and implies that it's often fatal. However, he offers a ray of hope in a referral to world-renown gastroenterologist Dr. Nurko (Eugenio Derbez) at Boston Children's Hospital.Dr. Nurko is very much in demand by desperate patients all over the world and getting an appointment with him is no easy task, but Christy Beam refuses to take ""no"" for an answer and insists on getting her daughter the best medical help available. As the entire family struggles to cope with emotional stress, family care and serious financial issues, Christy and Anna must make regular trips to Boston where Dr. Nurko uses his talent for medicine (and for dealing with sick children) to do all he can for Anna. Sadly, she continues to suffer, but Anna and Christy receive no small amount of comfort and encouragement from a local Boston waitress (Queen Latifah) who befriends the struggling mother and daughter. It looks like there's nothing more to be done when Anna and her sister are climbing a tree in their yard and Anna experiences that dramatic and terrifying fall, lying deep within that tree trunk needing a miracle.The main problem with ""Miracles from Heaven"" is that it can't keep its message straight – or its own vocabulary. The word ""miracle"", as defined at the beginning of the movie becomes, in the movie's last big scene, a much broader term which is then rendered virtually meaningless. Another word the movie has a problem with is ""impossible"". It's used on the movie poster and in the film's trailer to describe Anna's healing. But Anna was indeed healed. Her healing was never (and ends up not being) impossible after all – especially for people of faith – which is the third word the film uses inconsistently. Is faith really faith if it goes away when prayers aren't answered quickly, but then returns once everything has turned out okay? And if prayers offered in faith led to Anna's healing (as the movie implies) what does that say about the prayers or faith of many parents around the world who have sick children that are never healed? Troubling questions for a movie that asks us to accept an impossible miracle on faith.Some may consider the issues I just raised to be trivial or based on a misunderstanding of the film's message, but I just happen to think that words have meaning and that should count for something. However, I can't evaluate this movie objectively based on its use of words without also giving my subjective and more positive assessment of the film. ""Miracles from Heaven"" may be flawed in the choice of words in its script and inconsistent in its message, but it also happens to be a very meaningful and even entertaining story. Although the extent to which Anna's suffering is shown seems designed to increase the number of tears that audience members shed later in the film, overall it is a well-told, very well-acted story of the importance of a close family and true friends. I can't quite recommend this movie to a general audience, but the faithful will likely enjoy it. ""C+""",Miracles from Heaven
28,esteban1747,A miracle to believe or not,7,26 December 2017,"It is a film based on a tragedy of Beam's family, composed of three girls as well as their parents. Illness, an irreversible one affected one of the girls, and that is when family adventures begin, accompanied by economic and sentimental difficulties. The solution arrived unexpectedly, many can believe it, others cannot, and everyone is free to have his/her own opinion.

30,coreyjdenford,An absolute miracle,7,11 June 2016,"This is my review of Miracles from Heaven (Spoiler free) ***1/2 (3.5/5)Cast: Jennifer Garner, Kylie Rogers, Martin Henderson, Brighton Sharbino, Queen Latifa.Plot: A young girl suffering from a rare digestive disorder finds herself miraculously cured after surviving a terrible accident.Films about miracles are very rare to find and sometimes they are not very good however this film is good, sometimes unbearable to this heartwarming drama will make you laugh, cry or even smile with joy. Garner plays Christy Beam just a humble woman living a normal life until the strangest thing happens, when her middle daughter Anna (Rogers) gets a mysterious illness and no amount of medicine can do anything about it.Believe it or not but this is based on true story and is also a book adaptation written by the real Christy Beam, and the film directed by Patricia Riggen. Personally I've never read the book but I did watch this and it is a truly overwhelming story and also the best performance by Garner in a while.Here are some points as to why I think this is drama not to be missed:Story: The story is probably same as it is in the book but I thought was really well written and produced in the film, and I just literally fell in love with it. The story mostly takes place in Texas, it is also when the core performances happen mainly from Garner (Christy) and Rogers (Anna). The story is tear jerking and an absolute joy to behold. I wouldn't normally say this because I am an Atheist but I think this is the story about God-given Miracles I have ever seen.Performances: The performances are incredible in this movie it is Garner at her best just playing normal woman, and worried one at that because she tries to everything for her daughter. The performance from Kylie Rogers who plays Annabelle Beam is just a one in a million performance and is just amazing. Basically Rogers and Garner just steal the show from the other actors. Even Kevin (Henderson) doesn't get much of a say and he plays worried father also trying to help his daughter, his performance is well it could have been better.As I have already said this a very lovable about a family just trying to get by in life even when one of their own is ill. The reason for my initial mark is: Not enough character development: Not a big issue but for a film like this the character development is essential. In the beginning all you know is their names but the real development you just have to guess at because it doesn't how their daughter got ill, all we know is that it is mysterious. Not enough character development.Garner and Rogers are brilliant in this tear jerking drama that will hopefully never be forgotten.Verdict: Overwhelming, if sometimes unbearable to watch this indie film will make you cry even make you laugh. It is just a lovable story about family and love.7/10 recommended watch even if you an Atheist.",Miracles from Heaven

32,Thrashman88,A Positive Message,8,8 May 2016,"I'm not a very religious person but I must confess I did enjoy ""Miracles From Heaven"", a film based on true events. Even though the movie's title is its own major spoiler, it doesn't distract you from enjoying this good-feel family movie. The movie deals with the Beam family, specially their daughter Anna, who begins to suffer from a strange illness that prevents her from fully digesting food and nutrients and endangers her life in the short run. Her pain is unbearable and her mother (excellently played by Jennifer Garner) becomes desperate to find a doctor that can put an end to her daughter's illness. Although Anna's illness is not cancer, it is just as life threatening as it slowly turns the perky 10 year old girl into a depressive pre-teenager who sees death as her only way to end her sufferingChristy Beam (Anna's mom) finally find a doctor that could be their ray of hope: Dr Samuel ""Nurko"" Nurkobel, a gastroenterologist specialized in pediatrics who has his practice at Boston's Children's Hospital. Sadly, there is no cure for Anna's condition and she can only have medication and special care to make her existence more ""bearable"". I'll wonder off a bit from the story to mention how archaic I find certain medical practices in the U.S. Cisapride (it helps regulate ""motilty"" or the way intestines make food ""move along"" its tract), which was one of the few drugs Dr.Nurko could prescribe to Anna, is a medicine that has been withdrawn off the market in the U.S., yet it is widely available elsewhere (Mexico, Latin America). It's so common elsewhere that you don't even need a prescription to buy it, yet god knows how much did Christy Beam had to pay for it to help her daughter. I'm surprised that, coming from a 1st world country like the U.S. such a drug is only reserved for veterinarian use! Not even Cisapride could tone down Anna's problem, so Dr.Nurko was basically useless in helping Anna from her strange disease. Christy Beam, who is a devout Christian just like the rest of her family, becomes angry and starts to drift away from God, her church and faith itself, yet Anna never seems to lose it, even at her most painful moments. It would have to take a bizarre freak accident to turn things around positively, in a way science still cannot explain. We are lead to believe that yes, faith does indeed work in strange ways.""Miracles From Heaven"" is well written, well paced, well directed. It doesn't break any new ground; it's the type of Sunday morning fare that airs on TV for family viewing, but it eventually cheers you up in the end.

34,FallenEye,"From Film, To Condemnation.",4,24 September 2017,"It's the last 20 minutes or so that completely ruins this movie. It's incredibly bias, arrogant, judgmental and manipulative, and the ""miracle"", whether true or not, leans totally on the credibility of a Biography, as a genre, like how animation does the same with the genre of Adventure.The first hour to an hour 15 minutes, I was truly enjoying this film, and I empowered it to allow myself the ability for self reflection, and of course, accept the bio for what it is, and what it'll be... And perhaps while I'm at it, gain some level of inspiration myself, however, slow claps, a soulless speech, blatant manipulation to make the story lean one way based on a tale told by an already bias girl who is also heavily influenced by the people she looks up to most (her parents), and just to add insult to injury, we have a man coming forth about the death of his daughter in a fashion where the movie almost damn near implies his daughter died because of his contrary beliefs, with thick sugarcoating of course, completely and utterly ruins and destroys the credibility this film had been setting up.Truthfully, I almost even feel as if, the director, Patricia Riggen, wasn't a director, but rather, the pastor or member of the congregation itself. There is a lot that is wrong with this film; it starts off as a movie, just to end up being a judgment, no matter how much they tried to hide it.Apart from that, just looking at the cinematography, directing, score and acting; The cinematography was pretty great, I've never seen Boston look that good. The acting, one thumb up - though some characters felt random and useless, the music was touching at quite a few points and the directing, had flaws - like the young doctor's condescending and arrogant reaction to Christy's woes and the other doctor delivering the news of Anna's fall with a ""gambit"" first; it wasn't funny, it was misplaced and highly inappropriate - for example, but overall, a satisfactory job I guess.This movie was floating well above 6/10 for its majority, however that last 20 minutes, was just a crime too difficult to ignore. 4/10, and to be honest, I can't help but feel it deserves even less.",Miracles from Heaven

I think she could have had more of an influence and inspiration in the building of Christy Beam's (Jennifer Garner) faith, although Angela (Queen Latifah) did show Christy Beam (Jennifer Garner) kindness in the midst of the terrible situation she was going through, and that's very important, also there was nothing that stood out about this film as far as the cinematography and directing went and there were other situations that went on in this film's story that could have been brought out and covered more to make the film a little more intense and more drama filled but the main part of the story brought the message out good enough.

38,nmholland,"Overall A Good Film, With A Few Downsides",7,1 July 2016,"Miracles From Heaven is directed by Patricia Riggen and stars Jennifer Garner as the mother of a sick child named Anna, played by Kylie Rogers. The child is diagnosed with a rare disease that doesn't allow her body to digest food. Stay away from the trailers for this movie if you plan on seeing it; they spoil the entire film. That's all I'm going to say, because I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone.I was somewhat excited about seeing Miracles From Heaven, but I was expecting the movie to be as the trailers said it would be, and it was a completely different movie, despite it still being pretty good. The marketing team for this movie should really be fired, because the advertisement for Miracles From Heaven was marketing a separate movie. The film does have some flaws, but it was good overall.My favorite thing about Miracles From Heaven was the performances given by the actors that play the little girl's parents, that being Jennifer Garner as the mother and Martin Henderson as the father. These two did pretty great together, and made a very believable married couple that are struggling with their ability to cope with the sickness that their daughter has. Although I wish the film went a bit deeper into their conflicted relationship based on stress and disagreements, both actors did very well, and deserve some recognition by receiving future roles.Having said that about the two parents, and the actors that played them, not many other characters, or actors, stand out. Most of the other actors do fine, and don't really have anything special to do with their screen time, while also not exactly doing bad. Queen Latifah was marketed as playing a big character in this film (her name is on the poster), yet her character was given a good amount of depth, and then forgot about by the script. Her character just disappears from the film entirely, and it was pretty disappointing, to be honest.Kylie Rogers, who plays Anna, the sick little girl, does pretty good. Her performance isn't very distinctive, but she does okay for a little girl. Both of her sisters seem like wasted characters overall. I really wish the film would've dived into the difficulties that the sisters were dealing with, as in having a very sick sister, but it didn't. The sisters, played by Brighton Sharbino and Courtney Fansler, were partially wasted as characters that could've been interesting.The direction was pretty good. No shots really stood out as good or bad, and the overall camera work did what it should've done, it just wasn't as interesting as it could've been. The script was pretty nice, with some very good dialogue at points, and some pretty bland dialogue at others. There were a couple different subplots that really should've been either cut out, or given more attention to, that were kind of stuck in between the two, and those elements are what dragged the story down.The absolute worst thing about Miracles From Heaven is the pacing, particularly with the time jumps. There are more than enough time jumps, yet the film fails to explain how much time has passed. Coming out of the theater, I didn't know whether or not the film's setting lasted 6 months or 6 years. These time jumps really pulled the movie down by an entire letter grade (or so), and was pretty underwhelming.Other than the few complaints I mentioned, I liked just about everything about Miracles From Heaven. It didn't get too preachy, and was constructed as a film pretty well. I'd recommend Miracles From Heaven to anyone who can handle watching something somewhat sad, because there are a couple sentimental moments.",Miracles from Heaven
39,trevor-82944,Faith is Like This Movie: Painful but Worth It,5,22 December 2016,"I know, you've just about had it with these poorly produced independent features that preach Christianity. I will admit that Miracles from Heaven falls under that category of the lowliest of the low when compared to the loud, expensive spectacles that Hollywood churns up to financial success. But it's not the same type of ""repent or you're going to hell"" hate speech that God's Not Dead spits out, nor does it celebrate shallow cultural stereotypes like Kirk Cameron's Saving Christmas, but rather, it tells a true story open to interpretation that is worth discussion by all viewers.The family we follow in this picture is the Beam family, composed of a mother, father, and three girls. Jennifer Garner (Alias, Juno) plays the mother of the family, Christy Beam. This once talented actress is simplified to an annoying vessel of a character who exists just for the other people in her life to hand her crucial information, all while she blames others for her troubles. Yet her whiny nature is true to the natural events, as the stress between her and the Lord comes across plainly.Martin Henderson plays the father of the family, Kevin Beam. He shows no sorrow toward his daughter, nor is he as involved here as the true story claims. Courtney Fansler plays Adelynn Beam, the youngest child, while Brighton Sharbino plays Abbie, the oldest child. Neither of these girls are convincing in their roles, but there's at least a slightly more tolerable performance by the miracle child in between them, Anna, played by Kylie Rogers.Anna goes from freely spinning in a tire with her sisters one minute to puking her way through each long, ungodly night for weeks on end. The symptoms continue, her tummy becomes unnaturally bloated, and it takes a trip to the Boston Children's Hospital to diagnose the true condition: Pseudo-Obstruction Motility Disorder. All the doctors say that she has no chance of surviving this disease or does she?While the oversaturated lens-flare heavy imagery of Texas takes me out of the experience, the use of the camera and script still expresses a clear aura of support that glows within this family. You see it as dad buys his daughter a dog to cheer her up, and they all commit to not eating pizza until they know she's better. Together, you sense that they're all secretly praying, ""Why me, Lord?""Christy thus makes a difficult choice to fly to Boston for a doctor who can find a cure. I'll admit I never felt she had anything valuable to leave in Texas, as all her ""friends"" there are such dreadful actors, and director Patricia Riggen's (The 33) poor staging of their scenes failed to add any expected drama. Yet once they make it to Boston, life and joy is poured back into their hopelessness with Boston's most knowledgeable doctor, who is extra silly with his Elmo tie and pirate impersonations to boot. Funny how the most miserable place for them each to be is where the most smiles erupt.During their stay, they each befriend an outgoing waitress played by Queen Latifah (Chicago) who takes them on a tour through Boston in her own vehicle that looks fresh out of the dump. The montage of the mother and daughter meeting the city and its famous landmarks tries to be both charming and humorous, but the high commercialism and oversentimentality of it all misses the point of the story entirely. They could have left this whole scene (and waitress) out and nothing would have changed.Yes, I know, Miracles from Heaven is a deeply flawed Christian film that has no real replay value (and that's coming from a fellow Christian). But aside from the lack of mastery over story, an unbelievable account of a miracle too good to be true makes this a must-see. The logical would say that a lethal disease is reason enough to give up on Christ, but Miracles from Heaven proves how miracles are hidden in any uncalled for series of events. Miracles may not be in the big things like cancer and death, but it's always in the little things like pillow fights and pizza parties. Miracles are found in a cross necklace worn at all times, Miracles are found in the father's response to his daughter's eternal pain. While we may not know what God has for us, we can still see the miracles in everyday living as long as we cling to faith in his good plan.",Miracles from Heaven

I am from Brazil and many Brazilians say they are catholic or Christian as many times as they get their beers in the fridge, a lot more. And most of the time, they are just afraid to say they don't care about religion at all but that would make them look bad - I guess. So, I happened to be one of those blessed people who live in another country sponsored by the employer. It happened between 2008 and 2013, and I lived in Fort Worth, Texas for almost 5 years. If this story was true it might have happened not far from where I used to live in Keller. Well, no matter what people think or talk, challenging situations like this specially, will always put in you in a position of start asking, seriously and deeply, are we alone on this deal? Are we really in the WYSIWYG world? I doubt it!Faith is not to be explained, never. And you will deeply question life values and beliefs when you bump into the unexpected things, most of the time death-related.

Whenever I feel like I enter any church to pray and I look around. Some people are into it and some just sitting there or checking the cell messages.

Miracles from Heaven, while not critically acclaimed, is a movie that was described as heartwarming and feel good. We like both, so we went to see it, even though we are non-believers.It's a very well done movie with good production values. The filming is outstanding. The two leads, Jennifer Garner and Kylie Rogers give very credible performances. While the movie didn't convert us, Kylie's discussion of her belief in Jesus to a girl suffering from cancer in the hospital brought tears to my eyes.If you are a believer and like movies, this is the one to go see. That doesn't mean that all others should avoid it. We both were raised Christian and we have many devout Christians in our extended family. This may explained why we are open to movies like this.

There is no end to how blind they are and will do everything they can to trash a beautifully made movie. The acting is phenomenal by Jennifer Garner as well as the girl who plays Anna. The support characters are just so-so. It reveals the crisis in faith that many people go through when they wonder why would a good God allow something seemingly bad to happen to a good person. It also reveals that some so-called Christians are not very helpful to people who are going through such ordeals.

Once when the girl was playing she falls from the tree and loses her consiousness. While she was in comma she sees high doors from where bright light was coming.

There are moments that will make you weep, especially when the little girl is in hospital. Yet there are moments of hope, when she meets the doctor and the waitress. The desperation the family to cope up with it is so real and raw.This movie gives hope in miracles and things that we don't know. If you believe in God, watch this. If you don't; still do.

55,adean81,Review for Miracles From Heaven,8,29 May 2016,"If you are looking for a tearjerker, then you're in the right place. I caution people to not wear makeup when watching this movie because you will be crying by the end. The story is about a Christian family from Texas, whose second daughter becomes seriously ill with an incurable disease. The situation puts a lot of financial stress on the parents because they have to see a specialist out of Boston every month. The journey is about the mother, played by Jennifer Garner, and how she does whatever she can to make sure her daughter gets the best treatment possible. The movie is based on the real- life story of the Beam family and what happened with the middle daughter Anna, played by Kylie Rogers. While there are some religious and spiritual elements of the movie, and it plays an important role, it never comes off as preachy or pushy. It just works with how the story is told. The idea of having faith is an important theme of the characters in the movie. The mother struggles with her faith and questions her belief in God. While Anna, tries to stay positive and even has a conversation with another sick girl, to try and cheer her up. Eventually, Anna wants to give up on living until an accident happens that changes her life. Hence the title of the movie.One of the things that sell the emotion of the movie is the tremendous acting by both Garner and Rogers. They really sell a real connection between a mother and daughter. Rogers is such a delightful little girl that warms your heart when she's happy and saddens it when she's in pain. Garner does an amazing job with the real tears and heartfelt speeches about her daughter. The entire cast is great in this movie. Queen Latifah comes in (for a few scenes) not only to provide some comedy but to bring some hope to the girls when they feel a bit defeated. Even if you are not a fan of faith-based movies, you will still enjoy this film because the focus is on the mother and daughter and the family struggles. If you're looking for a good cry, watch it. If you aren't looking to cry, watch it! This is an amazing movie and sheds great light on people who do have sick children and everything they have to go through. It's a heartbreaking story that ends with a very uplifting message. The idea being that miracles are everywhere, even if it's just someone helping you out in a tough situation. It's the little things in life that make the big things possible. Watch the movie, and get inspired.",Miracles from Heaven
56,ke_we,6 out of 10,9,23 February 2020,"I'm only giving us a 9 Out of 10 to offset the dozen reviews i read that said the acting and Cinematography were good, but Yet they gave it a one star because of the Christian propaganda. Like really? Christian propaganda? As a Christian I can say that's not what I saw. I saw Hollywood trying to make a buck on a true story while still trying to stick to their political correctness as to not offend other religions. The movie goes so far that never even mentions the word Jesus. It only refers to God, even though in the real story it says she met Jesus. I think that's a pretty important piece that the director left out to keep this within the PC world of Hollywood, They also have multiple crosses shown throughout the movie that none of which are a crucifix with Jesus on them. Don't think that was not done on purpose.
They even threw in the two crazy Christian ladies To keep the narrative alive that there's so many Christian nut jobs out there. What those two women said about the girl being sick because she sinned Was ridiculous and something I could not imagine any Christian I know saying - And I would bet my left pinky toe never happened.
That aside, I thought the movie was pretty well acted as to most of these faith based films that tend to not be. And the filming was professionally done. It wasn't crazy corny like many of it's predecessors. All in all it was a nice movie to watch with the family and avoid the all the filth for one night.James 5.12

So, one kid in Texas (small town Cristian family) gets really sick and the mother does not know what to, takes it to the doctor. The doctors do not know what to do, so the family goes to a big city, where the big doctors see the problem and start treatment. But the kid being a kid falls into a hollow tree and after being rescued by firefighters gets miraculously healed by the holy spirit. The mother prays the whole time so it must be God who healed the kid. The whole movie is pathetic, the whole idea that this mother believes a god will miraculously heal her kid, but not the doctors, is so wrong. If you so much believe then why bother to take it to the doctor aniway! The main actress is not likable at all.

There are those that believe science can solve everything and science can explain anything when neither are true. We've come a long way with medical science, for instance when I had my appendectomy 35 years ago the procedure was very different from the one my buddy went through just a few weeks ago. There are things that can be cured now that couldn't be cured years ago. There are procedures that were very risky years ago that are now a lot safer. I'm thankful for all of the advancements in science. However, we still have a long way to go. And it's always exciting when God intervenes and heals people beyond a medical explanation.

63,indieke,"Religion promotion movie, that makes me just mad.",1,23 July 2016,"Yes it made me mad! Even if of course you want the girl to heal, there are some factors, that makes this a total waste of time.This looks like a promotion picture, not for a President candidate, but for religion. I have nothing against religion, when people just try to do good. For me if there is a God, spirit or an unknown force, we have no ability to full understand this.This movie is shallow, because of religious motives. You not see people sweat suffering. You not see living hell on earth in this situation. Everything is clean. The lightening is perfect, not realistic. The people are not of this world. Everything is clean and shining. Well having a sick child in these conditions is not ""clean"".Having a sick child is going through hell. It are dramas not enough developed here. All around the world, children are sick, parents go through hell, can't pay the bills, and often a child dies in much worse conditions, then the clean environment of this movie.That the girl got better after falling, can be explained other then a miracle of religion. The fall could have said her intestines just where they should have been. The fall has altered her condition, but has that has anything to do with God?How can you state that being so religious, is why she survived? When so many children are dying of cancer and other diseases every day? Why would God choose her to live, and not another poor sick kid? The movie makes you believe, the girl survives because she believes in God. So other children, who would be non believers deserve to die? That is just what we not like about Islam, to think some people are better then others, just because of any religion. I believe in people who want to do good, and not because they are part of a religion. I think of all these children, innocent, who were not raised for believing in a God, but have to suffer, just as children, who parents do believe in some religion and are NOT saved.I hope the family is doing alright, but that they keep",Miracles from Heaven

My wife and I also have 3 kids, so parenthood also gives one a shared association with the Beam's story. One of our kids is special needs and has had dozens of hospital/medical interactions so yet another touchstone of emotion with this film. But it would be a hard heart indeed that could watch this film, even with NO such associations, and not be moved by this lovely true story.

82,s-ushurova,Too much of a religious propaganda,6,15 May 2018,"I wanted to love this movie, I really did, but there are unfortunately a couple of things that bothered me immensely.First, I would like to stress that the actors did a terrific job. I actually cried when they cried. The plot was quite original as well. I would have easily given this movie a 9/10, if only the story was told differently.What I did not appreciate at all was the portrayal of atheists vs Christians (because the movie doesn't talk about just any religion). I really didn't like the fact that Christians were portrayed as these innately good, holy people who believe in God and miracles, and therefore deserve them. As opposed to the cynical, heretical atheists whose children die because they don't believe in the supernatural.I mean, let's assume for a second that this story actually happened, like the movie claims it did: a little girl with a severe intestinal disorder was cured miraculously after falling on her head just the right way. Fine, beautiful, magical. But why on earth did the journalist's daughter have to die at the end? Was it just because he was an atheist? And not just any kind of atheist for that matter. He basically didn't allow his daughter to believe in God; he was kind of rude to Christy (Jennifer Garner), who very conveniently was super nice and polite; his wife left him, didn't die just left, so he didn't have the support of a devoted, hard-working, religious partner like Christy did. Why? Because, let's be honest, in the eyes of Christians atheists are lost and empty people who don't believe in the sanctity of marriage, or the unconditional support of your family, and especially of sick children.But the moviemakers just had to take it even further by turning Ben (the journalist) into a believer in the end. I guess it's just like Anna said: ""They'll get there when they get there."" Heck, I too would consider converting, if that would apparently stop my future offspring from dying.",Miracles from Heaven

Second, I am not a frequent movie goer, so I do not have much to add concerning the acting, cinematography, and story line. However, I think the main character should get an academy award. And the rest of the actors were pretty good too. I just saw the movie tonight, so I do not know how long I will contemplate the ideas put forth in this movie. But I think it is a movie I will want to see many more times and will get something different out of it every time. This movie reminds me of another similar movie that I have seen many times called The Ultimate Gift.",Miracles from Heaven
84,kristindwebb,Love this movie,10,17 August 2020,"It is a gem of a true story! With quality acting and cinematography. It's prayerful, and realistically portrays Christian faith experiences (trust, forgiveness, doubt, anger, humility, conversion, love, gratitude). If you're a person of faith, this is a must see.

It brings out emotions of anger, disappointment, frustrations, desperation, hope, faith, understanding, love and peace. Bring your tissues and experience the story of a family who goes through all of these emotions while we go though them too. It reminds me of the movie War room, and has the same feel good ending as that one did. I hope movie goers enjoy the story of a real family going through real problems and finding answers along the way.",Miracles from Heaven

There are literally no five minutes without religion even being mentioned in this film. I get that a family (because this has happened more, I am not so cynical to believe that no miracles ever take place, but I don't believe there is such an entity as 'God' who is responsible for this) would have this journey from sickness to health, but I was baffled by how some big stars have lent themselves to cooperate in this particular story. Why this story? Why not a different one? From the hour and a half, the church is shown about every few moments. Very tiring. I have never been so disappointed by Jennifer Garner.
The acting in itself is not bad, it's just that the story is clearly too thin to carry on a whole movie, so they've chosen to depict that as much as possible. Pass.",Miracles from Heaven
91,JDEYM,Very interesting film about the existence of miracles,8,26 May 2021,"I think it is certainly an atypical movie, for at least two reasons.In the first place, because it shows a fact that, if it were not real, would be considered totally implausible.Secondly, because it is very different from productions of this type that tend to target the sensitivity of an undemanding audience, showing low blows or, at the other extreme, showing scenes excessively sweetened with a superficial or childish treatment.Regarding the first consideration, I remember an essay by an Argentine novelist, Hugo Wast, about his way of writing, in which he relates that, at the beginning of his career as a writer, he showed his grandmother a manuscript in which they died, because of an epidemic, the five children of a family. The grandmother told him that this should not be included in the novel because it was implausible. Wast said, ""But, Grandma, you told me about a real case where that happened!"" ""Yes,"" answered the grandmother, ""that can happen in reality, but never in fiction.""As for the second consideration, I was struck by the very serious treatment on such a controversial subject as the possibility of the existence of miracles. Here the scientist Albert Einstein is quoted, saying that it can be said that miracles do not exist, but, with the same degree of truthfulness, it can also be said that all reality is a miracle.The film is not meant to stand out as a magnificent piece of art, but it is a deeply human testimony.It is not a documentary film, but the acting part, except perhaps for the presence of a well-known actress like Queen Latifah and, to a lesser extent, Martin Henderson (the main actor of the series ""Virgin River""), is totally simple, privileging the rapport with the deep drama of the plot and showing much more humanity than histrionics.The themes of life and death, disease and pain, faith and skepticism, religiosity and trust in God or rebellion against his designs, the struggle to survive and humanitarian aid are presented throughout the whole development.The film maintains a very intense suspense, at times almost unbearable, and, although in the title itself it is explicit that everything will end in the best way, the outcome is truly amazing. Perhaps the way this outcome is portrayed is the film's only weakness, which up to that point shows remarkable solidity.In short, it is an interesting film, with very committed actors, a successful direction and a lot of humanism and sympathy in the characters, mainly the doctor, who despite being a world-wide eminence in his specialty, treats the sick girl with extreme care and professionalism, but all this complemented with a playful method in the best Patch Adams style.Along with the Indian film ""Stars on Earth"", it is the best film I have seen in fourteen months of forced confinement due to the Covid pandemic and therefore I recommend it, without a doubt, to both those who believe in miracles and those you think are mere fantasies.",Miracles from Heaven
92,roxieft2003,Great True story!,10,22 March 2016,"The book really inspired me. It helped with my faith in the healing of my own child. I couldn't wait for the movie. Well, I was not disappointed. It was even better than the book because the characters just came to life. And ""yes"" the movie will make you cry, and cry. My husband didn't want to see this movie, at first, but decided to watch it with us as a family. Well, with tears in his eyes he said ""it was one of the best movies I have ever seen"".

94,buddy-81185,A church without Christ,3,14 August 2016,"This movie was not what I had expected. The story was interesting and kept my attention. The acting was excellent, and I don't understand why some would think that Garner was melodramatic. Everyone in the movie did a believable job of acting. Where I had a problem is that the suffering was overextended to the point that it was difficult to watch. The church was really useless and at no point did I see anyone in that church offer to come over and pray for the sick child. What kind of miracle do you want if you don't even mention the need for a miracle? Actually, the sick child was the one who exhibited more faith than anyone. She was at least clinging to God. Speaking of God, why was the name of Jesus never mentioned in the film? If it's a church, why not give credit for the miracle to Jesus? What's the problem of giving Him some praise and credit? Plus, the doctor seems to indicate that somehow her neurological system was ""reset"" due to the fall. Really? There is no cure for the child's disease. Heaven was shown so briefly that had you turned your head to sneeze, you probably would have missed most of heaven with the beautiful flowers and butterflies. Heaven is real, Jesus is real, healing happens and miracles happen. Yes, there are many who suffer and die, but miracles do happen. We still are required to pray and intercede for those who need prayer. I never saw any genuine prayer for healing. Sorry, if we are going to make movies where people are part of a church, let's at least not be so politically correct that we can't mention the name of Jesus Christ.",Miracles from Heaven
95,havoren,"The WORST of Any ""Emotional"" Movies",1,29 January 2018,"This religious drama succeeds in visual representation but fails miserably in many different ways including a poorly written plot, boring characters, an awful score, and an offensive religious tone that comes off as putting down others for not believing in faith or the proper type of religion that gives second chances. This movie also fails in delivering emotion due to the lack of good acting and well written dialogue. The only type of audience that would like this flick would be religious people who would also find movies such as Left Behind and Kirk Cameron's Saving Christmas to be quality movies. To anyone else who finds interest in this movie, do the world a favor and stay far far FAR away.

98,rwsloat,Don't let the title fool you: this story is grounded in the tough realities of faith.,10,21 March 2020,"Based on the trailer and the title and the producer parentage it partially shares with the dreadful ""Heaven Is for Real,"" my expectations were rather low. But it may be the best Christian film I have ever seen-certainly in the top five.Why? Because it felt real. The people acted and talked and felt like real people do.Jennifer Garner is powerful in the central role, and the entire cast is well chosen and well directed by Patricia Riggen, who also helmed the highly acclaimed ""Under the Same Moon"" and the underrated and underwatched ""The 33.""Try to avoid seeing the trailer, because it tells you most of the plot points-yet it does not reveal the actual story. The title is misleading and might scare away people who have no interest in yet another facile feel-good pop-Christianity trifle. Fear not! The miraculous elements are secondary, and either subtle or almost downplayed. The film doesn't go for cheap answers or emotion. It is a genuine exploration of faith and coping with undeserved suffering. It affirms hard-fought genuine faith.I urge you to see it, and to bring others with you, especially the unconvinced-who are not likely to find Jesus on the spot, but who may begin to see the reality of faith in a loving God who does not fit into our convenient boxes.",Miracles from Heaven

104,ephraimcamenzind,A drag of a movie,4,29 August 2016,"I have seen some good Christian movies before (such as fireproof or the encounter) and reading the reviews here on IMDb made me consider watching this one too, but I was misled. I say this with all due respect to the real person behind this story, but this movie is not a good movie. There is too little plot here. You could easily cut the first one and a half hours of the movie down to 10 or 20 minutes. The acting is very mediocre at best, except for the little girls and maybe Queen Latifah. Jennifer Garner has but one facial expression throughout the whole movie and her male counterpart I found rather boring. To be fair, the plot doesn't give Jennifer Garner much to act upon (her child is sick, her child is sick, her child is sick... wait there is hope... no... her child is sick, her child is sick... ). I guess if you are a mother or dad, you might be shaken to tears, because you might feel for the length of a whole movie what it would be like to loose your child. But for me, not having any kids, this movie didn't do that for me.On the upside and why I'd still give this movie 4 stars: The last part of the movie made me think about life and miracles and what it all means to me. And it moved me somehow.""There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle."" (quote from Albert Einstein; in the movie)This movie made me think of the core message here, which is to me: the true miracle of life is love. It is around us even when we don't see or feel it. People being there for each other, helping each other, not giving up on each other, and forgiving each other when no one expects it. That's not something ordinary. That's something miraculous. Because then things may happen which you never thought possible. Still ""Miracles from Heaven"" fails at most things which make a good movie. I give it 4 stars for the core message, for making me think, for the girls' acting and for telling a ""true"" story. The rest is not worth seeing in my opinion.",Miracles from Heaven

The kids acting was okay, the adults, not so much. The cut scenes during the testimony at the church doesn't have any connections to miracles. These movies are just doing the opposite of what it should be doing to Christians. If everything is a miracle, why oversell specific ones. clearly millions of children are suffering against all odds. And 'God' decides to help one out of the many and we call it a miracle. Please make reasonable Christian movies, at least it will leave some 'unbelievers' scratching the back of their heads.Just saying.............Do whatever you want as far as it doesn't affect anyone or anything negatively.",Miracles from Heaven

I've had 7 near- misses in my life, and while i was watching this movie: I was watching it, as if it were about me. The last time I left this movie feeling a sense of personal fulfillment, was 3 years ago, after i saw 'Homefront' & 'Dallas Buyers Club.' This time, it only took one movie to make me feel that way again.

I would not hesitate to allow a child to see this for any reason.I am not ashamed to say this film had me, a 68yo US Navy retiree, in tears more than once, not only for the scenes showing the girl's pain, but for the difficulties the parents went through, as well.",Miracles from Heaven

For me, this is a movie that turned my daughter around as she is struggling with faith and life issues at the moment. That is a miracle by itself.This is a small movie that we enjoyed and it touched our hearts and the acting of Garner and Kylie are commendable. All the actors in this movie are very convincing. The movie was just not all centered in faith but also about how the community, strangers and family rally behind the Beams.

It reminded me of another movie, ""The fireproof,"" or maybe even ""The Vow"" The performance of Jennifer Garner and Kylie Rogers was exceptional. You cry, and you can feel all of their struggles with Kylie's illness and her mom Jennifer's sadness, fighting to help her daughter overcome her illness. In general, it is a very sad movie, with a note of hope given by Queen Latifah. She balanced the movie with some funny scenes and her wonderful, positive personality. I love the music and the artistic development of some of the scenes, like the representation of Heaven, when Kylie described to her parents, after her miraculous recovery, that she was told that everything will be alright. I also liked the closing scene with the song, ""Here come the Sun"" and the sunflowers. Their visit to the Boston's aquarium was anther good scene. I loved the views of Boston as a city, as well as the country side of Texas. It truly made me cry the scene of Kylie in front of a Monet at the Boston Museum. The movie has some good dialogues. It is a movie about hope, faith, and the value of family. But also the movie have a negative side background, something that make your doubt about your faith. The movie kind of put as a miracle the medical attention that Kylie received at the Boston's hospital. Seem like no anyone can go and receive that exceptional medical attention. I could say more, but in general, it is a good movie to watch with our family and teach them the importance of faith.

It seemed impossible that she could still be alive when she was rescued approximately six hours later, but that's when the miracle occurred.This is a heart warming, family friendly story of faith complete with photos of the actual family at the end. My only criticism is the lack of the name ""Jesus."" Faith is mentioned. God is mentioned. A cross is shown, but Jesus is avoided and the Bible says, ""there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved.""Acts 4:12I rate it second after ""War Room"" as my favorite faith film.

There is something missing in her acting and she doesn't seem to be able to carry on with a lead role. Very disappointing. The story line is interesting, but the way this family is portrayed is unbelievably unrealistic, where everyone is perfect, everything is in place throughout the ordeal, everyone gets along like they're on an old episode of Eight is Enough, etc. I believe this film went straight to video, and if not, it should have.",Miracles from Heaven

121,kaylahmcantu,Be Immersed In Film About Real Suffering and Strength,9,17 March 2016,"I just saw this movie yesterday and I am a Christian. I think that is important to mention because there will be some people who simply don't like the movie because they don't like Christian films. So here is my honest review: When I first saw the trailer I thought this movie was going to be decent, but not great. I thought it would probably be the formulaic Christian film that most of us have seen over and over again. Most of these films have flat Christian characters put in tough circumstances that never cause them to truly struggle with their faith, which is why most people find Christian films to be unrealistic. This is not the case with Miracles from Heaven. This film has incredible performances by the entire cast, especially Jennifer Garner and Kylie Rogers. The film perfectly balances the story with aspects of faith. The core of this story is about a mother suffering with her daughter's pain and health. What I was not expecting was to feel as though I was a part of this story. The film immersed me in what it would be like to be going through this struggle. This movie will make you cry in the sad moments and in the happy moments because you will feel as though this is your family. That is why this film transcends other Christian films. The moments where God is mentioned don't feel as though they are forced and preachy. Those moments are carefully woven and important to the family's journey through a terrible illness. It surpassed my expectations. That's why I recommend going to see it. ""Miracles are God's way of showing us that He's here."" - Miracles from Heaven",Miracles from Heaven

All in all, this is a feel good movie and it makes you appreciate what you have, and how you can lose it all in the blink of an eye.

124,leavingonajetplane,Beautiful Story,10,16 July 2016,"I was a little trepid due to the religious undertones of this movie ... but ... I loved it! The casting is excellent, and just because Queen Latifah isn't doing a SNL impression doesn't mean she didn't do a good job in a character role. It's called acting.The actress who played Anna was fantastic too, in fact the whole family was. BUT the stand out star by far was Jennifer Garner. To those critics who condemn her to Alias / Daredevil and other such ilks I say ""not any more"". Since Dallas Buyers Club she has shown she can adapt and is not only a fantastic character actor but that she is capable of leading a movie.Garner has both warmth and strength, two characteristics I'm sure the real life mother had too. You can't help but buy in to this family and this story and I'm really glad I saw it.",Miracles from Heaven
125,akhenton,Best Movie of 2016 so Far.....,10,7 April 2016,"In my opinion this film is Ms. Garner's best work so far. The cinematography in the film is exceptional. Shooting of clouds with orange skies is wonderful. Images of Boston (Fenway Park). Boston Aquarium scenes were breathtaking. the sea life scenes were wonderful. The scenery in Texas was a joy to see, with so much rich color. Reminded me of a summer day. The scenes between Mother and daughter is raw emotion and painful to experience. I felt that emotion. Queen Latifah was awesome. I wish though, she played a bigger role in the film. Her chemistry with Ms. Garner and Ms. Kylie Rogers made me smile. After seeing Miracles from Heaven, I am hoping all three are friends in real life.Mr. Derbez reminded me of a lot Mr. Robin Williams as Patch Adams. Mr. Martin Henderson played the role of a very caring and wonderful father in every way.The pizza pact made me laugh. The tree always gave me a sense of foreboding. The scene where the family surprises Ms. Kylie Rogers in the hospital was a loving celebration to see. Praying that Mr. Affleck and Ms. Garner will watch the film together, if they have not already./wink I will make sure to recommend Miracles from Heaven to family and friends. Discussing the film with my family over dinner tonight. ""They will get there when they get there.""

126,iowahawku,A Must See!,10,10 April 2016,"To sum up, it's the most inspirational movie that I ever saw. This is truly the best acting Jennifer Garner has done. Her performance may lead to a nomination for an Academy Award. (We'll see.)Just in case, movie goers do not need to fear any Christian related messages if they happen to be nonbelievers. Those who do not believe may, instead, wonder (from time to time) if there is any kind of destiny after death. For those wanting to maybe avoid this film, on purpose, consider seeing it with an open mind. Then, by the end, determine how you think and feel in relation to everything the Beam family went through. Most especially, ask yourself about the ongoing question of existence. Again, this film is based on a true story.",Miracles from Heaven
127,bszkula,Fantastic Movie,8,17 July 2016,"This is the best film I have seen in a very long time. Both Jennifer Garner and Kylie Rogers made me feel the excruciating pain emotionally and physically that each of these people went through. I feel the Director Patricia Riggen drew out the very best in these two extremely talented actresses who gave such exceptional performances. It did not go unnoticed that the photography was also top shelf being done by Patricia Riggen's husband Checco Varesa. These two make exceptional movies together. Also an excellent pick to play the Boston Children's Hospital Doctor was Eugenio Derbez and Queen Latifah as the Angel/Angela was wonderful. Jennifer Garner and Kylie Rogers should both get Oscars for their performances but that will never happen in Hollywood since we are waiting and waiting for them ""To get there"". I do feel bad about so many negative comments by the atheists with so much hatred in their hearts. I am sure they never saw the movie Bambi who had some sage advice from that philosopher Thumper who quoted ""If you can't see anything nice  don't say anything at all"". Thank you T. D. Jakes for producing this wonderful film.",Miracles from Heaven
128,pboisvert-11876,Very moving and well done,9,16 July 2016,"This movie is very stirring and emotionally moving. It really captures the emotions and the crisis of faith that must be the experience of those who must watch their children suffer in any way.The directing is very good and the cinematography is well done. When I started watching the movie I expected the characters to be somewhat plastic. To my delight, this was not the case. The characters seemed real, human, and relatable.However, it is the performance of Jennifer Garner as Christy Beam (the Mom) and Kylie Rogers as Anna Beam (the daughter) that put it over the top. I very much recommend this movie",Miracles from Heaven

Having faith , real faith can turn bad into good, you can be heard. The cast gave amazing performances, I felt like I was there, the struggle, the pain, the fear of painful ending, the helplessness , inability to heal, to change and overcome the tragedy and the pain, our limitations in what we can do as human beings and then the tears of pain changing into tears of joy, gratitude and finally the faith that we are watched and taken care of, believe it or not.",Miracles from Heaven

132,nataliedulaney-53036,Anna Beam got sick with an incurable disease and it was cured with a miracle (true story),10,23 February 2017,"I am not a huge fan of religious films, but ""Miracles From Heaven"", directed by Patricia Riggen and written by Randy Brown, impressed me with the combination of actor selection and the way the story was directed. Believer or not, this dramatic family film will make it difficult for anyone to hold back tears during this true story. Christy Beam, who is perfectly played by Jennifer Garner, is a mother of three little girls and the wife of Kevin (Martin Henderson). Together, they regularly attended services at a mass church in Texas as a healthy, happy family.Now the trailer itself says it all, so there won't be any spoilers. ""Life is good, Christy Beam,"" said Kevin, which definitely foreshadows that their lives were about to turn upside down. It started when their bright 12-year-old Anna (Kylie Rogers) suffered never ending stomach pain. Multiple doctors insisted not to worry since her condition was either lactose intolerance or acid reflux. Christy Beam, being a mother with an instinct, knew her daughter was dealing with something more serious. It was frustrating to see these doctors just constantly telling Christy Beam to calm down. Anna was then diagnosed with a rare intestinal disorder that didn't have a medical cure. From that point, Anna and Christy were flying back and forth from Texas to Boston to meet with the best pediatric gastroenterologist, Dr. Samuel Nurko (Eugenio Derbez). He had a way of bringing out the best of the sick children with his light-hearted humor, which was pleasing to watch. Anna also encountered a friendship with a compassionate waitress, Angela (Queen Latifah). She had an idea that Anna was sick, so she encouraged them to let her give them a personal tour with a twist. She has never been a disappointment with her acting and performances, and she continued that legacy in ""Miracles From Heaven."" Both of their acting roles brought joy and a comic relief in the movie. Throughout the film, it's fascinating to notice the small miracles happen, which is ultimately what ""Miracles From Heaven"" is about. However, that one miracle, that faith, that Christy was desperately searching for came when Anna fell thirty feet down of the inside of a tall tree and hit head first. It may not sound like a miracle, but not only she survived the fall, her incurable disease was cured. Even though the audience already knew what was going to happen from the trailer, it is hard not to be engaged by that intense moment; it had myself on the edge of the chair the entire time. Anna claimed that when she was spiritually gone, she experienced a moment with God; one that is hard to believe. It was definitely cheesy and may seem impossible to understand, but it just depends on what people's beliefs are. The Beam Family knew it was a miracle; as do I. What made this film worked so well was the emotional performance put on by Jennifer Garner. Through the character Christy Beam, she expressed resilience, vulnerability and real warmth. Patricia Riggen, as the director, seemed to have no challenge with keeping the viewer engaged since I was just crying throughout the whole movie. It was a constant roller-coaster that was filled with anger, happiness, and sadness. Like I said, I am not a huge believer, but from the beginning to the end, ""Miracles From Heaven,"" is a heart-warming movie.",Miracles from Heaven
133,steak-60845,10 Review- An amazing must see film,10,9 March 2017,"As someone who isn't a Christian I enjoyed this movie! Simply because I am a mother! I never leave reviews, but this movie moved me in ways I truly didn't expect. Don't listen to these simple minded people who rated this movie a 1 or 3. Watch it. It's worth your time. And if you are a parent... grab your child and hold on.",Miracles from Heaven
134,cliffeliamatt,"Hmmmm. A Good Movie, but...",8,28 May 2017,"Good plot. Good story. And excellent acting with a really professional cast. Not your average movie. Unusual story and really watch worthy. I have one, and only one comment which makes me a bit uneasy. Maybe 2. I am a Christian, and a faithful church goer, but I am saddened that although the story highlights Anna's view and reason for her miracle, the movie did not portray this in a balanced way. Instead it highlights a bias view of a particular version of Christianity which is flawed and full of propaganda. This from the buckle of the Bible Belt, Texas US evangelical Christianity. Perhaps we need a disclaimer before the start of the movie, so that those who are not Christian knows that the beliefs portrayed in the film comes from a corner of Christianity and not universally accepted by every Christian faith. Unfortunately this is what ruins the Christian genre of movies out there, which can have positive messages but are rejected by the non-Christian.",Miracles from Heaven
135,tablet-41163,Miracles From Heaven,10,3 December 2017,"Possible spoiler...My daughter and I just watched this movie. It was at times hard to watch because you feel like you are there going through the whole ordeal with the family. JenniferGarner was really good in this movie. The whole cast was really great - - especially little Anna.This movie teaches all about how important it is never to give up hope at anytime - no matter how bad or unlikely things seem. We will never forget this movie and will watch it periodically to remind ourselves of all the important things in life. We have seen many miracles too, so we know they can and do happen. Prayer definitely works and can move mountains. It has for us too. Although you go into this movie knowing that some kind of miracles happens, you really don't know what happens until the very end.",Miracles from Heaven
136,TommyCSL,good movie with flaws,7,20 March 2016,"I was not the intended audience for this movie, I went to see it because I like Jennifer Garner, I enjoy John Carrol Lynch's work and I am a huge Walking Dead fan and this movie had John Carrol Lynch and Brighton Sharbino in it along with Madison Lintz's mother, but I did find this was good entertainment.The movie showed you had to do more then just trust in God for things to be OK, Jennifer Garner demands more test be run in the ER when her daughter goes in in a lot of pain and the ER doctor says it is just severe acid reflux, and then when she isn't getting in to see the specialist she flies to Boston to try to get her in, and does.It is a well, if unevenly acted movie and does a nice job at the end showing how little acts of kindness can turn out to be a miracle to someone else. It could have edited the story down somewhat and told its story better, the part when Anna talks about going to heaven after she falls down a tree I don't think was needed, wouldn't it still be a miracle if a girl with an incurable disease falls three stories down the inside of a tree, doesn't get hurt while her incurable disease is cured, without her going to heaven and talking to God? The bottom like is that if you think you will like this movie, you probably will, and if you think you won't you probably won't, but the movie is an enjoyable feel good story with some nice funny moments and some nice touching family moments.",Miracles from Heaven
