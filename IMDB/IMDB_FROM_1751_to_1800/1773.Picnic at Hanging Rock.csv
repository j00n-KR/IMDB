0,MartinHafer,beautiful cinematography,7,4 August 2005,"This is a very pretty movie--both the cinematography and music are well done (though the frequent use of pan pipes was an unusual choice and seemed a bit odd for an Australian film). And, the way the story was portrayed, it really did a good job of making you believe this was a true story and not fictional (which it is).So why isn't my score quite as high as other reviews? Well, there just isn't a whole lot of story here and the pacing, at times, is a little too slow and drawn out for my taste. It seems that since it isn't based on a true story, they could have interjected a little more suspense or mystery--especially in hashing out what occurred to Sara at the end of the picture. Still, it is very well made and quite unusual. All in all, a very good film--particularly the haunting score played by Zamfir.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
1,SnoopyStyle,dreamy sense of foreboding,8,18 July 2016,"On Saint Valentine's day 1900 in the state of Victoria, Australia, schoolgirls from Appleyard College go picnicking at Hanging Rock led by teachers Miss Greta McCraw and young de Poitiers. Below them, Michael Fitzhubert is having lunch with his Colonel uncle, aunt, and valet Albert. Back at school, headmistress Mrs. Appleyard has kept Sara from going. At the picnic, buggy driver Ben Hussey notices his watch has stopped and Miss McCraw's watch has also stopped at noon. Miranda St. Clare, Marion Quade, Irma, and Edith go off to explore spied by Michael and Albert. After a nap, three girls walk off and Edith runs back in hysteria. Miss McCraw go in search for them as the rest return home with Edith. The locals set off to find the missing four. Appleyard fears losing students. She tells Sara that her benefactor has stopped sending money. Irma is found but she won't talk about the disappearances.There is a light dreamy sense of foreboding for the first part. It's a little slow at the beginning as one wonders what the story is going to be about. It has repressed sexuality. It's a moody, haunted mystery. It's a lot of things. The most daring of all is that it gives no obvious answers. That can very infuriating. It also leaves the audience with a haunted feeling. The scenes at the Rock are almost hypnotic. I would have liked more time at the Rock in the later parts. The Sara story hints at an even darker world at the school. Most of the actors are relative amateurs. For instance, Sara mumbles a lot of her lines but that fits her character. This is kinda floaty haunting mystery.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
2,Hitchcoc,Cruel and Powerful,9,12 October 2016,"This is a film with a blackness that counters its sustained beauty. It is centered on a Victorian private girl's school, run by a virago whose only interest is in tuition. She takes joy only in her constant threat. The girls are generally very attractive. Some of them are from rich families, but others from orphanages and other settings, including being wards of the state. One day they go on a picnic to a natural formation called ""Hanging Rock."" It is composed of rock faces that literally appear to be threatening faces. Four of the girls go exploring, against the wishes of the matron who brought them. Three of them disappear, leaving a whiny, overweight, unattractive girl to tell the story. Through most of the film, people search for the three. Suspicions arise and the headmistress bemoans the destruction of their reputation, leading to withdrawal of girls for the next term (not to mention that the missing girls will certainly not be back). This is a villainous lady. She has a young orphan in her sights and abuses her constantly. Of course, she can't continue to pay the price for the school. There are two interesting male characters who come under suspicion. I have seen this title for years and was glad I simply took a chance on it. Beautiful cinematography and intense storytelling. Peter Weir is masterful.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
3,gavin6942,"So Close to Perfection, But So Far Away",7,3 March 2012,"A story about the disappearance of several Appleyard College students, and a teacher, from Hanging Rock.This was acclaimed director Peter Weir's second film, and now considered one of Australia's most-beloved films... for the rest of us, Weir might better be remembered as the director of ""Dead Poets Society"" (1989) or maybe the man behind ""The Truman Show"". The film is difficult to enjoy, because while it is visually stunning, its slow pace really pushes the patience of the audience. One could argue that the slow pace is necessary to really enhance the feeling of awkwardness and eeriness. Indeed, the film has been called ""creepy"" by critic Greg Harris; while I am not sure this is the proper word, it does leave the viewer feeling uneasy.Roger Ebert called it ""a film of haunting mystery and buried sexual hysteria"" and remarked that it ""employs two of the hallmarks of modern Australian films: beautiful cinematography and stories about the chasm between settlers from Europe and the mysteries of their ancient new home.""I am unclear about the ""buried sexual hysteria"", though Ebert does go on to talk about theories of rape and murder that I think exist more in his mind than on screen. I am also unclear about his ""settlers from Europe"" idea. I will not argue the beautiful cinematography, though -- the framing is excellent, and the use of Hanging Rock's natural images (including several face-like rock structures) is well-executed. There is some confusion over how big the rock is -- does it require a trail of bread crumbs to get back or is it a five minute climb -- but this may be part of its charm.Where Ebert really nails the film, though, is when he sums it up as being ""free of plot, lacking any final explanation, it exists as an experience."" Indeed, many of the film's shots evoke memories of paintings, such as Renoir's ""Luncheon of the Boating Party"", and in one moment a girl is even compared with Botticelli's ""The Birth of Venus"". The film exists, like Ebert says, as an experience free of plot... a moving, two-hour painting that we can take away from as we wish, and like or dislike as we would a classic work of art.Peter Weir's own words further suggest he was not trying to give a clear-cut narrative. ""We worked very hard,"" says Weir, ""at creating an hallucinatory, mesmeric rhythm, so that you lost awareness of facts, you stopped adding things up, and got into this enclosed atmosphere."" We are free of time and space while watching ""Picnic"", as we could be in 1900 or 1776 or any other time (and it is interesting to note the film takes place on Saturday, February 14, 1900 -- a date that never existed).Much more could be made of the film's themes and symbolism with the hearts, the boys, the trances and the swans... but I know of no coherent way to express these things. Which, I think, may be exactly what Weir intended.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
4,lee_eisenberg,The collapse of the old order.,10,7 January 2006,"Most people remember Peter Weir's ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" for for its almost horrific plot: an all-girl's school in Australia goes on a picnic on Valentine's Day, 1900, and all but one girl disappear without a trace. But it seems that there is a metaphor here: the collapse of the old order. What I mean is: after the disappearance, the oppressive school gets a lot of bad PR and is forced to shut down and headmistress Mrs. Appleyard (Rachel Roberts) withdraws from the public eye. By oppressive, here's an example: while driving out to Hanging Rock, when they reach a certain point, the girls get to take off their gloves. As for the frequent theme of communication issues in Australian, here it never gets communicated what happens to the girls. All that I can say is: be prepared to get unnerved by this movie.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
5,jboothmillard,Picnic at Hanging Rock,8,2 August 2013,"From director Peter Weir (Gallipoli, Witness, Dead Poets Society, The Truman Show), this film featured in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book was apparently the Australian picture that put the country's films on the map, I was looking forward to it. Basically, set in 1900, near the town of Woodend, Victoria, Australia, at girls' private school Appleyard College, accompanied by mathematics mistress Miss Greta McCraw (Vivean Gray) and young and beautiful Mademoiselle Dianne De Poitiers (Helen Morse), the students are going for a picnic to the local geological formation Hanging Rock. It is the morning of St. Valentine's Day, and the girls are reading poetry and Valentine's Day cards, including Miranda (Anne-Louise Lambert), Irma (Karen Robson), Marion (Jane Vallis), Rosamund (Ingrid Mason), Sara (Margaret Nelson), and Edith (Christine Schuler). Spending the time strolling and relaxing in amongst the unusually shaped and positioned rocks, the girls go various directions and wander to unseen places, but specifically three of the girls, Miranda, Irma, Marion, and Miss McCraw in a sleep like state climb into the higher parts of the rocks. The rest of the party return to the school distraught, Mademoiselle De Poitiers explains to stern College authority and headmistress Mrs. Appleyard (Rachel Roberts) that these four young ladies have gone missing, the local police are called and a search party led by Sgt. Bumpher (Wyn Roberts) and Constable Jones (Garry McDonald) go looking. Young Englishman Michael Fitzhubert (Dominic Guard) is questioned when he admits to witnessing the girls wandering at the Rock while he was lunching with his uncle Colonel Fitzhubert (Peter Collingwood), his aunt Mrs. Fitzhubert (Olga Dickie), and his valet Albert (John Jarratt), and he becomes obsessed with searching for Miranda. Albert returning to Hanging Rock discovers an unconscious but living Irma, and the news spreads to Woodene, dehydrated and exposed she wakes and has no memory of what happened, and jittery teacher Miss Lumley (Kirsty Child) is told by Mrs. Appleyard for parents to withdraw their children from the school. Later Miss Lumley in a drunken state resigns from her position, Sara was potentially to return to the orphanage, but her body is found in the greenhouse, believed to be suicide, and apparently Mrs. Appleyard is found dead at Hanging Rock, the search there continued occasionally over several years for the missing school girls, but without success. Also starring Jacki Weaver as Minnie, Anthony 'Tony' Llewellyn-Jones as Tom and Frank Gunnell as Mr. Whitehead the school gardener. The performances are all well done, the location for the puzzle to happen and unfold is a fantastic choice for its distinctive look, and as it unfolds the unknown origins of the missing girls makes everyone turn sour and the plot goes into slightly dark territory, it is certainly a most watchable period psychological mystery. It won the BAFTA for Best Cinematography, and it was nominated for Best Costume Design and Best Sound Track. Very good!",Picnic at Hanging Rock
6,Woodyanders,Haunting and fascinating,9,15 August 2017,"1990. Several students from an all-female college inexplicably vanish into thin air while spending a St. Valentine's Day outing in the Australian wilderness.Director Peter Weir ably crafts a hypnotically dreamy atmosphere that's in equal degrees ethereal, enigmatic, and sinister, vividly captures the suffocating repressiveness of the early 20th century Victorian era, lets the compelling story unfold at a leisurely pace, and makes excellent and evocative use of the titular ugly and uninviting main location. Cliff Green's oblique, yet still intriguing script offers plenty of pungent criticism of the stifling zeitgeist of the Victorian period and the deep-seated need to escape from sexual and social repression into a better more permissive world.Moreover, it's superbly acted by a top-rate cast, with especially stand-out contributions from Rachel Roberts as stern headmistress Mrs. Appleseed, Anne-Louise Lambert as the sensual and entrancing Miranda, Karen Robson as the perky and fetching Irma, Jane Vallis as the nerdy Marion, Dominic Guard as the smitten Michael Fitzhubert, Christine Schuler as annoying whiny frump Edith, Kirsty Child as compassionate teacher Miss Lumley, and Margaret Nelson as rebellious troublemaker Sara. Russell Boyd's sumptuous cinematography delivers a wealth of stunning and beautiful visuals. Best of all, Weir's admirable refusal to provide some kind of explanation for the disappearances gives this film its own singularly arresting cinematic allure.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
7,rmax304823,"""There's some questions that has answers, and others don't.""",8,3 August 2008,"What a movie. Australia started come out with films that received worldwide attention in the early 1980s, with ""The Last Wave"", and a cascade of them has followed, from the raucous ""Mad Max"" to more contemplative issues. And on top of that, they've been putting out a horde of toothsome blonds, from Olivia Newton John to Nicole Kidman. GOOD ON YA, MATE! When it comes to magnificently featured blonds, Anne-Louise Lambert, as Miranda, will serve in ""Picnic at Hanging Rock."" It's true she's a bit tender, only in her mid-teens like the other girls at Mrs. Appleyard's (Rachel Roberts') expensive boarding school in rural Victoria. But the fact is that the film is full to the brim with budding but repressed sexuality -- repression of all kinds, in fact, with all that strict discipline and formality. Even one of the other students seems to have a crush on Miranda. So blame Joan Lindsay and Cliff Green, the writers, instead of my own admittedly warped interests.All is not well at the Appleyard School. The continent at the time was nothing much more than an English outlier and the school has imported its parent culture wholesale -- the strict class system, everything. It's already old fashioned. And it's feeling the financial pinch too.All Mrs. Appleyard needs is some kind of scandal, and that's what happens. The girls go on a picnic to nearby Hanging Rock, a jagged jumble of bushes and gray boulders with stucco textures sticking up out of nowhere. A handful of girls, including Miranda, decides to climb to the top. A plump whiny girl follows and when she tires she loses contact with the others. Panic -- in self-disciplined British style -- follows when the other four fail to return. A search is implemented. Bloodhounds, aboriginal trackers, but there is no trace of the girls.After a day or two, one girl is finally retrieved in an unconscious state and brought back to the school. She's out of it because of exposure and shock, but she is at least ""intact"", as the doctor puts it, although there is some mystery about why her shoes and stockings are missing, and why she isn't wearing the corset that is part of the girls' uniforms. No trace of the others is ever found. The affair effectively brings about the end of Mrs. Appleyard and her boarding school.Not much of a story, is it? A couple of girls go missing from a school and that's that. Not a drop of blood in sight. Not a single motorcycle roar within hearing. And yet the film seems pregnant with a sense of languorous dread, of something that is not quite right -- cockeyed, off kilter. We can sense it from the very beginning, with a score drawn from the deep chords of an organ and from Zamphir's Peruvian nose flute or whatever it is. When there is no music on the sound track we can hear the buzzing of flies or the soft growls of wind about the stone mansion. Why, when Miranda is leaving for the picnic, does she tell another that she's not coming back. And after all, what DID happen to those missing girls? Applause for director Peter Weir and for others of his ilk, like Nicholas Roeg, who have the courage to put out a movie that isn't all hustle and bustle, that takes care to establish an atmosphere that is almost a character in itself, that lingers over the contrast between elegant, lacy civilization and the indifferent implacability of nature's raw rocks.Everything begins and ends at the right time and place, one of the characters insists repeatedly, and the world of movies have a place for films like this that challenge and mystify rather than just tickle your glands.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
8,Tweekums,An Australian classic,9,21 June 2021,"This Australian film is set at the end of the Victorian era in a girls boarding school in a remote part of Australia. On St Valentine's Day 1900 the girls attend a picnic at the titular Hanging Rock. They are warned that the rock itself is dangerous, as is the local fauna; however four of them decide to explore, a teacher follows them. Something happens on the rock; three of the girls disappear, along with the teacher; the one girl who returns has no idea what happened to her friends.Normally in a film this would be a mystery to be solved but while the question is asked it isn't answered; instead we see how the disappearance affects the other girls and the school's staff; most notably headmistress Mrs Appleyard. It also affects two young men who witnessed the girls heading towards the rock; one of whom insists on searching for them when others have given up. The film has a really great atmosphere; somewhat spooky despite there being nothing explicitly supernatural going on. There are clearly elements of horror cinema without anything horrific being shown. The way the story is shown creates the impression that what we are seeing is based on fact, even though it is a work of fiction. Peter Weir did an impressive job directing and the cast were great; it helped that those playing the girls weren't too much older than their characters. Overall I'd certainly recommend this film.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
9,moonspinner55,Purposefully vague...yet even on that level it is half-realized,6,11 July 2001,"This Peter Weir drama is so languid and low-keyed, art-house lovers are always tempted to pass it on as an automatic masterpiece (witness the 1,000+ people on this board who gave it a 10). Plot concerns three turn-of-the-century schoolgirls who disappear along with their teacher while on a field trip with their class in the Australian Outback. Film takes a very odd approach: it wants the mystery to be unexplainable, yet all the while drops little clues along the way. It has a sinister atmosphere that eventually gives way to irritation because nothing is ever done with the trappings of the premise. It's a striking film visually but not verbally, as the line-readings of the young girls are rather monotonous (possibly on purpose). Weir shows a great gift for visual communication, however his narrative suffers in the process. As a result, that beautiful, haunting final shot ends up not meaning much and ""Picnic At Hanging Rock"" leaves its audience swatting at red herrings. **1/2 from ****",Picnic at Hanging Rock
10,dbdumonteil,a weird and entrancing fantastic movie in spite of its weaknesses,7,15 September 2003,"This is a very original fantastic movie and it aims at showing that in fantastic cinema, horrible things don't happen only at night. They can also happen during the day and sometimes in completely unexpected circumstances. ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" is like ""the Blair Witch Project"". The two movies have got a lot in common: they're deprived of special effects, there aren't any bloody sequences and above all, there isn't any rational explanation on the strange phenomenons that happen. Moreover, both are bathing in a weird atmosphere and they contain a end that leaves the spectator bemused and it isn't here to reassure.However, Peter Weir's movie is inferior to ""the Blair Witch Project"" because it introduces 3 major faults: it drags on and is sometimes boring and unlike the quoted movie, it doesn't succeed in creating a lasting fear feeling during all the movie.Nevertheless, ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" is a truly unique film that shows Weir's talent. This one remains one of the best directors that Australia gave us.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
11,Quinoa1984,"enigmatic near-great film about the breakdown of an institution, and a mystery unsolved",9,24 December 2015,"You can read whatever you want into the disappearance of three girls and their watcher/headmistress while on holiday in 1900 Australia at a place called Hanging Rock. That is what makes Picnic at Hanging Rock intriguing but what also, I imagine, was frustrating for certain viewers coming out at the end. Americans generally want a mystery solved at the end of the day, whatever it is, and if it isn't, if things are left ambiguous or just left up in the air, it doesn't translate into ginormous box office or widespread attention (Fincher's Zodiac suffered that problem, though has been reevaluated as a landmark by many). With 'Hanging Rock', Peter Weir crafts a story from Joan Lindsey's novel that favors atmosphere and setting a particular, dreamy, almost-forgotten-but-in-the-wind style over story, but when you look at what plot is there it's actually compelling, especially for what comes after the main event is like watching a slow-moving, delicately staged car wreck, if that makes sense.We see this group of girls go to this Hanging Rock, and four of them going off on their own to explore (a Boticcelli reference happens too, from a picture book to seeing the girls walk away, there's more significance there that I can't point to but I know it's there). They climb and explore, with one girl sort of complaining and trailing behind (in the end, she'll be the one not to disappear), and when the midday malaise and doldrums hits, the girls just get up, walk slowly (or shot in slow-motion), and they're just... gone. Unlike Antonioni's L'Aventurra, which was also notable for a story where a character goes missing and the mystery is existential in nature, we do see these girls in the moment they vanish. But... what exactly happens? Many theories have been posited, from the basic (they fell down a hole, with only one of them getting out, the one who does, eventually, get rescued), to the more outlandish (aliens, which I wouldn't think far off given the mood). One thing is for sure, Weir doesn't make things very naturalistic in his direction, from simple things like when one of the girls opens a gate, turns her head as birds flap around in the sky and there are images transposed onto one another of her looking, the birds, the Hanging Rock itself. Or the music, which has an air at times of being very early-Man with its pan-flute sound, and then at other times sounds like an Italian horror movie, with the dread and over-the-top style that comes with that sound. But this is contrasted with realistic but restrained acting that's meant to reflect the period, especially from the head-master played by a very effective and cold Rachel Roberts.But this restrained feeling is something that bursts open, like one of the corsets one of the women or girls wears that just pops out and when emotion just over-flows. There's a great sense of how there is radical change in how the girls feel about things, since Miranda (Lambert) is one of the girls gone and the one who was kind of a leader in the group. When she exits, the girls are left with no one, and when the one girl returns it's like a pack of wolves snaps out. That is an extremely affecting scene, where things escalate very quickly but it doesn't seem outside the scope of reason. It helps that the setting is at a girl's preparatory school where everything has to be orderly and though not too harsh in discipline (we don't see anyone hit or punished in abuse) there is this sense of 'be straight, do what you're told, oh and don't forget to pay that tuition or you're out). And a lot of the struggle between what to do and what to say is seen in the character of Sarah, who can talk but is so shy she barely says a word (an orphan, of course), and this disappearance hits her the hardest of all.I loved seeing how little by little the school comes apart; it would be one thing to make the story just about the girls being gone, but the author and Weir as adapter know that's just not enough to sustain the narrative. There is no one real protagonist here - except maybe the Rock itself, which has its own ominous glow to it, one of the great rocks in movies alongside the monolith in 2001, full of its own grandiose, eerie enchantment - but Rachel Roberts comes close to playing something of a central figure, and its someone we kind of dread seeing, but has a lot of dimension. She may be stern and even cruel up to a point (certain things she says to Sarah are shocking to see), but she has a job to do which is giving these girls an education and put them forward to the world, regardless of any of their, um, emotions or, heaven forbid, sexual tension (which is there, if you look kind of close enough). Though there are other people on the side, like the supporting male characters who keep going back to search the Rock due to guilt and some unspoken words, it's Roberts show a lot of the time and she makes it work on the human level to balance the visual poetry and grace.Yes, Picnic at Hanging Rock is often poetic, and only once in a while becomes a little too much or, borderline, dated in its attempts to make something larger than the real world into the mythic or other-worldly. There are no easy answers to what happens to these girls, but there doesn't need to be given how the story unfolds, who does what to whom, and seeing the decay of an institution come undone ever so simply by the worst that can happen - the 'not knowing' even being worse than finding them dead, for example.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
12,edwagreen,Picnic At Hanging Rock ***,7,24 May 2014,"The film starts to take off after the disappearances occur and the people left behind are there to remember and question what actually occurred on that fateful day in 1900.There is a true treasure of a performance by Rachel Roberts, as the principal, head-mistress of the Australian Women's College where the events took place while girls visited a geological formation, only for many of them to disappear. Roberts is outstanding as the head caught up in this apparent tragedy. Running the school in a tyrannical manner, her veneer cannot be matched and she only has to face the realization that what has happened may ruin her financially, as well as her actions towards an orphan whose tuition has not been paid up in six months.There are strong hints of lesbian behavior between two of the girls, and one of them correctly predicted her own fate.A haunting, interesting film.

Here we have a dreamlike exercise that weaves a tale of Victorian schoolgirls, circa 1900, who disappear after a school picnic on a sunny day near Hanging Rock.That's the story in a nutshell. Before they disappear without explanation, we see the girls leading rather repressed lives without really getting to know any of them.The disappearance is something the whole story seems to be building toward, because there's an air of dread and mystery about Hanging Rock that makes the viewer feel the conclusion will reveal something--but it never does. The ambiguity remains right up until the final moment.Summing up: Moody, atmospheric, but rather hollow at the core and some will simply find it a pretentious bore.",Picnic at Hanging Rock

There seem to be plenty of viewers armed with psycho-babble to defend this film's deeper meaning, its undertones of sexuality, power,repression, etc., etc., blah, blah, blah. Whatever. I'm sure director Peter Weir knew what point he was trying to make, but this movie is a monotonous, droning bore, and I was left with no incentive to make sense of it.

17,Wuchakk,Several females suddenly go missing in southeast Australia in 1900,7,8 March 2021,"When the students & staff of a girl's school outside Melbourne take an outing to Hanging Rock on Valentine's Day in 1900, three girls and a teacher mysteriously go missing. What happened to them?Directed by Peter Weir and based on the 1967 novel by Joan Lindsay, ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" (1975) is an artsy psychological mystery that seems timeless. The style is akin to movies like ""Days of Heaven"" (1978), ""The Secret Garden"" (1993) and ""The Virgin Suicides"" (1999). If you like those movies you'll appreciate this one. While not as compelling as Weir's future ""Dead Poets Society"" (1989), there are some obvious parallels. Both movies deal with prep schools that represent the curious constraints of civilization; you play the game to survive and the only way to escape is through some kind of exile.The first act is artistic, but rather dull with an increasing sense of foreboding. Things pick up during the haunting outing at Hanging Rock. Once the females go missing the movie becomes compelling because the viewer WANTS to know what happened. The fun of the movie is to speculate on the clues and come to a probable conclusion, as well as look for symbolic meaning.I should add that I own the ""The Secret of Hanging Rock,"" published in 1987, which contains Lindsay's supposedly missing 18th chapter. I strongly believe this was a scam by the publisher to sell more books after the author's death due to the increasing interest in the story via the movie's international success. There is zero factual evidence of this apocryphal 'last chapter' containing the 'explanation' to the original book. Lindsay had repeatedly stated that she did NOT write any solution and purposefully left the story a mystery, fiercely advocating the open-endedness of her tale. It doesn't help that this curiously brief 'last chapter' doesn't fit the style & content of the original novel; it's awkwardly blunt with its peculiar 'explanation.' Still, it is ONE of the possible answers and certainly adds to the interesting mystery.The film runs 1 hour, 47 minutes, with another version running about 8 minutes longer. It was shot at Hanging Rock in the state of Victoria, about a 50-minute drive northwest of Melbourne in southeast Australia; the Appleyard College sequences were shot at Martindale Hall near Mintaro in South Australia, about a 7-hour drive northwest of Hanging Rock. Other scenes were shot in the studio at Adelaide, which is about an hour drive south of Martindale Hall.GRADE: B",Picnic at Hanging Rock

19,The_Void,Imperfect mystery.,6,8 September 2004,"Peter Weir doesn't direct great films; he directs good films, and Picnic at Hanging Rock is a good film. Picnic at Hanging Rock is a film based on the disappearance of several college students and a teacher on Valentines Day 1900. The film if often falsely thought to be based on a true story. One thing that Picnic at Hanging Rock does well is atmosphere. Peter Weir gives 'Hanging Rock' itself a life of it's own; the way that it is presented on screen is mysterious and interesting. That coupled with his haunting music make for one excellent setting for a movie. Another thing that Picnic at Hanging Rock excels at is creating a sense of intrigue. Right from the start, the film makes you watch; it presents you with the facts, and you feel that you have to watch to find out what happened.From these two things, you might be thinking that this will be a great film; but it's not. It falls down, and the reason for that stems from its ambiguity. The problem with being ambiguous is that you don't give your viewers a definite ending; so after spending nearly two hours watching Picnic at Hanging Rock; you don't really feel like you've seen anything. This means that at the end, the film feels unfulfilling and it left me cold. And how can a movie be great if leaves you cold at the end?On an aesthetic level, the film is sound. It looks lovely; as mentioned, the rock especially is a delight, and the costumes and settings at the school combine to put the film firmly in the early 20th century. The cast all perform well; on an individual level, none of them really shine, but as an ensemble it is a good overall performance. It is a shame that Peter Weir hasn't succeeded in making a great film yet as he obviously has a talent for directing. His directing here is mysterious, and he indulges in having lots of imagery in his film, which adds to the intrigue and makes the film more beautiful. Overall, this film is definitely worth a watch. Its technical side is enough for any film buff to appreciate, but it's on the story side, the more important side, that it falls down.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
20,zetes,An incredibly beautiful mood piece,9,5 December 2001,"There's not too much to say about Picnic at Hanging Rock. It's one of the most beautiful films ever made. Technically, it's perfect. The cinematography is godly, and the musical score, much of which is performed by Zamfir, master of the pan flute, is exquisite. It's also wonderfully directed by Peter Weir - he shows a talent far beyond what I saw in The Truman Show, which is unfortunately the only other film by him I have seen. Hopefully, that will be remedied soon. What I didn't get was the actual point to the film. A film doesn't necessarily need a point, but this one seemed to be trying to say something, but it was never clear what. As near as I can tell, the metaphorical and allegorical content had to do with the state of repression these women were suffering. The camera even lands on a photograph (or portrait) of Queen Victoria at one point near the end of the film. However, if this is the case, it seems kind of pointless to criticize those values. I don't know when the original novel was written, but the film was made three quarters of a century after the events had taken place. Oh, and, by the way, is this based on a true story, I wonder? If there was another point or metaphor being developed, the writers failed to express it.But who cares? Picnic at Hanging Rock is an amazing piece of filmmaking. That's what's important, and that's where it succeeds. 9/10.",Picnic at Hanging Rock

As lovely (particularly on Blu-ray!) as the girls appear with their white flowing dresses and the stunning outback landscape, there is a constant sense that something awful will, and then that something awful has, happened. Peter Weir directs with great skill in this early feature, made the year after The Cars That Ate Paris (yes, just a bit different!) and gets great performances from all concerned. It is some time since I last saw this and found myself captivated as before. Could perhaps done without the pan pipe soundtrack but it was the mid 70s. Lovely.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
22,JamesHitchcock,Haunting Mystery,10,17 May 2013,"To celebrate my 1200th review for IMDb, I turn to another of my favourite films. ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"", based upon a novel by Joan Lindsay, tells the story of the mysterious disappearance of three schoolgirls and their teacher during a picnic in 1900. There appears to be a belief in some circles that both book and film are based upon a real-life event, but in fact the story is pure fiction, although Hanging Rock itself, a spectacular volcanic formation and a well-known tourist attraction, is a real place. The story begins on the morning of St. Valentine's Day, 1900 (in reality a Wednesday but in the film a Saturday) when the girls of Appleyard College, a private boarding school, set out for their outing to the local beauty spot. During their picnic three of the girls, Miranda, Irma and Marion, and their mathematics teacher Miss McCraw mysteriously vanish while exploring the rock. Frantic searches organised by the local community reveal no trace of the missing women until, about a week later, Irma is found unconscious but alive. When she recovers, however, she is unable to say what has happened to her during the interval or to give any clue as to the whereabouts of the others. The film deals with various interconnected themes including social class, sexuality, same-sex friendships and the relationship between man and nature. Most of the characters are drawn from the wealthy or professional classes, and speak with a British RP accent; it would appear that in the Victorian period there was little difference between a British accent and an Australian one as far as the upper classes were concerned. The main exceptions, apart from the coach-driver and the local policeman, are Albert and Sara, a brother and sister who grew up together in an orphanage. Since those days their paths have diverged somewhat. Albert works as a servant in the household of Colonel Fitzhubert, a local landowner. His younger sister is a pupil at Appleyard College, where her education is being paid for by a mysterious guardian, although he has allowed his payments to get into arrears, much to the anger of the headmistress Mrs Appleyard, and she is being threatened with expulsion. Sara is not permitted to accompany the other pupils on their outing, although the reason is never made clear. Both brother and sister have formed close same-sex friendships. Lesbianism is never explicitly mentioned, but it is strongly implied that Sara has fallen in love with her beautiful friend Miranda, although it is less clear whether Miranda returns her feelings. Albert's relationship with Michael, Colonel Fitzhubert's nephew, is clearly platonic, but they are nevertheless close friends, despite the social barriers which at this period normally inhibited friendships across the class divide. It is Albert and Michael's diligent searching, when everyone else has given up hope, which leads to Irma being found. Another theme of the film is the contrast between the propriety of late Victorian Australian society, particularly upper-class society, and the wildness of nature. A key role is played by Rachel Roberts as the stern and autocratic Mrs. Appleyard. She is a woman who sees herself as having a mission to inculcate the values of Christian European civilisation into her young charges but who is defeated and ultimately destroyed by the inexplicable disappearances and who ends by committing suicide. Art was to be tragically parallelled by real life when Roberts herself took her life five years later. The film never provides any solution to its central mystery, and ends with no explanation of the fate of the missing persons. In some films this sort of ambiguity would be a weakness; here it becomes a strength. At times the film takes on a semi-religious, or at least mystical, tone, with the charismatic Miranda appearing as a prophet leading her followers on to some hitherto undiscovered region; their disappearance is not necessarily to be equated with death but with a passage to a new life or a new plane of existence. A hallmark of the film is its atmosphere of haunting mystery, and the unresolved ending is only one of the means which Weir uses to create this effect. Also instrumental is the photography of the Australian landscape, especially in the scenes set on the rock itself, which were shot in misty soft focus, often backlit in brilliant sunlight. A sense of unreality and mystery is also created by the musical score, which makes much use of haunting Romanian panpipe music played by the virtuoso Gheorghe Zamfir. (The film was responsible for creating something of a vogue for the panpipes in the West). There is also the contrasting beauty of the three leading actresses, the blonde Anne-Louise Lambert as Miranda, the dark brunette Karen Robson as Irma and the light brunette Helen Morse as the young French mistress Diane de Poitiers, a beauty heightened by the elegant late Victorian costumes. I said at the beginning of this review that this was one of my favourite films, but it is not just one of my favourites. Ever since it first came out, ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" has been regarded as one of Australia's most well-loved films and the film which put that country's cinema on the international map. It was also the first masterpiece of its young director, Peter Weir, who has since gone on to become one of the world's greatest living film-makers. There is not enough space in this review to explore all its complexities; suffice it to say that since 1975 Weir has occasionally equalled the standard he set here, notably in ""Dead Poets' Society"" and ""The Truman Show"", but he has never excelled it. 10/10",Picnic at Hanging Rock
23,Red-Barracuda,A puzzle that will never reveal all of it's secrets,7,17 April 2014,"In Victoria, Australia in 1900 a group of girls and teachers from an exclusive school go for a picnic near an ancient huge volcanic rock, a primitive place with some foreboding. Three girls and a teacher disappear. Only one girl is eventually found. The mystery remains unresolved. The fallout is devastating for the school.Picnic at Hanging Rock is one of the most celebrated films from the Australian New Wave. This was a collection of movies from that country mainly made in the 1970's that explored new and challenging cinematic territory. Other films include Walkabout and Wake in Fright. Like those, Picnic at Hanging Rock is a pretty definitive example of this group of movies. It's an enigmatic and haunting mystery, with an ethereal and dreamlike atmosphere. It's notable for the inconclusiveness of its plot. Its secrets will never be solved and for this very reason it still exerts fascination and debate. In fact, the film begins with on screen text that describes in advance what is going to happen. So the mystery is known in advance, meaning the audience has a sense of dread right from the beginning and we watch and wait in anticipation. The opening half of the film is sublime, especially the events that happen at Hanging Rock. It's here where the exquisite photography and beautiful, haunting music take hold, as we watch the four girls ascend the rock. Things happen that have some importance but which remain tantalisingly vague - watches stop at 12, the girls simultaneously fall asleep before the final ascent. And then they vanish. It remains a mystery but it feels instinctively like something sexual in nature has happened. Later, the one surviving girl returns with scratch marks and an identical mark on her head that the boy who finds her mysteriously shares. Neither he, nor her, can remember a thing about the experience. The mystery remains a puzzle with some of the pieces forever missing. It feels like Western civilisation has entered the supernatural realm of the Aborigines, a simply unknowable place. Culture clash is one of the underlying themes I think, as this wild primitive land seems like an incredibly incongruous place for the British to extend their culture. The images of the Victorian girls, prim, proper and sexually repressed, contrast so jarringly with the wild, unrestrained Hanging Rock. The rock is so evocative it is like a character itself. Parts of it even look face-like. It's easy to believe it could hold ancient secrets.I often think of this as a film of two halves. The first part encapsulates the picnic and immediate aftermath. This is by some distance the best section of the film. The whole dream-like Hanging Rock sequence is so evocative and mysterious. It's shot and scored quite beautifully too; accentuated further by the presence of the lead girl Miranda played by the bewitching Anne Lambert. While the subsequent investigation adds more intrigue, in fact it's here that the most disturbing moment of the film occurs when one of the girls giggles as she relates seeing the missing teacher run up the hill while stripped down to her underwear. The fact this haunting scene is never seen but only told makes it much more sinister for some reason and again increases the feeling that something strange and sexual has happened at this place. I have to admit though, that I find the second half of the film does not maintain the excellence. The pace is fairly slow and we explore the fall-out from the disappearances. It's interesting enough but simply compares quite poorly with the excellence of the first half. It's only for this reason that I do not praise the movie without reservation. Nevertheless, Picnic at Hanging Rock is something of a one off and there is no other film I can think of that has its peculiar enigmatic tone and for this reason it is something that all adventurous film lovers should check out.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
24,Lejink,Rock of Teenagers,8,19 May 2021,"From the first shot, of a pre-titles notice-board alerting the viewer to what is to follow, namely the disappearance on Valentine's Day 1900 of three young girls and their teacher on the real-life geographical spot at Hanging Rock, Director Peter Weir, at once invites curiosity and intrigue, leaving the audience scratching their heads to try to recollect whether such an occurrence ever actually took place. The wider audience outside its native Australia would have no reason to suspect that this wasn't a recreation of real events which certainly adds to the sense of unnatural strangeness which clings to almost every shot.A group of young Australian boarding-school girls are going on a trip to the local beauty spot, Hanging Rock, accompanied by two of their teachers, one a young Frenchwoman in tune with the girls' sense of frivolity and adventure and the other a starch middle-aged school-marm no doubt sent as the eyes and ears of the school's strict governess.The girls are in their early to mid-teens and with their flowing hair and diaphanous white gowns are obviously presented as being on the cusp of young woman-hood, a sense confirmed by the feelings they stir in two teenage boys, one well-to-do, the other a lowly cabbie. There are several shots implying the phallic imagery of the rock itself and our last glimpse of the later missing girls is of four of them making their way up through the vine-strewn hill path, with the watchful older teacher following in their wake. When they later fail to return the main group, only one of the four is found in the subsequent exhaustive search of the site and she in a catatonic state at that, while the other three and their teacher appear to have disappeared completely.Weir has produced a haunting film which explores the outcome of the disappearances, not only in the practical sense of its obviously damaging the commercial prospects of the school itself but more deeply on the psyches of those caught up in the aftermath of the tragedy.Beautifully shot and well-acted by its entire cast, the movie refuses to resort to pat explanations leaving the events open to conjecture. In that sense, the film is less about an unexplained tragedy than on its impact on those connected to it.Voted Australia's best ever film, it highlighted the emergence of a talented new wave of Australian film-makers and indeed Weir himself would go onto make several notable movies in a long career which naturally took him to Hollywood. This, his breakthrough film is one of rare beauty, insight and mystery, well deserving of its national and international reputation.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
25,paul2001sw-1,Pre-Raphaelites in Australia,6,19 June 2003,"In Peter Weir's film, ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"", a party of upper class schoolgirls and their teacher go missing.  Among the vanished is Miranda, an artistic, angelic, sapphic and telepathic young woman.  The film offers no explanations but concentrates on the psychological effect of Miranda's departure on her erstwhile companions.  But this is not a strictly realistic film either: with a stylised, dream-like aesthetic, one imagines it as the sort of film Miranda herself would have enjoyed.  In form it resembles Antonioni's L'Avventurra, though less subtle and (thankfully) also less boring.  But when everything about the missing girls (not just their disappearance) is left beautiful and mysterious, a hole inevitably opens up in the middle of the film.  A little more humanity, and a little less divinity, in their portrayal might have made it possible to care about their loss.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
26,gbill-74877,"Atmospheric, ambiguous, and amateurish",6,13 July 2018,"Director Peter Weir creates a dreamy feeling to this mystery of the disappearance of three schoolgirls and a teacher during a picnic at Hanging Rock, Victoria in 1900, and that's probably the key to really enjoying this film, soaking up its atmosphere. I liked the ambiguity of it all, as well as the little Victorian age touches, communing with nature and reading poetry. However, as a whole, it seemed a bit like a made-for-TV production, amateurish in places, and melodramatic in others. The whole point, of course, is that horror is more intense when it is unseen and unknown, and, like others, I see the film as a forerunner to 'The Blair Witch Project'. It was harder to appreciate moments when character actions seemed illogical or the film left loose ends dangling. It's telling to me that the original book explained the events in a very silly way (google it), but author Joan Lindsay's editor had that chapter removed. The film is entertaining, but it didn't live up to its acclaim for me.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
27,CuriosityKilledShawn,"A very creepy, if truncated dark fairy tale",8,6 June 2000,"Before Peter Weir became a well-known Hollywood director he started out with a series of short Australian movies and smaller feature films. The most famous of these would have to be Picnic at Hanging Rock, an ethereal, dreamlike adaptation of Joan Lindsay's ultimately unfinished book. The final chapter, and resolution to the mystery, was cut from the novel and published years after Linday's death, so Weir, and screenwriter Cliff Green, basically adapted an incomplete book, creating, in essence, an incomplete movie.On Valentine's Day 1900 the girls of an uppity private college are taken on a day out to titular rock, a foreboding, gloomy outcrop baking in mid-summer heat. Four of the girls separate from the group and go exploring, drawn to the summit in a seemingly hypnotic state. As the rest of the gang pass out at the base of the rock, one of their teachers (none other than Mrs. Mangel herself) follows. Three of the girls, and their teacher vanish into thin air, leaving the moaning fat chick to come screaming back down the rock.The community reacts with anguish and determination to find the missing girls. A local rich boy and his servant go searching for them at any cost, also falling victim to the rock's inexplicable lure. Meanwhile the Headmistress of the college struggles to maintain her integrity under increasing media attention (yes, even in 1900).For a movie set in almost perpetual bright sunlight PAHR is extremely dark. The ominous, deeply sinister sound design draws your eyes to the screen and hooks you. The rock has the ability to hold the characters, and the viewer, in a trance-like state and the mystery is amplified through silence and subterfuge. There is a vital piece of the puzzle that is never explicitly said by the characters, especially after one of the missing girls suddenly reappears, her trance not yet broken.Russell Boyd's photography captures the sunshine of Victoria in such a way that you can actually feel the warmth coming from the screen, and fills may shots with a vignetting effect which would otherwise look cheap, but instead adds to the dream-like atmosphere of the film.The final chapter of Linday's novel (Chapter 18) deals with time travel and suspended animation, which ties in with the clocks freezing at exactly 12 noon. I'm not exactly sure how the movie would have turned out had this been published from day one, but it certainly would have been anti-climax. Or...maybe not.Picnic at Hanging Rock is a film that would give David Lynch nightmares.",Picnic at Hanging Rock

I can't say that this movie would be considered among the top movie list of all time for any particular person, most likely it has found itself in history as among the best Australian movie of all time. This definitely non-American, period mystery movie presents one of the best period pieces of a movie and one of the most mysterious (not in then weird, strange, or odd sense of the word) movies of all time. Whether or not the general American audience would be willing to accept and enjoy this movie is a totally another matter. Nevertheless, I consider this movie by singularly most favorite movie of all time because of the mystery surrounding the movie had how perfectly balanced the confluence of cultures is expressed in this turn of the century (early 20th Century) Australian outback theatrical film.

The film is beautifully photographed and Weir does a good job of evoking the period, taking a very leisurely pace. The best part of the film deals with the events leading up to the disappearance of the girls. The problem is that after that the film seems to slow down to a crawl. Little happens to move the story forward. Ultimately no resolution is offered.

30,sol-,My brief review of the film,6,3 May 2005,"A haunting, atmospheric piece of cinema, the film is very well handled by Peter Weir in the director's chair, and the costumes, cinematography and music all fit in very well. The film however needs to survive on pretty much these virtues alone, for the leisurely pace causes the film to drag and the screenplay is a little unsatisfying. Some parallel is meant surface between the frustrating screenplay and the frustration felt by those trying to solve the mystery in the film. However, this does not really make the film any more fun to watch. Some seem to feel a need to discuss Michelangelo Antononio when discussing this film. His most popular films were of unsolved mysteries that became less and less important as the story progressed. In Weir's film the mystery remains unsolved too, but it never decreases in importance, which causes the film's frustrating nature. On a technical level the film is quite an achievement, and in experimenting with new storytelling techniques it manages to do the job. But, it does not come too highly recommended, unless one is into what it is trying to achieve.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
31,tomgillespie2002,Visually extraordinary,9,13 May 2011,"Picnic at hanging Rock opens on the serenity and excitement of Appleyard College, an all-girls school on St Valentine's day in 1900. As the girls run around, celebrating the day, it is announced that there is to be a trip to hanging rock, a local geological site where millions of years previous, a volcanic eruption formed a very distinctive cluster of rocks, containing many hidden cracks, and passageways to explore. The film is based on the true story of four girls who break away from the titles picnic group to take a closer look at hanging rock. They venture into the labyrinthine rock formations. Only one of the four return, dazed and confused, having no memory of what happened. One of their teachers had earlier gone looking for the foursome and still not returned.What happens after this is the obvious search and rescue routine. The spread of the story also has an effect on the school, which begins to fail financially, and the head mistress turns to drink. In these searches only one girl is ever found. She also has no memory of what happened. I'm trying not to go into too many details of the narrative itself, as I feel that it is pretty self explanatory from a small synopsis. What is incredible, and distinctive about the film is its visual beauty. This is not to say that the story is not good. It is a story of loss and the effects this has on the people involved and surrounding the incident. Much like the effects that the death of Laura Palmer had on the population of Twin Peaks.This was Peter Weirs second feature film after the excellent pseudo- exploitation movie The Cars That Ate Paris. It is a piece of cinema that displays great direction, and an ability to work with actors. This is completely founded by Weirs subsequent work. This film also opened him up to American offers, as it was viewed as a prestige picture, more than likely viewed in the same vein as British costume dramas are in Hollywood. It also opened up Australia as a significant contender in the world cinema market.The opening half of the film, particularly the scenes around the rock have an ethereal quality. This is exacerbated by a sound design that creates an unnerving atmosphere. The various sounds of wind reverberating through rocks, crevices and trees portray an impending sense of doom. The visuals also stunning here complimenting the sound design and incredible musical score. The visuals have a hazy, dream-like quality in these scenes. Cinematographer, Russell Boyd did clearly do a good job, even in the eyes of Weir, as they collaborated on much of his subsequent work.Two of the four girls and the teacher who went searching for them were never found (and still their disappearance is a mystery). I like this kind of ambiguity. It is a natural element of life, and a narrative form that should be utilised more often. I thoroughly enjoyed the piece, and found its visual beauty illuminating.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Picnic at Hanging Rock

Police and that, keep returning and scouring the rock several times, where eventually one giri was located, where the other two girls and a teacher, to this day remain a mystery where, not that there would be much of them left now. No one is more obsessed with finding the girls than this young boy, who becomes smitten by the beautiful and wonderfully portrayed Miranda (one of the missing). There's so many young talents here, and you too notice a 24 year Jarratt, decades before his WC killing days.

33,robert-temple-1,The greatest Australian film ever made,10,24 October 2010,"This early film by Peter Weir has grown in stature with the years, and it continues to haunt large numbers of viewers round the world. Now Peter Weir has made available a director's cut, and a magnificent three-disc DVD set is available with that, the restored original cut, and a disc full of fascinating material including two old TV interviews with Joan Lindsay, author of the novel, and a two hour documentary on the making of the film, A DREAM WITHIN A DREAM (2004, see my review), which features in depth interviews with all the living people who were involved in the production except for one, Margaret Nelson, who has quit acting and declined to participate. In fact, I regard Margaret Nelson's performance as the girl Sara Wayborn as the finest in the film, an uncanny psychic portrayal of the character who I believe represents the author. I am convinced that Joan Lindsay suffered a catastrophic loss of the great love of her life, a girl at her own boarding school (not the same one as the story), and that Sara's passionate love for Miranda is the heart of the mysterious tale of loss. The film succeeds in being a world classic of the first rank for a variety of reasons. First of all, because the young Peter Weir accomplished a genuine work of genius in directing it. But the key to the film working was the casting of Anne Lambert as Miranda. It is true, as Helen Morse says in the film, that she is a Botticelli angel. But it is important to realize that being beautiful is not enough, she had also to be Anne Lambert. As for her amazing looks both then and now, she is like the fourth sister of Alice, Mary, and Matilda Temperley, whom I have said all their lives were born and remain Botticelli angels. There are some creatures who are just like that, and it is a rare but inescapable fact of Nature. Helen Morse was such an overwhelmingly beautiful young woman herself that on the basis of looks alone, she was more impressive even than Lambert. And she delivered an inspired performance as 'Mademoiselle'. Everyone in this film seems to have been gripped by a mysterious emanation of inspiration, and from the accounts they give, they all seem to have worked in a kind of state of semi-trance, resembling that portrayed in the film. In the film, two watches stop at noon, but during the production people's watches also stopped repeatedly! There is something deeply weird about Hanging Rock, a gigantic 500 foot-high volcanic outcrop arising from flat land near Wood End in Victoria, Australia. It may well have some kind of effect on people's brains and nervous systems. It must cause a considerable 'blip' in the gravitational field in the area with all that vast bulk of unexpected extruded mass, and must distort the Earth's magnetic field, causing an enhanced local magnetic variation. All the people who spent weeks making the film seemed to think that it influenced them and entranced them in some way, and did not merely stop their watches. The film itself is one of the most magical ever made. Everything came together to make it a true work of art. All beauty can be appreciated only by contrast with some form of ugliness, whether physical or psychological. Here we have the harsh and relentless character of the Headmistress Mrs. Appleyard, played with inspired and spectacular brilliance by the late Rachel Roberts, who came from England bringing her own weird wig with her. Christine Schuler is perfect as a pathetic, whining girl who screams with terror when she has a psychic intuition that some of the girls are going to disappear forever. Karen Robson as Irma manages just the right level of ambiguity towards the end to maintain the mystery forever. There is a magnificent performance by the young Dominic Guard as the boy Michael. He too seems to have entered almost into a state of trance throughout not only the film but the making of it. Having glimpsed perfection, in the form of Anne Lambert, his life can never be the same. And John Jarratt as Bertie Crundall is more of a typical Ossie, and does an excellent job of it. For this film is set in 1900 and everybody else is formal, and intensely English. Even in 1975, Weir says it was difficult to find a girl in Australia who was innocent and did not have too 'knowing' a manner. He could find none at all in Sydney and Melbourne and had to go to somewhere sleepier and a bit backward, namely Adelaide, before he could find any girls for this film. He hesitated over Anne Lambert because he thought she looked as if she knew too much, but then he realized that her character of Miranda needed to, and Sara says of her: 'Miranda knows things, secrets.' For instance, she knows she will not be coming back and that Sara needs to find 'someone else to love'. The hothouse atmosphere of adolescent girls cooped up together is similar to that portrayed in the brilliant recent film CRACKS (2009, see my review), which also features a girl's boarding school of a bygone era and has a beautiful young woman teacher played by Eva Green who is beautiful and haunting in the way that Helen Morse was. I truly wonder whether CRACKS may have been partially inspired by PICNIC, even subconsciously. Cliff Green did a sensational job of scripting this film and Russell Boyd's cinematography was wholly inspired. The sound of the Romanian pan pipes played by Gheorghe Zamfir (the 'r' is left off his name in the credits) is unforgettable. But most effective is the slowed-down sound of an earthquake which is used as the signature sound of the Rock. This beautiful, haunting, perfect masterpiece will endure as long as Hanging Rock itself.",Picnic at Hanging Rock

This movie is directed by Peter Weir (Dead Poets Society) and stars Rachel Roberts (Murder on the Orient Express), Helen Morse (Far East), Tony Llewelyn-Jones (The Last Confession of the Cannibal) and Jacki Weaver (Silver Lining). The storyline for this is interested and reminded me a little bit of a not as good Last House on the Left the way the movie is more about how people respond to unfortunate circumstances over the actual horror elements.

35,ackstasis,"""Waiting a million years, just for us""",8,1 January 2010,"It's a little surprising that I'd never seen 'Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975),' given that I'm very familiar with its titular landform. Throughout my life, I've visited Hanging Rock on many occasions, and, indeed, I've even shot my own film-making project on-location (this particular high-school documentary included an appropriately-vague recreation of Peter Weir's film, utilising three of my (male) friends as the missing children). Nowadays, with the novel and film exploited as a tourist attraction, Hanging Rock isn't the most mystical of locales, but Weir incites something magical from the six-million old landmark. His ingenious use of sound, photography and editing combine to create a whole other world, steeped in a primal mystery and spirituality. I also loved the dream-like use of the pan flute, which probably inspired Ennio Morricone to do the same for Leone's 'Once Upon a Time in America (1984).'Weir dismisses our traditional notions of narrative convention. After 75 years of cinematic progress, the audience has been groomed to expect resolution; that is, for every mystery there must be a solution. 'Picnic at Hanging Rock' defies this expectation – a puzzle without any pieces that fit – leaving the audience as maddeningly insecure as the film's characters, who can't accept that they'll never know the truth. For her original novel, Joan Lindsay penned an additional chapter (published posthumously as ""The Secret of Hanging Rock"") which explained how the missing students and teacher had entered ""time warp"" of sorts; this reconciliation of an age-old land with the recently-arrived British population hints at the friction between Aboriginal and European cultural values, a conflict that forms the backbone of many classic Australian films, including 'Jedda (1955)' and 'Walkabout (1971).'There's a curious element of liberation in the girls' disappearance at Hanging Rock. The stuffy formality of the girls' Victorian-era lifestyles clashes jarringly with the naturalistic surroundings of the Rock. There's also a sense of sexual repression, a barely-concealed eroticism, not only between the male and female characters, but also among the girls themselves: for example, it's made quite apparent that orphan Sara (Margaret Nelson), in particular, is romantically obsessed with Miranda (Anne-Louise Lambert). The prudish Mrs Appleyard's (Rachel Roberts) sadism towards student Sara may also stem from some repressed sexual desire. Prior to embarking on their picnic, Mrs Appleyard informs her girls that they may only remove their gloves after passing through Woodend. However, while exploring the Rock, three of the girls remove their shoes and stockings, a symbol of nudity and sexual liberation. Similarly, Irma (Karen Robson) is missing her corset when she is recovered from the bush.",Picnic at Hanging Rock

Three girls and a teacher from a boarding school vanish while visiting a volcanic rock in the countryside of Victoria, Australia. While a mystery doesn't exactly unravel (one of the girls is found, essentially catatonic), a complete breakdown of the highly cloistered society found within the walls of the school does ensue. The headmistress (a sharp featured Rachel Roberts) realizes that the scandal spells doom for her school and proceeds to disintegrate into booze soaked madness. Director Weir captures the class structure that existed throughout the British Empire (there's more than one shot of Queen Victoria's portrait) while creating a compelling, deeply involving, even creepy masterpiece.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
38,Lechuguilla,An Unfathomable Mystery,9,23 August 2010,"A profound mystery hangs over this story. Yet, the film's theme is crystal clear. ""Picnic At Hanging Rock"" presents viewers with a scathing indictment of phony Victorian values.Set in Australia in the year 1900, the film tells the fictional story of a group of young girls who journey to a local natural attraction, a rugged volcanic mountain, with its big rocks, lush vegetation, strange birds, insects, and small reptiles. The planned one-day outing is to be a pleasant diversion from the girls' cloistered lives at a boarding school, lorded over by Mrs. Appleyard (Rachel Roberts), a dreadful woman with an authoritarian attitude and a stiff, beehive-like hairdo, who tries to pump Victorian values into the girls.Director Peter Weir really lays it on thick, with those horridly starchy clothes, rigid rules, ascetic lifestyle, underlain by the school's puritanical philosophy. If some of the plot segments at the boarding school had been excised, the plot would have moved faster. And that unctuous narrow-mindedness would still have come through. Also, the girls, being roughly the same age and dressed almost alike, are hard to differentiate.Despite these complaints, the film exudes a wonderful aura of mystery, at least at Hanging Rock itself. Four of the girls go off on their own for a little adventure. Up through the jagged rocks they climb. Only one returns. What happened to the others? Naturally, with everyone at the school so accustomed to programmed behavior and rigid order, conflict and chaos ensue.This is a film that encourages the viewer to think. On the mountain, one of the girls who goes missing blurts out to no one in particular: ""A surprising number of human beings are without purpose, though it is probable that they are performing some function unknown to themselves"". It's like she's part of the mountain itself. Strange. Unsettling.Events at Hanging Rock lead to an unfathomable mystery. Alternate explanations can be suggested, but none are really satisfying. We come to a dead-end, wherein logic fails. And that's what makes this film so very, very intriguing.",Picnic at Hanging Rock

40,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Breathtakingly haunting.. Stays with you long after,10,27 October 2015,"Peter Weir's mystery drama Picnic At Hanging Rock is the very definition of haunting. It has an intangible, dreamlike atmosphere that is at once beautiful and eerie. Nothing quite like it has crossed my cinematic vision up until this point, and can't believe it took me this long to check it out. The setting s 1900, Australia, a land still very much wild and untamed, although partway colonized by the British. In the hypnotizing opening scene, several angelic young girls in a remote boarding school cast longing, lingering looks out the windows at the horizon, and lyrically recite verses of poetry in the early morning air. They are a naive young bunch, because of the times, and their age. They embark with some of their teachers for a picnic at a local landmark, a labyrinthine plateau called Hanging Rock. Four of the girls become curious in the warmth of the afternoon sun and venture into the maze of stone formations high up on the hill. Three of them are never seen again. The fourth is traumatized by a terror she can remember nothing of. It's a mystery that crawls up your spine and grips you with a need to know, yet left unrequited and empty as the unforgiving outback. Cinematographer Russell Boyd paints gauzy pictures worthy of renaissance art, and navigates the spooky rock formation until we think we see things, feel things, and are within the grasp of answers that the film remains obstinate in giving. He even laid bridal lace over the lens in some scenes to enhance the ethereal tone. A huge part of what makes the film work is the knockout pan flute score by Zhamfir that piles on the atmosphere. A classic of true originality and daring exploration.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
41,drownnnsoda,Weir's visual exploration of the perimeters of the void,10,27 December 2007,"""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" opens with a group of schoolgirls in Victorian Australia on a picnic at Hanging Rock, a monolith outside Melbourne. Four of the girls vanish, along with their teacher, and only one returns; the remainder of the film details the outlying effects of their disappearances, on the school, its constituents, and two young adult males who witnessed them there that day.Heralded as one of Australia's cinematic masterworks, ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" is actually based on a 1967 by Joan Lindsay that is equally compelling. The film matches it masterfully, though I would recommend going back to the source material, as I would with most any film adaptation. Peter Weir's adaptation mostly works because he stays true to form: ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" is was not a plot-driven novel, and Weir is smart enough to carry this over in translation. This film is exactly what many have described it as: Hazy, ominous, bizarre, beautiful. The essence of the novel is the void at its center which Lindsay circles around and around with turns of phrase, and Weir accomplishes this optically with hypnotic visuals, cross-fades, and close attention to his actors.The film is really more of a work of impressions surrounding an event, and the intrigue is unexpectedly potent despite a subtle—and rather skeletal—narrative. A memorable panpipe score is present throughout, and is at times serene and at others incredibly discomforting. Rachel Roberts gives a strong performance as the school's repressed, aloof headmistress, while the young female actresses each strike a balance of character and mystery, especially Anne-Louise Lambert, who plays Miranda, the one who ostensibly leads them into the chasm.I can say as a fan of the novel that this film is beautifully-crafted and truly captures the essence of its source material. Where Lindsay offered it in literary form, Weir presents his audience with a visual exploration of the perimeters of the void. We never get to look straight at it—only around it— and that's essentially the point. It's a melody without lyrics, and sometimes that can be more than enough. 10/10.",Picnic at Hanging Rock

44,myriamlenys,"once seen, never forgotten",9,17 August 2017,"A masterful adaptation based on a masterful book.The movie is notable for its sense of existential dread. It suggests that this everyday reality is but a thin skin over untold riddles and horrors : think of the surface of a sea, which looks so innocent and welcoming with its dancing wavelets, but can cover everything and anything, from a sunken pirate ship to a whole mountain range. The depths of the ocean could even hide a Kraken, to be glimpsed only on the Last Day ; in fact, the movie strongly suggests that there IS a Kraken, and a more dreadful one than you ever imagined.It was a stroke of genius to set such a story in one of the eeriest sites of Australia, a continent filled to the brink with wonders both known and yet to be discovered. Moreover, it is a continent where even the most sturdy of Western settlers (or their descendants) entertain a complex relationship with their environment, which is at the same time familiar and dauntingly, terrifyingly alien.Note the many, many careful touches which contribute to the nightmarish quality of ""Picnic"", such as the score : it is not a coincidence that music is played on the Pan pipes.

45,gcd70,Masterpiece of mysterious film making,8,26 January 2008,"Positively haunting film about a group of young girls from a ladies college in rural Victoria whose picnic at Hanging Rock in 1900 goes horribly wrong when three of the students and a teacher vanish high up on the magnificent monolith.Adapted by screen writer Cliff Green from a novel allegedly based on a true story, ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" is eerily brought to the screen by Aussie director Peter Weir, whose connection with the human psyche seemed to be at its height in his earlier films, as was evident in the excellent 1981 production ""Gallipoli"", which portrayed young men thrown into turmoil in the form of ""World War I"".In ""Picnic"", Weir expertly teases out this fascinating tale, keeping the audience breathless as they wait for the mystery to unravel, a mystery that our director is careful never to dispel.Making things all the more involving are some fine performances from a strong cast including Helen Morse, Vivian Gray and Jackie Weaver. Watch especially for Rachel Roberts strong showing as school governess Mrs Appleyard, and fine turns form Kirsty Child and Anne Lambert as two of the young girls.Adding an extra chill to proceedings are the almost ghostly pan-flute themes played by Gheorge Zamphir, which are strongly supported by Bruce Smeaton's equally effective original score. Production values are all quite superb also, with sets and costumes (Art Dir. David Copping) from the Victorian era convincingly recreated, riveting cinematography from Russell Boyd and smart, sharp editing.Indeed a masterpiece of mysterious film making created with magnificently judged simplicity from Peter Weir, and certainly one of the best Australian films from the 70's, and arguably one of Weir's best ever.Thursday, September 29, 1994 - VideoPeter Weir intended to create a legend with ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"", and he has done so superbly, giving the film an eerie mystique and a quality that's almost ethereal. The rock is portrayed as an entity in itself, with real power and a mystic aura.Adapted from Joan Lindsay's novel by Cliff Green, the story of three ladies college girls and a schoolmarm who go missing on the mysterious, volcanic monolith in 1900 is truly haunting. Weir teases out the tale with assured professionalism, always maintaining that uncertain element which keeps the audience riveted.Performances are all outstanding. As the headmistress Mrs Appleyard, Rachel Roberts is powerfully disturbing, while Vivien Gray does distracted and puzzling to perfection. Strong support comes also from Dominic Guard, Helen Morse, Kirsty Child, Anne Lambert and Jackie Weaver. Director of Photography Russel Boyd's lensing is spectacular, breathing life into the rock and giving the surrounding countryside a great, grand look.Good editing, art direction, set decoration and authentic costumes all help immensely.

I get that criticism, but for me, a movie that makes me stay awake at night, puzzling over its small details, is diabolically brilliant. This is a movie that makes you think, and it doesn't expect you to figure out the answers either. It simply poses an infuriating question, and waits quietly as you try to figure it out.

47,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Surreal and Eerie Film of Disappearing,8,12 February 2020,"This was a film that I heard from one of my favorite podcasts. They had said they didn't necessarily think it was horror, but the concept of the film had me intrigued. I finally decided to check it out and write this review. Now I'll be the first to admit, it isn't technically horror. It does have enough elements for me that I'm going to write this up to say why. The official synopsis is during a rural summer picnic, a few students and a teacher from an Australian girls' school vanish without a trance. Their absence frustrates and haunts the people left behind.As the synopsis states, we are at a college that prepares women to be ladies back in 1900's. It is Valentine's Day and the girls are going to a rock formation that was created by volcanic activity in the area millions of years ago. The school is run by Mrs. Appleyard (Rachel Roberts). She is quite strict. As the girls file down to leave, Miss Lumley (Kirsty Child), advises Sara (Margaret Nelson) that she will not be attending. We aren't given the reason yet though.Sara is an interesting character as she is love with her best friend Miranda (Anne-Louise Lambert). I don't think it is in the way that sexual, because we learn later that Sara grew up in an orphanage. Miranda informs her that she needs to open up to other people as she won't be at this school with her forever.The rest of the girls file into the carriage that will take them to Hanging Rock and Mrs. Appleyard informs them they can remove their gloves when they pass the small village. Along with them are two teachers, Greta McCraw (Vivean Gray) and Mlle. De Poitiers (Helen Morse). They are also warned to watch out for poisonous snakes and ants that live in the area.While there, Miranda along with Marion (Jane Vallis) and Irma (Karen Robson) decide to go exploring. They're given permission and head off with Edith (Christine Schuler) allowed to follow them. Strange things start to happen like their watches stop. They were forbidden from climbing the rock formation, but do anyway. The higher up they go, the more weird things that happen. Edith wants to return and is shocked when the other three remove their shoes and stockings. They go even higher up and Edith screams.Also in the area is Michael Fitzhubert (Dominic Guard). He is there with his uncle, aunt and their valet Albert (John Jarratt). They noticed the young women as they were going up the rock formation. They're shocked by the news that they're missing. They are also the first suspects of possible doing something to them. This takes some weird turns from here. Edith is found, but Miss McCraw went to look and now she's missing. What happened to them and where could they have gone?Now I need to start off here stating that director Peter Weir did a phenomenal job of creating a creepy atmosphere. I knew before seeing this that there are way too many things that are poisonous in Australia and that is prevalent when they are going to leave and the things they're told to watch out for. The danger is high and these young women still go off on their own. It isn't unbelievable that a volcanic formation would be magnetized, which is why their watches stopped working. It is when the women start to climb the formation does it get eerie.I normally talk about the soundtrack of a film as one of my last things and I'm not the greatest at noticing them unless it really sticks out. They have a flutist playing a song to Pan and it is quite creepy sounding. To go along with it though, the women start to do things that aren't natural and acting weird. Immediately seeing it, I started to wonder if possible there is something supernatural here at play. If not that, it could go back to natural things causing them to go mad. It was perfect connection to make the film have an even more surreal feel.What makes this film even more interesting is I felt it gives us another explanation in the form of Michael and Albert. Michael feels guilty and it made me wonder why. Seeing him get sucked in the madness to try to find them had me wondering if he was a part of it or just a good hearted person.The final aspect of the story I wanted to touch on was seeing the lives of those affected by this event. Sara loses her only friend and she learns that she might be kicked out of school. Her benefactor is behind on the payments for her to stay there. Mrs. Appleyard has to deal with the backlash of losing these students and her school hangs in the balance. We even have the police officer assigned to the investigation as he is mobbed by his own people for answers. This event affects more than just the lives of the missing and it is something we don't really think about.My only real big issue is that I thought there were some pacing issues in the later second act of the film. I thought it did well in establishing the characters and the mystery. Seeing the beginning of the breakdown of those involved was good, that had me hooked. It kind-of meanders for a bit before it picks up in the third act again. It actually has a pretty bleak ending as well, which I was a fan of.Acting for this film is something else that was quite strong. Roberts is really good as the headmistress. She wants her school to succeed as well as the students, but she is villainous in how vindictive she can be. She is extremely strict as well. Morse is quite a sweet teacher, but weight of what happens to her seems to break her and I thought it was a solid performance. All of the girls are all good in their distinct ways. Nelson is also quite a tragic character. I also wanted to commend Guard. His character I originally disliked, but seeing what he is willing to do turned me around. It's also fun to see Jarratt in another of his early roles here. The rest of the cast rounded out the film for what was needed.There's not really much in the way of effects for the film. They do make the characters look disheveled, which is interesting since the time period they are all dressed up. The costumes look authentic and also quite warm to be in. I think it is also interesting as well since they have to be so proper. The cinematography is also well done.I'm already touched on it a bit, but the score to this film is absolutely amazing. There are really two different types of songs that the film uses. At times that they are going more for the eerie feel, there is the flute that is played. Being that it is a song to Pan, it's interesting that things that are out of the norm are happening. There is more classic music for the other times which I thought was good as well as it fit the scenes.Now with that said, this film isn't necessarily horror, but the feeling of dread and the mystery definitely make it close. It is haunting to try and figure out what is happening. Going from there, seeing how this event affects everyone is as well. I thought the acting was really good across the board. There was a slight pacing issue, but it doesn't ruin the film. I liked how they really made it feel like it took place in the 1900's and was shot very well. The score of the film was great and fits the scenes perfectly. I would say that this is a good film and one that I will check out again in the future.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
48,Samiam3,A solid art film about an incomprehensible mystery,7,31 October 2010,"Peter Weir's Picnic at Hanging Rock is a very realistic film, which becomes a fantasy by using a device so simple, it's brilliant. Something is shown to us; then it is taken away in a manner that denies logical explanation to the viewer and the characters alike. Four Australian college girls go hiking up the Volcanic side of Hanging Rock on their school's Valentine's day picnic. Four go up, only one comes down, and she is unable to explain what happened. Search parties are carried out the next day, and the day after. Everyone wants an answer.Picnic at Hanging Roack spends a fair amount of time committed to creating a garden of eden through the camera. The grass is tall, the leaves are green, the flowers are blooming, birds sing, streams glisten in the sun, all of which is over looked by a very rugged, archaic rock formation, with erosion holes that almost form faces if you look close enough. Picnic at Hanging Rock's decision to embrace anti-conventional realism possibly owes something to the likes of new-wave film makers like Anonioni, Goddard, Truffaut, all of whom want to put distance between the screen and the viewer But for this film, that wont do. Yes it needs to be realistic, but it also needs the viewer's investment. Picnic at Hanging Rock will not have you turn away, I can guarantee that. This is not a bleak film like L'Aventuraa, this is an enriching and haunting piece of work which makes true statements. When something goes wrong, everybody wants an answer. Weir sells it to us flawlessly, never over doing it or under doing it.As impressive as the movie is, it's not quite great. The performance quality feels over- mannered and the last quarter or so of the movie, feels a bit draggy, choosing to spend time with some of the less interesting characters. I should probably mention now, that this is a movie supposedly based on true events, events which remain unanswered. So all the better it is then that the movie remains also unanswered. Picnic at Hanging Rock, is easily and delightfully beyond standard classification. It is an art film, but one that values the viewers investment more than it values self-indulgently being a rogue (a frequent complaint about art films) ...this is one worth seeing.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
49,Spleen,Sphinx without a secret,6,24 September 1999,"Three schoolgirls go wandering into a rock formation in the middle of the Australian bush, and they are never seen or heard from again.  No-one has a clue what happened to them.  -Well, not quite no-one.  Another schoolgirl saw them vanish, and evidently saw something unspeakably eerie - although that's easy for Peter Wier to claim, because he feels himself under no obligation to tell us what she saw.  Nor does he tell us what happened to the three missing girls.  He never so much as drops a hint.  He does, however, make us sit through two hours of mysterioso hand-waving before allowing us to be absolutely SURE that the whole experience was a waste of time.There are relationships between the remaining characters to be explored but since there's not a lot of movement on that front, either, we're left with no more than a one-note mystery lacking any solution.  Oscar Wilde coined the useful phrase, `a sphinx without a secret'.  It's important to realise that there's nothing in the least intriguing about sphinx-without-a-secret stories: with no secret, there's nothing to be intrigued ABOUT.  The story can only offer a contrived atmosphere of secrecy, whipped up in this case by lingering panoramic shots of the Australian bush - which, take it from me, is the least attractive woodland in the world - accompanied by some twerp improvising sweet modal nothings on a flute.  If you get to the end of the film you'll never want to hear a flute again.I have a vague feeling that all Australians should watch `Picnic at Hanging Rock' - I sort of have this idea that it's our duty - but if you're NOT Australian, I will gladly let you off the hook.",Picnic at Hanging Rock

51,onepotato2,Vexing,5,22 February 2010,"Three girls school students disappear (seemingly supernaturally) without a trace on a nature outing; meanwhile back at the ranch, the headmistress (right out of Dickens) takes pleasure in mistreating a girl. I like me some ambiguous movies. Show me a Rorschach movie (Wetherby, Plenty, Comfort of Strangers) and I'm always intrigued, and this has its appeal, but every scene played neutrally for two hours makes one long for anything with a bit of impulse behind it. After the title incident (40 minutes in), it just starts to feel like a visual meringue. Even without answers, it craves a bit more structure. The photography is nice. Some frames look like Old Masters, but this is largely in the first half where attention is usually lavished on setting tone and establishing the plot. In the second half, obvious points get stated and restated. And the second lesser interesting plot line (Sarah can't pay for school) serves only as a bait-and-switch distraction to prevent from having to disclose anything about the first one. The two plot lines are apples and oranges. Tension grows in a conversation between the two young men, which shows the kind of ambiguity the rest of the movie needs, until Weir blows it by having one of them make their innocence explicit. It plays like a movie that had scenes subtracted, rather than one whose ambiguity was intended (which it is).The weakest aspect of the movie is the characterization, which is very poor. Every conceivable type of femininity assayed (by a largely female cast) is found wanting. Every character is held up to scorn: // The girl-students are flighty dingbats distracted and hysterical over their virginity // Iron-willed martinets turn out to cower from girl fights // Severe, Dickensian headmistresses are vindictive control-freaks because they're no longer young & attractive // Homely, bespectacled chubby wallflowers are pills // Hired girls are tramps. What's left? Only a man could let this many anti-female stereotypes accumulate without noticing it.One is encouraged to conclude that hyperactive virgins with no place to discharge their sexual energy, instead have conniptions and get into mischief. But sex alone wouldn't fix these girls. And a movie isn't richly ambiguous just because it studiously avoids showing you anything conclusive, like a Harold Pinter writing exercise. There is not enough to concentrate on in the 2nd half. I have no idea what the cruelty of the headmistress has to do with anything happening in the better half of the movie.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
52,Galina_movie_fan,"Helen of Troy as a Young Girl or ""Everything begins and ends at the exactly right time and place""",8,31 October 2005,"It is easy to describe the film without giving too much away. Its plot summary tells you exactly what happens:""Three students and a school teacher disappear on an excursion to Hanging Rock, in Victoria, on Valentine's Day, 1900. Widely (and incorrectly) regarded as being based on a true story, the movie follows those that disappeared, and those that stayed behind, but it delights in the asking of questions, not the answering of them.""Peter Weir in his early film skillfully moves from the recognizable intimate world of the girls' school filled with poetry and high neck dresses, corsets and the mutual crushes to a pagan environment in which ""modern"" principles and standards have no meaning and no values.If we assume that the movie does not belong to the straight realism genre but to the ""magical"" or ""mythological"" realism, a lot of things would make sense. We may never find out what exactly happened to the girls and their teacher but it would not matter - we could guess. I see this movie as Miranda's story. The girl of such beauty, charm, and charisma simply could not exist in this world for long time. She seemed to know or to feel it when she told her friend Sarah, ""You have to learn how to love someone else because I am not going to be here for long time"". I've read many times that this is a movie about sexual repression and I would not say that I completely disagree but I think that it has many interpretations, and with its open end and the mystery still present after all these years, any explanation is possible. During their ascend to the Hanging Rock and the noon day nap, the girls and especially Miranda don't seem repressed or unhappy; on the contrary, they are in the state of content and bliss. I'd say that they were longing for something miraculous to happen and I did not feel the presence of menace or nightmare luring through the trees and ready to materialize in the still hot air and swallow them. I think that Miranda with her golden hair and ethereal beauty was reincarnation of the young Helen of Troy. At that day, February 14 1900, two parallel worlds came as close to each other as possible and there was a window inside the Hanging Rock. One was the turn of the 20th century Victorian world with its restrictions, rules, and laws of what is proper and not and another- the ancient world of the Greek Gods that used to rule the Heaven , Sea, Earth, and Underworld and sometimes, would kidnap the mortal women of immortal beauty. You'd ask ""What? Why""? I say, how about the Flute de Pan, the instrument that was first invented by the God of Nature, Pan and which hypnotizing sounds lead the girls inside the rock? The Gods knew that Helen's beauty could destroy the countries and be merciless killing force for many men. They did not stop it thousands years ago from happening - they decided to do it on the Valentine day, 1900. They took Miranda -Helen and I hope they sent her to the Island of Blessed Spirits where she is happy and where ""even the highest flying birds of memory could not reach her."" You know, I wish the film stopped right after the disappearance. As much as the further scenes involving the search for the girls and their teacher, the sad and heartbreaking Dickensian tale of an orphan Sarah, and the story of the ""iron lady"", Mrs. Appleyard are interesting and compelling, they seem strangely unnecessary - they don't add anything to the Miranda's vanishing. The movie is about eternal beauty and femininity, their rarity and impossibility to reach and to own them. The social aspects would work perfectly in another movie, not in this one. Anyway, first thirty minutes of ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" are perfection, beauty, and unbearable sensual delight that I've not seen or experienced very often in the movies. I'd rate first 30 minutes  10+, the rest of the film  7.5.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
53,Easygoer10,Overrated Mediocrity,5,26 June 2020,"I am a big fan of Peter Weir. I also understand this is his first big screen film, so I give him some latitude. Regardless, the acting is at best mediocre. The plot is good. Unfortunately, he blew it. I did not find anything ""magical"" or ""ethereal"", which are tenets supposedly associated with this film. No way. It's a waste of time and money. 7 years later, Weir made one of my favorite films: ""The Year of Living Dangerously"" (1982) starring Sigourney Weaver, Mel Gibson and Linda Hunt. That is a truly brilliant film. Sadly, this is not. I want a refund!",Picnic at Hanging Rock
54,JLRMovieReviews,This Day for a Picnic is a Day You Won't Soon Forget!,10,31 May 2016,"St. Valentine's Day 1900. An all girls' school. Based on true facts, this film concerns a group of girls who are treated on a day off from studies to a picnic at Hanging Rock for culture and leisure. A female teacher and male custodian of the school are chaperones. But what begins as carefree frivolity quickly becomes disturbing. The group comes back with less in the party, because some of them went missing and couldn't be found due to a trek up the rock. Repurcussions of this are far reaching for the school and the school mistress, played to perfection by Rachel Roberts. This is the plot but it is far from the whole spectacle of this, the mystic of this doomed trip. Peter Weir, who also directed ""Dead Poets Society"" and ""Gallipoli,"" creates a world of young, pure girls whose imaginations and hearts are full of expectations of the wild, tomorrow, boys and each other. They are ready for life and love, eager for discovery of new things. Even Ms. McCraw falls into the spell of the Hanging Rock. This is obviously a very sensual film, with the girls fresh and ripe as they are blossoming into womanhood - but enough of the allegorical euphemisms. Because there was very little known about the case and very little discovered as to what really happened, there are no answers given in this film. What Weir does do is capture the enigmatic character of the rock, atmosphere, the whole incident. What makes it even more tragic is the sadness of the girl, Sara, who is so connected to Miranda, one of the doomed girls, and how Sara talks of her childhood, the orphanage, and her brother, of whom she misses and of whom we see throughout the film. Rachel Roberts gives a chilling performance as the school mistress and how, as she loses her control of her life, she loses all her grip of her senses. If you like period pieces, I think I will you find this thought- provoking and entertaining, despite its very dramatic ending with no solid answers to anything. An uneasy and beautiful movie experience makes ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" a movie essential.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
55,frankde-jong,Film with an animistic flavor,6,29 March 2021,"""Picnic at Hanging rock"" is about a disappearance without solution. These kind of films are rare. The only other example I can think of is ""L'avventura"" (1960, Michelangelo Antonioni).Because the film gives not a single clue about a human offender, one can't help to start thinking that mother nature herself was acting. This fits in nicely with the animistic belief of the Aboriginals, the indigenous people of Australia, the continent where the film is situated.In this respect ""Picnic at hanging rock"" has much in common with ""Walkabout"" (1971, Nicolas Roeg). Nature is dangerous (in ""Picnic at hanging rock"" the camera shows us many creepy reptiles) and men are vulnerable in the vast wilderness (in ""Picnic at hanging rock"" the vulnerability of men is symbolised by (still) innocent teenage girls dressed in immaculate white)The relationship between nature and men described above may be typical for a country that only has habitation on the coast and is pure nature inside.The theme of the film is fascinating, but the duration of the film is a little too long.",Picnic at Hanging Rock

There is something quite intentionally enigmatic about this movie that leaves you puzzled from beginning to end. This is one of the first movies that put Australian cinema on the map, so to speak.

57,sharky_55,"This we do for pleasure, so that we may shortly be at the mercy of venomous snakes and poisonous ants.",6,2 March 2016,"The schoolgirls of Appleyard College are led by the angelic Anne- Louise Lambert, and seem to be at a blossoming age where in the absence of boys furtive glances are cast all around, giggles and valentines litter their conversations, and their beauty already drawing the notice of older men. And if you did not spot these signs, what about the tremendous Hanging Rock, jutting out of the ground with a towering phallic presence, every curve and jagged edge suggestive to the teenage mind. But under the iron-fisted rule of headmistress Mrs. Appleyard this trembling sensuality has been repressed - the Victorian-era dress code and manner of speech take this a step further. They are well trained and versed in the arts, uttering Poe and Shakespeare dreamily and somehow, appropriately. The film is at its mesmerising and hallucinogenic best when it discourages reason and logic, and simply lets the girls wander wherever their young minds and bodies take them. Weir superimposes the erratic flight of the beasts of the air on the girl's faces, and dissolves barren landscape on barren landscape. Static closeups of leftover food teem with insect and scavenger life - in the soundtrack, their buzzes become an unshakable presence in the background, serenading the untamed wilderness. And when the girls arrange themselves on the top of Hanging Rock in a formation that suggests an otherworldly, supernatural influence, the screen shimmers visibly in the heat, sweaty and hazy with perspiration and mystery. But it loses its power after that initial encounter with Hanging Rock, where it switches back to the students and teachers remaining, all of whom are desperate to solve the puzzle. The soundtrack, consisting mostly of a piercing, ethereal pan flute and a section where it turns demonic and foreboding as they make their way up the cliffs, loses it potency with each subsequent visit. What Weir wants to achieve is an atmosphere that displaces all rational explanation, as if the Australian outback was beyond the reach or understanding of humans and is reclaiming those children for itself. But he cannot resist dangling clues that inevitably spur investigation and theory; Miranda's strangely prophetic ""I won't be here much longer"", the single corset found at the scene of the crime, the doctor outlining all the physical injuries on Irma's body in meticulous detail as if to say 'pay attention', and the strange, additional disappearance of Miss McCraw which does not amount to much. These details, which are spoken of plainly in that English dialect, and discussed not in the outback, but in the boring grey interiors of the school, are of course not given any closure. The audience is supposed to be hypnotised and transfixed by the Hanging Rock and its grasp, but every time we switch back to the edges of civilisation their power is suppressed once more. And then in the vague, unrewarding ending that has many viewers frustrated, Weir quite deliberately conceals. He places the camera within that uncanny crevasse, peering out at a hesitant Michael inching towards it. It tilts down agonisingly to reveal Irma's body, and zooms in to show the horror on his face - and she of course conveniently cannot remember a thing about what has transpired. It never even thinks of revealing the other side, and the film becomes bewildering rather than enigmatic.",Picnic at Hanging Rock

On a rigidly organised day trip to a geologically complex and ancient landmark, Hanging Rock, a group of the girls wander off - and simply vanish.The sense of the unreal, eerie and weird at around this point is a master-class in restrained exaltation. The music in particular pinpricks the senses, making one feel quite unsettled - pocket-watches stop on the dot of midday and afterwards we hear of sightings of a 'red cloud' just then, too.I still believe that the film peaks too soon, all this happening around a quarter way in, leaving the remainder of the film for the salient questioning, searching for the missing and coping with the aftermath.Rachel Roberts - as all the cast are, is very good, often excellent; she's the formidable school headmistress, mixing restraint with authority, with just a hint of self doubt during the darkest hours of the dilemma.Without doubt, the star here is the cinematography, by Russell Boyd, the level of its sumptuousness as deep and thick as the finest carpet, delicate and luminously soft to convey a sense of the ethereal.",Picnic at Hanging Rock

Three of the girls and a chaperone wander off for a short walk and disappear into thin air.  A week later one of the girls mysteriously turns up unharmed, but with amnesia about the events that befell them. 
Peter Weir never makes it clear what is reality and what is dreamworld.  The events and the actions of the people don't add up.  It's a morality play and the characters, scenery, and events are just symbols arranged by Weir to make his points.  At least that's what I think he was doing.  
I must admit that PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK is different, although probably much more so in 1975 than now.  It has languid, slow pacing that I found annoying given the lack of a plot.  If you are into this type of movie you'll enjoy it.  If you are not, you'll want to skip it.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
60,Bob-45,"Poetic, Mythical Mood Piece",8,17 November 2000,"PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK (PAHR)is lyrical, suspenseful, frightening, beautiful, melodramatic, political, sensuous, maddening, frustrating and, ultimately unclear.  It is NOT a movie to be seen in a theater (a typical theater audience would probably sneer) because it DEMANDS repeated, sequential viewings.  Even then it is doubtful one will sort things out completely.   Certainly I haven't.  Perhaps, had I watched the CRITERION DVD and listened to Peter Weir's audio track, I might have understood the seemingly mixed messages in his director's cut.  Even this cut still contains at least two choppy scenesearly in the film which MIGHT have established a clearer perspective.  Art should NOT have to be explained, though it CAN be deliberately ambiguous. IS the film about ""sexual awakening?""  Maybe, though I can cite arguements against that.  Certainly if it is, it is about much more.  It seems as if the film is the film is much more about the ""expanded consciousness"" of women, a precursor to the acceptance of women in modern society.  Ironically, this may be true due to the respect afforded Queen Victoria.  Her strength may well have destroyed the very provincialism associated with ""The Victorian Age."" But WHAT about the mystery?   Three of those that disappeared seem ""otherworldly"" from the very beginning.  Two are thinkers. The third, Miranda, seems to have transcended thought and become almost purely spiritual.  When she is described a ""Bottecelli beauty,"" we are shown the picture of the goddess Venus.  Perhaps these three simply ""went home.""  The film offers no definite conclusion. PAHR is not a film to be understood.  It is a film to be FELT.

61,TOMASBBloodhound,As beautiful and impenetrable as Australia seems to those who've never been there.,10,11 February 2009,"Rich, full of symbolism, yet ultimately ambiguous, this early Peter Weir effort is one of the finest films I've stumbled across recently. Why do so few films challenge their audiences? And why are the ones that do so hard to find? A film like Picnic at Hanging Rock is not just watched, it is experienced. Combining an attractive cast, breathtaking shots of nature, beautiful music, and some eerie sound effects, this film is a lot like the rock itself. It either absorbs you completely, or probably just rejects you like it does to various characters we meet.The story is presented in almost documentary manner at the beginning and very end, yet it is not based on any actual event. It is Valentine's Day in rural Australia in 1900. A dozen of more girls from an elite finishing school pile into a wagon and head out for a leisurely gathering at a foreboding rock formation. The teen-aged girls read poetry back and forth between them as a teacher offers grandiose scientific descriptions of the rock as they approach. There are a few other people already there. But they will only end up as spectators. No matter how much they try and learn of what is about to happen. After a while it is noted that everyone's watch has stopped at precisely noon. Odd, but no big deal. Then, four young ladies set off on their own and begin to scale the formation. Once they reach the top, all hell.... or something breaks loose. One of the girls begins screaming. The next thing we're told is that the other three girls are missing, along with their prim and proper math teacher. What the heck happened? And why can they not be found? Why can the girl who made it back only recall a few tiny details? The rock is searched again and again. No girls. Two young men who saw the four wander off head out on their own to search the rock. They find one of the girls alive, but do not figure out the rock's secret. How did the girl stay alive up there for a week? Why are her hands all scratched up, yet her bare feet are perfectly unscathed? These kinds of questions are not answered by Weir's intentionally ambiguous film. In fact one could probably watch this film 100 times and come up with that many theories. And you'd likely notice something different each time. I especially identified with the noble young man who camped out on the rock after searching it all day. He was so smitten by ""Miranda"" when he first saw her walk past, that he will love her and dream of her the rest of his life. Even if she is never found. Every young man dreams of someone they know they will never see again. And that little wave she gives in the final shot is quite telling. She knows she is going off to a place only she knows about, and the fleeting glimpse is the last thing anyone left behind will have to remember her by.

In 1900, schoolgirls set out with a teacher for a picnic at an aboriginal sacred site; there three of them disappear and are never found.It is a genuinely tantalising film that brushes up against supernatural elements but offers no resolution to its central mystery. It certainly alludes to white colonialism, and its atmosphere evokes burgeoning sexuality, but its 'meaning' remains an open question - a factor that burnishes its mystique.

The movie got good reviews, but when I saw it at long last, I felt unsatisfied.Not when the disappearance was never explained; I knew that that was going to happen. Not by the cinematography or performances; those were good. But I never really understood what the whole point was. You see a lot of people and a lot of events, but you never really get much information on anybody. What exactly was Australian life like in 1900? What was the idea of the girls' school, besides an alternative to the orphanage? What prompted the girls to explore the rock (which proved to be ugly and uninteresting when viewed up close)? Why did the survivor who was found not say anything when she came back? I realize the movie was supposed to leave things open-ended, but I feel they overdid it.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
65,Rickting,A timeless masterpiece,10,8 September 2017,"This is my favorite film I've seen in 2017 so far. I quite simply have not been able to stop thinking about it. One of Australia's most well-loved films, in this movie- part period-drama, part mystery, part terrifying horror film- 3 schoolgirls and a teacher go missing on a mysterious rock in the Australian outback. This is a mystery with no solution- but you wouldn't want there to be one. It's like what Morgan Freeman says in The Shawshank Redemption: sometimes words can't do something justice. A true ending would only unravel the movie's haunting, heartbreaking story and ruin the atmosphere and spoil the many equally fascinating interpretations. I see it as a story about sexuality, Peter Weir (Wow, why isn't he more famous? His direction here is genius) sees it as a film about nature, others describe it as a film about colonialism. This is such an interesting, fascinating film with so much to say, and it's backed with amazing performances, brilliant visuals and a complex, chilling and heart-breaking script. Occasionally the pace is slow, but who cares to be honest. Aside from the fact that maybe showing a bit more of how the community outside of the school reacts to the disappearances, there really is hardly anything wrong with this movie. Both a haunting yet beautiful dream and a captivating drama, this is truly a work of art. 9/10",Picnic at Hanging Rock
66,bbewnylorac,"Beautiful, memorable film",9,13 April 2020,"What I love most about this film, as an Australian, is that it tells a very local story. It's a long way from Hollywood. For the first time in a film, I saw my local history up there on the big screen. OK, sure it's fictional, but it really portrays what rural Victoria may have been like in 1900. You see Hanging Rock, a beautiful outcrop in the bush. You see a classical private girls' boarding school, turn of the century clothes, horses and buggies just before the motor car and the way our great-grandmothers may have been educated, if they were well off. It's true - and people forget this - that the film is actually quite a shocking horror movie. All sorts of gothic tragedies happen, chief among which is the disappearance of three girls and a teacher into the rock, with one girl returning, permanently psychologically scarred. As someone said, it's a little like Blair Witch Project - an exercise in imagining what it would be like if the supernatural were real. The cinematography by Russell Boyd is a revelation - sweeping landscapes, lingering profiles, close ups of insects, supernatural touches - he experiments with everything but it somehow works. The acting by a fresh young cast is fantastic. Who else but the ethereal yet intelligent Anne Louise Lambert could have played Miranda? Probably never has a movie in Australia been smarter about, and more respectful of, women. I'm so glad that the author of the original novel, Joan Lindsay, lived to see her book brought to the screen so beautifully. What's it all about? It could be about the mysteries of life and death, about European colonials entering a strange indigenous world, or about adolescent girls reaching maturity and something going awry. Or it could just be a really entertaining, well made film that still intrigues us, many years after its original release.",Picnic at Hanging Rock

In the first 40 minutes or so - before the disappearance - the dialogue occasionally becomes too portentous to totally work, but otherwise the film barely puts a foot wrong. The sense of the landscape as almost a living thing - rock formations shot to look like faces, animals emerging from their surroundings organically - is beautifully established, and the sense of mystery and threat lingers without ever becoming overwhelming. Guilt lurks near almost every character, the sense that mostly unrevealed secrets are constantly on the verge of being exposed is tangible.",Picnic at Hanging Rock

I had heard it was based on a real life, mysterious disappearance and didn't find the film mysterious at all.On a 2nd viewing I liked this film much better. I don't think it should be explained or described as a horror film or even a mystery. I'm not sure how it should be described. The acting is very good and the story starts out rather low key, unpretentious and soft with a girl gently reading a poem. It has a featherlight feel to it as it starts out dragging one into a state of tranquility or relaxation. We see very accurate costumes and beautiful sets. The film never really grabs me and shakes me though. I feel like something is just around the corner but it never quite gets there. I would say the most interesting character is a young man who becomes obsessed with finding the girls who disappeared at hanging rock. We really want to know more about what he has found out.

70,avik-basu1889,A mystery with surrealism and allegory !!!,9,7 November 2017,"'Picnic at Hanging Rock' starts with the line ""What we see and what we seem is but a dream. A dream within a dream"". That line says and expresses everything about the tone, feel and general vibe that Peter Weir sets for the film. Weir leaves no stone unturned to make sure that the film plays out on an elevated dreamlike realm. We get a lot of cross cutting, super-imposed visuals, slowed down movements, etc. complemented by beautiful moody scores involving pan pipes.Personally I found three ways to attempt to make some sort of a thematic reading for this film:1. The film can be interpreted as a work that explores the abstract concept of fantasy/curiosity itself. The girls of the college are shown to be fascinated by the mysterious Hanging Rock. It gives them a chance to experience something beyond the boundaries of their normal, routine and mundane life in the college. The Hanging Rock represents an otherworldly aura of wonder to these young curious girls. The film(like the novel it is based on) then reverses this when the three girls along with Miss McCraw go missing. Now what happened to these girls at the rock becomes the center of fascination, fantasy and curiosity that overwhelms the other characters which lends a meta-quality to the film's narrative because it is that same sense of curiosity and fascination that grabs the viewer during the entire second half of the film. After Irma is rescued, there is a scene in the film where she bids farewell to her friends(she is crucially dressed in striking red unlike the other girls who are dressed in their normal whites). Instead of the scene progressing into a sweet farewell get-together, we get an explosive encounter where the other girls start screaming and hounding Irma for the answer to their questions about what happened that day at the Rock. This scene is a clear and deliberate representation of the frustration of the viewers for not getting an answer to these questions.2. The film can be seen as an exploration of sexual awakening as well as repression. There is a shot at the very beginning of the film where 4 girls of the Appleyard College are standing in a line diagonally to the frame as they each tighten the corset of the one standing in front. This particular shot beautifully and subtly juggles two elements at the same time - on one hand it presents a picture of tender feminine beauty and sisterhood, but on the other hand with the tightening corsets it shows the severe restrictions that they are subjected to. Their fascination for the Hanging Rock can be easily thematic equated with a burgeoning sexual curiosity with the Rock itself representing a male aura and the eventual disappearance of the girls being somewhat of a sexual awakening. In the initial scenes of the film, there is a bit of an attachment that gets hinted at between two of the girls of the college namely Miranda and Sara. Miranda open asks Sara to learn to love someone else as she is going away. The 'going away' can be interpreted literally, it can be interpreted as a foreshadow of what's to come, or it can easily interpreted as Miranda claiming that she won't remain the same girl after encountering the Rock. She will become someone more aware, more conscious and more mature. There are recurring shots of a swan that come after the disappearance of the girls and the swan is made to look like it represents Miranda or at least her spirit. Thematically this could be interpreted as Weir telling us that Miranda is still present in the midst of all the others, it's just that she is unrecognisable in her new state. There's also a lot of possible euphemisms in Miss McCraw's description of the Rock. Weir deliberately juxtaposes the tenderness, the sweetness of the girls with the rough, abrasive, intimidating presence of the Hanging Rock. What's even more telling is that the 3 girls before venturing into the infamous crevice, take off their stocks, their stockings and later when Irma gets rescued, we learn that the corset was missing too alongwith the knowledge that Edith imparts about Miss McCraw's state when she made her way up to the rock. It certainly feels like an act signifying sexual liberation.3. The third way to interpret the story will be to read it on a much broader scale and see it as a narrative that shows the conflict between imperialist order and indigenous Australian roots. Mrs.Appleyard is a very strict and overbearing headmaster who does her best to make sure that every little thing of her school remains orderly and every student remains obedient to an almost slavish extent. There are subtle shots of the photos of Queen Victoria in her office underlining the imperialist roots of this institution. But the 3 girls and Miss McCraw escape Appleyard's brutish order and become one with nature. In terms of music too the film uses European Classical tunes and juxtaposes them with the very exotic sounding central score of the pan pipes.Having written all that, the magic of the film which I am smitten by isn't down to the themes and the possible allegories, it is actually down to Peter Weir's hypnotic, storytelling style. He makes sure that the entire film feels like a dream that plays out on a plane of elevated reality. The acting is great from everyone, especially Anne Lambert and Rachel Roberts. Russell Boyd's cinematography is exceptional. The outdoor scenes are vibrant and aesthetically appealing .I don't think, 'Picnic at Hanging Rock' is for everyone, but if you like dreamy, languidly paced mood pieces, then this one might be for you.",Picnic at Hanging Rock

Based on the novel by Joan Lindsay (who was deliberately ambiguous about whether the events really took place), Picnic at Hanging Rock is less a mystery than a journey into the mystic (it stubbornly refuses to reveal the fate of those lost), as well as an inquiry into issues of class and sexual repression in Australian society. Visually mesmerising throughout, and given the look of an Impressionist painting (Weir and director of cinematography Russell Boyd were inspired by the work of British photographer and film director David Hamilton, who had draped different types of veils over his camera lens to produce diffused and soft-focus images), the movie has an ethereal, dreamy look that make it a work of poetic horror whose secrets haunt viewers to this day. The main title music was derived from two traditional Romanian panpipe pieces: ""Doina: Sus Pe Culmea Dealului"" and ""Doina Lui Petru Unc"" with Romanian Gheorghe Zamfir playing the panpipe and Swiss born Marcel Cellier the organ.

Beautifully photographed through and through. The music was also absurdly beautiful and powerful - I was under the impression while watching that it was a fully original score by David Appleyard, but it turns out that most of it is classical tunes pulled from other composers. The cast is rather appealing, but no one character is truly enticing, they are all somewhat vapid. The strongest element of the film is in it's visual presentation - it truly feels like witnessing an exquisite painting in motion, but sadly, the film's content itself is primarily uneventful and thus primarily unfulfilling. One of the most inconclusive films I have seen in quite some time. I understand that people perceive the magic with this film to be that type of Lovecraftian concept of ""what matters is what is not witnessed"", but it doesn't work for me so well in this case.

Four of the girls wander off. 1 gets separated from the group and returns to the others, frantic that she's lost her friends. A teacher then goes after the lost girls. When it gets dark, the remaining return to the school, horrified that they've lost 4 members. Search parties look for the girls over the coming week and find 1 girl, but the rest remain lost forever.The movie is directed very well (Peter Weir) and is eerie at times, but it really loses intrigue after the half way mark. The cast is pretty weak, which didn't help at all. My highlights were:-Vivean Gray, in her best work outside playing Mrs Mangel in ""Neighbours"". -The phrase ""have you taken leave of your senses"".-John Jarrett, in his best work outside of ""Better Homes & Gardens"".Lowlights include: -No ""real"" picnic eg sandwiches, eskies etc. -The score. -The fact I discovered it's not based upon a true story. Not that I wish 3 girls and their teacher perished, just that I feel I've been misled for the last 30 years.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
74,mlraymond,"Strange, dreamlike film tantalizes, and gives no answers",10,25 October 2006,"The first time I heard the film's theme played on the pan pipes, I was chilled. The music seemed so haunting and eerie, completely at odds with schoolgirl innocence, white frocks and Victorian naiveté. The music seemed more appropriate to a horror movie, and then I began to realize that this film might well fall into that category. The film is unlike anything I've ever seen from an American director, and its Australian landscape and long ago characters may seem even more intriguing to an American viewer because of being so unfamiliar. There are so many possibilities in this movie ,that I will only mention one that I find both disturbing and fascinating. In the sequence that was later cut from the original version, Irma, who was found unharmed on the Rock, and Michael, the young Englishman who went to rescue her, have a restrained sort of courtship, even though Michael can't stop dreaming of Miranda. There is one very odd scene, which has two significant moments in it. They're sitting together in a row boat alone, and he asks her very quietly, "" Irma, what happened on the Rock?"" Then we see Irma looking off in the distance thoughtfully, but not answering him. In the next scene, they've returned to the boathouse and are standing with their backs to one another. Michael stares off in the distance and says, "" I'm leaving here and never coming back"", at which point,Irma leaps up and runs away. What I have always wondered is, did she in fact tell him what happened on the Rock, some strange secret that only she knew, and then felt betrayed by him in some way? If so, what was the nature of that secret?It occurs to me that she may not have told him anything at all, because she genuinely doesn't remember, and in sheer frustration at the hopeless mystery of it all, he makes the comment about leaving. What adds to the strangeness of the moment is that Irma herself is leaving Australia soon to return to Europe.The whole odd courtship sequence was apparently removed at director Peter Weir's request from the official video release, because he felt it slowed the story down too much, but I feel it adds to the strange, unexplained nature of the whole thing.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
75,jldmp1,Visual Feast,8,2 October 2006,"This entire movie serves as a cinematic delicacy -- more than just as 'pretty pictures'. What is striking is the uncanny use of 'architecture'.On the one pole, we have the neoclassical architecture of the Appleyard College...everything is prim, ordered, perfect. On the opposite pole, we have the 'architecture' of the titular rock formation...wild, dreamy, unknowable. The polar dualities are also reflected in the competing works of poetry.Weir reveals to us that the rock is in fact a character, and what's more, it is telling us the story. Any attempt to see the 'story' from the other direction only results in frustration, acknowledged in the narrative as the failed 'search parties'. Quite purposely, the setting is the end of the Victorian period, so as to heighten the sense of stricture, and liberation from that stricture through nature.As lovely as the 'dream' is that Miranda leads us to, I still somewhat prefer the vision of ""Barry Lyndon"". But I also have to think that some of this 'architecture as a character' quality rubbed off on Kubrick for ""The Shining"".",Picnic at Hanging Rock

The film is intentionally ambiguous about what happened and why its characters behave the way they do—much more ambiguous, it turns out, than the novel by Joan Lindsay upon which it is based. In this way it is not unlike ""The Innocents"" (1961), an adaptation of Henry James' psychological horror novella ""The Turn of the Screw.""

I had always assumed it would be L'Avventura Down Under. But they're completely different films- if each meditations on the vanishings of individuals. Antonioni's characters, while exploring natural terrain, vanish into the Nothingness of the world, which for Antonioni, is part and parcel of the Nothingness of Humanity. Weir's characters vanish into a Nature that both encompasses humanity, speaks to it as subject, yet exists as unknowable Other. Weir's vision of disappearance is at once more comforting and more terrifying than Antonioni's. It's somewhere between ""Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy"" and ""Anti-Christ.""",Picnic at Hanging Rock
79,GirishGowda,A Haunting Tale,9,14 August 2013,"On St. Valentine's Day in 1900, the girls from a private institution, Appleyard College, go on a picnic to a local geological volcanic formation, Hanging Rock. Four girls take permission and decide to explore the rocks. They encounter another family and a couple of boys. By the end of the day, three of the girls and a teacher are missing.This is a masterpiece in psychological drama. We're given just enough clues to guess at what might have happened, but if you're looking for a definitive wrap-up in the end, you're going to be sorely disappointed. The movie offers mere suggestions rather than complete explanations. This could be the work of aliens or of the Gods, as the rocks seem to take the form of faces throughout the movie. At one point, I even suspected the two boys who were around the vicinity.Appleyard College - The term 'college' is applied very loosely since this is just a finishing school where they're taught on how to be the 'perfect' woman. Victorian sexual repression and symbolisms are bubbling just beneath the surface. The girls slowly start to let go of their inhibitions and are attracted by something, which could possibly be their doom and yet move towards it. This is just completely fascinating since there's barely any dialogue and yet the visual is so very powerful. The animals in the Australian mountains add to the uneasy feeling. What I've told is just one part of the story. There's another part with a girl, a lovely French teacher and the headmistress, Mrs. Appleyard, which is simply amazing. At the start of the movie it says this is all based on a true story. A little google search and you find that the claim is total bogus though. Its based on a fictional novel. Considered as THE movie which put Australian films on the map, this is indeed a great classic. An eerie, atmospheric mystery which leaves you haunted and wanting for more. 9/10",Picnic at Hanging Rock
80,Artimidor,What we see and what we seem are but a dream - a dream within a dream,9,17 April 2012,"Above all Peter Weir does two key things in ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"": Setting up a huge mystery and, well, dealing with it in a very unique way devoid of any sensational or commercial interest, an approach, which has divided audiences ever since. If you take the trip, be prepared for something different - you might be claimed by the mountain, and whether that's a good or a bad thing, well you be the judge of that. But whatever you get out of it, it will defy categorization.The film at any rate is true to Joan Lindsay's novel, and compared to the book has the advantage of a beautifully haunting score composed by Bruce Smeaton, mostly performed by pan flute player Gheorghe Zamfir - melodies which become recurring players when the events unfold. With this enchanting and eerie music Weir underlays the lush dream-like imagery he photographs, thus creating an alien, otherworldly, even ethereal atmosphere, somehow outside of time and space, a breath of eternity. You might get chills, goosebumps or both at the same time in this weir(d) mix of beauty and horror out there at that Australian college, where Mrs. Appleyard (Rachel Roberts) holds a tight rein over her girls. ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" can be and has been interpreted in numerous, very different ways, and there was even an ""insightful"" chapter of Lindsay's novel released posthumously. But frankly, all what's fascinating is in the book. And in the film. If you've seen it and enjoyed it you'll know why.",Picnic at Hanging Rock

Some interesting characters, beautiful photography, great sound effects, efficient acting, wonderful costumes, an eye for detail, and - the jewel in the crown - a couple of haunting Romanian folk melodies played on the pipes of pan with pipe-organ accompaniment.The incident in the film is so realistic for fantasy that many people (some still do)thought that it had actually happened. In fact it is based on a science fiction-ish novel by Joan Lindsay.It is a picture of the innocence of pre-pubescence, and how it blossoms not in one fell swoop but as a gradual process. In Miranda, it has developed a little more than in her schoolmates. She, and those with her, leave the innocence behind, and that innocence, like the missing girls, is gone...for ever.The basic mystery, of the girls going missing, is just the top layer. Like another famous Austrlian film, Walkabout, every time you see it, you will notice some detail that you have never noticed before.The old Chips Rafferty films were never like this.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
82,tequila101,Scray & very Sad. This film is truly a gem to watch as these two Elements are together.,9,20 January 2011,"In ways this true story shocked me. I don't know why, it just looked shocking. Three girls going up on a high rock and never returning. Really scary stuff for a true story.The film's true story is based around many girls who are going on a picnic at a high rock. Four of them wonder off and one runs off very worried about what will happen while the other three suddenly go missing at this point. A large search goes out for a mistress and the three girls. It is so sad, two are never found, the mistress dies and only one is found.From the scene where the girls climb the rock, I felt really sad, every scene was sad and everything inside the atmosphere was sad. Everything became sad and horrific. I will admit there was a really funny scene which i won't give away and there were two mildly funny scenes but overall I didn't find this funny at all. At times I found it to be a horror film.With this film I also found that there was two stories put together. Besides the girls gone missing on the large rocks, the story about the lost little girl who was to go back the orphanage, Sarah. Really sad what happen to her.Besides saying all that, this film has a scary and creepy tone, it's a little funny (in my opinion, it's pretty horrifying and but most of all it is the saddest of the saddest.

83,thinbeach,An Evocative Feast,6,6 December 2017,"This film is certain to yield many varied interpretations, primarily because it doesn't give any answers. A class of Victorian-era school girls take a day trip to Hanging Rock - a large rock formation shaped by volcanic activity in the Australian countryside. They idle about in the forestry before a group of four wander off alone and climb to the peak, but only one comes back, and what's more, one of the staff members, who ran off on her own, also disappears. The search for the missing is taken up by the police, along with two men who were present at the time of the disappearance - one English upper class, one Aussie working class, with their vernacular completely at odds with each other. The girls can not be found, and while the search continues, we spend time learning the backstories of various other characters inside the school - from the headmistress, to the pupils, to the gardeners and the maid. The unsolved disappearance shrouds each male character a suspect, and every single character a great mystery that might reveal an important piece of the puzzle, despite seemingly being caught up in their own unrelated troubles, such as money to pay the school fees, and poetry recitals. The first half of the film is youths romantic allure, a teenage girls optimism. The second half is a discovery of the pain residing underneath the perfectly manicured surface, with the journey into the rock a symbolic representation of passing from one to the other - a child to adult. The great anticlimax however, is that the case remains unsolved.As it is not based on a true story, this irresolution is not an unfortunate by-product of real life events, rather a purposeful artistic decision, and it becomes clear we are watching not a detective story, but an art film using the story telling techniques of one, in order to maintain suspense. We are hoodwinked. The clues given to follow the crime - clocks stopping at 12, scratch marks on hands yet not body - are simply red herrings. Sherlock Holmes could not unwind it, because there is nothing to unwind. The clues were never intended to lead answers, as opposed to narrative tools taking us from A to B, and if you're anything like me, to be purposefully mislead under false pretences does not leave a good aftertaste.If we are to take a figurative rather than literal interpretation of this film, we can find meaning in the symbolism used. Based on a novel, the author Joan Lindsay was an artist before she was a writer, and from the framing of shots to the constant symbolism, this film is reminisce of an old oil painting in motion. The three girls who are lost to the rock are seen removing their shoes and stockings moments before their disappearance, while the missing teacher was last seen in her underwear - shoeless. Meanwhile, the only girl to come back from the rock did not remove her shoes or stockings. In artwork, the removal of shoes was commonly symbolic for sexuality - the undressing - which is as sure a sign as any that their disappearance is metaphoric for the loss of virginity. The somewhat phallic looking rock becomes the representation of man, and set on Valentines Day, the film depicts the dangers women face when wandering into this wild new territory, and leaving their protected innocence behind. For the older staff member, who had previously described volcanic eruption as though male ejaculation, it may represent a lifetime of repressed sexuality, as others have commented.It is beautiful to look at, from the casting to the costumes, and the juxtaposition of those characters and costumes against the bright Australian bushland. The old masterwork paintings are some of the most terrific images created, and not enough films share their influence. It also sounds terrific, with the constant and varied bird chatter, to the foreboding ticking of clocks, classical music, and a haunting otherworldly pan flute. The camera movement is at times languid, ebbing and flowing between characters and their surroundings, soaking up the atmosphere. It is the epitome of the 70's. All hazy images, dreamy vibes, mythic, nature based philosophy, that was just as likely (or more) to have stemmed from the herb than the library. It is a very complex and indirect way for one to express themselves, and likely to appeal those more concerned with feeling than logic.If Picnic at Hanging Rock proves anything, it is the power of mystery. It may frustrate the heck out of our rational minds, yet leaves an enchanting impression. Finding it better to watch than to think about afterwards, to me it is a picnic that probes the tastebuds, but does not fill the stomach.",Picnic at Hanging Rock

It's all a little more complicated than that! Set in the Australian bush in 1900, you may regard it as a mystery, a horror story or something else entirely. As the producers tell you in 'A Dream within a Dream - the making of A Picnic at Hanging Rock', they figured the only way they could bring Joan Lindsay's story to the screen was to pick the most attractive cast they could find. This they did, and I'll admit to having a crush on a member of the cast at the time. This resulted in the only fan letter I ever wrote to an Aussie actress, and I still have her greatly treasured reply, doubly appreciated as she has disappeared and couldn't be located for the DVD release!

Running a girls school could not have been easy in the 19th century esp. given all the constraints on outward appearances. The strange relationships and interactions that resulted are explored here.

90,knucklebreather,Engaging period horror film,8,25 January 2011,"""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" is in some ways a minimalist movie. The movie is the story of a class of boarding school girls who go to a huge rock formation called Hanging Rock on Valentine's Day, 1900. Three of them, along with a teacher, mysteriously disappear.There are no special effects, no crazy monsters chasing down the abundant supply of heroines. There is immense personal conflict - love and hate - between many of the characters, but much of it is unspoken, to the point where the audience is almost starved for more information, as opposed to bored with a glut of uninteresting sappy details as in many films. Despite its sparse dialogue and lack of cinematic fireworks, there's a huge amount of depth to the movie. It's a period piece, a horror, psychological fiction, a romance (although most of that is not spelled out for the viewer), and of course one could spend all day speculating about what it all means.I felt that the main reason the movie succeeded was actually the soundtrack. This is unusual, and I'm not sure I could say that of any other movie, but the atmospheric, other-worldly sounds at critical moments simply make the difference between those scenes being the low-budget exploits of girls exploring a rock outcropping and the kind of stuff that sends chills down your spine no matter how many horror movies you've seen.This is definitely a high-brow horror movie to remember.

Peter Weir was surprised at the decision of choosing him as director. At that time,he has not been not even in the frontline directors of Australia.Once this film got critical acclaim ,Peter Weir did not have to look back and made a name among the most respected filmmakers of all time(Dead Poet's society,Truman Show).
Picnic at Hanging Rock is an example of brilliant filmmaking .Peter Weir with a relatively lesser known cast achieved miracle with his vision. He made the Lindsay novel come to screen with acute precison.The mystery of Hanging Rock still attracts tourists worldwide.
The film adheres more to the mystery the tranquillity of Hanging rock rather than the police investigations and the other things related.The film doesn't even focus on how it happens or why it happens .The film takes the Hanging Rock itself as a character.It is beautiful,calm,mysterious and also seems probably harbouring secrets for centuries.The atmosphere and the setup is the ace for the film's unprecedented success,the film is vividly poetic and the characters(mostly female leads) are the metaphors of purities lost in buried sexual hysteria(thanks Roger Ebert).The character of Mrs Appleyard reflects the society and their treatment towards the women(totally personal opinion) and how rationality is condemned that time ,creativity is nothing but a sin.One of the characters is referred as Boticelli's Angel i.e delicate,small built with prominent features ,youthful .The students of Appleyard school has been objectified from various paintings and the authorities are there to preserve their beauties ,their youth rather than instigating rational thinking.The cast has done a commendable job especially Rachel Roberts as Mr Appleyard .The film is a tranquil disturbance,a haunting calmness and a classic.",Picnic at Hanging Rock

The perceptions begin to experience relevant changes. Everything feels differently: comments and opinions do not seem to come from any teenager girl, but from an ancient wisdom knowledge related with spiritualism and non-dualism. For instance:-Marion:""A surprising number of human beings are without purpose, though it is probable that they are performing some function unknown to themselves"".-Miranda: ""What we see and what we seem are but a dream, a dream within a dream"".-Miranda: ""Everything begins and ends at the exactly right time and place"".They seem to have entered into a dreamland dimension, suspended in time. An ethereal energy which makes all acts are led by a high level of awareness and absolute sense of freedom.However, according to Sara, Miranda predicted her own fate: she would not return. So she could have had a prior intuition about her predestination. Her ethereal mood, mystery and beauty are perfectly portrayed by Anne-Louise Lambert.We have a story in which fate and power of nature are intertwined.

He is not in the mood to render a judgement on something, rather he is not even asking us to give one. This depiction of his is solely for asking and raising questions. The most prominent comment for this film which tries to teach is ""We,humans are not the only species who live on this Earth."" All species want to maintain relation with Nature, but who and how keeps it good, matters a lot."" The tragedy lies in the film where the director constantly urges viewers to think, ask and visualize what would be the cause behind all the acts? But he simultaneously tries to make ourselves believe that all is the fate of Nature. And thereby, the story keeps on grooving around the characters as a sinister's mystery in their minds. The one message, one tries to take out might be-""One mustn't try to know all the answers, but one must try to find answers by knowing all the questions"".

Based on the novel by author Joan Lindsay, the story follows a group of girls from Appleyard College - a girls' private school, who go on well, a picnic. Four of the girls decide to break away from the picnic and explore Hanging Rock.What ensues in a progressive mystery that grips the viewer with an uneasy sense of foreboding. The Hitchcockian tension is stretched like an elastic band until you feel like you want to scream at the girls and tell them to turn back. One of the girls, in fact, does just that - but her screams are ignored.Three of the girls ascend into Hanging Rock in glorious slow motion, while the fourth girl screams out in terror as if bombarded with some unseen force. What makes Picnic at Hanging Rock so unnerving is it's ambiguity and Peter Weir does a great job at stretching that figurative piece of elastic.One of the three girls, Miranda St Clare (the beautiful Anne-Louise Lambert) plants herself in the viewer's imagination. She is carefree, daring and dangerous - and completely unfazed by the uncharted territory of Hanging Rock.No definitive explanation is given to the girls' disappearance. There are two male characters thrown into the mix and there is a mild suggestion that they had something to do with the disappearance.Keep a look out for a young John Jarratt (of the Wolf Creek series). When the other boys says that he wants to go back and look at the girls - which could be misconstrued as an admission that they had murdered the trio.And yet, the story is completely open to interpretation. Hanging Rock is presented as the big bad and as something that can snatch people. Perhaps even draw them in like a magnet to metal. The boys perhaps stumbled across the girls' bodies.

Fortunately, it didn't disappoint. The plot: a bunch of college girls in 1900 go on a picnic, and four go missing. Though the pace is the very definition of slow, this bare string of a plot held my interest for 107 minutes, because narrative is not the point at all here - mood is. Director Peter Weir deploys sound design that would do David Lynch proud, and a surprising assurance for a novice. He exploits the mystery of nature to create some downright creepy moments (the same way the directors of The Blair Witch Project would 24 years later).Stay away from this one if you have no attention span, or if you need a movie to provide you with closure. Or if you're one of those retards who complained that there was no witch in The Blair Witch Project.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
101,DaRick89,An intriguing exercise in building and diffusing tension,8,22 November 2016,"Picnic at Hanging Rock is a curious movie in my ways. The pacing is fairly slow, progressively building up to key moments within the film, while the relatively simple plot is essentially just a mystery with a few twists. However, where the movie excels is in building and diffusing tension. For example, up until the girls disappear into the rock, there are a few hints that something bad, or unusual, will happen. Firstly, there are Miranda's cryptic comments to Sara about needing to find somebody else to love, Miranda's almost ashamed look downwards when Sara waves to her (as if she knows that she'll not be returning), the birds and the horses being startled when Miranda opens the gate and time seeming to stop at the rock. That, plus the eerie atmosphere and music, builds the tension quite nicely. The same thing happens later in the film, when Sara's reaction to Miranda's disappearance, Mrs Appleyard's increasingly abusive behaviour towards her and revelations about her troubled past let you know something unpleasant is about to happen. The film also diffuses tension quite nicely. You can almost FEEL the tension among the students, teachers, townspeople and police after the disappearance of the girls and the pervading atmosphere of suspicion and mistrust makes the film more compelling. As the film progresses, tension affects these people in increasingly unpleasant ways. Moreover, while the film only has a few key moments, these moments are exploited quite effectively to the point where they are indelibly etched upon my mind. Edith's blood-curdling scream when the girls disappear into the rock and Mrs Appleyard being in full mourning dress, with an accompanying death stare, after Sara kills herself.The dialogue is both novel and quaint, as one would expect from a period piece set in 1900. The characterisation is mixed. The girls are mostly fairly flat characters whom exist more to serve the plot than anything else. The mystique around Miranda and her cryptic comments and behaviour somewhat obscure the fact that we learn next to nothing about her and find it difficult to relate to her or the other girls individually. However, Sara and Albert are fairly well-developed characters whom are easy to sympathise with in light of their struggles. The contrast and interplay between Michael, the high-brow Englishman and the ocker Albert also adds colour to the film. The cinematography is superb, with some evocative landscapes, some creative shooting angles (we never know what lures the girls into the rock, adding to the mystery) and some novel shooting techniques (placing bridal veil fabric over the lens to make the picnic's atmosphere seem more intoxicating). The film also looks very crisp and the costuming is well done.The actors and actresses effectively serve the plot by performing their fairly limited roles quite well. The late Rachel Roberts in particular does very well portraying an otherwise tightly-coiled, disciplined woman who slowly cracks under pressure. John Jarratt also does a good job playing the every-man ocker. Weaver, Morse and McDonald are other reasonably well-known names. Ultimately, Picnic at Hanging Rock is an intriguing film. I'm not sure I would call it a classic - at times the film's slow pacing does frustrate and the characterisation and plot are on the whole fairly thin. However, it masterfully uses tension to keep the interest and filming techniques to keep viewers watching. The actors and actress involved appear to understand the film's intent quite well and perform accordingly. On the whole, a comfortably above-average outing.4/5 stars",Picnic at Hanging Rock

103,chandanshivaramu,Haunting Portrait of Characters against a Surreal atmosphere...!,10,19 June 2012,"I love this movie because it stays in your memory and makes you linger around it for a while. I got totally intoxicated by its haunting locales, characters, story and above all the music.. Its just something too surreal. The lead actress is utterly gorgeous and stunning to watch. This movie starts with a slow pace and but slowly unravels itself into a suspenseful journey ending in a confusing and sad climax.. you actually feel that ..you could have done something to rescue those poor girls..sigh..!! The director is synonymous with his meticulous details, slow pacing ending with a roller coaster climax and haunting music(recall Harrison Ford's Witness). I couldn't make head or tail understanding the climax of the movie.. but just felt satisfied watching a journey where in mysterious events befall..Its just one of a kind.. I hope you enjoy it..!!",Picnic at Hanging Rock
104,binaryg,The Most Hauntingly Beautiful Film I've Ever Seen,10,25 January 2005,I fell in love with Picnic at Hanging Rock back in the Seventies. I watched it many times. I just rented the Criterion Collection DVD. It still holds up so well. Watching it is like viewing a beautiful painting except that it moves. The cinematography rivals Barry Lyndon and Days of Heaven but with the addition of ethereal nature of the story makes those two films seem harsh. Weir made wonderful choices with the music and the actors. Miranda IS a Botticelli Angel. Please don't try to create an explanation for what happened. It even makes no difference whether it ever actually happened. Having this and The Last Wave to his credit guaranteed Peter Weir's a reputation as a great artist and as a great director. His film The Plumber also from the Seventies is great too.,Picnic at Hanging Rock
105,madcardinal,"What If the Earth Itself Really Is Alive? Should We, Can We Subdue the Earth Within Us?",9,18 April 2011,"I read the novel before watching the movie, and both are excellent, with the book being slightly superior to the film because it can weave in the innuendo, nuance, and Freudian symbolism more effectively than the film. The movie is quite faithful to the book, although the film gives comparatively more attention to the Sara Waybourne character and less attention to Irma Leopold.I highly recommend considering the rock a character - perhaps the most important character - in this film; I ask you to consider that the rock is not a static, dumb object as we would interpret it from our modern, materialistic viewpoint. Rather, by accepting a more aboriginal, animist interpretation of the rock as a living being, the viewer gets in tune with a different understanding of the underlying reality of things which should make it easier to comprehend and appreciate this film. In connection, it also may be helpful to remember Australia is a continent which was stolen away from the native inhabitants by Europeans, who fancied their culture more advanced, civilized and reality-based than the aboriginal culture; this European conquest has lasted for a tiny blip of a second when compared to how long the natives have lived there. Also, one of the cultural hallmarks of Christian Europe was the (at least partial) sublimation of sexuality in order to fuel presumably higher goals, for example, art such as this movie.On one level, ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" is about the suffocating sexual repression of the Victorian age. The older students at this girls boarding school are just entering into that golden period of 16 to 24 years old, that fleeting period when humans are at their most vigorous, fertile, robust, sensual and beautiful. This makes the repression all the more crucial. There are clues sprinkled into the movie to help the viewer make up their own mind as to what happens, but you have to pay careful attention: this is not a Hollywood style movie where you're hit over the head with plot developments or character motivations in high relief, nor is every question that arises clearly answered in a reassuring, formulaic way. If you like easy answers, forget this movie and watch a Hollywood flick.Most of the cast is solidly good. Dominic Guard as Michael Fitzhubert and Anne Lambert as Miranda are perfect choices for their facial features, physical build, and mannerisms. I would have cast the character of Irma Leopold differently. In the book, she is described repeatedly as stunningly beautiful, and although the actress who plays her in the movie is quite attractive, she is not stunningly beautiful.One of the girls quotes Poe: ""All that we see or seem is but a dream within a dream."" Another girl gushes, ""The rock has been waiting thousands of years, just for us!"" Ultimately this film is relevant to everyone alive on planet earth, because on this second level, ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" is about that biggest mystery of all - being and nothingness.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
106,Robert_Woodward,An enthralling allegorical tragedy,10,24 August 2008,"The story at the heart of Picnic at Hanging Rock is outlined at the film's very beginning: an introductory text describes the mysterious disappearance of three schoolgirls and their teacher in the Australian outback. Yet for all that we know about what will happen, this is an utterly enthralling film, combining a moving, mysterious human drama with rich and haunting symbolism.The 1900 period setting is impeccable. The grandiose school for girls rises out of the vast Australian wilderness, a tiny outpost of Empire in a strange land. The costumes, from Victorian schoolgirl outfits to white imperial soldier uniforms, are brilliantly realised. Very soon we see that the schoolgirls are stifled. Some of them strain against the confines of their cosseted environment and the strict Victorian values imposed by Mrs Appleyard, the headmistress of the school. It becomes apparent that beautiful Mirandah and the orphaned Sarah have fallen in love, but Mrs Appleyard intervenes: when the girls set out for the 'Hanging Rock' for an end-of-term picnic she sees to it that Sarah is kept behind whilst Mirandah and the others set out.It is at the Hanging Rock that we see just how alien the Australian landscape is to the Victorian ideals of colonial society  and vice versa. When Mirandah and three other girls separate from the main party to view the Hanging Rock up close they venture into an otherworldly place, where strange animals and bizarre rock formations abound. The rhapsody of the young women in the unfamiliar landscape is cleverly conveyed through the blurring between images of human faces and the great expanses of the landscape. As the girls ascend and disappear from view into the upper reaches of the rock it is hard not to feel a glimmer of their atavistic impulses.The disappearance of the schoolgirls and the school governess are witnessed only by Edith, another schoolgirl, and we can but wonder how accurate her subsequent account is. The disappearance is ultimately a mystery: this is not a film to provide a neat ending or anything much in the way of answers to our questions. What makes the film so captivating is the combination of a moving human tragedy with powerful symbolism.The school and the adjoining town can be viewed are an encapsulation of colonial society with its Victorian ideals. Despite the strictures of the school headmistress, the new generation are already drifting away from a society that has been newly imposed upon an ancient landscape. The Hanging Rock, an enormous rocky outcrop of volcanic origin, has stood for a million years and is described as a 'recent' geological feature. Inscrutable and uncaring, the rock embodies the timeless nature of the foreign landscape. For the transplanted society, time is running out: it is an anachronism in this land. It is no wonder that all the watches stop at 12 o'clock when the party reaches the rock.In parallel to the vast, uncaring entity in the natural landscape is the imperial society itself. With its Victorian ideals and its ruthless enforcers such as Mrs Appleyard, this society rides roughshod over the happiness of its inhabitants. Mirandah's and Sarah's is a doomed love from the beginning of the film, but there is a further tragedy in Sarah's life: as a young orphan she was separated from her brother and whisked away to the school. Minnie, a servant to Mrs Appleyard, quite rightly remarks with pity of the poor girls at the school.A few points of light are set against this dark tone. Michael and Albert, a young aristocrat and a young servant, present at the rock at the time of the disappearances, become furtive friends despite their very different class backgrounds. And, though in many ways a tragedy, the mysterious disappearance of the girls has a certain beauty to it. The three ascend out of oppressive surroundings into a new and unfamiliar place. Their action heralds the beginning of the end for a world that tried to smother them.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
107,pocca,Death and the Maidens,8,8 May 2005,"Even though this has been described as a film about sexual repression (and Peter Weir may have thought he was making such a film), I don't think it is--rather, it is a celebration of the dreamy, self contained sexuality (or rather pre-sexuality) of young adolescent girls just before they seriously turn their attention to men. Sure, they may be living in a society straitjacketed by Victorian mores, but the girls really don't seem to be the unhappier for this, non withstanding the earthy maid's comments that she feels sorry for them. Miranda and her friends seem completely content and at ease in their languid, hothousey world of poetry, pink and white bedrooms, and mutual crushes (I was reminded of the similarly dreamy, self contained little universe of the sisters in ""The Virgin Suicides--another film that is supposedly about repression). During the noon day nap at Hanging Rock, the girls, heads resting in one another's laps, are in a state very much resembling post coital bliss--far from seeming repressed, they are among the most content women I've ever seen on screen. It is quite arguable that Victorian morality had something to do with their sexuality turning inward like this, but all this does is lend credence to the truism that repression intensifies sexuality--which may explain the lingering fascination the Victorian era has for the modern age, and why one of its most striking symbols of its oppressiveness--the corset--is also very erotically charged. The girls' disappearance into the eerie black land form (that seems to have faces at times, bringing to mind fairy tales about trolls who steal golden haired children) suggests that at in their present state they are so contented that anything else life might hold for them could only be a letdown, that only whatever dark force (death? nothingness?) is haunting Hanging Rock could possibly be a worthy enough lover for these girls who are already so supremely self fulfilled. There are, unfortunately, aspects of this film that don't work, or rather jar with the elements discussed above, the most prominent of these being the Dickensian subplot of the persecuted orphaned pupil Sarah. The actress herself is affecting in her part and her boyish beauty contrasts well with Miranda's ethereal femininity (she looks like a young Renaissance prince at times), but her story really belongs in another movie because at heart ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" is more Gothic than socially conscious.Maybe Weir really was aiming to make a movie about the evils of sexual repression, class inequality or even colonization, but such possible themes are blown away by the languid, ethereal images of the young adolescent girls at the beginning of the film, floating contentedly through their hours like clusters of Monet lilies.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
108,campbell-russell-a,Disappearing into time and space.,10,11 June 2012,"On release, many people missed the point of this film and tried to work out ""who done it?"". I suppose it was because most people had not read the novel nor knew much about its author, Joan Lindsay. Joan herself was a person who seemed to belong to a bygone age and one whose writings displayed an intense interest in time as recorded by nature rather than by humans and their mechanical and therefore artificial time keeping methods. Notice how all the watches have stopped at twelve o'clock before the girls climb the rock. In the novel, the girls on the rock hear the noises of those who will search for them the next day prior to climbing higher. Time has been warped.The film is littered with clues as to how the girls have disappeared. Scratches on Irma's legs but her bare feet have no signs of wear - not walking across rock but through time. Miranda's awareness of her impending disappearance and pronouncement that ""Everything begins and ends at exactly the right time and place"" prior to disappearing.The film is itself is remarkable because it captured a drifting, lost ambiance that makes those who let it work its magic experience a sense of timelessness until we wake and return to our literal and pedestrian world.",Picnic at Hanging Rock

110,bazzer-57663,Still fabulous,10,29 December 2019,"I just watched this again (the original 1975 cinema release) after a few years and it's as beautiful as ever.This movie defies conventional analysis. The plot is non-existent, the acting is so-so, the script sparse and the cinematography dated. The only factor in which it excels by any normal standard is the wonderful score. If you insist on movies with a resolution, look elsewhere.None of which matters in the slightest. Picnic at Hanging Rock is an impression, a tone poem, to be taken in its entirety or not at all. And the most important actor is the rock itself: it displays so many facets (and indeed faces, literally) that we could discuss what it all means for days, without reaching any conclusions.On the most obvious level it represents the primeval power of the Australian bush and highlights the incongruity of the attempt to parachute genteel Victorian England into such a savage landscape.On St. Valentine's Day, as the romance-inspired schoolgirls wind higher up and deeper into the Rock's towering buttresses and pinnacles, it seems to represent the power of masculinity, not only drawing in and embracing the girls but even seducing their uptight teacher into stripping off her skirt and climbing (disappearing) in just her drawers.And, as faces in the stone glower, the Rock seems to represent the end, the path to the ultimate consummation and blissful peace. This is pointed to early on when Miranda predicts her own fate, and as she climbs to her doom (whatever that might be) she is untroubled by fear or apprehension, and disappears with a knowing smile.This contrasts starkly with the earthly tribulations back at Appleyard College and as Miranda passes on (through? up?) to her destiny, her devoted lover Sara, unable to escape the cruelty of the humdrum world, throws herself to her death from the walls of Appleyard.Wow. As I said, we could chew the fat over this for days. But none of it really matters: what is crucial about Picnic at Hanging Rock is not that you analyse it but that you just let it be as it envelops you in its mystery and haunts corner of your soul forever.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
111,benturkalj,A beautiful film that defies categorizing,10,13 December 2005,"As far as Aussie flicks go, you would be hard pressed to go past Peter Weir's brilliant Picnic at hanging rock.The premise is simple: We are led to believe that four girls in the early nineteen hundreds, after going for a trek through hanging rock, have simply disappeared. It is only in the first thirty minutes that that the 'horror' part of the movie is established, with the majority of the film focusing on the mystery of the girls disappearance.As an achievement, 'Picnic' has so much going for it. Weir manages to create something truly eery through what is never seen. Interwoven in the main 'horror' plot is some magnificent drama, mystery elements, and a fantastic look at how Australian culture was in those days. And the brilliant score, mainly using piano and wind pipes, perfectly complements the story, which can be frightening, incredibly touching, and funny. Possibly the finest film to come out of Australia, and still Weir's best.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
112,Dr.Mike,Repressed Sexuality Escapes,8,10 March 1999,"Around the turn of the century, it was not uncommon for young women to be educated at boarding schools like the one on Picnic at Hanging Rock. Isolated from males and socialized into being fine young ladies, an incredible amount of repressed feelings must have built up among them.  The film examines these feelings and the power they hold.The film never resolves anything, which is wonderful.  What has happened to the girls?  Well, it doesn't really matter because they are freed of the shackles of the school.  The girl who is not allowed on the outing shows what might have happened to the lost women if they had not escaped.  Even some of the school elders want to return to the craggy natural setting of the Rock.  The large effort exerted by the town to retrieve the girls exposes the danger that female liberation posed at the time.  It is a sad and truthful commentary that the only way for the women to escape is to climb the mountain and be lost forever.",Picnic at Hanging Rock

I've been wanting to watch Picnic at Hanging Rock for years... bought the blu ray recently & thought it was time... after finally watching it, I'm quite shell shocked at what I've just witnessed... the mood throughout this film is on a spiritual level, hypnotic at times, tension building below... the soundtrack & sound design compliment the film & create this mysticism surrounding the missing characters... the narrative is quite minimal, focusing on the mood of the film rather than what's being said... but quite often what is being said is cryptic & only leaves you with more questions... after doing further reading, it is stated that even the novelist Joan Lindsay never confirmed if the story was based on fact or not... but many people including the producer of the film have gone to Hanging Rock & felt this unease... like they are being watched... this aspect to me is fascinating and makes this film such an achievement from the young director at the time... also worth mentioning that gorgeous the actress who played Sara, Margaret Nelson has been missing for sometime... plus the lead bitch of the school Mrs. Appleyard played by Rachel Roberts committed suicide in 1980... the more you dig with this film / novel and Hanging Rock the location, more is left unanswered... it's most definitely one of the greatest Australian films & cant wait to see it again & give it 10/10, along with 2nd viewing of The Last Wave... until then ill be hunting down Mark Hartley's 2004 doco ""A Dream Within a Dream: The making of 'Picnic at Hanging Rock"" & continue my research on the film, the location, it's characters & the novelist...",Picnic at Hanging Rock
115,Mikelito,If you want to speculate on the meaning - go ahead - make your day,5,23 December 2007,"This film started nicely enough with soft-focus Hamilton-ish girl-exploitation footage, school-girls waking up to a sunny day, combing their hair and so forth. In fact I firmly expected them to go skinny dipping at some point. There is pan flute music by Gheorghe Zamfir (very hip at the time) and flying budgies inter-cut with many nice looking pictures of the Australian wilderness. There is almost a Nicholas Roeg feel in the way some scenes are juxtaposed in that ""Roegesque"" cutting technique  but his ""Walkabout"" 4 years before on a similar subject is much better.People wonder about the meaning of this picnic movie  come on, it's sort of a mystery but it's really not worth exploring. It's for people believing in ""meanings"" of everything that happens. People who believe in the accuracy of the contents of fortune cookies. People who have lots of time.Basically this seems to be about Europeans lost in an Exotic environment. If you don't agree just go and invest your time into exploring alternative meanings. That is still much better than playing ego-shooter games 20 hours a day and finally acquiring guns over the Intenet.Peter Weir/dyet I love the look of these 70s movies, very un-spoilt, almost artistic. No CGI and no 1.300 edits a minute. Very organic.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
116,Filmtribute,A beautifully enchanting and haunting film,10,7 September 2001,"Although the images have stayed with me since I first saw Picnic at Hanging Rock some 20 years ago, the power to instil a strange sense of loss remains. The revised director's version released in 1998 unusually cuts seven minutes from the original as, according to Pat Lovell (executive producer), Peter Weir wanted to remove any pretty romances and speed up the final act. The sound quality has been enhanced and the look improved through colour regrading, but sadly a couple of key scenes involving Irma (Karen Robson) have been omitted.  We are told at the outset that some of those who start out for the St Valentine's Day picnic in 1900 are never to return, and, even though various clues are shared with us, no attempt is made to solve the puzzle.  Miranda (Anne Louise Lambert), who provides a voice over, based on a poem by Edgar Allan Poe, sets the tone at the beginning with, `What we see and what we seem are but a dream, a dream within a dream', and the film goes on to concern itself with the aftermath of the disappearance and the impact on all involved with those missing.  It explores an apparently idyllic way of life that is not what it first seems, how this false paradise is fragile and how it is shattered by the breakdown of established order.  Tensions and hysteria all surface, exposing the suppressed passions that are the reality of life, as well as the claustrophobic atmosphere of the affluent Victorian European life style in an alien land.  This theme is further expressed by the virginal white dresses worn for the picnic, which seem out of place in this environment and represent the stifling restrictions placed on the young women.  The layers of dress and petticoats the girls have to wear, combined with the various shots into mirrors, as if into another dimension, also reflect the story's many strands. Russell Boyd's award winning cinematography is stunning and actively encourages you to feel the summer heat.  The beauty of the actresses and the sounds of the Australian bush, under the sinisterly foreboding gaze of the Rock, with its blatant phallic symbolism, seduce you so that you will more feel a sense of the horror, as Edith (Christine Schuler) does.  The flashback at the end, poignantly coupled with the adagio from Beethoven's piano concerto No. 5 (Emperor), leaves you with a sense of loss of youth and virtue.  Peter Weir subsequently recreated this impression in the final scene of his equally outstanding Australian feature `Gallipoli'.  I am also reminded of the effect produced by Jane Campion (The Piano) in her early work `Two Friends', where the tale ends in the past when the friendship is at its closest, making the passing of innocence feel more painful with ageing and the passage of time. Cliff Green's script is not only faithful to Joan Lindsay's narrative but also complements it exceedingly well, although dialogue is often replaced by visual impression and unnecessary details are excluded to maintain the sense of mystery the author intended.  However, the novel's literary mistake regarding Felicia Hemanes' famous Victorian recital piece is repeated, which is actually `Casabianca' (about the Battle of the Nile) and not `The Wreck of the Hesperus' by Henry Longfellow.  Discrimination is displayed by Mrs Appleyard (Rachel Robert's fantastically monstrous harridan) towards Sara (Margaret Nelson), a forlorn orphan in love with Miranda, who is kept back from the picnic for not learning the poem, whereas Irma's position as heiress obviously carries influence, as clearly on the Rock she can only quote the first line.  Sara is shown pity by the housemaid, Minnie (Jacki Weaver), whose own sexuality is realised with the handyman, Tom (Tony Llewellyn-Jones), in stark contrast to the general ambience of repressed desire.Miranda's sentiment that  `Everything begins and ends at exactly the right time and place' is demonstrated by Joan Lindsay who based her fictional account on Hanging Rock, a sacred Aboriginal site, near Mount Macedon in Victoria.  To provide added authenticity Peter Weir filmed at the Rock during the same six weeks of summer.  Aborigines believe time is not linear and Lady Lindsay eschewed the notion of man-made time, hence the title of her autobiography `Time Without Clocks'.  At Hanging Rock both the watches of Ben Hussey (Martin Vaughan) and Greta McCraw (Vivean Gray) stopped at twelve o'clock.  Incidentally 14 February 1900 actually fell on a Wednesday, not a Saturday, unless the author used the Julian calendar instead of the Gregorian, so that the eleven days were not lost?The open-ended nature of the fable is deliberate to mirror life where we may learn or uncover some secrets but never understand the mystery.  Plenty of extraneous facts and unexplained details are related, such as the absence of scratches to Irma's bare feet, yet identical injuries appear on her head and Michael's (Dominic Guard), her joint rescuer with Albert (John Jarrett), very redolent of the `X Files'. The film is beautifully shot with haunting music, exceptionally well cast and acted, and tightly directed.  The ever excellent Helen Morse is an inspired choice as Mademoiselle Dianne de Poitiers, the French mistress and the girls' confidante, who describes Miranda as a Botticelli angel from the Galleria degli Uffizi in Florence, and Peter Weir specifically uses the image of the Birth of Venus.  In fact Miranda, Irma and Marion (Jane Vallis), the three senior boarders who vanish, are evocative of the Three Graces, who dance in attendance to Venus, in Sandro Botticelli's Primavera. Anne Louise Lambert's portrayal of Miranda (an ironic reincarnation from her famed role in 1973 as the bed-hopping nymphomaniac in the Australian soap `Number 96') captures the vision perfectly with her ethereal loveliness and enigmatic smile, and is reminiscent of the knowing look on the death mask of the renowned `L'Inconnue de la Seine', who coincidentally died around 1900 in Paris.Picnic at Hanging Rock is a masterpiece of its time, and still rates as one of my favourite films today.",Picnic at Hanging Rock

To provide added authenticity Weir filmed during the same six weeks of summer at the actual Rock where both the watches of Ben Hussey (Martin Vaughan) and Greta McCraw (Vivean Gray) stopped at twelve o'clock. Unsportingly, the English change from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar in 1752 with the loss of 11 days, doesn't offer an explanation for the alteration of 14 February 1900 from a Wednesday to a Saturday after correcting for the additional 29 February in 1800.  However, rather than playing with time Lindsay confessed to having no care for the preciseness of dates, whilst the open-ended nature of the fable is a deliberate mirror of life where we may learn or uncover some secrets but never understand the mystery.  Plenty of extraneous facts and unexplained details are related, such as the absence of scratches to Irma's bare feet, yet identical injuries appear on her head and Michael's (Dominic Guard), her joint rescuer with Albert (John Jarrett), all very redolent of the `X Files'. 
The sympathetic direction draws out perfect performances from the exceptional cast in tune with the beautiful photography and the coetaneous haunting music of Bruce Smeaton and Gheorge Zamfir.  The ever-excellent Helen Morse is an inspired choice as Mademoiselle Dianne de Poitiers, the French mistress and the girls' confidante, who describes Miranda as a Botticelli angel from the Galleria degli Uffizi in Florence, and Weir specifically uses the image of the Birth of Venus.  In fact the three senior boarders who vanish; Miranda, Irma and Marion (Jane Vallis, who lamentably died from cancer in 1992), are evocative of the Three Graces who dance in attendance to Venus, in Sandro Botticelli's `La Primavera'.  Lambert's portrayal of Miranda (an ironic reincarnation from her famed role in 1973 as the bed-hopping nymphomaniac in the Australian soap `Number 96') captures the vision perfectly with her ethereal loveliness and enigmatic smile, and is reminiscent of the knowing look on the death mask of the renowned `L'Inconnue de la Seine', who coincidentally died around 1900 in Paris.Picnic at Hanging Rock's eerie power is such that the strange sense of loss it induces remains some 22 years after my initial viewing, proving itself a masterpiece of any time.",Picnic at Hanging Rock

119,tommythek,This picnic tastes great but is unfulfilling.,7,26 July 2001,"Confession: I don't know WHAT I think of this movie! Not only that, I had to go to IMDb's user comments to find a person or persons to TELL ME what I think of this movie. None did. I read all 45 of the user comments (reviews) and I STILL don't know what I think of this movie. That's how enigmatic this movie is. To me, anyway.I did learn one thing, however, from reading these 45 preceding user reviews. A very great many of these user-reviewers are some of the keenest and most astute moviegoers whom I've ever encountered. They know things about this movie and have picked up things from it which are completely over my non-perceptive head.Example: One user-reviewer, an English gentleman, I believe, obviously did his doctoral thesis on this movie. He knows things about it that even Peter Weir (the director) doesn't know. A number of others did their masters on it. Many of the latter refer to Miranda (Anne-Louise Lambert), one of the girls who disappeared, in terms of her being a sort of virginal Botticelli-like angel. While I do agree that Miranda is a most ethereal character, whenever she would appear in a scene, ""Botticelli"" was not the first word to jump into my mind. But that's just me.Much is made by many of these perceptive and sharp user-reviewers of the girls' awakening feelings of sexuality and of the phallic symbolism of Hanging Rock to the girl climbers. Oh. I was just wondering: Where'd the girls go? What happened to them?One of the many puzzling aspects to the story of this movie, one on which no one seems to agree, is.....is it true? At first I thought it was. Then I thought it wasn't. Now, I have no idea! And the user-reviewers are of no help on this, politely at odds amongst themselves on the story's veracity. I'd like to believe that the movie and novel which preceded it are based on a true incident. No, not because I would wish anything bad to have happened to these adventurous, yet innocent, young girls some 101 years ago. I wish it were true only because it would be but one more ""event"" to add to the great mystery that we know as life. A mystery, a question, to which no one has the answer.Listen to me! I sound like I know what I'm talking about. Which I don't! Especially about this movie. In the final analysis, this movie left me generally unfulfilled. There is much in it that is worthy of praise, first and foremost the moviemaking skills of Peter Weir. But when credits rolled, something was missing. I felt as if I'd just eaten a delicious Thanksgiving dinner, having enjoyed every single bite, then, upon arising from the table, felt my stomach completely empty. A feeling stranger than strange.Anyone viewing this film for the first time must be prepared for a movie in which all the various and loose plot ends do NOT get all tied up by the film's denouement. If one is so prepared, one may come away from it more fulfilled than was I. ""Tastes great,"" unfortunately, was as far as I could get with it.One sad note: At the movie's conclusion, Mrs. Appleyard (Rachel Roberts) arrived at a fate not much unlike one arrived at by Ms. Roberts herself just five short years after the movie's release. Just as art often imitates life, so, too, in this case, did life imitate art.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
120,Oriel,"Haunting, creepy, and richly rewarding",10,16 July 1999,"While eagerly awaiting the release of Blair Witch Project, I finally got around to watching this movie, and Picnic is emphatically the more effective of the two.  Although many will object that the two films are too different to compare, I think such a comparison is valid: both rely for their effectiveness on atmosphere over visible, clearly defined spooks; on suspense over special effects or even plot resolution.  However, the worlds of the two films are unarguably different.  I found the golden, dreamy, visually mesmerizing Australian countryside of Picnic one of the film's most outstanding features.  This lyrical, almost sleepy period setting, thronging with long-haired damsels in white lawn dresses, lulls the viewer into a spellbound state, aided by the otherworldly pan flute music.The film unwinds slowly and deliberately, which may account for the occasional hostile reviews; certainly, if you want fast-paced thrills, or are in an impatient or hurried mood, Picnic will be wasted on you.  But if you allow yourself, you'll be hypnotized by the gentle increase of tension and mystery, even as you are unable to identify their source.  Before long the suspense will become almost unbearable as you come closer and closer to the horror lurking beneath the sun-drenched surface.But the source of the horror?  That's left largely to you.  While I was initially disappointed that the film offered so little explanation for the pivotal disappearance of the young women, on reflection I realize that any explanation would only reduce the film's eeriness.  Part of the power of this film is its ability to leave you wondering, guessing, and still trying to put your finger on the reason it's so disturbing.  It may begin like A Room With a View, but ultimately it's an exquisitely rendered horror film.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
121,SrCAPnCDLvl99,The scariest picnic ever!,10,23 January 2004,"It'd been quite some time since I last saw Picnic At Hanging Rock, but as soon as I heard that haunting Pan flute it all came back to me and I felt the goosebumps covering my skin once again. This film still has that level of quality to it, and I still consider it one of my absolute favorite films of all time.As soon as you push that tempting Play button on your remote control as you're watching the Criterion Collection release of this film, you're thrown into a dream that starts as a fantasy but quickly turns into a nightmare as those girls disappear at hanging rock. You know that they're going to and there's nothing you can do to stop it... I have discovered that most people speak of this film as drama, or maybe something in the line of an art film, which is funny to me as I've always seen it as a horror film. I mean, this film is really scary. Those girls disappeared and noone ever knew what happened to them. I remember thinking of this film as I saw The Blair Witch Project back in 99. Those kids also disappeared in the middle of the woods, only; in that film, you saw what happened to them, something that remains a mystery in this. That's what makes it so great. It has to be told though, that the film does lose it's pace a bit towards the end as all the scenes are centered around the Appleyard school and leaving out on the mysterious Rock, but that is when the Pan flute is reintroduced, which keeps you in the meditative state you've been lulled into during the course of the film. There's so many scenes that you'll end up thinking about for hours to figure out what they really meant, only to come out empty handed, or possibly with a headache as a result. For instance: I've never understood the importance of the brother & sister link between the kids form the orphanage. If a film touches you in the way that this film does, you can't help but giving it the highest of praise and the 10/10 rating that it truly deserves. This is Peter Weir's one, and unfortunately only, true masterpiece as of yet; a film you must see before you leave the face of the earth and vanish into that dark shadowy place beyond;  running into your very own Hanging Rock.",Picnic at Hanging Rock

This film has an interesting premise, but fails to live up to it.  Don't misunderstand, I love movies where the answer isn't always clear.  I just don't see why Picnic at Hanging Rock is placed in this category. To me, it comes off as a pretentious and empty exercise in humanity. There's beautiful music, lovely scenery, and dreamy girls (and boys) who seem to be living in a bubble about to burst.  None of the main characters seem real, perhaps because the movie deliberately compares them to artworks.

123,chatbada,Valentine's betrayal...,10,14 February 2021,"This is probably one of the most mysterious movies I have ever seen. Not only regarding the plot, but also the meaning of the movie.
One thing that is interesting, is that you can imagine whatever you want about the plot, it won't affect the sense of the film, it's meaning. And this is really important. One thing that could help you though, in order to understand the movie, is to remember that Peter Weir is also the director of Dead Poets Society.
There is a strong connexion between those two movies. I don't want to explain Picnic at Hanging Rock, so I won't go further about this point. But Picnic is not only a thriller, it has a more deep subtext. And that's why it's a great movie, and not only a good entertainment.
If you haven't watched it yet, let me give you also the other reasons why I still consider it as my favorite movie for such a long time : the cinematography, the pictures, the costumes, and the soundtrack are amazing.

125,MissRosa,the unspeakable takes control,9,28 May 2000,"This is mesmerizing film with a cipher at its center. Less is more. I am amused at some of the comments. There seem to be two types: those which depict the movie as ""beautiful, ethereal and subtle"" and those which depict the film as ""too symbolic, too slow, boring, too 70's.""The point is, there is no point. The central vision of the film is enigma, the void, mystery. This seems to make a lot of explainers uncomfortable, but the use of emptiness at the core of a work of art is nothing new. ""The hand that erases writes the true thing"" Faulkner's masterpiece ""The Sound and the Fury"" is about a character who is absent. The characters that surround her, and who actually people the novel? Not all there, lacking, disintegrating, unknown, unwanted, unloved.If there must be a meaning, it is that nothingness is the biggest threat of all. ""I will show you fear in a handful of dust"" We fear our disappearance. We'd like to believe that our little lives, our little comments, our little film lists will endure forever. But they won't. Nothing will.what is existence? a random ever-changing collection of energized particles.At any point, we can cross the line into nothingness. Nature will subsume us.The film ""A Passage to India"" had the same theme. It was NOT essentially a movie about rape or sex scandal. It was about the yawning pitch-black eternal emptiness of the caves. It drove two women mad. Nature as an amoral uncaring unmoveable eternal reality.Just as Picnic was NOT about repressed Victorian sexuality. These were pretexts, and were utilized because the fear of sex is the fear of letting go. The fear of sexuality leads irrestibly to our main fear: that darkness, emptiness, and the powers of nature will overwhelm us and erase us.In Picnic, there was no villain, no enemy, no fall guy, no perpetrator, process or predicament that we could blame for the girls' disappearance. They simply disappeared. And that is the scariest nightmare of all.",Picnic at Hanging Rock

And boy does 'Picnic...' deliver.Basically some boarding school girls go to a mountain and a few go missing. That's the plot. A bit thin you'd think, but no Peter Weir manages to drag it out for a full two hours. The characters are dull - a few seem potentially interesting but the aloof approach adopted means we never get to engage with them. There's interminable dreamy sequences of slow-motion shots backed by panpipes whilst characters utter pretentious nonsense like ""I know that Miranda is a Botticelli angel"". The part of this film I found most interesting was the budding friendship between the upper-class English boy and his lower-class Australian valet, suggesting perhaps the possibility of transcending the class divisions of the old country in a new land. However this is but a small subplot and the rest of the film is unutterably boring.

It is also quite slow paced and not very introspective: boring and sad.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
128,augurar,Poorly executed,5,18 June 2013,"This film sounds interesting, but unfortunately it is not very good. The basic plot outline is that some schoolgirls and a teacher disappear while on a picnic to a local landmark. Attempts to find them are unsuccessful, and the mystery is never explained. I find this interesting because there are several real-life events that are somewhat like this, for example the Dyatlov Pass incident and the Mary Celeste. And indeed, what is interesting about the events is not the explanation, but the mystery itself, so the fact that the mystery remains unresolved at the end of the film doesn't bother me.However, despite its potential, several things about this film do not ""work"", in my opinion. First of all, the time period and setting are not executed convincingly. I can't really put my finger on it, but there is an artificial feel to the film and its characters that makes it impossible to believe that these are real people in a real time period. Granted, the characters are fictional, but the film fails to effectively create the illusion of a cohesive reality.In addition to this, the film is rather heavy-handed with its delivery of themes. For example, setting the picnic on Valentine's Day seemed unnecessary. The description of the rock as the girls are riding in the carriage is another overly blunt attempt at symbolism: ""Siliceous lava forced up from deep down below..."" Yeah yeah, repressed Victorian sexuality, whatever. This is the sort of thing much better shown through actions and visuals than communicated so directly. The repetition of ""important"" lines at later points in the film also seemed over-the- top and unnecessary. Clearly the director did not trust the viewers enough to let them figure this stuff out for themselves.Finally, the film suffered from plotting and pacing issues. In contrast to some of the reviewers here, I actually thought the film had too much action, not too little. Despite its slow-moving feel, the film actually jumps from one event to the next for the entire film. First the girls disappear, then there's the investigation, then Michael and Albert return to the rock, then Michael is found by Albert, then Irma is found, and so on and so on. It's like the writer is afraid we'll get bored with the film if we don't have something new to consider every few minutes. Unfortunately, all these peripheral events distract from the film's essence and diffuse its energy, leaving little time to fully explore the strangeness of the first disappearance or its effects on the remaining characters.To conclude, though built on an intriguing premise, this film lacked the subtlety, insight, and craftsmanship necessary to develop its premise in any meaningful way.",Picnic at Hanging Rock

For a more down to earth person like myself, this movie is a waste of time.I will agree with the director , Peter Weir, on one thing. He's right, I really don't care what happened to those girls at the end, because I just wanted the movie to end.I understand all the social criticism that is really at the heart of the movie. It takes a harsh and very critical view of the repressed Victorian era these girls were raised in.Lots of observations about sexual repression, etc. We've seen all that before.One might wonder if things were really that bad. No doubt, the director, Mr. Weir, and the screenwriter, Mr. Green,are pleased with all the ""progress"" of sexual liberation today resulting in broken families, illegitimate children, etc.Maybe, in another 75 or 100 years, someone will make a movie about the society girls are being brought up in today. It might even be as critical of this time as Picnic at Hanging Rock is of the Victorian era.This movie is also another example as to why movie critics can't be relied on. They all love it. But, it violates the first principle in making a movie, that is, telling a good story.Having just trashed the movie, I will say one thing in it's favor.

131,wlbtraveler,Utterly fascinating,10,23 January 2021,"I honestly don't even know where to begin with ""Picnic at Hanging Rock."" It's one of the most intricate, symbolic, and bizarre films I have ever seen. Much like its central mystery, the film eludes explanation, representing a question that cannot and, I suppose, should not be answered. It's an unusual amalgamation of a Victorian period piece, a metaphysical exploration, and a coming-of-age story. In any other hands, that would be extremely difficult to pull off. Thankfully, Joan Lindsay and Peter Weir are perfect for the job.Because of the film's staggering intricacy, I'd like to discuss each of the themes I noted individually. These themes may not be the same ones others have noticed, which is honestly to be expected. ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" is heavily symbolic, and screams ""subjective interpretation"" like nothing I've ever seen before.First, I'd like to cover the theme most discussed and frankly most obvious: sexual repression and release. As many reviewers and analysts have said before, Hanging Rock appears to symbolize sexual awakening and a release from strict Victorian values. The girls at Appleyard College are constantly bound in heavy dresses, gloves, and stockings, even on a day as hot as St. Valentine's (though you may remove your gloves once the carriage has passed through Woodend, as Mrs. Appleyard so eloquently reminds them). It's an incredibly repressive society that surrounds the girls, and Hanging Rock represents an escape from that. As Miranda, Marion, and Irma climb higher and higher on the rock, shoes and stockings are shed and left behind. The shot of Irma dancing on the rock and framed by the sky will always be one of my favorite scenes from any film. We later learn that Mrs. McCraw, who also climbed the rock, was seen without a skirt on during her unnoticed ascent. Edith however, who is younger and notably disinterested by the rock, does no such thing and is vocal about her hatred of the rock. It's as if she isn't ready to break free of this society yet and is almost disgusted by the idea.As I said, Hanging Rock symbolizes an escape from this oppressive society. As the girls climb higher and higher, the escape further and further from the restrictions of their lives. Miranda appears almost giddy as she looks up towards the summit, reminding the others that they must turn back eventually but always continuing higher nevertheless. The two moments where the girls suddenly become dazed and fall asleep during their ascent seem to almost represent a transition between these ""levels"" of escape. After each reawakening, Miranda, Marion, and Irma appear even more enraptured by Hanging Rock. Eventually, as if in a trance, they disappear altogether, having fully transcended their oppressive society. Irma, the only girl to eventually return (or be returned) is in a sense unrecognizable to her former classmates after her reappearance. She has transcended this restrictive existence but eventually returned, carrying some of that with her. During a final meeting with her classmates at a dance lesson, she is wearing a bright red dress, which as many analysts have pointed out, is a huge contrast to the white dresses worn by her classmates and formerly herself. After an extremely uncomfortable silence in which her classmates seem to be unnerved by her presence, they fall upon her, screaming and demanding to know what happened up on Hanging Rock. Irma rushes away and is never seen again, unable or unwilling to answer.Another theme of the film which I find quite fascinating is the collision of Western society and ancient indigenous cultures which are so poorly understood by the relatively new arrivals. In a land as spiritually unconquered as Australia, the European immigrants of this era are woefully unknowledgeable and naive towards the legends and cultures they have tried to dominate. Hanging Rock is a physical manifestation of these spiritual legends, and is a place that cannot be conquered by the Western trespassers who have no understanding of it. In that manner, Hanging Rock has a sentient, almost malevolent presence, which is exacerbated by the apparent faces visible in the rock. Whether you see Hanging Rock as helping the girls escape or stealing them away is a matter of opinion, but you cannot deny that it is extremely foreboding (It's worth noting that even executive producer Patricia Lovell was afraid of Hanging Rock and refuses to go back to this day). Michael, the boy who finds himself fascinated by Miranda (I mean who doesn't) is another victim of Hanging Rock's unbounded spiritual nature. In his search for Miranda and the others up on the rock, he is seemingly confronted by a force that is too overwhelming for him to accept or understand. Albert later finds him on the rock, nearly catatonic and surrounded by the unreachable voices of those he is looking for. Some people simply aren't ready for what lies within Hanging Rock.A final major theme which I find noteworthy is the profound sense of loss present in the film. Though Hanging Rock does serve as a sort of escape for Miranda, Marion, and Irma, their disappearance leaves behind a large hole in the lives of those around them, chiefly Sara, Michael, Mlle. de Poitiers, and Mrs. Appleyard. The sudden loss of Miranda is devastating for Sara, who loved Miranda and saw her as the only friend she had. Over the course of the film, she becomes increasingly depressive and isolated, lying still for hours on end and presumably trying to find answers for questions that don't have any. This eventually culminates with Mrs. Appleyard informing her that due to her overdue tuition, she is being returned to the orphanage she was so desperate to escape from in the first place. Eventually, she is found in the greenhouse, having apparently jumped from the roof in an effort to find the only escape she thought she had left. Our learning that Albert is her long-lost brother only rubs salt on the wound, as it means that she was so close to potentially finding happiness. But like Miranda, it was just too far out of reach.Michael has a similar reaction to Miranda's sudden disappearance. He spends much of the following days and weeks searching for her on and near Hanging Rock, hoping to find a missing girl that he never even spoke to. His efforts are fruitless and he nearly meets his own demise on the rock, but is saved by Albert. His story is at least bittersweet, as he eventually departs Victoria in an effort to leave that profound loss behind. Mlle. de Poitiers has a similar departure, grieving over the loss of Miranda, Marion, and Mrs. McCraw but moving on and hopefully finding peace. Unfortunately, Mrs. Appleyard has no such luck. With the loss of two students, the departure of many more, and the disappearance of Mrs. McCraw whom she heavily relied on, she spirals into severe grief and begins to lose touch with reality. She becomes increasingly distant to the remaining faculty and students, and eventually accepts the demise of Appleyard College. An epilogue informs us that she perished in an apparent attempt to climb Hanging Rock, likely hoping to find comfort or answers in a place that had neither to offer.Now enough with the themes, because those can be fairly depressing. Let's talk about THE Miranda. Miranda is a fascinating character played by a fascinating actress. Anne-Louise Lambert, who was and still is absolutely beautiful, portrayed her in such a unique fashion that one can't help but be fascinated by her. She played the character so well that even Joan Lindsay (the author of the original novel) called her Miranda. She has a manner that is simultaneously worldly and ethereal, and has a sincere spirituality to her that is evident from the very beginning of the film. Her odd phrasing of ""I won't be here much longer"" in her conversation with Sara almost seems to indicate that she is aware of her impending transcendence. Later at the picnic, she, Marion, Irma, and Edith venture off to the rock with permission from Mlle. de Poitiers, who Miranda turns and gives one last wave to. To de Poitiers, it's only a temporary goodbye. After all, they promised to be back soon. Miranda on the other hand seems more sincere in her goodbye, taking one final look at her classmates and friends before turning away forever. It's almost as if she knows what will happen on Hanging Rock but accepts it for what it is. As she says mere minutes before her disappearance:""Everything begins... and ends... at exactly the right time and place.""Aside from Miranda, part of what makes ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" so magical is its constant ethereal quality, not only during the events on the rock but also before and after. The picnic scene is especially interesting, as it appears so otherworldly onscreen, both hazy and sunlit. Cinematographer Russell Boyd reportedly accomplished this by placing a bridal veil over the camera, and it works WONDERS. That is possibly one of the most genius moves I've heard of in cinematic history, so hats off to him for coming up with that. His effort combined with that of director Peter Weir truly created a marvel of a film, and its comes as no surprise that so many viewers are totally captivated by it.In the end, I suppose all I can say is that ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" is a film that everyone should see, if only to help you understand that some questions simply don't have or require answers. Both the film and its story completely defy any explanation, and its an exercise in what I suppose you could call ""mystical filmmaking."" It's an incredibly subjective film that leaves everything from the plot itself to character motivations up to the viewer to decide. Whatever you decide in the end, it cannot be denied that ""Picnic at Hanging Rock,"" much like Hanging Rock itself, is something truly special.",Picnic at Hanging Rock

Whilst I'm sure there are many different myth's and legends surrounding the rock, the film is based on a 60's novel, but I'd always believed and had read to believe that the disappearance really happened.I was expecting a more sparse film concentrating solely on the rock and the disappearance, but the way it goes on to show how various people are effected by it and how the school goes to pot is great - a rich atmosphere is created through the music and fine acting.A stand-out piece for me would be poor Sara, her brother (as I understood it) was actually Alfred - the rich family's horseman/helper - whatever-you-call-it- and it would have been wonderful if they'd found each other, so-close... and all that.Many people comment on the ""mystic symbolism"" of the film but I find it more scary than anything else, and it always gives me the chills any time I watch it.

If you are interested in Aboriginal spirituality and have certain ideas and theories about the sacred land of Australia, this movie definitely gives you something to think about. There is a lot of talk on these boards and around the internet about the ""secret"" behind the mystery, but for me it isn't unresolved at all. It was very obvious to me, being interested in what different spiritual traditions have to say about the nature of time, what happened in this movie. I think it will affect people on different levels depending on how you choose to experience movies in general as well as your capacity for abstract thought. For the record, I don't like movies that deliberately offer no resolve to the mysteries they weave, I really am one for solutions, but it was natural and enjoyable for me to reach my own personal conclusions about what exactly was going on in this movie. It was wonderfully subtle but rich in meaning. The movie is extremely atmospheric and I almost felt myself go into a bit of a trance while watching! I especially love the scene that occurs right before the girls go off for their exploration, while they are sitting in the grass. At this point in the movie, do listen to the wondrous sounds of nature! Crickets and birdsong, the wind in the trees, sounds like that. We need to get out in the natural areas of our own corners of this earth and feel that. It is necessary for our health and wellbeing. This is also a film for nature enthusiasts! In addition, I adored the recitation of poetry and a glimpse of the life of a schoolgirl before the technology age, and outside the hustle bustle of the city. It really makes you realize that it is seriously a shame how addicted young people are to their gadgets, and how wonderfully simple life was at that time. It truly facilitated a love of poetry in the young student that I believe has been lost to modern society. Scary. Finally, I must say that I (like countless others) fell under the spell of the lead girl, Miranda, who is likened just before her disappearance to a Bodicelli Angel. She really is a lovely and special girl.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
136,RoLaren,left Hanging after the Picnic,4,22 June 2000,"Words like ""haunting"", ""lyrical"", ""creepy"" crop up in most of the reviews of this film. The premise sounded promising: schoolgirls disappearing in the Outback at the site of sinister rock...I've sat through--and liked--most of the Merchant-Ivory films, been a fan of David Lean for years, so my attention span is pretty tolerant, however...endless shots of rocks & foliage (no matter how beautifully photographed), assorted creepy-crawlies, an ominous soundtrack and lots of drawn-out pauses do not constitute a film.I was looking forward to watching this film (I rented the ""director's cut"" on video), having heard much about it over the years, but I was left feeling like I'd attended a beautiful banquet in which most of the food turns out to be props. In addition to the lack of substance, the film is marred by stagy moments such as ""Mademoiselle"" staring after Miranda (one of the schoolgirls) and comparing her to a Botticelli angel; another schoolgirl looking down on her companions from above and commenting (while staring off into the distance in the manner long ago deemed appropriate for a Soliloquy) on the insignificance of humans; scenes with characters who lend nothing to the plot or atmosphere (the servant couple at the school, for example) and very bad wigs (Rachel Roberts' in particular).I didn't find any of the ""horror"" promised and most of the suspense I experienced came from wondering when SOMETHING was going to happen. What a disappointment. What a waste...",Picnic at Hanging Rock

139,Mark1988,"Haunting, Elegant and Incredibly Atmospheric",9,31 May 2007,"Having found a video store with a decent amount of Australian cinema, I was very excited to find Weir's 'Picnic at Hanging Rock' in the outlet's excellent collection. The film itself is classic in my country, however I tried not to implant my own expectations on the work, rather attempting to approach it with an open mind.The story centers on several school girls who go missing while attending a school picnic at Hanging Rock on St.Valentines day 1900. From there, the bulk of the story extrapolates how the friends, teachers and the community adjust to their shocking disappearance. This focus on how people react to the mystery is the film's master stroke. You can't help to be pulled into the mystery as you, like the characters in the film, begin to grieve but also wonder exactly what happened to these lovely young women.The acting and direction is very polished for a group of -at the time- very inexperienced film makers. All the cast, from the gardeners and maids, through to splendidly cold Mrs Appleyard are perfect. The unlikely friendship between a young English boy and an Australian stable-hand is heart warming and genuine. As much of film focuses on the isolation and emotional abuse of the girls in the school, the entire female cast covey very realistic feelings of angst and grief. Even now, the performances hold up well because of the subtlety and passion of the actors. The many silent sequences around Hanging Rock are evoked very well with all the support cast remaining focused and true to the period in terms of their expressions and demeanor. In addition, Weir's directing is incredible. The trademark focus on atmosphere and character development shines through with mastery in this piece. Considering his lack of experience, it is a remarkable achievement.The cinematography is also very good. Russel Boyd and Weir use many silent sequences on the Rock itself to help evoke the spooky atmosphere of the location. The sequences are beautiful and almost surreal. The girls seem like angels ascending to heaven as the clamber further and further away from civilization. These scenes are spine-tingling and atmospheric. They will stay with you longer than most of the clichéd ""horror"" sequences Hollywood churns out.This film is simply beautiful. It sparked conversation and argument at our dinner table for hours as we bickered over the mystery. No other film as provoked so much discussion, not only in terms of narrative but the chocking atmosphere the oozes through the entire movie. Not for anyone after mindless action but a real classic of Australian cinema.",Picnic at Hanging Rock

I lived alone when I first saw it in the mid-80's, and I had trouble sleeping after I watched it. The metaphysical quality of the mystery, the ambiguity with which the mystery is treated, are far more horrifying than films where the shocks are blatant and obvious and concrete. What really happened on Hanging Rock? There is no way to tell. It is the horror of the unknowable, the existential void, that makes this film so deliciously chilling. This film's subtlety does not work for those whose idea of horror is the guy jumping out from behind a tree with a knife - I recommended it to a friend, and he told me it was one of the most boring movies he had ever seen. Picnic at Hanging Rock is beautifully filmed, but plays more like a dream than a conventional narrative. The pan-pipe music is evocative of another world.

Or are the girls' over-active imaginations causing them to believe that sinister things are happening around them, especially at Hanging Rock?

There are also the lingering doubts: What really happened at Hanging Rock? Each viewer is left to decide... **NOTE: This is not an action adventure, not a typical horror or mystery. I cannot fit it into any one category, ART is the most likely, although it is certainly dramatic.

143,ProgressiveHead,Both Dark and Etherial,9,18 October 2011,"On Valentine's Day in 1900, students of an all-girls college in Victoria, Australia, embark on an excursion to Hanging Rock, where they picnic and just generally appreciate the beauty of the surroundings and the geological marvel of the rock formations. Unfortunately, some of the students disappear in truly bizarre circumstances.Early feature from Peter Weir (Dead Poets Society, The Truman Show) is a story often subtly told, and this enhances the sense of mystery regarding the disappearance of the girls, a mystery that appears to be at least as deeply buried as the now ""hanging"" rocks themselves were prior to being spewed out of the earth one-million years ago.The period setting and often beautiful locations add greatly to the overall effect. Hanging Rock is located in Victoria, but many other scenes were shot in the Adelaide Hills of South Australia and also the picturesque town of Strathalbyn (a mere half-hour's drive from yours truly's hometown of Murray Bridge) which to this day retains much of the aesthetic appeal of its early settlement heritage, but I digress. Also adding greatly to the atmosphere is the often haunting score, dominated by an eerie and beautiful wind instrument, perfectly suited to the natural surroundings and the mysterious quality of the central narrative locale. Truly spellbinding.Though it contains nothing much to appeal to gore-hounds, Picnic at Hanging Rock has at least one foot firmly planted in the horror genre, and many seasoned genre fans will find much to appreciate.The varied characters are well-drawn, telling us a story in themselves, often reaching a satisfying resolution of conflict, for better or worse.Just don't expect a bunch of straightforward answers concerning the incidents at Hanging Rock. It's in exploring the mysterious where Picnic truly shines.",Picnic at Hanging Rock

The only interesting people were miss McCraw who being treated like crap, and then she wanders off and we'll never hear of her again.
The orphans Albert and Sara. Nothing is told about them much either. 
Millie and Tom. And they too are just bystanders. 
To someone's story. Mlle de Poitiers? She has an engagement ring, so - Nah. We will never know who she was engaged to, or what ever happened with her.
Why is she in charge at the picnic? Why isn't she punished in any way for losing the girls? I suppose it's because she's SO BEAUTIFUL. That's the only reason for womenfolks to exist. At least in this movie.
Except the headmistress. She is there just to be mean. Because power does that to women. And then she becomes a drunk and kills herself. Possibly. 
Too many people with not much to say. Is this Michael's story? Or Sgt. Bumpher's story? I don't know. I don't think Peter Weir knows.Nothing is ever solved. There's too much ESP in this movie. ""I just know I won't be coming back."" ""I just know I have to go there"". People seem to have no other reason to do what they do except that they ""know"".I hate the ""knowing""... the girls are meaninglessly wandering about being airy fairy, talking about love and stuff and things that sound meaningful with a breathy airy light voice. The music is horrible. It's like watching these ""you'll never believe these mystical unsolved bla bla bla"" videos on YouTube. This one is just 100 minutes in stead of 10 minutes. The clothes... Why is everyone wearing white except the only two women with anything in their head? And then the church clothes... *sigh* Why?Make-up - what's with all these bruises and scratches?

How was that in any way necessary?And the girls hopping over the brook? There was no need for the fat girl to put her foot into water, but, sure, she did, and the other three, slim, ""beautiful"" girls, just hopped over like gaselles. Except that Saint Miranda the Angel had to lift her skirt to show off her legs, even though she never needed to lift her skirt. *sigh*And the practically only fat girl wasn't only fat, she was lazy, whiny, stupid and ridiculous and gets slapped. That slap scene also... All the girls are on Iris, and this amazing, wonderful Mademoiselle goes find the fat girl to slap her. Cinematography... er... I don't even care. The story is so fragmented, nonsensical, stupid and boring, I really don't care if it even has any technical value. I give it 2 only because I've seen worse movies, but I don't recommend this to anyone for any reason.

150,Mr Lombardo,All that we see is but a dream...,10,1 May 1999,"Simply put this is the greatest Australian movie ever made.  There really is no other film like it.  The first words uttered in the film are ""All that we see or seem, are but a dream, a dream within a dream..."".  That is what Weir has created with this film - something that is as beautiful and as surreal as a dream.The factuality of the events depicted here are stressed at the beginning and the end but the film is actually directly based on the novel which is of debatable authenticity.  There certainly isn't any real evidence backing up this story.  In fact, many people now think it is a work of fiction since there is supposed to be a final chapter which was cut which resolved the girls disappearance in a sort of 'through the looking glass' way.  There are many theories to what happened to the girls ranging from plain old murder (Irma going psycho is my favourite) to the paranormal (timeslip/parallel universe/alien abduction) but in the end, in the context of the film, they don't really matter.  I guess Weir wanted to stress the factuality of the events to heighten the dream-like quality of his film.  After all, a dream without a reality is just another reality.The film is pure atmosphere, its locations switching between the Victorian boarding school with its oppressive gothic overtones and tyranical principal and the alluring, but terrifying Hanging Rock.  The movie in many ways is a horror movie - the school representing a more natural horror and the rock the supernatural horror, the two combined in quite splendid fashion.  The way this film fills you with dread is remarkable.Another very potent theme is the sexuality of the girls - slightly reminiscent of Walkabout which also combines a young woman's sexuality and the Australian outback to magnificent effect. This is why Weir's film is so successful.  Sex and horror often go hand in hand because they are the most intense feelings you will ever experience.The music in stark contrast to the film seems to be heavy handed but actually succeeds in enhancing the atmosphere of the film - and it really is quite a beautiful score.Some may choose not to view it as mystery but as an allegory for a girl's journey into womanhood.  Indeed, the three blossoming girls with their white virginal dresses take on an almost angelic form as they climb the rock. An unstoppable ascension to a higher plane of existence.A haunting, sublime masterpiece.",Picnic at Hanging Rock

An all too unbelievable story made from a real life premise to be the excuse 'that supernatural powers were involved'.The suspense of this film was when will it end!

I was expecting a quite light hearted story that was not too intense, it is rated PG after all but I was shocked. I must say this is the scariest film I have ever seen and I have seen quite a few films on peoples top 20 scariest.I am not going to review the overall film like I normally would because there are enough reviews on this film already about how brilliant the acting is (it really is) and how great the directing by Peter Weir is but I will discuss and get out everything I am feeling straight after watching this film. The story of this film, the first 30 minutes scared me so much, the eerie atmosphere that was created by the three girls and then the fat girl screaming when the other three girls wouldn't listen. Brrr... it was like the three girls were in a trance (which I believe they are) and the other fat girl is sensing something, she can see or feel something that is so horrifying that she cannot stay there any longer. The numerous searches on the rock are so tense and scary that I could hardly bear it and when the servant, I can't remember his name, found the man on the rock it made me jump so much. The way the fat girl describes her encounter of her teacher who is never found got visions in my head that stayed with me and it was so vivid, so horrifying. I am really not a fan of horror movies at all, in fact I generally hate them except for a select few, this was something else and it chilled me so much. So the first hour earns this film a 10/10 but I am afraid that I found the last section of the film very boring and a bit pointless. I know that it was all meant to show the effect the whole incident had on the college and the town but this certainly did not make the whole atmosphere any scarier and certainly lightened the mood.To conclude, I would say that Picnic on Hanging Rock is nearly a masterpiece and the first hour is an experience I will never forget and it scared me so much. After watching this me and my dad discussed what maybe could have happened but every time we suggested something the other would come back and say how that could not be possible. The story is so scary and scarring and definitely would not be recommended to anyone who can get very easily scared.

The story really sucks you into another world and you feel transported back in time. It manages to be a calm movie while also having a sense of intensity and mystery. The pacing is almost perfect. Only in the last 15 minutes or so I thought it could have been a bit smoother. The movie feels slow but it really isn´t. That´s because of its dreamlike atmosphere that is supported by excellent editing and camerawork. There´s always something happening, always something to look at, it never drags; the story always moves forward. I´ve watched many many movies but when it comes to the visuals I was absolutely stunned here. The locations are like beautiful paintings, which just adds to the whole dreamy atmosphere. The costumes, colours and lighting are all chosen well. The characters are great but also it´s one of the few things it could have improved upon a little. I just think some characters were really well written, but some others needed more depth. But I like the ideas this movie wants to convey and the characters really support this. The actors all do a good job, although Sara Waybourne and Helen Morse stand out to me. What I have not talked about yet is the music and sound design, but it really is just as good as the rest. I want to listen to the soundtrack again right now. There is mostly classical music, which I´m a fan of, so it might not be for you. But still it´s fitting for the movie, it supports the atmosphere and is chosen at the right moments. The sound design also stands out to me anytime we are at the hanging rock. It again just adds to the whole mysterious, dreamlike atmosphere.Here is my rating:
1. Story,characters & acting 2,5/3
2. Visuals, camerawork & editing 3/3
3. Music & sound design 3/3Overall this would be 94% and I will give it 9 points, as some characters and the pacing at the end could have been improved upon a bit. The ending also could have felt a bit smoother, but we are talking about small details here. It´s an excellent movie and I really recommend it.",Picnic at Hanging Rock

159,newsview,Picnic at Hanging Rock: Beautiful and Ultimately Empty,3,4 November 2013,"Everything about ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" is promising. The costuming, the set, the characters, the cinematography — the Australian outback itself. Unfortunately, the film doesn't develop the characters into much more than vignettes, doing little to delve into how the characters think and feel. Relationships and how or why they are formed are scarcely defined, and little else about the story is, either. The film doesn't elaborate on the themes of the story to salvage the mystery it works so hard to build. This film contains parallel story lines, some of which appear to tie into the disappearances of the schoolgirls, some of which do not. Picnic at Hanging Rock feels like one of those films you need to watch repeatedly for some of the nuances or ""clues"" to sink in, but in reality a lack of resolution to the story IS the story. Filmed in the mid '70s, the pace of the film is slow, perhaps intended to weave a dreamlike atmosphere (or to be less charitable, a throwback to the weed-smoking, psychedelic drug culture of the time). For modern audiences, however, the movie may prove frustrating in that it doesn't move the plot along fast enough to sustain the momentum that the tension- building soundtrack attempts to create. The soundtrack alone simply isn't enough to carry the mood.There are those who will say that enigma itself is artful, whereas other viewers will no doubt feel that the ill-defined ending to this film has cheated them out of two hours of their valuable (and limited) recreational time. I would have to side with those who believe that enigma without resolution — or at least allusion to some semblance of solution — makes for an unsatisfactory film-watching experience. Think about it: real life is itself an open-ended ""mystery"". Those who seek escape in film or books are often looking for more closure than a ""real life"" film like this can offer — or at minimum the intellectual challenge of spotting all the clues to solve the mystery for themselves. By today's standards, Picnic at Hanging Rock moves too slow and delivers too little. With so many watch-worthy films and so little time, this isn't among the better picks. Enigmatic, open-ended films have their place, but it remains true that those without a clear beginning, middle and end are rarely successful among the mainstream as ends unto themselves.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
160,Tetra123,"In the Victorian spirit of Gothic revival; eerie, dreamlike, beautiful...",10,25 March 2009,"*Spoilers* A fascinating work of atmosphere, artistic impression and feeling, Peter Weir explores significance and how it's assigned to our experiences in ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"". From its opening, viewers are encouraged to somnambulate through ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" believing--offered as a passage from Poe, spoken on a breeze, forewarning from a chain of wood-nymph Cassandras--what we see and what it seems could be nothing more than ""a dream within a dream"". From that moment until the closing credits, the dream theme remains constant, with a plot that unfolds in such a way that everything is believed at face value, not a scene goes by without seeming relevant and every image is pregnant with multiple meanings; yet, nothing is ever really said at all---the plot (Victorian schoolgirls go on a picnic at a local place of natural wonder; some get lost with their teacher, some will never return--it doesn't really matter what happens; you'll care about the ""what"" but not necessarily the ""why"") is never neatly resolved, nor is the audience told what sort of story they'd actually seen. Everything in ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" is presented with the authority of dream logic; of course it all makes sense. To borrow from Miranda, ""Everything happens at the right time"". Actions are accepted ""as is"" and without question, such ambiguousness lending to both cosmic significance and fundamental meaninglessness--essentially summing up ""Picnic at Hanging rock"" in one line. This film being set in the Victorian period--and the same thing that captures me about any costume film--adds an element of passed time, its wistful poignancy, immediacy. However disconnected people of the 1970's would've been from the year 1900, as time marches on, humans become further distanced from those who lived during those years. Through death of people from an era or generations, the living travel further away from the moments, places and things that were so important to those who lived--their collective consciousness, shared memories. Nomatter what happened to the girls, or how intense the situation was for the people who were part of it, that time is gone. The transience of time and how pieces of knowledge are left out of the greater puzzle, when people don't have the tools to interpret them, could be seen as two powerful themes running throughout ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"". What did we know 110 years ago that we don't know now? In the same sense, what will humans know that same passage of time into the future? Whatever it is, it's unlikely we'll be alive to know it. ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" implies that despite our best intentions of progress and education, we never really know either. We live in the present, our past is dead, we are yet to exist in the future; however, in the future we will, with certainty, cease to exist.The two things Victorians romanticized most, youth and death, are assigned places of honor in this story. A cold realization creeps up your spine as the film progresses; though unfortunate enough to die in youth and miss out on their own life stories, the vibrant girls at the center of ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" would've aged and eventually died, anyway. All of these characters in context would be dead at this point in time if they'd actually existed. Every person at the search party was in for the same fate as that of the girls--whether or not it came earlier or later, swiftly or drawn; painful or not: We are all going to die. By keeping ourselves busy constructing social stories, rules and customs we take our minds off the inevitable.It was also interesting to see that photos of the girls were shown often, with people responding to the pictures and assigning a sort of life to them. Throughout the film, the ugliness of death is eclipsed by romantic tragedy and the legends that spring from it--the idea of The Beautiful Tragedy as entertainment; people responding to ideals and romance--cultural or otherwise--as a way of ignoring the existential horrors and biological violence most assign to death and decomposition. In this sense, we are also reminded of the eeriness of the film medium itself, the way it taunts us with ghostlike images (sometimes of stars long dead), implying captured time and lingering souls---visual compositions of human mannerisms and personalities; an artistic distortion of past time and an attempt to capture the social essence of a living person. There is great monumental-ism to be found in being a screen star, where, as long as the medium endures in one shape or another, one can be remembered by the living and unknowingly exist as an active part of their world---people will feel some kind of emotion toward you, as you were in that moment in time.I also think it's no accident, coming from the maker of ""Dead Poet's Society"", that the most grounded characters--the ones that manage to keep calm and evade danger--are the poorer, less educated ones. If only viewed as a commentary on isolated academia and how excessive education and social regimentation can sometimes make humans too precious for life, ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" can be seen as a success.In my opinion, ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" is the most effective kind of scary film; a mind-bending, atmospheric chill-inducer that disturbs us by mixing elements of natural beauty with sinister realities. A common ghost story could never hit the same chord; that sort of thing gives us hope about existing after bodily death. ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"", however, taps into the subconscious unease that comes with being a creature aware of its own mortality; the impending doom of its own nothingness. Mortality is the alarming mystery each of us faces every day and some works of art perk us up and force us to pay attention to this ringing bell. In ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"", that bell is brazenly--disconcertingly, so--played as music and is a masterpiece because of it.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
161,bonniebabyblu,Romantic spook,8,29 April 2016,"I love this film. It's beautifully shot and very creepy, especially as Aires Rock is meant to be a weird place to visit anyway. This is very old and I wouldn't have watched it if someone hadn't have mentioned it to me. I'm glad I did.The locations are great and I'm really curious about the reality of what went on? Whether it is actually based on some true events or not? That's what I like about films like this as oppose to the ridiculous modern horrors that plainly do not really have 'Darth Maul' hiding in the attic. This is a simple tale, well told and well acted. I'm a teacher and will be showing this to my students as if we don't show them old movies, they just get lost in time. This deserves a shout out.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
162,Crabnebula1914,Atmospheric and eerily believable!,8,26 March 2007,"Picnic at Hanging Rock is a very dark and atmospheric film. The movie instigates a psychological response while it inavertadly wanders into the unexplained areas of the mind. It's a film that is meant to be experienced not watched. Although Peter Weir is an Australian director the feature cannot be categorized into any specific national style or genre. It has all the qualities of an independent/experimental film with none of the shortcomings that can sometimes get dragged along with those kinds of pictures. The overall approach is unpretentious and eerily believable even though the plot and story are far out and imaginative.Cinematography, sound and lighting are what give this movie its hallucinatory rhythm and substance creating an entire atmosphere of mystery. Although the film comes off as slow paced it just requires a little patience to adjust to its unique style. Some notable scenes are when the girls are climbing Hanging Rock and there are over lapping shots of birds flying that dissolve in and out with their faces. There is a good variation in different methods of shooting employed by the cinematographer in these particular parts. Although through most of the scenes there are a lot of shots when the characters are captured in the center of the frame, later in the film there is a great contrast to this simple approach. One example is the more low angle photography when filming Hanging Rock. Since it is so large and vast and the camera is placed more below, it projects the image of a superior force that should not be reckoned with. These shots of the rock create a feeling of uneasiness to the point were it becomes a character in itself; some of the rocks even take on a human presence because they look like faces. These shots just linger in the movie constantly reminding the audience that there is a mysterious element of danger prominent. Sound and music tie a lot of elements together in the film too. When the girls are making their way up the music also seems to coincide with the pace of their ascent towards the top. The classical numbers also seem very appropriately placed in the film because it matches with the prim Victorian attitudes. The incorporation of silence has an equally important effect as music does in some cases. Early in the film when they first arrive the only things noticeable to the ear is the harmonies of birds chirping and other natural sounds that are to be heard in a setting such as that. This gives the audience a feeling of cinematic realism while it still does not compromise the intended fantasy and surrealism. Sometimes a lack of sound can even enhance and accentuate feelings of apprehension.There are also a few different genres going on in this picture. In one light it is a period piece seeing as it takes place in 1900. The costume design and recreation of the times look very natural and accurate. There is also an adequate portrayal of Victorian attitudes while the picture never becomes over indulgent like some period films (Fellini's Casanova, Zefrelli's Jane Eyre). It's important however that one not be led on by this soft exterior it starts out on because it slowly snowballs into a very psychologically startling storyline that also borderlines into the horror genre. Even though there are no knife wielding maniacs or ghouls swallowing people up doesn't mean that it can't be frightening. Actually, the lack of things like that is what gives the film its originality. Peter Weir seems to be one of the few directors (if not only) that can make a movie where tragedy falls upon attractive young women without being exploitive; everything throughout the picture is done in good taste. It's good to see a filmmaker fearlessly blend different styles into one work. It's pretty safe to say that Picnic at Hanging Rock is not one particular kind of movie because it has many different elements combined into one. Since there is nothing that legitimately explains what happened to the girls who disappeared it was important for the director to uniquely craft that aura of mysticism. It makes the viewer aware that the option of something supernatural is responsible for what happened. There are no answers led on by the director throughout the movie, it's entirely up to the audience to draw their own conclusions, now although this may frustrate some it also peeks interest in others. Because of that Picnic at Hanging Rock is definitely not intended for all audiences. Weir lets the mystery stand while there are many clues and hints to be interpreted.Although Picnic at Hanging Rock can come off as confusing and that it doesn't answer its own questions its still fair to say that it is original and different than most other films. Sometimes an element of mystery is what makes a story interesting and engaging to ones imagination. Whether or not the style comes from the directors own creative instincts or it has more to do with the cultural influence from his own native South Whales.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
163,slip_ree,A film about Beauty,9,27 December 2000,"**SPOILER** People have pretty much covered the basics, so I'll just add my little piece.  To me, wondering what happened to Miranda, et al. is beside the point.  The point is, you ARE wondering...as are Michael and his mate, as is the schoolmaster, the mademoiselle, as is everyone.  The first half hour of the film accomplishes this feat (of hooking the viewer) through one basic technique: swamping the audience with beauty, over and over again.  The schoolgirls, the precision of their daily habits, their dresses and parasols at the rock, etc. It's all absolutely exquisite.  You, the viewer--much like Sara, mademoiselle, etc--are invited to fall in love with Miranda, et al.  And--as you can see by reading the comments here--some of us do (and love this flick) and some of us don't (and accordingly hate it).  Some people DO fall in love with a Botticelli in moments; others do not. I know I've reduced much of what the film is about, but people covered all the other bases before me.  That's just my take on it, and as you can tell, I fell in love too!",Picnic at Hanging Rock

165,The-Flick_Chick,I love this film,10,17 June 2013,"I gave it a 10. But to be fair, I give any movie I love a 10. It is subtle, and beautifully shot. If you don't mind films that leave a lot up to the imagination this is definitely not for you.The movie was very creepy. The sound in particular helps to set the tone. I remember turning it off at one point the first time I watched it to wait for my boyfriend to come home. After watching it a few more times I can't get back to that same point of fear I had felt originally. It took me awhile to even watch it again. But I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys the subtle atmospheric scary flick.Without giving too much away the film follows a group of schoolgirls in Australia during the early 1900's. After a day out at the well known Hanging Rock, a group of girls go missing. The film follows the search for the girls, and how their disappearance effects the school they attend as well as the locals.",Picnic at Hanging Rock

167,hempets,Largely overrated,5,24 November 1999,"Reading most of the reviews here, one would think is one of the best movies ever made. Sadly, this is not the case.  The story has potential, but is marred by slow pacing.  They could have easily cut half an hour out of this film without affecting any important plot points.Many of the reviews here refer to this as a 'subtle' film.  There's a big difference between subtlety and lack of development.  Both the main plot and the subplot about Sarah suffer from the latter. Some have compared it to ""The Blair Witch Project,"" but it lacks the suspense, mysteriousness, creepiness and chilling quality of that film.There is no explanation of why the two boys feel possessed to look for the girls.  Are they crazy enough to risk their lives searching for three girls just because they find them attractive?  Their characters seem superfluous. Also unexplained is the thrown-in voice-over about the woman who runs the school being found dead at the base of the rock, apparently searching for the missing girls. Does this mark a sudden, major character change, where she suddenly cares about the girls more than their parents' tuition money? Or was she so greedy she was willing to risk her life for the possibility of finding the girls (thus assuring 3 more tuition checks next term)?  By the time you get this far, does you still care?  The only characters I felt empathy for were Sarah and the missing girls.Two positive notes, however: 1) the direction and performances were very good; 2)the film was technically exceptional.  The cinematography, costumes, and set decoration were beautiful. This is brought out nicely in the Criterion Collection DVD.If you've seen ""Blair Witch"" and are looking for something similar, you won't find it here. If you have a DVD player and don't mind slow-paced, unexciting movies, the DVD may be worth a rental.",Picnic at Hanging Rock

There were a lot hysterical women and confused men in this movie, none of whom reacted to the movie's events in a way I recognized as human.  My wife said it best: ""you know the movie's out of whack when the only sensible character is French.""I'm sure it's a great movie since all the critics say so, but I didn't get the appeal. It's got some pretty shots, but even the camera work seemed obtrusive.

170,gkhubbard,Creepy but empty film.,1,8 November 2021,"This film excites its admirers in ways I do not begin to understand. Various fans have written about the exciting visions of past classical and Christian symbols and the mysteries in each scene. There are elaborate comparisons to films and television series before and since this film was made.However, any film, whether an art film, or something less experimental, must have a core of substance, something to hang its plot on, an anchor from which to spin the tale. Then, of course, the plot must unspiral in a way that seduces the viewer into suspending their everyday world view, and experience the film almost as though they are a participant.There are many films that do not provide the information needed to resolve their plots, and the viewers are left to make sense, from their individual perspectives, of the unsolved mysteries. Step back from the seductive Australian-ness of the cinematography, and some good acting, and it becomes clear that 'Picnic at Hanging Rock' does not have an anchoring core. The plot line of people vanishing into the unknown from a mass of rock has been used before, notably in a 1960s pulp science fiction horror story.It is reminiscent of the plots of the 'X Files,' where creepy events became the launching points of the individual plots, but the creepy incidents were nearly all initiated by aliens. That made the plots easy to write. You didn't need any real substance, just alien 'magic' and stereotypes. A notable exception was an episode centered in a haunted house with Lily Tomlin and Ed Asner. Here, the well-written plot moves forward quickly toward the unexpected ending.In any production, it's easy to scare an audience, just jump out, yell 'boo!' like 'Wait Until Dark.' And it is easy to write an inexplicable plot element into a script to catch an audience's attention. The challenge is to develop these disturbing incidents into a coherent plot. 'Picnic at Hanging Rock' has failed to accomplish this despite sinister incidents spread over some two hours running time.",Picnic at Hanging Rock

Besides the plot awkwardly unfolds and drags endlessly (what a relief when the film reaches its end!!!). The Victorian era as a backdrop weighs heavily like the top of an old trunk in the dusty attic of an ancient Australian manor house.I have seen far better films whose scene takes place during the Victorian era.

Unlike American films there is no happy Hollywood ending. I have yet to finish this film as I was in film class when we viewed it , we just saw the first 40 minutes and have no idea how it ends only that is sort of a mystery.

This misses the point.  (See the Roger Ebert review linked from IMDb.)I think the movie is wonderful in what it does not tell you.  Leaving things out can be a sign of incompetence, but done well, it engages one's imagination.  The implications of _PaHR_'s quiet, sunlit eeriness can feel cosmically significant.

It has overbearing music that makes the painfully slow pace of the movie even worse. The idea for the story has some real potential, but I don't think someone could make a less interesting film given the general outline of the story that structures its content.

At best, it could be enjoyed as antiseptic Victorian lesbian softcore porn. Otherwise, it is suitable for use in Guantanamo as torture. Maybe all of the rave reviews at IMDb come from 11 year old girls who think of themselves as poets...or women who still wish they were that 11 year old waif.

Everything else I heard or read about this film was not exaggerated in the least. But, the most haunting element of this film for me was the Pan Flute soundtrack score played by Georges Zamfir. It will leave you chilled and disoriented as if you had just passes through a mysterious fog.

182,frud,This film *is* about sexual repression,8,27 July 2007,"Devildoll claims that the girls' look of peaceful contentment as they lay around with each other indicates that the film seeks to describe an a pleasure that doesn't entail sexual repression. This claim relies on a mistaken understanding of interpretive options. The point isn't that the girls cannot experience a kind of intense, blissful feeling of companionship. But it is inevitable that this state, seemingly so free of tension, will not be sustained, and the girls will go through a passage into more explicitly defined sexuality, including attendant conflicts over jealousy and envy. I think it is possible to read them as opting out of that transition. But this suggests that they themselves realize the diffuse state of companionate feeling cannot be sustained, and that they seek to escape its collapse. That describes a dilemma addressed by repression, only now repression takes the more global form of an elimination of the disruptive instincts by disappearance/suicide. There are other, less ethereal ways this can be accomplished, bulimia and anorexia are among them.Whether devildoll intends it or not, her position represents a kind of fragmentation of sexual life that the Christian Right promotes in their argument for sexual abstinence. ""Friendships and faith in the lord are just as enjoyable and fulfilling as relationships which involve genital sexuality."" But that begs the question as to why it requires so much effort to maintain abstinence, and how sexual relations come to be framed as so dangerous and beyond the girls capacity to manage.",Picnic at Hanging Rock

Indeed, the plot seems to take second stage to the overwhelming moods of the film, accentuated by a lonely, wistful soundtrack utilizing panpipes.

I did not find the movie suspenseful or scary and I'm not sure why anybody would, although some people seem to.Roger Ebert and Peter Weir (both people who liked this film) sum it up nicely.Ebert describes it as a film that is ""free of plot"" That it is a film that doesn't have any final explanation and exists only as an ""experience""Weir says that he worked very hard to have the audience lose awareness of the facts.  He did everything he could to hypnotize the audience away from thinking that there might be a solution.So if you watch this film you should NOT try to figure it out.

If you want to see it, expect a film ""experience"" but don't expect a clear story, realistic characters or a plot.I found the film to be long, slow and plodding.  The point where the three girls disappear is probably the best moment in the whole film, as somebody else noted, but one brief moment of entertainment in an otherwise ambiguous film is not enough.I watched it thinking that it was a mystery.  I watched the characters do odd things (like falling into fits of apparently simultaneous-narcolepsy) and thought to myself ""What the heck was that?"".  I tried to use logic to piece together things that people did and said.I obviously went into this film with wrong expectations.  I thought there'd be a plot, I thought there'd be a mystery.  I should have read Ebert and Weirs' comments prior to watching the film and I'd realize that there is no plot and that the director didn't want you to even think for one moment that there was the possibility of an answer.  It is a film that is intentionally obtuse.If you're looking for a dreamlike escapade or something to soothe you to sleep then perhaps this film is for you.PS: This film is NOT based on any true events any more than The Blair Witch Project is.  Search the internet for more information and educate yourselves.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
186,eshaun,"Excellent director, immaculate film.",10,19 April 2003,"Peter Weir is a master of taking the mysteries of human nature, combining them with the essence of humanity, then distilling those aspects through the inexplicable itself. This has been an earmark of his films ""Dead Poets Society,"" ""Fearless"" and even ""The Truman Show"" but nowhere is this more apparent than with ""Picnic At Hanging Rock.""Beautifully filmed in rural Australia, the plot of ""Picnic At Hanging Rock"" is deceptively simple: students at an upper crust Victorian-era girls' school go on a field trip to Hanging Rock --an unusual geographic site miles away from civilization. On the trip, three of the girls and one of the teachers go missing. A simple plot, right? Well, on the surface it is indeed simple, but the way Peter Weir deals with the subject matter will keep the viewer absolutely enthralled and at a loss as to the cause of the girls' inexplicable disappearance. What has frustrated many viewers is that the responsibility of the hypothesis lies solely on them: there are no conclusive answers, but rather a number of theories as seen through the eyes of second and third parties.Additionally, Weir spices up the overall feeling of uncertainty with repeated images seemingly unrelated to the flow of the movie. Swans, ants, flowers, flies and poetry all appear repeatedly throughout the film, indicating that there is some deeper significance to the nature of the disappearance. Something that is just out of the viewer's grasp. In truth, Weir's direction in this film is akin to a more accessible and humanistic David Lynch. Much of the same thematic ground is covered, and the pronounced sense of uncertainty is a trademark of many Lynch films, especially his recent masterwork, ""Mulholland Drive.""Finally, what makes ""Picnic At Hanging Rock"" a true marvel of filmmaking is the complete integration of all elements in the support of the ephemeral theme. The pan-flute of Zamfir adds an otherworldly element to the score; the cinematography makes Hanging Rock look alternately commonplace, and enigmatic, depending on the scene. This collusion of all elements makes ""Picnic At Hanging Rock"" essential viewing for anyone interested in immaculate emotive filmmaking. -E. Shaun Russell",Picnic at Hanging Rock
187,t-verhaege,A beautiful snore-fest,2,7 February 2019,"I can see why some people would described this as haunting, sensual, hynoptic and so on.They will find with delight deep meaning in it. A profound philosophical reflection about man and nature or the colonisation of Australia by the British perhaps.And perhaps they are right, but at the end of the day, there is only one unforgivable sin for movies. It's to be boring. And as beautiful as it is, this movie is incredibly boring.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
188,alan-titcombe,Utterly Pointless,2,29 September 2004,This is the mystery of what happened to 3 girls who wandered off from a school picnic and disappeared without trace. And at the end of the film its still a mystery ... because no one knows what happened ! The identity of Jack the ripper was also a mystery but all films on that subject over the years have had a stab (not much of a pun intended) at what may have happened. This film just shrugs it shoulders. If you don't have a theory fine - but DON'T MAKE A MOVIE ABOUT IT ! The filling out of the characters and back story is virtually non-existent too. I honestly think this film could be optimized down to a single still showing the 3 girls wandering off with dazed expressions. I really didn't get anything more than that from this film. 2/10,Picnic at Hanging Rock
189,timhughes2000,Picnic....,10,30 April 2004,"This film is magnificent! From the storyline, the settings, the atmosphere, the cinematography, the Victorian repression, the music throughout, the sense of the ordinary, the epic and the bizarre all clashing together to make something altogether superb from such disparate parts.Whether it is supernatural, otherworldly, plain disappearances, a murder scene, or who-knows, no one ever really finds out. And what might seem important, might not be, and what might seem trivial might not be either! It is the imagination made reality on film, and the most dreamy and atmospheric film I have seen.The fact that it is in Australia as well, at the turn of the century counts for a lot. The story in the movie could be read in countless ways; as symbolic of the horrors and hypocrisy of Victorian society; as a criticism of European ideals imposed on an alien landscape; as the end of one society, that of Victorian, to the beginnings of the modern world we all now live in. It is this that is the crux for me; the appearance of something new from something so old; the old landscape, the passing values of Victorian society, the passing values of class deference in English-speaking societies, and obviously Australia.There is another thing that gets me about this movie; the down to earthness of Australians up against the bizarre and epic nature of an ancient landscape that refuses to be tamed.There is for me a sadness in this film, and repression of every kind, but, somewhere, in tiny glints throughout the movie, the future is glimpsed when ordinary people can be free of such repression, and somewhere the story of Oz itself is in this movie. I don't know how or why, but it is! I think! Whatever, I love this movie and can't get it out of my head.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
190,manading,Motion Picture - Motion = Picture.,1,10 October 2005,"I am dumber, angrier, and sleepier for having watched this film. What exactly was happening in 1975 to justify this waste of celluloid? In order to understand how a film like this could be made, you have to know that it was made by the government-funded Australian Film Corporation. If this organization's mission statement includes any of the words ""entertaining"", ""quality"", ""enjoyable"", or even ""watchable"", then they are recent additions. Apparently in the mid-1970's the only requirement to secure funding by this body was that you actually use film as your medium. That's the only explanation I can venture for why Peter Weir made the radical choice to lift this oil painting off the canvas and try to smear it across multiple frames. There were several scenes where I had to turn to my wife and ask, ""What just happened there?"", not because it had happened too fast, but because nothing had happened, and yet all the classic cinematic clues hinted that the scene had ended. Warning: It is against the law to view this movie while operating heavy machinery.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
191,Ars_Vivendi,wonderful atmospheric film,10,5 February 2014,"This is a wonderful film, I can only recommend it. Some people criticize it, because of a 'lack of plot', but in my eyes there is indeed a plot, namely what happens, when a group of young people goes missing, what effects does this have on those left behind (deadly ones to say so). That's what this film is about, essentially. And I would say, it's done in a very nice fashion. PAHR is very atmospheric, it's very generic and gives you a good sense of how the turn of the century (1900) was. Having seen this film you will know why the time between 1900 and 1914 was called the 'Belle Epoque', the nice period, even on the other end of the world in Down Under. The interior of the school building is so classy, same as the clothes of the people. The shiny, bright, yellow and sunny images of the Australian landscape depicted in this film which at times more seems to be a still than a film put you in good spirits, make you kinda of happy, particularly if outside of your window gray in gray reigns. Three of the female main cast are pretty, namely 'Miranda', 'Sara' and 'Mlle de Poitiers', they alone are worth watching PAHR, but strangely PAHR has something more to it. It may be the only film which you can watch without actually listening to what the people in it say, it's dialog, but you can listen to whatever you want, for example some music you like while seeing this film and you won't be put off by PAHR. PAHR may be the only film where this is possible, seeing it without knowing what the characters in it say because even 'silent' it's a joy to watch this film. Try it once, it works. As the saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words. This doesn't mean that the dialogs are bad, but the pictures are so good that they can stand without words, don't get me wrong on that. And of course the 'Ascent theme' by Bruce Smeaton (middle of the film, where one of the few male main characters climbs up the rock this film named after) is divine. Why did Bruce Smeaton (composer), Anne-Louise Lambert ('Miranda') with her bright, straight and long blonde hair, Helen Morse ('Mlle. De Poitiers') and Margaret Nelson ('Sara') not have greater careers on screen one asks? All of them made a solid and decent work in this film. Are all the directors and filmmakers in this world blind? Margaret Nelson played her part of a sad, depressed, longing and lonely orphan teenage woman very convincing, you got the impression that she was really down mentally in this film, so if Margaret Nelson didn't play herself then she was already back then (1975) a very capable young (19 years old back then) character actress. Where art thou, oh Spielberg and Co.? By the way, talk about individuals searching for missing people, or people gone amiss on vacational trips, it's not as unlikely as some critics bemoan. Think of Micheal Rockefeller, the missing Australian prime minister or the teenage boy who went missing on the famous Venezuelan Tepuis table mountains some years ago, which are evaded since then by the locals or a disappeared little girl in Germany or so some years ago found dead by a local searching for her who was neither a police officer nor related to her, just some random private person moved by the television news. And one final point: Once against concerning the lack of plot. If a movie seems to be headed into a mysterious direction, where probably the mystery can't be resolved in a 'normal', or let's say physically possible way, where it becomes obvious that this film turns to be fantasy or science fiction, then anyone who sees this film has to ask 'what kind of special effects could there be in an Australian film from 1975?' - None I would say, which somehow anticipates a not too visually outstanding or stunning ending with aliens coming for pretty earthling blondes, or ghosts killing them or some outlaws abducting them, Ned Kelly was long dead since then after all, wasn't he, and what kind of (other) outlaws still existed in 1900 rural Australia, I wouldn't know, maybe a bunch of dingos or carnivorous kangaroos. Some years ago there was a funny spoof where the alternative ending was that 'Edith', not disappeared and wider than taller member of the group of girls went missing was accused of having eaten her peers. By the way, doesn't an unclear ending make a sorry more interesting than a happy ending? Maybe people who only watch American Hollywood movies are just accustomed to happy endings, but at least in French cinema movies have quiet often a ambiguous or even 'sad' ending where the main characters and heroes don't survive or if so in a pitiful state. Why should there always be a happy or clear ending? Doesn't happen in the real world either. People disappear in real life without a trace and are never found, why not also in a movie? Short meaning to a long text: Watch and enjoy this film without prejudgments.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
192,tooelemountains,The mystery of Hanging Rock was...,1,31 May 2018,"... in real life one of the most fascinating enigmas that so many people wonder about down to this day. The story has been told before in book and film, all of which were of great interest to me. The story of Hanging Rock picknic was done superbly by Peter Weir in 1975. And there was a captivating movie several years before that. In this version everyone is a little or a lot creepy and somewhat degenerate. I do believe it is a really obscene attack upon the characters of the real people who actually lived out this fascinatingly dramatic incident. Over on Amazon Prime, Amazon has cut off all reviews because they were so bad and Amazon became suspicious there was some campaign against this series. But there wasn't, it's just that this series really is that awful.Unfortunately the people who actually lived out the real incident so long ago are not around to complain that the producers of this series wanted to make it sensational. They went too far, too dark, and way too sick. Instead of attracting interest by sensationalizing the story, they bore viewers with constant, mind numbing, and relentless perversity.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
193,peterm-77945,Landmark Australian film,10,1 August 2015,"Peter Weir's wonderfully evocative and atmospheric film, about the 19th century disappearance of four schoolgirls in the Australian bush, covers issues of Victorian repression, beauty and Aboriginal magic among other things. Probably still Australia's best film and for many years my favourite. The film is slow and dreamy, yet with a strong narrative. This film is a landmark in the history of Australian film-making: it was our first successful art-house film, it was our most sophisticated attempt at cinema to that time, it marked a radical departure from the bush yarns of the 40s and 50s, and from the raucous comedies and rough action flicks of the early 70s, and led to a renaissance in Australian cinema.",Picnic at Hanging Rock
194,Brendan4000,Where can I get soundtrack?,8,3 February 2006,"This was an interesting movie with a great, strange soundtrack. Does anyone know where I can find/buy it?? Please email me at Brendan4000@aol.com. I have scoured the internet, etc., to no avail. I know I could probably buy a bunch of Zamphir CDs until I found the right songs, but I wanted the true soundtrack. As for what happened in the movie, I believe that the the kid attacked the women. He is seen staring at the women, transfixed by them. As they walk away, the movie shows him leaving his work and walking towards them, then cuts suddenly. Then later, as if he felt guilty about what he had done, he goes back to look for them. From a criminalist point of view it seems obvious that he sexually attacked the poor ladies up on the rock. But I know people want to believe something mystical happened. The woman were turned into swans, transported through time, etc. Thanks!!!",Picnic at Hanging Rock
