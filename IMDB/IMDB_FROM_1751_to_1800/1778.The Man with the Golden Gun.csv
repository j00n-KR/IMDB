0,TheLittleSongbird,"One of the better Roger Moore Bond movies, but not the best of the franchise-still a solid movie",7,1 November 2009,"The Man With the Golden Gun is a fun James Bond movie. While not my favourite of the Bond franchise, it is one of the better Bond movies with Roger Moore in the title role. The film does have its slow parts, the plot isn't quite as tight as it could have been and the script isn't quite as well constructed as previous Bond outings due to some of the slapstick humour that didn't quite work. On the plus side, it is fun and is better than its reputation certainly. It is hugely benefited by the beautiful exotic locations, and Maud Adams is stunning here. So is Britt Eckland. The stunts are neatly executed, and the performances are brisk and solid. Roger Moore doesn't quite have the charisma and flair of Sean Connery, but gives a convincing enough portrayal of our favourite special agent, that makes Geoge Lazenby think ""Now I know where I went wrong"". Scaramanga is one of the more interesting Bond villains and is played with crisp efficiency by the majestic Christopher Lee, and Herve Vilechaize is certainly a scene stealer as henchman Nick Nack. And the music is outstanding. Overall, a very good movie, that is well worth watching for the locations and Lee's performance. 7/10 Bethany Cox",The Man with the Golden Gun
1,bkoganbing,A Crack At The Champ,6,6 July 2009,"About halfway through watching The Man With The Golden Gun I realized that Ian Fleming just might have gotten his inspiration for the novel that this film is based on from Ed Wood. If you remember the gizmo that the aliens were trying to stop the humans from developing was a device that would convert energy from solar light. An absolutely unheard of thing at the time except from the fertile imagination of Ed Wood in Plan Nine From Outer Space. Of course The Man With The Golden Gun is done with a lot more dollars and lots more style than poor Ed Wood's masterpiece.An international killer named Scaramanga played by Christopher Lee who worked mostly for the Communists, but now freelances at a million dollars a contract wants the device. But he also wants a crack at another guy whom he feels is his only competition in the killing field. None other than Roger Moore as 007. So not only does he steal the device and murder its developer Richard Loo in the process, but he also kidnaps Bond girl Britt Eklund and that's always an inducement for James Bond to go into the path of danger.Lee has another score to settle with Bond, it seems as though Bond went and Bondified his mistress Maud Adams. That is completely unacceptable.It's a James Bond film which follows the accepted parameters that James Bond films usually do. One thing that was different was that Roger Moore did not rely on the usual gadgets that British Intelligence provides in most films. Just as well because it does come to a battle of wits between two well matched opponents.",The Man with the Golden Gun
2,Leofwine_draca,"Weak for Moore, but still enjoyable",6,21 August 2016,"This second outing for Roger Moore's Bond is a slightly bloated, overlong film packed with far too much in the way of exposition and dialogue and far too little in the way of any decent action, aside from one major car chase occurring about halfway through. The silly antics are spoiled by grievous mistakes (the jaw-dropping comedy sound effect during the 360 degree car jump totally ruining the excitement of the moment, turning a truly memorable and dangerous stunt into nothing more than a juvenile cartoonish joke) and some ill-judged attempts at humour which feel out of place and unnecessary. The plot itself is rather good and offers one of the most interesting villains in the whole Bond series, a man akin to Bond yet on the opposite side of the good/evil spectrum.Once again there are some nice locations to look at, Macau and Thailand here being the main setting for the action. Some kung fu antics and a minor martial arts tournament-style battle enliven the otherwise leaden pacing about halfway through, a sequence followed by a fun speedboat chase and the welcome reappearance of Sheriff J.W. Pepper from LIVE AND LET DIE, a racist red neck caricature so overdone that it's unbelievable! Unfortunately as the film slowly moves towards the finale, any excitement and inventiveness seems to have gone out of the window, instead we see director Guy Hamilton rehashing moments of brilliance from GOLDFINGER and others. The finale, taking place in a carnival fun house, is a severe letdown and highly anticlimactic. The theme tune by Lulu is also one of the worst I've heard.The casting offers up some nice choices; Christopher Lee as the villainous Scaramanga is excellent in the part, fleshing out his character no end and making him a highly interesting contrast to Bond; unfortunately his midget henchman Nick Nack (as played by the slightly seedy Herve Villechaize) is more annoying than menacing and has far too much screen time. Lois Maxwell returns for a cameo as Moneypenny, Bernard Lee has a little more (welcome) screen time than previously and it's good to have Desmond Llewellyn back as Q, even if it is for only a short period. Minor but familiar players include Soon-Tek Oh as Lieutenant Hip, James Cossins as British agent Colthorpe and Marne Maitland as one of Bond's contacts. Glamour content comes from Britt Ekland, saddled with a rather boring character and much more fun in THE WICKER MAN, and the truly gorgeous Maud Adams as a femme fatale. Being a major Roger Moore fan, I found his performance to be spot on once more. Worth a watch for fans of the series but generally a minor disappointment even when compared to films that I love but others dislike, such as A VIEW TO A KILL.",The Man with the Golden Gun
3,SnoopyStyle,Great locations and Hervé Villechaize,7,19 December 2013,"Scaramanga (Christopher Lee) is an assassin for hire at a million dollars per hit. He leaves a bullet indicating Bond is on his hit list. He is suspected of killing 002, and Bond goes to track him down.This is the second Roger Moore Bond movie. It is a slicker affair than his first. It has quite a few exotic Far East locations. And how can I not love Hervé Villechaize as the evil side kick? It's a rather simple story. It's more of a detective story as he tracks down Scaramanga while sexing up Maud Adams and Britt Ekland. One thing this Bond movie lacks is a lot of big action. When the action does come, it's usually just your basic shootouts or hand to hand combat. It's a departure from the Bond formula. This is much more of a cat and mouse game. There is a big car chase with a real fun Evel Knievel jump and the comedic return of Pepper (Clifton James) as he crosses path with Bond.",The Man with the Golden Gun
4,Horst_In_Translation,Certainly has its good moments,6,24 April 2020,"""The Man with the Golden Gun"" is a British movie that runs for slightly over two hours and was released back in 1974, which makes it over 45 years old now already. It was actor Roger Moore's second turn as Bond and I'd say that quality-wise it is about as good as his first, maybe minimally inferior. The first was mostly about Blacks and here 007 dives into the world of Asians, so certainly many foreign cultures again in here too. Still I must say that it is not even close to being as good as Connery's Asian-themed Bond if you want to call it that. I mean Moore does not even have any Asian Bond girl in here and the one in the pool does not really count, despite her name. The area where the film elaborates nicely on the Asian impact is martial arts, sumo and whatever is fought at that school. Anyway, as for the basics: The director is Hamilton and the writers are Maibaum and Mankiewicz and all three of them have worked on several Bond movies. Of course, it is all based on Ian Fleming's work, but everybody knows that. Let me elaborate a bit on the typical Bond components: As for the Bond girls, I would agree with most people who think that Ekland and Adams despite being attractive portray characters that are definitely not considered among the Bond girls everybody remembers, even if the name Goodnight is pretty cool. Q is in this film too, portrayed by Llewelyn obviously, and he was missing entirely from Moore's first Bond, so it is good to have him back, even if it feels a bit strange I must say because his role is very different compared to what it is usually like. He is basically just standing around and watching when Bond's boss talks to him about the mission at hand. Technical gadgets or ideas are not a part of this film. But well, at least he is back. In terms of Bond's helpers: Due to the location, there is no Leiter this time, but an Asian fella who helps Bond. Well, I found him really forgettable too. With the exception of one scene when he is in the car with Bond and he has his two nieces with him and that ""Mitnichten."" comment from Bond is like the funniest moment in Bond history. The epitome of a brilliant play on words, even in the dubbed German version I saw, although I believe there is no way they could have topped this in the original. You can definitely say that Moore's take on the role is still comedic in a way or at least more comedic than most other Bond actors' takes, but this one here is maybe the one that includes the least fun moments from Moore's 007 outings. Not because they were unfunny, but simply because they were not really going for it this time.Now many people say that they do not like this film too much because the main antagonist mentioned in the title overshadows Bond on many occasions and I would not disagree with this statement. Christopher Lee is really as good as it gets here and had I rated him, I would have given 4 stars out of 5 probably. Scaramanga is truly captivating, also without his third nipple, which was an interesting inclusion though looking at how this is the man's only imperfection basically. And even when Bond tries to use said imperfection to his favor, he is almost killed. By Nick Nack that is. But again, even if they have Bond unconscious, they mess things up anyway. The result is the scene at the den though, this fighting school, and it's alright they did because this is a fun scene too looking at how Bond takes care of one guy especially who is really nothing but a showpony as we find out. Back to Nick Nack, he is played by Hervé Villechaize and I found it interesting how his master here is a British actor playing a Hispanic character. And in his trademark show afterwards, for which he got cast most likely because of this movie, there is actually a Hispanic actor playing his master. I am of course talking about Ricardo Montalbán. Anyway, Nick Nack is the biggest helper to the main antagonist here and as such he gets the final scene from the movie, just like the guy with the metal arm does in Moore's first turn as Bond. Nice tradition. And that scene was pretty funny honestly with Nick Nack constantly running around and being chased by Bond. He sure was not too happy that he did not get the island now that Scaramanga was dead. I must say I really liked the way how Bond posed as the statue and got Scaramanga this way. That was nicely done. I generally liked the overall idea of this cabinet, which is Scaramanga's hunting ground. This made up a bit for the other plot of the movie that elaborated on the financial advantages for Scaramanga and why he was doing what he was doing. Anyway, I could write a lot more about this villain. Such a shame that after his introduction, he was missing for a full hour basically. But he made more than up for it in the end, also with the quote when he is on the phone saying that Bond will not be leaving the island. Good stuff! Lee definitely nailed the part, also for example how he opens the bottle with his perfect shot. I think that Scaramanga was not too different to Bond compared to the antagonists 007 is up against in other films. Both have massive egos, want to be the number one, love women, the sweet life etc. and are somewhat lone wolves you could say, even if Moore probably did not portray Bond in a way like that as much as Craig does. Soon did. But there is a rivalry for sure. It was almost unexpected to see Bond not amused when the Bond girl says towards the end that she could easily stay on the island forever because he values himself more than he values Scaramanga.As for the women in here, they are sometimes treated in a way that female rights advocates would definitely not be too happy about. Just take the scene in which Bond gets crucial information out of one female character and there is some violence involved, even if he says he does not enjoy it and does not want to do it again. Or how Bond has sex with one woman in his hotel room while the other is in the closet in the same room. It's a bit chauvinistic, but well I am actually glad people back then didn't mind. People are like that. Characters are like that. Nobody is complaining either when in Tarantino films characters die every 10 minutes. Or at least they shouldn't. Alright, back to the movie at hand: Some more words about Goodnight. She actually manages to take out the bad guy's muscle guy at the end. That was not expected because she does not seem to be the most capable at/despite her job. Then again, the way she does she blows up the entire island. 'Nuff said. Her name also results in more male-centered comedy when Bond says her name to his boss and ends the conversation in the very last shot. Before that, there were already sexual comments about an erection and an orgasm in a pretty fun manner. I loved how politically incorrect the film was from that perspective. Cheeky moments right before we see Nick Nack up there. So maybe there is actually more comedy in this film than I initially said there was. I can only say I enjoyed it. Pepper (James) is also back again from the last film, but he did not turn into a recurring character and this was his last performance in a Bond movie. Then again, the ride in the car, especially the really comedic Evel Knievel jump, was spectacular enough and a nice way to say goodbye.Oh yeah, as for the title: the mention of ""Gold"" is nothing unusual at all. There was Goldfinger before that and there is Goldeneye later on. I like it. Also says a lot about the main antagonist in here who is pretty memorable if the movie is named after him, but then again, this was more of a thing back then than it is today. Just look at Dr. No. And there is focus on guns in the title too. This is also interesting because we find out a bit about Bond's gun as well and how it is a pretty distinguished choice, even if it is not golden. Definitely more focus on firearms than on drinks or cars in here. Not too usual for Bond. Normally he just uses guns, but never talks about them. There is even a duel in here (the old-fashioned way), even if it is not handled the traditional manner with one coming out alive. Or well, it is, but the action afterwards moves to the most special location this film has to offer. I still wonder how loyal Nick Nack was to his master with what he said to Bond and if it was just make-believe. Is he an opportunist? You decide. Also this was a bit of a progressive Bond, definitely for 1974, with the elaboration on solar energy and also one statement about the consequences of smoking. There is this other guy who gets shot by Scaramanga and he is basically in it for the money / organized crime plot. He was alright, but his story never really gained steam and was perhaps the weakest aspect of the movie. Overall, it is nonetheless a fairly enjoyable film and also does not get worse on fifth rewatch I am sure. If you like Bond, that is. I know I do. It is not one of my most or least favorite 007 films, but there is no hesitation for me in giving this one a thumbs-up. The song I like too. Cannot agree with most others who think it's nothing special, but I guess it is pretty telling that Lulu is never really thought of when there is discussion about Bond song performers. Maybe by now more people even remember her Ronan Keating duet. Anyway, people who say this is a contender for Moore's worst Bond are a bit too harsh I guess. Or even if they think so, they should still say it is a good movie nonetheless because they all are. It's tough to come up with flaws here. Maybe a bit strange that Scaramanga sees Bond as such a rival and has this imitation of Bond in his headquarter and yet he is not even the one who sent the golden bullet. Also a great choice as a declaration of war by the way. Very metaphoric. Okay, as you see I like this movie and I will finish now because the character limit is approaching. I think you should watch this one. One final interesting thingey: Take a look at Sonny Caldinez' other film appearances. Bye.",The Man with the Golden Gun
5,mark.waltz,"A roller-coaster, fun house merry-go-round of a very funny Bond. Give me Moore!",7,30 July 2017,"There will always be debates over who was the best Bond, and I cannot come up with an answer that would settle the argument for the billions of fans. I grew up seeing Sean Connery on TV and Roger Moore in the movies. I like to think of each of them as different men named James Bond, perhaps cousins, both going into the same profession or having the same alias, or each be working in an alternate universe. With the recent death of Roger Moore, I'm starting once again to revisit the series, finding Connery to be more action based (with women and martini's on the side) and Moore playing Bond as if he was a 70's version of Cary Grant, mixing action in with the martinis and women and including some wonderful verbal comedy and a dab of farce.In his second stint as James Bond, he's traveling around to find the assassin who may or may not be out to kill him. This takes him all over the world, locations I won't mention because it's too much fun to discover those yourself. What I will reveal is that Moore pretty much turns the entire world into his own version of Six Flags, whether chasing (or being chased) down an exotic canal, being pestered by a kid selling ivory elephants (and getting rid of him in the most amusing way) and later driving along with tourist Clifton James who seems straight out of ""The Dukes of Hazard"" and gets his share of laughs with some stereotypical hick humor.Then, there's the villains, or the presumed ones, in this case, Christopher Lee and diminutive Herve Villichaize (""Fantasy Island"") who has a few surprising moments of his own. The women are varied and many, covering many different nationalities, and the sexuality of the film is handled with class and humor. Moore gets his hands filled with more than just the villains and women, at one point dealing with a sumo wrestler in a very private area, and even getting to disguise himself with a third nipple. This is a lot of fun from start to finish, and I remember now why back in my youth, a new Bond film always meant a trip to the cinema, back when you didn't need aspirin to deal with excessive noisy sound effects.",The Man with the Golden Gun
6,classicsoncall,"""Do you always take a shower with a pistol?""",7,17 December 2018,"As a product of their times, I'm finding the early James Bond films to be real campy and the stories not as credible as I thought they might have been. Having just started watching the franchise in order, I'm coming across more goofy elements than I thought I would, like the character of Sheriff J.W. Pepper (Clifton James) in this and the prior movie of the series, ""Live and Let Die"". Gee, if he isn't just plain embarrassing to watch in these pictures. I have no idea why the film makers thought it would be a good idea to have such a clueless redneck character in their movies.Now on the flip side, I don't think you could have called for two more stunning Bond girls than Maud Adams as Miss Andrea Anders, and Britt Ekland as Miss Goodnight. Although it didn't seem very realistic that in a real life tough spot like Bond (Roger Moore) and Miss Goodnight found themselves in near the end of the picture, that she would be running around in a skimpy bikini trying to outwit the bad guy Scaramanga (Christopher Lee). Not complaining mind you, but it seems like she might have gotten a little drafty after a while.I didn't know Hervé Villechaize ever portrayed a Bond villain, so that was a bit of a surprise for this viewer. It looked like he was pretty much doing a tryout here for his role as Tattoo in the 'Fantasy Island' television series that came out a few years later. It would have really knocked me out if he had exclaimed 'Da plane, da plane!' somewhere during the story, and I did have my eye and ear out for that, but it never came about. Come to think of it, Christopher Lee had a more than passing resemblance to Ricardo Montalban of that same series, he could easily pass for Montalban's brother.Well, superfluous papillas and solex agitators aside, this is a fairly lively flick with the requisite amount of Bond action and fiery explosions. The only thing is, with all the build up of Scaramanga being such a formidable hit-man, the eventual showdown between him and Bond came off as anti-climactic. The genius assassin should have figured that the human James Bond might have considered replacing the mannequin James Bond to gain an advantage. Oh well, can't win them all.Say, have you noticed how many Bond films end up on a boat?",The Man with the Golden Gun
7,gavin6942,One of the More Classic Films,7,13 June 2017,"James Bond (Roger Moore) is led to believe that he is targeted by the world's most expensive assassin (Christopher Lee) while he attempts to recover sensitive solar cell technology that is being sold to the highest bidder.The highs and lows of this film. The high is the casting of Christopher Lee, who always makes a good villain, and it is wonderful that he was able to be part of the Bond franchise. The low is the crappy theme, which some have said is the worst in the entire series. Worst or not, it is far from good. Somewhat redeeming it is the track called ""Hip's Trip"", which was later memorialized by the Prodigy in their song ""Minefields"".While already a good film, it probably grew in stature following the video game ""GoldenEye"", as it really made the golden gun part of popular culture.

9,Tweekums,Silly but fun entry in the Bond series,7,14 March 2012,It is clear from the start that this will be a fairly ridiculous film when a man arrives on a remote island having been hired by a dwarf to kill his boss in a fight that takes place in a surreal funfair! The man fails and Scaramanga; AKA The Man With the Golden Gun lives to assassinate another day. Scaramanga is famed for charging a million dollars per hit and using solid gold bullets and when one of them it sent to M with Bond's number on it looks as if he will be the next victim. Bond decides the best thing to do is find Scaramanga and traces him to Hong Kong. It looks as if Scaramanga is going to succeed when he has a clear shot at Bond's back... instead another man dies; a man Bond had been searching for. The dead man was an expert on solar and it seems that Scaramanga had been working for a Chinese tycoon based in Thailand. Bond follows him there and eventually they meet up but Scaramanga escapes along with Bond's assistant Miss Goodnight and a vital piece of solar energy technology. If Bond is to retrieve it he will have to go to the island and confront Scaramanga in his 'funfair of death'.If you were hoping for something serious you will be sorely disappointed; this entry in the Bond series is probably the most far-fetched to date. If you want a laugh though it is quite fun; Clifton James reprises his role of Sheriff J.W. Pepper from 'Live and Let Die'; here he is on holiday in Thailand and gets caught up in a car chase that features one of the most famous Bond stunts... the corkscrew car jump; which is sadly spoilt by a ridiculous swanee whistle sound effect! There are plenty of 'silly but fun' scenes including two school girls beating up a hoard of people that had been chasing Bond and later on a fight between Bond and a Dwarf! Miss Goodnight is certainly one of the lesser Bond girls; nearly everything the character does makes things worse. While Scaramanga isn't a great Bond villain he is made much better than he could have been due to Christopher Lee's performance.,The Man with the Golden Gun

Pepper), a weak final showdown between Bond and Scaramanga, and one of most inept Bond characters ever in the form of MI6 agent Mary Goodnight (Britt Ekland), who looks good in a bikini, but who clearly has the IQ of a brick.Even the inclusion of some fun kung fu action (I'm a sucker for 70s chop sockey), an absolutely amazing car stunt—a jump across a river via a twisted half-bridge that results in the full rotation of the vehicle before landing—AND my favourite line of dialogue from the entire Bond series ('Tight in all the right places, not too many buttons.') cannot make up for the fact that The Man with the Golden Gun doesn't hit the target as often as one might expect.",The Man with the Golden Gun

After making an inauspicious debut as James Bond in 1973's lackluster ""Live and Let Die"", Roger Moore returns unceremoniously to the iconic role (he isn't sexy--or sexual--enough to fill the bill, squinting his eyes and squirming under pressure like a prep school graduate being reprimanded). Bond travels to the Far East for a face-off against assassin Scaramanga (Christopher Lee, the man with the golden gun as well as three nipples!) and pint-sized henchman Nick Nack (a well-cast Hervé Villechaize), who plan to misuse solar energy for world destruction. Scaramanga is being double-crossed by mistress Andrea Anders (beautiful Maud Adams), while James is assisted by Britt Ekland's incredulous Mary Goodnight. The chase sequences are rote, the jokes (one expanded from ""Die"" involving a redneck sheriff) are unfunny, and Moore (though trim and tanned) isn't wholly convincing as a super agent. The complicated plot (including karate asides and a visually inept funhouse opener) isn't involving, and Guy Hamilton's direction is clearly lacking tension, even more so than in the previous installment. ** from ****",The Man with the Golden Gun
13,JohnHowardReid,A better Bond!,8,27 September 2014,"Aside from a couple of dull stretches, involving of all people, a surprisingly insipid Britt Ekland, this is both an exciting and amusing effort incorporating some great action sequences and a suspenseful, edge-of-the-seat climax which even tops the movie's exciting opening with Marc Lawrence. Admittedly, Bernard Lee's ""M"" is getting a bit too perfunctory, but the other characters are well played (although Richard Loo's voice is a bit odd – maybe it was dubbed). Christopher Lee has a really great time as the villain, and let's not forget the super-lovely Maud Adams. Fortunately, there's not so great an emphasis in this installment on crazy inventions and effects. Indeed, the approach to these standard Bond items is welcomely tongue-in-cheek. Instead, the movie concentrates on the exotic locations in Macau, Honk Kong and Siam, all of which are used as exciting backgrounds for some marvelous chases and action material. Admittedly, the scenes involving the American tourist are a bit heavy-handed but Ossie Morris' sharp deep-focus location photography overcomes much – even the dull work of Ted Moore who obviously photographed the more routine studio interiors. Sets of course are a major asset, as usual, and the music score has plenty of zing. Production values are first-class. Admittedly, Hamilton's direction is no more than competent, but he knows when to give Morris and the location directors their heads – and that's the name of the game!",The Man with the Golden Gun

15,BandSAboutMovies,"Great villain, OK movie",6,9 April 2020,"The fourth and final Bond film directed by Guy Hamilton, The Man with the Golden Gun is everything that was 1974: oil crises and martial arts films. It was seen by some - at the time - as a low point in the series. And it also marks the last Bond film co-produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, as Saltzman would sell his half of Danjaq, LLC, the parent company of Eon Productions, after the release of the film. As a result, this would be the last Bond film for three years until The Spy Who Loved Me.The part of Scaramanga, the killer other side of the coin to Bond, was offered to Jack Palance, but he turned it down. Christopher Lee, Ian Fleming's step-cousin (Fleming had suggested him for the role of Dr. No), would be the man to take the role.He's a killer paid $1 million dollars per hit. Supposedly, he's coming after Bond, but only to throw him off the trail of a MacGuffin called the Solex Agitator. Along the way, Herve Villechaize show up as Scaramanga's miniature henchman Nick Nack, Maud Adams makes her first Bond girl appearance as the villain's mistress Andrea Anders, Britt Eklund shows up as Mary Goodnight and Sheriff J.W. Pepper comes back.When I saw this as a kid, I always thought that Bond defeated his nemesis way too easily. I still feel that way. It's filled with ridiculousness, a low body count and plenty of moments that Moore didn't agree with, like pushing the kid into the water and threatening to break Anders' arms.The theme song by Lulu is alright, but I kind of love that Alice Cooper wanted to do it. His Bond theme is on his album Muscle of Love.",The Man with the Golden Gun
16,Coventry,Bond Bullseye Bond!,5,19 December 2015,"It's such a damn shame that the James Bond movie with the undeniably most fabulous villainous opponent is, in fact, also the James Bond movie with the weakest and most unexciting scenario! The presence of cult monument Christopher Lee – at the height of his incredibly impressive career, moreover – as eccentric hired killer Francisco Scaramanga should have resulted in the one of the greatest and most unforgettable 007 movies in the entire franchise! At least, that's what I assumed, but in reality it's one of the dullest Bond flicks with far too many pointless dialogs, too few bombastic stunt sequences, too many pitiable attempts for comical reliefs, an almost complete lack of flamboyant gimmicks and totally uninteresting supportive characters! There's something terribly wrong with the script if the evil sidekick is a dwarf with a thick French accent and the sexiest Bond girl is a degraded assistant Special Agent! James Bond is alarmed when a golden bullet with ""007"" carved in it arrives in an envelope at London headquarters. This is the trademark of the notorious hit man Scaramanga and it basically means that he has marked Bond for execution. 007 wants to remain one step ahead of Scaramanga and travels to the Far East, where the hit man was last active. It turns out that Scaramanga is less interested in murdering James Bond than he is in stealing a hi-tech solar energy device and blackmailing the world leaders. The best things about ""The Man with the Golden Gun"" – apart from its lovely title – are Lee's impeccably stoic performance and the downright fantastic use of breath-taking filming locations and masterful set pieces. Scaramanga's lair, for example, is located on beautiful Private Island where he has his own crazy theme park in which he invites enemies to take a shot at him. Maud Adams stars as Scaramanga's reluctant mistress who inevitably prefers the charms of James Bond and gets punished for it. A quite remarkable little trivia items is that Mrs. Adams was cast again in another Bond movie nearly a decade later, as the titular character Octopussy. Christopher Lee literally owns the screen in every scene he appears, but unfortunately it's not enough. The script briefly hints at his character's past, being the son of traveling circus artists, but this intriguing sub plot isn't elaborated at all.",The Man with the Golden Gun

It stars Roger Moore, Christopher Lee, Britt Ekland, Maud Adams, Herve Villechaize, Soon-Taik-Oh, Richard Loo and Clifton James. Music is scored by John Barry and cinematography by Ted Moore & Oswald Morris.Bond 9 and 007 is distracted from his pursuit of the Solex Agitator when it appears he has been targeted for death by famous assassin Francisco Scaramanga.This would be the last Bond movie to be produced by the partnership of Broccoli and Saltzman, the latter of which was the one to leave. Perhaps they fought about what direction Moore's Bond should be taking? Because The Man with the Golden Gun is not a fitting film for them to part on, their fall out most likely impacting on why this is a pretty unadventurous entry in the James Bond franchise. The film plays more as a slapstick comedy than an action adventure. The script is uninspired, with the characters of Mary Goodnight (Ekland) and Sheriff Pepper (James) reaching new lows for Bond allies, while some of the situations that arise are just bizarre and lazy. The latter statement of which applies big time to the weak finale.However, even average Bond films have value somewhere in the mix. Here there's some grit in Moore's performance and Lee's Scaramanga is one of the series' most interesting villains. Maud Adams is given a good character to work from, her Andrea Anders is intriguing and very much a live wire in the plot, it's a good performance that would see Adams rewarded with the lead lady role in Octopussy (1983). Villechaize's Nick Nack, Scaramanga's right hand man/helper is a unique villain, though this is spoilt somewhat by a daft final confrontation with Bond. There's a brilliant car stunt performed by Bumps Willard, done in one take, it alone deserved to be in a better film.Elsewhere. Barry is back on musical score duties, providing an Oriental tinted arrangement. Sadly Lulu's title theme song is instantly forgettable and lyrically feels like it was written in 5 minutes. Locations are sumptuous, with Macau, Hong Kong and Thailand put to great use by the team, and the gadgetry is kept to minimum which allows us to enjoy the one or two inventive modes of transport used within the piece. The box office was $98 million, a considerable take for sure but still some $63 million down on the previous Bond adventure. With critics and fans considering the film a let down, questions were again raised as to if Bond was loosing his appeal? With Saltzman, Hamilton and Mankiewicz bowing out of the franchise, would there be a turnaround in Bond's fortunes? Would Moore finally get a script and film to test him? 6.5/10",The Man with the Golden Gun

Maybe that explains why I`m not a great Bond fan . Having familiarised  myself with the Bond series in later life it`s easy to see that THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN is one of the poorest Bond films , Moore makes a weak Bond , Britt Ekland plays a bimboesque Bond girl ,  the script is silly AND boring and Guy Hamilton doesn`t come close to the heights he reached in GOLDFINGER. I really get the impression that the film would have been so much better if the producers had stuck to the book and had Sean Connery back.

Moore had already perfected this kind of hero in his ""The Saint"" roles on TV, whereby he had some quick one-liners as he outwitted various enemies. He's doing the same here as Bond and doing nicely in the action scenes as an additional requirement.There are the usual car chases (very colorful one through the streets of Bangkok), the usual assortment of dangerous females with BRETT EKLUND being the dominant one, the usual gadgets to be used in a fight to the finish, and the usual spectacular stunts (this time one involving an almost unbelievable leap in a car), and the usual villains standing in the way of order and justice.I have no complaints about this one. ROGER MOORE was always very acceptable as James Bond and seemed to get better with each film. This was only his second time out as Bond and he did improve later on--but that's no reason to complain, as others have done.

23,zardoz-13,Not As Good As Later Moore Bonds!!!,7,10 June 2014,"The ninth entry in the James Bond film franchise, director Guy Hamilton's ""The Man with the Golden Gun,"" isn't a top-notch, 007 caper, but packs enough spectacle and humor to pass muster. This loosely-handled Ian Fleming adaptation involves a former KGB assassin and the Chinese have a peripheral role in the proceeding. Francisco Scaramanga (Christopher Lee) is out to harass solar power when he isn't counting his million-dollar fee per assassination. Bond finds himself drawn into the fracas when he receives one of Scaramanga's golden bullets with 007 engraved in it. The sights are as scenic as the women as sexy and the stunts are suitably far-fetched. Bond runs afoul of Sheriff J.W. Pepper again while in the orient and he discovers where British Intelligence has its new headquarters in Hong Kong. The plot amounts to a cut and paste affair with one of the girls sending Bond the bullet rather than the villain. Eventually, after the usual round of heroic stunts, Bond finds himself squaring off against the assassin in a remote island paradise. Tom Moore's cinematography is flawless. Like its forerunner ""Live and Let Die,"" ""The Man with the Golden Gun"" was okay, but nothing like the rest of the Roger Moore epics that followed. The elaborate car stunt with a car leaping across a gap between two bridges is spectacular. The film is bookended with scenes of 007 dueling in a carnival setting. Christopher Lee makes a terrific villain, but pitting Bond against pint-sized Hervé Villechaize is short-sighted. The theme song isn't as good as the others, but John Barry's orchestral soundtrack is flawless. The jokes fly thick and fast. The scene where Bond swallows a bullet that he gobbles form the navel of a dancer is hilarious. This Bond adventure is just too low-brow in many instances. The next James Bond movie ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" was far better.",The Man with the Golden Gun

This Bond adventure is one of the least likaeble and even slightly boring.I don't know what it is that makes this Bond movie so uninteresting to watch. Maybe it's the lack of a good Bond girl or villain that has a plan to destroy or take over the world. Or maybe it's because the movie lacks some typical Bond moments that all the other Bonds are filled with. But fact is that this Bond is nowhere as good as others.Still this Bond flick has one interesting thing: Christopher Lee. Nevertheless it stays very unfortunate that a man like Christopher Lee had to be in one of the weakest Bonds. I must also admit that I liked Hervé Villechaize as Nick Nack, who is one of the few memorable things about the movie.Like I said before; The movie lacks some typical Bond moments, with the exception of Bond at the fighting school which was the only scene that gave me a ""Bond feeling"".

Huh?Unfortunately, one then has to add in the regrettable tendency towards misplaced humour which always found its way into the Moore Bonds, at its worst here in the spiral car bridge jump - an absolutely stunning car stunt, given a sound effect of a swannee whistle.

Essentially, the world's #1 assassin named ""Scaramanga"" (Christopher Lee) has sent a golden bullet to James Bond indicating that he is his next target. So rather than waiting around for Scaramanga to choose the time and place James Bond decides to find him first. This leads him to Beirut, Macao, Hong Kong and Bangkok in an attempt to find information that might be helpful in that regard. Now, rather than reveal the rest of the story I will just say that this movie does a good job of combining both action and comedy. As a matter of fact, I think this is probably the most humorous James Bond film ever made as it features nifty one-liners from James Bond along with ""Sheriff J. W. Pepper"" (Clifton James) and a midget named ""Nick Nack"" (Herve Villechaize). It also features two quite attractive women in Maud Adams (as Scaramanga's mistress, ""Andrea"") and Britt Ekland (as ""Agent Goodnight"").

'It's a 74 sir..........',7,5 March 2015,"Bond must find the missing ""Solex Agitator,"" a device that will harness the sun's radiation and give great power to whomever possesses it. But also aiming for the prize is Scaramanga, a world-class assassin who brandishes a distinctive golden gun. When 007 discovers he is to be Scaramanga's next target, he is hurled into a deadly game of cat-and-mouse, continuing the search as he evades the killer on his trail. Bond must also contend with Scaramanga's lover, Andrea Anders, and Nick Nack, whose small size belies his lethal abilities. Even as 007 enlists the aid of Mary Goodnight, he must overcome ferocious odds to survive on Scaramanga's remote island.......If there was ever a Bond movie to prove that Moore had his tongue firmly in cheek when making his mark as the secret agent, this is the one. It's not brilliant by any means, and compared to the more classic Bonds, its laughable, but my word, its a lot of fun.Everyone is having a ball making this, it has one of the most psychedelic pre credits sequences, a rare one that doesn't feature actual Bond, and Scaramanga is a wonderful villain, not because of his goals or ambitions, it's just that Lee gives the character a little more panache than he deserves.But, seeing the film 41 years after its initial release, it's pretty sad to see just how misogynistic the film is, and how politically incorrect he film is toward Nick Nack, who also in turn, is one of the best Henchman ever in the series.But you can forgive its shortcomings, it was a long time ago, and it was acceptable then, but who cannot love a film with a flying car, the best stunt ever in a Bond film, a genuinely tense finale, and of course a girl called Chew Mee.If it took itself more seriously, it would have failed, the maguffin is too bonkers for its own good, and Scaramanga, his home, his playroom, are all just too bonkers for seriousness.A fun film.

30,Aaron1375,Christopher Lee as Scaramanga my personal fave Bond villain,8,22 November 2002,"Yes, of all the Bond villains in the over twenty films, Christopher Lee is by far my favorite. This is probably due to the fact I enjoy seeing Lee in general. He also does one of his best acting jobs here, it just seems he is utterly thrilled to be in this film and that he is happy to not being Dracula again. Of course, despite the fact that Lee is my favorite Bond villain and Roger Moore does great as Bond here and most of the cast do a wonderful job it still does not rank as one of my favorite Bond films. This is mainly due to the fact I just think they could have crafted a better story around the assassin whose skill set matches Bond and they could have and should have omitted a return character from the previous Roger Moore film. Of course, this film also boasts the return of Q as he was absent from Live and Let Die. So all in all a good Bond film, but had they done some different things with the story it could have been one of the best.The story has Bond being sent a bullet made of gold. This bullet may be a warning that he is the next target of Scaramanga, the man with the golden gun. He is a feared assassin and with Bond being in his sights M has no choice but to take Bond off his assignment; however, he hints that Bond should go out and find the assassin first thus improving his odds for survival greatly. Bond soon finds himself in Hong Kong where he soon learns that he is not Scaramanga's target and that a solar energy device is at the center of everything.This film has some good action in it and some great scenes, but as I said, they could have crafted a better story around the man with the golden gun. They also did not need to have a return performance from J. W. Pepper. Sure his character made perfect sense in the previous film, as it was set in Louisiana, but this time we're in Hong Kong...I seriously doubt a redneck sheriff is going to want to vacation in Hong Kong. Also, it makes little sense that Bond goes, ""Oh no"" when he sees the sheriff as he had virtually no interaction with Bond in Live and Let Die. Pepper ruins what should have been an awesome car chase scene with his lame humor and he just drags the film down.Overall, I enjoyed this film. Seeing Lee's Scaramanga and Moore's Bond interact is the best parts of this film as Lee seems more than happy to be a Bond villain. The Bond girls are attractive and Herve's henchman Nick Nack is also a nice character. Just a shame they had so many good characters, but they just could not make the story considerably stronger. The film does feature some nice action sequences, but a couple of times they are undercut by everyone's favorite sheriff. Still, it was a nice second film for Roger Moore as Bond as by now he seems like a veteran of several Bond films.",The Man with the Golden Gun

Traveling from Beirut to Macau, China, to Bangkok, Thailand, he aims to confront the assassin while recovering sensitive solar cell equipment. Hervé Villechaize is on hand as Scaramanga's little assistant, Nick Nack.""The Man with the Golden Gun"" (1974) was Moore's second outing as Bond. He did 7 films for the franchise in 13 years from 1973-1985. Moore's stint is my favorite run in the series with all seven films being kinetic, amusing, scenic and just all-around entertaining. There's not one clunker in the bunch and they were all profitable at the box office, but this one kinda got lost between the cracks of ""Live and Let Die"" (1973) and ""The Spy who Loved Me"" (1977).Director Guy Hamilton made three prior Bond films, ""Live and Let Die,"" ""Diamonds are Forever"" (1971) and ""Goldfinger"" (1964), and wanted 007 to be more rough around the edges in this movie, like he is in Ian Fleming's book. As such, Moore's acting seems more ""tough"" here than his other Bond entrees; for instance, the way he treats Andrea (Maud Adams) in the arm twisting scene. But Moore didn't like playing the character this way and toned it down for the rest of his installments.There's picturesque Asian globetrotting, with the Thailand islands being particularly scenic (standing in for ""Red Chinese waters""). On the female front, there's Agent Mary Goodnight played by Britt Ekland, who looks great in a floral bikini during the last reel. There's also the aforementioned Adams as Andrea and a cameo by Chew Mee. Memorable moments include an entertaining martial arts academy sequence; the amusing return of redneck Sheriff JW Pepper (Clifton James), who's vacationing in Bangkok with his wife; a great car-jumping stunt; and Scaramanga's secret solar power plant operation.The film runs 2 hours, 5 minutes and was shot in Thailand (Phang Nga Bay and Bangkok) and Hong Kong/ Macau, with additional work done in England.GRADE: B",The Man with the Golden Gun
32,SimonJack,Bond has a shoot-out in this lesser 007 film,7,23 April 2018,"""The Man with the Golden Gun"" is Roger Moore's second film as secret agent 007, James Bond. Much of this story and action takes place in Southeast Asia. Filming locations included Hong Kong, Macau, and Thailand. The story is based loosely on the novel by Ian Fleming. It has the usual world-threatening evil that Great Britain's top MI6 agent must defeat. In this case, it's a device that can harness the sun's power. But it will be used for dastardly purposes of world domination. The world control plot is overlaid with another plot. To get the ""solex"" device, Bond must contend with the world's top assassin, Scaramanga. And he has been hired for one million dollars to kill Bond. He plans to lure Bond into a duel to the death. Naturally, Scaramanga has the golden gun, which uses specially made golden bullets. Besides Christopher Lee in the role of the villain, Britt Ekland, Hervé Villechaize, Clifton James, Maud Adams and others have roles that are part of the action. But the acting across the board doesn't seem that good in this film. Ekland's part, as Mary Goodnight, is minimal at best. She is an MI6 staffer in Asia, but she is mostly wooden in her role. James is the Louisiana Sheriff from the last Bond film, ""Live and Let Die,"" and he and his wife are tourists visiting Hong Kong. When he sees the secret agent who caused so much mayhem back home a few months ago, Sheriff Pepper wants to get in on the action. The humor of the stereotypical Southern sheriff in America works in the U.S., but not so in an Asian setting. Here, he comes off more as an ugly American. This is not one of the more interesting or engaging Bond films. It's a stretch to give it seven stars. But the usual outstanding scenery, location shots, action scenes and film production values save this film from being blah. Here are some favorite lines from the film. For more dialog, see the Quotes section under this IMDb Web page of the movie. James Bond, ""I mean, sir, who would pay a million dollars to have me killed.""

34,ShadeGrenade,Duel in the sun!,8,22 April 2012,"'Live & Let Die' ( 1973 ) established Roger Moore as the new James Bond. But 'The Man With The Golden Gun' opened a year later to poor reviews and none too impressive box office takings. I saw it early in 1975 as part of a double bill with its predecessor. What went wrong? The book was one of Ian Fleming's weakest, admittedly ( published posthumously ), involving Bond being ordered to kill 'Francisco Scaramanga', the world's greatest assassin. Tom Mankiewicz and Richard Maibaum turned this nondescript thug into a far more interesting character, a sort of evil version of Bond himself. When a golden bullet bearing 007's number arrives at the offices of Universal Export in London, Bond is alerted that Scaramanga is on his trail. 'M' ( Bernard Lee ) takes James off his present assignment - to find a missing scientist named 'Gibson' and his invention - the Solex Agitator - which can convert sunlight into power ( the energy crisis was a topical reference ). Bond decides his best course of action is to track down Scaramanga and kill him first. The trouble is, no-one knows what he looks like. His only distinguishing characteristic is a third nipple! A major clue is a bullet which was used to eliminate 002 - 'Bill Fairbanks; - in 1969. It currently resides in the belly button of exotic dancer 'Saida' ( Carmen Sautoy ), who wears it as a lucky charm. Bond goes to Beirut to find her...'Gun' is nowhere near as spectacular as 'Die', and has a rushed look to it, as though it were a made-for-television movie. There are some good stunts - most notably the car racing off a broken bridge, doing a somersault, and landing perfectly on the other side - but these tend to be spoilt by unnecessary gags, in the latter's case it is the annoying sound of a penny whistle. The script had problems too; Bond is attacked in Saida's dressing room by three men, and we never learn who they are, much less why they attacked him. How did 'Andrea' ( Maud Adams ) know where to send the 007 bullet? How does M manage to phone Scaramanga's junk at the end of the picture? After the up-to-date look and feel of 'Die', 'Gun' is a disappointing throwback to the Bond's of the early '60's. It is sad to have to report that John Barry's score is one of the main reasons for this; the opening theme ( sung by Lulu, who later used an instrumental version on her B.B.C. show ) sounds like a bad imitation of 'Goldfinger'. Many elements from the Connery pictures are reinstated; the briefing in M's office, the flirtation with 'Miss Moneypenny' ( Lois Maxwell ), and a return from Desmond Llewellyn as 'Q' ( though the latter is barely needed as he does not supply Bond with any new gadgets, apart from a fake nipple ). If the intention on the producers' part was to put 007 in a 'Enter The Dragon'-type scenario, one wonders why they did not hire Robert Clouse to direct instead of bringing back Guy Hamilton for the third ( and final ) time. His advice to the stars was to play it for laughs. A more serious approach would have been better. Bringing back 'Sheriff Pepper' ( Clifton James ) was another error.Of the cast, Christopher Lee gives one of his best performance as 'Scaramanga'. Fresh from Hammer's 'Dracula' series, he is smooth, deadly, and altogether charming. His favourite gadget is a golden gun which, when not in use, can be dissembled into a lighter, cigarette case, and pen. As he charges a million dollars per kill, he is able to live in luxury - on his own private island in the East. He gets some good lines. After shooting 'Hai Fat' ( Richard Loo ), for instance, he quips: ""He always did like that mausoleum. Put him in it!"". Giving him competition is his diminutive side-kick 'Nick Nack' ( the late Herve Villechaize, best remembered as 'Tattoo' in the 'Fantasy Island' series ), who steals every scene he is in. Britt Ekland does her best with the role of bimbo 'Mary Goodnight', while Maud Adams ( who later played the title role in 'Octopussy' ) smolders as 'Andrea', Scaramanga's mistress, who wants Bond to kill her employer to free her from sexual slavery.'Gun' probably looks better on television. Certainly the shootout in Scaramanga's fun house would have made a great climax to an episode had there been a Bond television series in 1974. It was Harry Saltzman's final outing as Bond producer. From here on, it would be Cubby Broccoli's show. It would be three years before Bond was seen again, in the wonderful 'The Spy Who Loved Me'.",The Man with the Golden Gun
35,JamesHitchcock,Enjoyably Silly,6,20 July 2005,"Roger Moore's second outing as James Bond has one of the most bizarre plots of the entire series. All the Bond films, of course, contain strong elements of fantasy, and none is supposed to be a realistic spy thriller. Most, however, do have a plot that makes sense in its own terms, normally involving a villain who is plotting some evil deed which it falls to Bond to thwart with the assistance of a beautiful young woman. ""The Man with the Golden Gun"", however, has a plot which makes very little sense at all. The villain, Francisco Scaramanga, is a notorious international hit-man who has- seemingly- accepted a contract to kill Bond and sent him a golden bullet to inform him of his intentions. (Do professional hit-men really give their victims warning in this way?) Bond's chief, M, immediately takes him off the assignment he has been working on, but instead of going into hiding Bond leaves for the Far East in an attempt to track Scaramanga down. While there he meets Scaramanga's beautiful mistress Andrea Anders, and becomes embroiled in a complex (and often incomprehensible) intrigue involving a crooked Far Eastern tycoon and a stolen solar energy device. Also contributing to the general air of strangeness are Scaramanga's irritating midget manservant Nick Nack and the weird duel that he forces Bond to fight in a maze.There is, however, much that is enjoyable. The standard of acting, at least in the main roles, is generally high. Roger Moore was generally more convincing in his earlier films than his later ones, and this is one of his better performances. Christopher Lee makes a cool and stylish villain. Scaramanga can be seen as Bond's alter ego; a Bond gone bad, or perhaps what Bond might have become if he had been born on the wrong side of the tracks. (At one stage, Bond- for reasons too complex to go into- actually pretends to be Scaramanga). Like Bond, he is a lover of fine food, good living and beautiful women. Both are first-class shots and both kill for a living. It falls to Bond, however, to point out the essential difference- whereas Bond is a soldier fighting for his country, Scaramanga is a mercenary.The two main female roles are also well played. Maud Adams's Anders is an unusually well developed character for a secondary Bond Girl, and plays an important role in the development of the plot. The main heroine, Mary Goodnight, a British secret agent is brave and determined, but also clumsy and accident-prone, the sort of girl who nearly manages to kill Bond by accidentally pressing the wrong switch with her bikini-clad bottom. Although Britt Ekland's British accent was not quite spot-on, she makes Mary into an endearingly inept figure, playing her largely for laughs. One character (apart from Nick Nack) that I could have done without was J W Pepper, the redneck Louisiana sheriff with the impenetrable accent who rather overstayed his welcome in ""Live and Let Die"" and makes an unnecessary return as an American tourist in Bangkok. (One thing that dates the film is when Pepper reveals himself to be a Democrat- thirty years on Southern rednecks, in the cinema if not in real life, are invariably Republicans).Despite its frequent silliness this is not the weakest of the Bond films; I found it more enjoyable than some of the others. 6/10",The Man with the Golden Gun
36,DKosty123,Moore's Second Bond Mission,7,7 November 2007,"This film has an excellent cast. Brit Ekland & Maud Adams take very good care of the women of Bond here. Christopher Lee is Scaramanga & the first film role for Herve Vellicheze is a complete success as Knick Knack, his servant.While the film has an energy gadget known as a solaxe, the main focus is the meeting of Bond with Scaramanga. This comes off quite well. There are plenty of major stunts & some great location shooting which are quite enjoyable.The stunts are well done & with the strong cast, this is another good outing for Roger Moore.

37,KineticSeoul,Why Roger Moore is the caricature of James Bond,4,4 February 2016,"This is probably the silliest Bond entry compared to the past ones. No, seriously, I couldn't tell if this was suppose to be a comedy or a James Bond movie. It's like they didn't take anything seriously at all. It's like they got the premise down first, which was alright then threw in every bizarre and and lame idea they could think of during Bond's journey. Maybe the filmmakers just didn't really care because they had the license to the ""007"" franchise. Sure, the past James Bond films can be campy, but this one takes it to another level. The main aspect of this movie that saves it from it being one of those ""So bad, it actually kind of good"" category. Is because of Christopher Lee as the main villain Scaramanga. Scaramanga is basically an assassin opposite of James Bond, who instead of hating on Bond like Bond's past villains, he has a mutual respect for him as a fellow assassin. And his plan is to use solar energy for destruction which they don't go in depth with. The true crime for this film is how they made this villain sort of lame by giving him an extra nipple and wasted his potential to be a great villain. Just like how they wasted this films potential by adding in lame and silly elements. The scenes with him and Bond in it is what saves this film from being laughably bad. Seriously, with a title like ""The Man With The Golden Gun"", I was expecting a bit more. There is how silly and lame this film gets, it's just hysterical but there are spoilers so stop reading if you don't want anything spoiled. This film starts out with the first agent getting killed in Scramanga's lair. Which is basically some sort of carnival like area designed like something like the place where you go to play laser tag. His right hand man is a midget that goes by Nick Nack. Then it goes to James Bond almost getting killed in a belly dancer's room to get some action. With the belly dancer more concerned about her perfumes more than anything else during the whole ordeal. Then it goes to James Bond putting on a third nipple before trying to go skinny dipping to disguise himself as Scramanga. Then it goes to James Bond fighting off a Sumo wrestler by grabbing his butt cheeks then twisting the sumo guy's mawashi, then Bond gets knocked out by a midget holding a trident. The it goes to a lame karate choreograph with James Bond fighting in a tournament, to him using bunch of karate chops to win, afterwards he takes a bow then jumps out of a window. Where two girls dressed in some sort of high school uniform backs him up by fighting off the dojo fighters with one of the lamest fight choreography ever on film. When that is finished, it leads to a boat chase scene after James Bond pushes a poor thai boy into the water. Then there is a car jump that seems to be straight out of a comedy or ""The Dukes of Hazzard"". Then it ends with one of the Bond girl accidentally hitting the override button with her butt. At the end there is a fight between the midget Nick Nack and James Bond locking him in a briefcase. After that whole James Bond vs a midget ordeal he goes back to the girl to get some action like he always does. I will say the reviewers that claim this is actually a good James Bond movie, is either saying it to stand out or because they at least found this film to be amusing. Maybe the reviewers that gave this movie a positive review see things that I really don't. James Bond seemed more like a mean bully in this over a cold spy. Overall this really is a pity, James Bond meeting his match or the rivalry aspect of this movie could have made this Bond film stand out for the right reasons. Unfortunately the execution just didn't compliment the premise all that well.4/10",The Man with the Golden Gun
38,OllieSuave-007,Moore's second 007 film is pretty golden!,8,5 March 2014,"This is Roger Moore's second time portraying Agent 007, where he meets hit man Scaramanga (Christopher Lee), aka the Man with the Golden Gun. Bond decides to go track down Scaramanga and find a device that can make harnessing the sun's energy possible. Moore continues to give us his own unique brand portraying James Bond, but staying true to the character with his armor of wits, quick one-liners and cynicism. The action scenes are in abundance, and some exciting car chases, including the one in the streets of Bangkok. Bond had some unforgettable chemistry with Bond girls Goodnight (Britt Eklund) and Andrea (Maud Adams), a trademark role in his seductive yet charming ways with the Bond Girls. Somehow, the writers saw it was fitting to squeeze in the loud-mouth character Sheriff Pepper (Clifton James), whom I thought was out of place for a spy movie. He was borderline annoying, but other more memorable characters like Hip (Soon-Tek Oh) made up for this flaw. And, to cap it off, there is an exciting cat-and-mouse chase leading to the climax of the film, keeping the audience engaged in this two-hour-plus movie. Overall, another descent Bond film, which I thought wasn't as good as the Live and Let Die (the first 007 adventure with Moore), but certainly one to enjoy on a Saturday night.

39,bensonmum2,"""Mr. Bond, bullets do not kill. It is the finger that pulls the trigger.""",6,7 July 2017,"James Bond is called in to help find a solar device that, in the wrong hands, could potentially turn the sun's rays into a lethal weapon. To do so, Bond must deal with a highly paid assassin named Scaramanga. When one of Scaramanga's gold bullets shows up an MI6 headquarters with Bond's name engraved on it, Bond is convinced he's Scaramanga's next target. But what if he can find Scaramanga first? It's off to Macao, Hong Kong, and Thailand to find a potentially dangerous device and an assassin.As much as I love the James Bond franchise, I admit that all Bond films are not created equal. The Man with the Golden Gun is what I call a lesser Bond film. It has its share of strong points that I really enjoy, but there's too much that doesn't work for me to list it among the best. Instead of the normal comments I write, here a laundry list of what does and what doesn't work for me:What works for me:Christopher Lee - In a better Bond film, he would most certainly be remembered as one of the best super-villains that Bond faced. He's got the presence, size, and acting ability to pull it off. Instead, he's forced to play a guy in track suit with three nips who kills people in a carnival funhouse.Nick Nack - Despite his stature, Nick Nack makes for an excellent baddie. He seems to delight in causing harm to others.Maude Adams - I can't think of an actress who played a Bond-girl who did a better job of acting. You can see the fear, hatred, and resentment in her eyes when she's with Scaramanga. It's an outstanding performance. She's easily the standout in the film for me.It's fun - At the end of the day, this is still a James Bond film. Despite all the issues I have with it, The Man with the Golden Gun is still a fun movie that provides some degree of entertainment. It's not perfect, but I still enjoy it.What doesn't work for me:Sheriff Pepper - Why in God's name did they bring him back? Once was bad enough.The comedy - There's way too much comedy (or attempted comedy). Bond's quips are cringy, the school girls defeating the trained karate dudes is stupid, and Britt Ekland's bumbling Goodnight is annoying. (By the way, I really hate that this was the role Britt Ekland was given in the James Bond series. I would have loved to see her given a more traditional Bond girl role.)Ruining a great stunt - The car jump in The Man with the Golden Gun is legendary. Why did they decide to use a slide whistle sound effect as the car jumps the river? Why let a cheap sound effect ruin an uber-cool moment?The plot and flow - I'm going to have trouble explaining this, but here goes - More so than in any other Bond film I can think of right now, the solar device is a true McGuffin. Watching the film again last night, I had to ask myself on several occasions, ""what's the point of all this?"" The main plot line is never really clear. And, the film changes pace about a dozen times. One minute it's a karate movie, while the next it's a madcap chase film. It's jarring.If I had a list of favorite Bond movies (and I'm not sure why I don't'), I'm guessing The Man with the Golden Gun would place in the bottom five or so films. I still rate the movie an above average 6/10, but by Bond standards, that's pretty poor.",The Man with the Golden Gun
40,gridoon,Roger Moore's worst and flabbiest Bond film.,5,21 October 2001,"This is clearly the most languid Bond film ever made - seriously lacking in action and excitement. Most people seem to dislike the addition of sheriff Pepper as a comic-relief character, but at least he participates in the film's liveliest sequence (the car chase) and is broadly funny in a film that otherwise sorely misses the humor and wit that are so evident in other Roger Moore entries (""Octopussy"", ""For Your Eyes Only""). Moore is actually very good and believable in this film, but the other actors don't match him: Christopher Lee isn't given anything interesting to do, and Britt Ekland is a slim but colorless and (may I say) not terribly attractive Bond Girl (bring back Claudine Auger!!)     (**)",The Man with the Golden Gun
41,lost-in-limbo,Boy! Not you again.,6,12 September 2009,"Roger Moore's second outing was a disappointment when I first initially saw it, and again the second time it left me blank. Third time, sadly it's the same story. I didn't dislike it, but mainly remained not all that impressed by it. So much going for it, but it just doesn't seem to click together. You got the iconic Christopher Lee as Bond's main nemesis and Hervé Villechaize as a henchman. Cool. Beautiful bond ladies in Maud Adams and a bubbly Britt Ekland (even though a lot of people seem to pan her performance). Nice. Some well-chosen, wondrously exotic locations. Looks good.Even the story has some fun qualities and brings something new to the table having Bond being a target of a world-class assassin Scaramanga with his golden gun. Soon we both realize there's more too it, as they are both trying to get their hands on the 'Solex Agitator', which is a device that can harness the sun's radiation. The plot plays out like a cat-and-mouse game where Lee stays pretty much in the background pulling the strings that leads Bond on the chase, until the two finally come in concert for their ultimate showdown. Lee perfectly paints it with ""a duel between titans my golden gun against your Walther PPK."" It sounds like I shouldn't be dissatisfied, but as an adventure is seems rather slow-raveling, lacking oomph and low-key with its escapism action. It's more talky than I remembered with less gadgets being used too (which isn't bad at all). Also the annoyingly boisterous comic-relief character of Sheriff Pepper (from the previous Bond 'Live and Let Live') makes an reappearance in a couple sequences and that's the film's most exciting set-pieces too involving a martial arts fight turning into boat chase and an invigorating car pursuit with a spectacular stunt (with the terrible use of a campy sound effect). Having Sheriff Pepper is unnecessary, but I didn't find him as overbearing here. Aside from those moments, it doesn't feel like it's up too all that much even though it's always on the move and the script just seems to miss that sharp-wit favoring clumsy visual humor. There's a lot of killing time with intentions of keeping everything a mystery (with one surprise in the story's direction) and many contrived possibilities show up. Bond films really do rely on conveniences, but on this occasion heavily so.Roger Moore was starting to etch in that permissively laced personality, which was an admirably good Bond performance. Lee's exultant show-in makes you wished there was more for him to do.Far from the best, but no way near the bottom in what is a diverting Bond outing.",The Man with the Golden Gun
42,Lejink,Fool's gold,5,16 January 2011,"Sorry, I'm a Connery man myself, when it comes to what my sister calls Jimmy Bond films. Roger Moore, as has been said before certainly looks more like how you'd expect an ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" agent to look and he certainly gives us debonair and élan. But his Bond is also aloof, staid and stiff even when rhyming off those plentiful one-liners which came to over-clutter his tenure, lacking in passion, humour and even mobility.His looks will always bowl the ladies over but I just can't believe him as a steely-nerved, physically fit killing-machine. It doesn't help in this outing that his main protagonist is a self-confessed mirror-image, only Christopher Lee is older than our hero, further giving the impression of a sell-by date already passed. Even the title song sees a screeching Lulu fail to fill the ample shoes of say, Shirley Bassey.The best thing about the film was the sub-Evel Knievel twisting loop-the-loop car stunt, but too much of the rest of the film seems very second-hand - the shooting gallery prologue and climax is right out of ""The New Avengers"" and the big stunts are redolent of cinematic ""flavours of the month"", ""Enter the Dragon"" and ""Smokey and the Bandit"". Maud Adams and Britt Ekland are two of the less memorable Bond girls and it doesn't help that the fate of the world isn't at stake, coming down to the last few seconds as Bond and Scaramanga square-off at the end.I watched it on a Saturday afternoon and there still aren't many less demanding watches on my TV but Bond is turning safe here and that will never do.",The Man with the Golden Gun
43,bowmanblue,A good blend of Bond,9,28 July 2017,"The Roger Moore Bond era came in for a fair bit of criticism; not only did he have to compete with Sean Connery's interpretation of the superspy, but, by adding more wry humour to the franchise, people saw his films as too comic to be believable. 'The Man With the Golden Gun' is Moore's second outing and I think it's possibly the film that bridges the gap between dark and comic, incorporating elements of both, but never leaning directly towards either.For a start we have no hollowed-out lair for a Persian cat-stroking super villain to reside in. Instead, we simply have a rival hit-man who has his sights set on being the best in the world. Of course that means removing one 007 in the process. So it's far more of a simple premise when compared to the typical plans for world domination that Bond has to thwart on a day to day basis. Christopher Lee plays the rival hit-man, Scaramanga, with typical charm and menace, making him almost appear as Bond's 'dark side.' There's plenty of near misses between the two in what could be described as a 'cat and mouse' type affair until the inevitable climax.So, the plot is simple and deadly in nature, but it wouldn't be a Roger Moore Bond film without humour. As I mentioned, the jokes never really detract from the obvious danger Bond is in at all times. Scaramanga's primary henchman 'Knick-knack' may be small in stature, but more than makes up for his lack of size in terms of brutality and mischief (sometimes so much so you could be mistaken for watching a David Lynch film as the 'arena' set during the duel is pretty psychedelic – and, when you mix it with a cheeky but mysterious dwarf, you have a precursor to Twin Peaks if ever I saw one!). The jokes hit the mark and about the 'silliest' the film gets is the return of Sheriff JW Pepper who some people will most likely find irritating and detracting from the overall story (however, I really enjoyed his over-the-topness!).So, combine the darkness of the Connery era with some Moore humour and you have a winning combination. Naturally, you also have the beautiful locations, exciting chase scenes and Britt Ekland as the obligatory Bond girl. But if you don't want to get quite as silly as Bond making Tarzan noises while swinging through a jungle (Octopussy), yet don't want quit the levels of brutality displayed by Connery when he strangles a woman with her own bikini (Diamonds Are Forever) then this is a perfect in between Bond film that should entertain all.",The Man with the Golden Gun
44,ThomasDrufke,An Eye For An Eye,7,18 October 2015,"After the Connery films sadly took a bit of a tumble in quality towards the end, Roger Moore really picked the franchise back up with a few gems in my opinion, Live and Let Die and The Man With the Golden Gun. The latter took a slightly different approach to its villain. We still have the world domination goal in some right here, but Christopher Lee's Scaramanga was a more intelligent and focused villain. It was nice to see an almost mutual respect between Bond and Scaramanga, something that a few of the earlier films were missing.I really enjoyed all the new characters added. Goodnight was a nice counter balance to Bond in the field and proved to add something to the story instead of being just another Bond girl. It's unfortunate that the franchise never keeps the same 'Bond girls' from film to film. Goodnight could have been a nice sidekick for future films. Back to Lee, the film began by giving Scaramanga a 3rd nipple and it seemed to define who he was for the most part of the film, as strange as that is. Thankfully, it wasn't really mentioned at all in the second half. The downfall of the Bond franchise so far has been going too comedic and just becoming a borderline action comedy. That almost became the case again with the cameo-turned-supporting role of J.W. Pepper from Live and Let Die. A few lines here and there were funny, but I didn't see the need to bring that character back at all. Nearly took me out of the film.I think putting gold in the title was a stretch even if it is directly based of one of the books. The plot is pretty close to ripping off Goldfinger from 10 years back. But I think with the entertainment that this film brings from Lee's performance, to the action scenes, to the villain's sidekick, to the addition of Goodnight, and even from Moore's performance, it's easily one of the better Bond films at the point of its release. A lot of the elements from this film are retreaded from previous entries, especially the speedboat chase, but I think watching Moore and Lee go mano y mano for the last 20 minutes makes it all worth while.+Scaramanga was another great villain+Goodnight+Action-Retreads same plot points as other Bond films-No need for J.W.

It's a hodgepodge of concepts, gags, characters, and stunts that sometimes work and sometimes don't. Christopher Lee makes a good villain, but his story and motives are kind of ridiculous. It was entertaining enough, but The Man with the Golden Gun only gets a bronze medal from me.",The Man with the Golden Gun
46,lesleyharris30,"Albeit Cheesy, It's Great Fun,",7,15 September 2016,"The Man with the Golden Gun is a great movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a talented cast. It stands out from other Bonds as being one of the only ones where the villain really steals the spotlight. Christopher Lee is outstanding as Scaramanga, both charismatic and thrilling. Moore brings in incredibly witty dialogue and his scenes with Lee are the films highlight.There is a large lack of gadgets, which I found to be the weakest factor. I find the new machinery to be one of the funnest and most unique aspects of every Bond film, and not bringing in any this time around left me underwhelmed.The story is also extremely by the numbers, there is no plot point that is unexpected or exciting, it feels as if it's all going through the motions.More so than the action, the performances are what stand out in The Man with the Golden Gun, and I feel that is the main thing that makes it a worthwhile watch, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good adventure film.

Concerned for his safety, M takes Bond off active duty.Never perturbed (not really sure of that word either), Bond still investigates and soon discovers that Scaramanga has stolen the 'priceless' Solex Agitator. Oh yeah, one of those! A mere MacGuffin and no more. In his mission to retrieve said 'agitator' Bond travels to Thailand and Hong Kong and gets into many silly fights, one involving a midget butler. He even finds time stress-out hillbilly Sheriff JW Pepper once more and...erm...'roger' his gorgeous assistant Mary Goodnight.It's very dumb and thoroughly unsophisticated but it's all in the name of fun and Roger Moore's light, somewhat innocent way of playing Bond just keeps you smiling all the way through. I also liked John Barry's score, despite the fact he claims it's his weakest effort on the series.TMWTGG was the last Bond film to be shot in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio and I do feel that if it was shot in Panavision then it would have more slick and polished look. 33 years on, TMWTGG looks too grainy and dated and appears older than it is.

Not only is the storytelling top-notch, but it has some great, suspenseful action scenes as well. The cat and mouse finale between Moore & Lee at the end is a classic, and unforgettable. It's kind of odd how not many people tend to place this in the upper echelon of James Bond films. It has everything a Bond fan could possibly want! Christopher Lee's portrayal as the villain Scaramanga is one of the most underrated Bond villains in my opinion. He played off Roger Moore extremely well. Britt Ekland is one of the sexiest Bond girls, ever as Midnight. You won't be able to take your eyes off her. Maud Adams is also very good in her role. Weirdly enough even though she is killed in this movie, she would reappear in Octopussy as the main Bond girl!

Lee, in the title role, makes a smooth villain, and Ekland and Adams, a pair of Swedish-born babes, are easy on the eyes. It sticks close to the formula of the super villain with a preposterous scheme to control the world, but it goes on too long. Some of the double-entendres are pretty good, although the attempts at humor with James as a Lousiana cop are lame. Bond's misogynistic side, which first came to light in later Connery films, unfortunately crops up here as Moore roughs up Adams.",The Man with the Golden Gun
51,The-Sarkologist,Bond confronts the energy crisis,6,26 October 2013,"Bond receives a letter which contains a golden bullet with his number of in and thus MI6 believes that he is going to be the target of an assassination by the world's most expensive assassin, Francesco Scaramanga, and thus he is pulled off of his current assignment and forced to go into hiding. However, Bond is not one to run away from his problems, so he sets his own mission to go and attempt to locate Scaramanga and kill him before he is killed.There are a couple of plots woven into this film, the first being Bond trying to get the hunter before he becomes his next kill, and in the background there is the search for a scientist who developed a device all the solex agitator which is a means of producing energy from he sun on a commercial and industrial scale. At first is seems as if this plot is simply a minor background plot, but when Bond discovers that the actual target is the scientist, then it becomes evident that both plots are related.This film no doubt was made during the energy crisis of the 1970's where the era of cheap oil and coal was coming to an end. The Arab states had realised that the west had become reliant on their oil and as such jacked up the price so high that it was starting to become prohibitively expensive. As such people were beginning to look for new ways of producing power cheaply. The thing is that at this time the only reason to look for cheap power was simply due to cost as opposed to any environment issues – this was to come much later. Mind you, there is also the idea that the oil companies don't actually want a new source of cheap power because that will, in the end, hurt their bottom line. However, this is not something that is really looked at in this film.This film is also set mostly in South-East Asia, with scenes in Macau, Hong Kong, and Bangkok (as well as on James Bond Island which, contrary to what the film says, it actually located to the north of Phuket). It is interesting to discover that for around two years, the remains of the Queen Elizabeth was actually sticking out of Hong Kong harbour, however to date it has either been removed, or covered up in one of the land reclamation projects. Still, it is interesting seeing Hong Kong as it was in the 70s, and also trying to guess were a club like the Bottoms Up would be located (I suspect it would have been in Wan Chai). When I was wondering through Wan Chai I couldn't find any club like the Bottoms Up, not that I was actually looking for one. As for Bangkok, it seems as if little has changed in many places, though I haven't spent a huge amount of time there to say that I am overtly familiar with the city (though I did recognise the King's Palace during the chase scene).",The Man with the Golden Gun

53,slightlymad22,Christopher Lee Is The Highlight,4,28 February 2020,"I just watched The Man With The Golden GunI'm not a fan of this one, it does have some things going for it though, Christopher Lee (Ian Flemings's Cousin) as Scaramanga is the obvious highlight as is his Golden Gun and his island liar, easily my favourite Bond bad guy lair. The finale in the fun house is pretty cool, even if the death of Scaramanga is predictable. It also features one of my favourite double entendres of the Moore era ""She's just coming, Sir"". When I was a child, I never understood why that line always tickled my Dad that much. Oh the innocence and naivety of youth.The gangster from Diamonds Are Forever is back in a pre title sequence (another one that doesn't feature James Bond) so is the comedy sidekick Sheriff J W Pepper, I know a lot of people hate him, but he gets a pass from me, as I liked him when I was younger (he reminded me of Sheriff Justice from Smokey & The Bandit) and he made my kids laugh when they were growing up too!!Like how the last one played into the popular blaxploitation movies of the early 1970's, this one has karate/Kung fu as the were popular then too... the Bond franchise seems like it was trying to fit into current trends as opposed to staying true to its own identity.It has awful theme song, a worse Bond girl (an annoying incompetent fool who would never be a field agent) a moron sidekick (he really is stupid) a great stunt (done in one take) ruined by having an awful slide whistle sound effect added and Bond beating up a midget, albeit a horrible one just leave me cold.The movie only grossed $21 million dollars (the lowest since Dr.No) at the domestic box office, to be the first Bond movie to finish outside the top 20 highest grossing movies of the year. Nowhere near a flop, against its $7 million budget, but still a noticeable drop on precious movies.Side note: Due to falling out with Albert R Brocolli and to alleviate the financial difficulties, Harry Saltzman sold his 50% share of the Bond franchise to United Artists",The Man with the Golden Gun

56,johnnyboyz,Very little in the way of a Golden Touch: Christopher Lee looks like he's in another film; the piece is tonally broken and there is too much obligatory content.,5,19 July 2011,"What appears to be one of the better scenes in Guy Hamilton's fourth and final stab at a Bond entry, a 1974 effort entitled The Man With the Golden Gun, sees the two predominant forces of the piece placed next to one another at the fitting locale of a kick-boxing match; these two men at the peak of their respective professions at a large-ish stadium housing an event of grandeur spectacle featuring two warriors going at it for glory and through the pain barrier to an array of baying, paying audience members. Their eventual showdown echoes that of the two fighters, where we, the audience, are representative of the conscience crowd watching on and pining for a result. The strange thing being that neither of these two men are actually in competition with one another and, up to this point, neither of them had formally met. Where their meeting at this kick-boxing event might have encapsulated this sense of oneupmanship or duelling commonplace the two men share, we are then quick to realise that neither of these two actually share any conflict whatsoever, and their fighting with one another is purely elementary to what is a Bond installation rife with the bog-standard ingredients of pretty women wearing very little; far-off locales, which come with the benefit of being able to cash in on a territory which happens to take to the franchise, and quirky henchmen with very little of a role to actually play once all is said and done.It is a curious thing to have such an interesting villain, indeed, an interesting idea for a villain, and then forget to forge some kind of conflict with your leading man. When we are introduced to Francisco Scaramanga, we observe Chrisopher Lee taking a swim on an exotic island populated only by his girlfriend Andrea (Adams) and butler Nick-Nack (Villechaize) before being plunged into a scenario in which he must begin unarmed, against an armed opponent; turn the tables and then kill the individual whose reasons for being there were always shady in the first place. The gym equipment and his dexterity in dealing with what spontaneity he faces imbues a sense of professionalism and athleticism, a worthy opponent to any hit-man or cutthroat, professional or otherwise, that culminates in the shooting of a wax-work figurine of our James Bond. Indeed, this is a rare instance in which Bond's only presence in one of his own franchise's famous pre-credits sequence is to play the role of the shot up model, and despite the colourful nature of the name, Lee plays him with that accent Lee has which I'm not sure many from Scaramanga's nation of origin possess.Roger Moore returns after the debut he made in the previous year's Live and Let Die, the man appearing savvy to the early establishment of Scaramanga's ability in his reeling off of detailed information on the guy upon spontaneous request by his boss in London. A golden bullet has been sent to London with ""007"" on it; Bond is told to lay low but dismisses this by heading out to the front-line of it all, an obligatory punch up in a Lebanese nightclub preceded by, of all things, a laxative joke followed by a trip to a Macao based arms dealer, whose business is fronted by three seemingly innocuous looking natives outside eating their bowls of rice completely juxtaposing what gross implements of death transpire to be created within. Later on there will be, for absolutely no reason whatsoever other than we're in the Far-East and might as well, a kung-fu sequence against people I'm not even sure were villains. Dropped in amidst all of this is a needless love interest, if you can call them that, for Bond in the form of Mary Goodnight (Ekland); a bimbo more-so a co-agent whose soft bodied, photogenic qualities are distressingly so.Moore's portrayal of Bond has come under varying barrages of fire over the decades; the man rarely backed up by great material although here does rather well with some good stuff for the early part. From what I perceive, Bond was always an anti-hero; he was the smoking, drinking, womanising lead whom always prefigured to save his own skin before that of any organisation's or, indeed, the rest of the world's. When it is his life seemingly under threat for the early part of the film's first act, we observe the man disparagingly go against orders to lay low and consequently tear through most of Asia trying to find out why it is his masculinity and position of global recognition has been threatened, even going so far as to breeze into a woman's hotel suite and actually assault her. It is a rare instance of Moore doing what most would've liked to have seen more of, taking a strangle-hold on the material, as well as his surroundings, and going on to throw caution to the wind by getting results.Alas, the film is too misdirected and nonsensical to allow one to particularly warm to it in any way; the tone is all over the place, an energy crisis plot opens up involving Scaramanga which sees the man put a bullet in the forehead of a businessman in the upper echelons of such an industry, but this is an instance which follows on from that of the introducing of Live and Let Die's deep south heralded sheriff Pepper (James). His scene, apart from the fact he is an aggressive stereotype clumsily juxtaposing Moore's English suaveness, is goofy and is rounded off with a misplaced instance of anthropomorphism that does not do well to predate the rather brutal aforementioned execution. There is an obligatory car chase, in which the filmmakers get to namedrop an automobile company used by Bond, that doesn't make great use of the third party element that is the police force, and the whole thing feels rather limp long before it has hobbled toward its conclusion.",The Man with the Golden Gun
57,filipemanuelneto,China and Evel Knievel,5,31 March 2016,"Directed by Guy Hamilton and with a script by Tom Mankiewicz and Richard Maibaum, this is the ninth film in the 007 franchise and keeps Harry Saltzman and Albert Broccoli as co-producers for the last time. In this film, the second where Roger Moore embodies 007, the main subject will be the energy crisis and the advent of so- called green energies, issues that were very present at that time, due to the oil crisis and the beginning of ecological concerns in society.In this film, the British agent is threatened by an assassin called Scaramanga, famous for using a pistol and bullets made in gold. Discretely, Bond decides to set off in pursuit of his new enemy, with the permission of M. The clues lead him to Beirut, to the Portuguese colony of Macau and finally to Hong Kong, where Scaramanga kills Gibson under Bond's nose. Gibson was a scientist who invented a way to harness solar energy and alleviate the world's dependency on oil. Bond must now recover the stolen technology and goes to Thailand where, after many adventures, will join forces with his colleague Mary Goodnight, an English spy who is both beautiful as stupid. Finally he meets Scaramanga. The chase takes Bond to the island's villain, which takes the final confrontation, full of surprises.In this film, Roger Moore will continues the formula started in ""Live and Let Die"": sarcastic and calm in any situation, his Bond is also a natural seducer, kind and gentle, contrasting to the rudest posture of Sean Connery, while not giving any value to women who seduces and which quickly drops when it suits his mission. A curious note: the mechanism created by Scaramanga in his island for the use of solar energy, despite the science fiction touch, is very similar to solar panels we have today but I don't know if this was a ""jules- vernian"" stylish prediction or if, even then, we could logically predict the course of technology in this field. One of the most famous scenes of this film is the gold-covered woman, in a probable homage to ""Goldfinger"", an earlier franchise film where this scene first emerged. Another memorable scene is the car chase where Bond, to cross a water channel, makes a dangerous 360° rotation with the car, similar to Evel Knievel shows, a popular icon from these time.In addition to James Bond and Mary Goodnight (Bond-girl played by the Swedish Britt Ekland), the film brings again J. W. Pepper, which was a big hit in the previous film and works here just as comic element. The villain, Scaramanga, was played by the immortal Christopher Lee, whom the seventies ran particularly well thanks to vampire movies. His helper, the francophone dwarf Nick-Nack, was taken by the talented and funny Hervé Villechaize. The also Swedish Maud Adams embodied Andrea the second bond-girl of this movie, the only 007 movie (I think) with two bond-girls interpreted by actresses from the same country.",The Man with the Golden Gun

60,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Uninspired ""Bond"" has good components but missed opportunities",5,30 November 2017,"Growing up I'd always liked ""The Man with the Golden Gun"" and considered it to be among the more iconic ""Bond"" films. Being named after its gold-inclined villain, it certainly seemed like it belonged with ""Goldfinger"" and ""Goldeneye,"" which was the first ""Bond"" film of my youth – whose corresponding video game featured the Golden Gun, which was very, very desirable in multiplayer shoot- outs. Revisiting the ""Bond"" films in order, it's clear that Eon Productions ""Bond"" film No. 9 is a film desperately clinging to a formula that it's grown very tired of.""The Man with the Golden Gun"" marks the third straight ""Bond"" for director Guy Hamilton and writer Tom Mankiewicz – three films in four years. Original ""Bond"" screenwriter Richard Maibaum also did work on the film, his seventh of what would be 13 ""Bond"" scripts. At some point, even the most comfortably tailored tuxedos start to wear down.Based on Ian Fleming's last published ""Bond"" novel, ""Golden Gun"" sends 007 (Roger Moore) after the million-dollar assassin Francisco Scaramanga (Christopher Lee), known for his golden gun (and never missing a target). His whereabouts are unknown, but an unusual bullet with Bond's name on it leads him to China, where he meets Scaramanga's mistress (Maud Adams), rendezvous with fellow agents including Mary Goodnight (Britt Ekland) and eventually ends up in Thailand after getting mixed up in a complicated plot revolving around a device that can harness the power of the sun.""Golden Gun"" has that classic globe-trotting goose chase feel of previous entries. The shooting locations are more stunning than usual and the production design (including a half-sunken ship that serves as a secret MI6 base) is top notch. But what moves Bond from A to B to C lacks a sense of urgency, clarity and purpose. ""Diamonds are Forever"" struggled similarly to link all the action set-piece pearls with an effective narrative thread. ""Golden Gun"" features another boat chase on the Thai Klongs, another car chase with a wedged-in daredevil stunt and a pointless formal martial arts fight scene in an attempt to draw fans of '70s kung-fu movies. None of these are poorly done, but they lack for excitement. And there are not one, but two appearances by J.W. Pepper (Clifton James), an embarrassing blemish on Moore's first two ""Bonds.""Learning that ""Golden Gun"" was made as producers Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli were having a falling out and that it was their final collaboration makes a degree of sense. The exotic locations and sets of ""Golden Gun"" hold a certain promise, yet there's a fierce clinging to the series hallmarks and formulas, a checking off of boxes, if you will. Ekland and Adams are stunning Bond girls, though Ekland's Goodnight is an utter ditz and the butt of a lot of jokes. Considering she's an MI6 agent, you'd think she'd be more guileful or an equal of Bond's. In one scene she claims she doesn't want to be his next ""passing fancy"" and the next she's in his bed. Scaramanga is another missed opportunity. Although the great Christopher Lee makes him more interesting than the typical ""Bond"" villain, the chance for him to be the dark equal of Bond – who Bond could have been – is out there for the taking and even discussed, but by and large he gets treated like all the other ""Bond"" villains. He even has an unusual henchman by his side in Nick Nack (Hervé Villechaize), a little person clearly in the mold of Oddjob from ""Goldfinger"" though half as menacing (that's not a size joke).""The Man with the Golden Gun"" has the feel of a ""Bond"" with a lot of potential squandered in the name of sticking to procedure. It's inoffensive and has a lot of nice pieces, but doesn't make the effort to be a standout entry, something a franchise can ill afford nine films in. ~Steven CThanks for reading!

62,Anonymous_Maxine,The Man With The Plastic Gun.,4,9 August 2001,"Besides being the worst James Bond film ever, The Man With The Golden Gun had by far the most disgustingly awful opening theme song of the entire series. This time around, Bond faces an unimaginative villain named Scaramanga who has a third nipple and a midget sidekick, charmingly named Nik Nak. It seems that Scaramanga has gotten a hold of a priceless device that is capable of converting sunlight into electricity, effectively rendering him the most powerful man in the world in the middle of an energy crisis, purposely coinciding with the energy crisis of the early 1970s. Besides that, he seems to have developed an interest in exterminating Bond himself, to add to his growing collection of murdered double oh's. The main advantage that Scaramanga has is the thing that made it possible for this to have been a much more interesting film - no one knew where he was or what he looked like. Unfortunately, the nearly endless possibilities that this fact creates for the film are largely ignored, and we get an unusually run-of-the-mill spy film with this entry into the already extensive 007 series. As is very much the tradition by now, there are plenty of amusing names for the characters in this Bond film, such as the above mentioned Nik Nak, as well as others, such as the Bond girl, Good Night, one of Scaramanga's associates, Hi Fat, and a naked Asian hottie named Chu Me.  Roger Moore fits the spy element of the James Bond character fairly well, but as is the case in every Bond film that he starred in, he is totally unconvincing as the endlessly charming womanizer that Sean Connery so effectively portrayed.
(spoilers) There is an interesting scene in The Man With The Golden Gun in which Bond pretends to be Scaramanga to talk to Hi Fat, who has never seen him, which leads into the most interesting part of the film. There are a lot of plot twists during the duration of the film, and this makes it a lot more entertaining because you never know who knows what. Hi Fat takes Bond in as Scaramanga, but then when he leaves, we find out that Scaramanga was on the island he entire time, and both men know that it was Bond posing as Scaramanga. There were also plenty of idiotic fight scenes in the movie, such as the laughable scene between Bond and a couple of sumo wrestlers. Needless to say, the sumo wrestlers EVENTUALLY win the fight, at which point Nik Nak joins in half naked (did we really need to be subjected to that?) to finish him off. Luckily, Hi fat interrupts just in time to save his life and ""send him to school"" instead, sending him to some kind of martial arts school, which is held on an impressive set that is amazingly reminiscent of something out of an Akira Kurosawa film. Unfortunately, this is also followed by loads of pathetically staged fight scenes, but luckily, it's followed by a thankfully well-done car chase. The car turning into a plane was too much, as was the jump over the river (but at least it was pretty impressive), but the chase itself, for the most part, was pretty good, despite the fact that Bond had a redneck salesman as a completely unnecessary passenger. Ultimately, Bond is invited to Scaramanga's lair to partake in a civil dinner that desperately but vainly tries to achieve the same effectiveness achieved by the identical scene in Dr. No, but this rivalry finalizes in a trivial duel between Bond and Scaramanga. The final conflict is one of the least effective of all of the Bond films, and the by now clichéd ending on a ship in the middle of the ocean didn't help much either. It is never very clearly explained why the entire island would self-destruct if the sub-zero helium rose in temperature even the smallest amount, and we're left with a lot of questions and not a very impressive film. After this installment, it's amazing that Moore was ever hired to play Bond again.",The Man with the Golden Gun

64,ianlouisiana,No no seven.,3,10 December 2007,"The last of the real James Bond stories ""The man with the golden gun"" seemed - even on publication in 1965 - the work of an author who was growing tired of his creation.Ian Fleming was not impressed with Mr S. Connery who was clearly not a Public School Man and was at least ten years too young for the part as conceived by the author.He described Connery as ""far too rough"" for the role whch,as a prediction,is right up there with the man from Decca Records who thought The Beatles would never make it.Whatever his shortcomings as a seer,Mr Fleming wrote fast moving,punchy prose that translated brilliantly to the screen in the remarkable ""Dr No"" but rapidly fell victim to the film makers' urge to make everything bigger and better,so by the time his final novel reached the screen his dialogue had been hi - jacked and turned into a mass of double - entendres worthy of a ""Carry On"" movie and flabbed out with a series of tired and unfunny one - liners. Bond was now being played by Mr R.Moore as an over - coiffed clotheshorse with all the athleticism of Les Dawson but none of the charm.His voice was replete with the strangulated vowels and over - careful articulation of the unsuccessfully coached London boy trying to fit in at Cambridge. ""The man with the golden gun"" contains an embarrassingly bad opening sequence that goes on for far too long,a rehash of the redneck sheriff ""joke"" that wasn't very funny first time round - which also goes on far too long - and Mr C.Lee is slightly less convincing as a deadly hit man than A.E. Matthews would have been. As the Bond movies - and Mr Moore with them - got flabbier and flabbier their resemblance to the original character got slighter and slighter. The present incumbent,Mr Daniel Craig,may make the ladies' hearts flutter as he displays his six - pack,but he is just a narcissistic show -off,one of the few things the ""real"" Bond could never have been accused of. 33 years on from ""The man with the golden gun"" the gravy train shows no sign of slowing down.If they ever run out of authors eager to make a quick buck perhaps someone would approach J.K.Rowling to churn something out that will let them cash in all round.""James Bond and the philosopher's stone""?Smells like money to me.",The Man with the Golden Gun

It won't be giving From Russia With Love or Goldfinger a run for their money, but as the back-to-basics reality check that the series so desperately needed, this is more than acceptable. Roger Moore confidently plays a tougher, more businesslike Bond this time around, and spends most of the production flexing his detective chops in search of a rival assassin with nothing more to go on than the color of his weapon and a quick, curious nipple count. Stocked with fresh, exotic locales, skimpy beauties dressed for the beach, an adequate number of wacky, themed sidekicks (as in, less than the full dozen of the former picture) and a cool, legitimate master threat, this is pretty much the root formula for a good adventure with 007. Occasionally it gives in to a passion for pointless boat chases, and a few bad remnants of the era rear their head at inopportune moments (what was with the slide whistle during that massive car jump?) but such silly bits of self-indulgence are a part of the franchise's heritage at this point.

Acting is little more than average and although Moore was great in the acting but the action scenes from him were disappointing, Lee was superb in his character, Ekland was disappointing, locations was good and is beautifully captured in cinematography, climax of the movie is superb.overall an average Bond movie which had the potential to be a great movie.",The Man with the Golden Gun
71,r96sk,Now we're talking!,9,19 March 2020,"Now we're talking! I had a great time watching 'The Man with the Golden Gun'.Roger Moore has properly entered the building as Bond now, following an iffy start in 'Live and Let Die'. He is joined by Christopher Lee, who is truly excellent as Scaramanga. Hervé Villechaize stars as his sidekick, Nick Nack makes for a brilliant accomplice.Very good casting overall, a superb score by John Barry alongside some nice locations.

72,slokes,The Yin And Yang Of 007,5,14 May 2010,"It's never easy putting a numerical vote value to a James Bond movie; they follow their own rules and employ a unique formula designed to deliver pure entertainment rather than story. No Bond movie exemplifies this as well as ""The Man With The Golden Gun"".For every positive in this film, there's a commensurate drawback, rather like a yin for a yang.John Barry gives us one of the most interesting and dynamic scores, both lilting and driving...yet centered around a terrible main titles song oversung by a screechy Lulu.Roger Moore is a charming Bond and enjoyable company...except when he is pressed to act tough in a couple of ill-thought-out scenes that totally undercut his nice-guy 007 interpretation.Maud Adams and Britt Ekland are amazingly beautiful actresses presented to jaw-dropping effect...but underwritten as characters until they lose any point other than as window dressing.Christopher Lee is a riveting villain as title character Scaramanga...but the film uses him in a murky and somewhat goofy way, alternately impressed by Bond yet not taking him seriously.The setpieces that anchor this film are thrilling and engaging...but connected haphazardly to a central story with more ugly holes in it than one of Scaramanga's hapless targets.All in all, ""Golden Gun"" is fitfully entertaining but too stupid to be enjoyed in the same clean way you can relish other Bond adventures. Director Guy Hamilton's emphasis on laughs and grittiness finally catches up with him after his last two films more or less got away with employing the same left-field mixture.If you are going to play Bond for laughs, they should at least be good laughs, not Moore making lame wisecracks like pointing a gun at a would-be informant's crotch with the line: ""Speak now or forever hold your piece."" Or botching one of the marquee stunts in the Bond series, a 360-degree midair car jump, by running it in slow-motion with a slide-whistle. You could have gotten the same result from a model without endangering anyone. Clifton James returns from the last film as Sheriff Pepper, slowing up the action with odd scenery-chomping asides. He should have taken his cue from a previous role and spent a night in the box instead.Liking Bond, and Moore as Bond, helps a lot. His scenes with Bernard Lee as M give him more to play off of than usual, with M cleverly putting him onto an assassination job against Scaramanga without exactly saying so. Christopher Lee does seem an ideal match for Moore with his cheery civility and the brotherhood of being hired guns. ""You work for peanuts, a hearty 'well-done' from the Queen and a pittance of a pension,"" Scaramanga observes. ""Other than that, we are the same."" The Maguffin of acquiring a solar-power magnifying device gives this film a certain timeliness that moves 007 out of his 1960s Cold-War perspective, even if Scaramanga's own interest in the device is rather lamely shoehorned in (he was brought in as a hired gun yet his lair turns out to be uniquely equipped for employing the device at film's end).We do get one cleverly-developed bad guy in Scaramanga's assistant, Nick Nack (Hervé Villechaize). Nick Nack is one of those seemingly soft ideas (Dr. Loveless, call your office) that actually delivers with Villechaize playing him for ample menace as well as laughs. His relationship with Scaramanga, whom he sets top assassins on in order to keep his boss in top fettle, establishes a creepy vibe aided by Scaramanga's funhouse-equipped lair.Here again, what you get is balanced by what you miss, namely the more expansive set-design work of Bond regular Ken Adam. You miss a lot with ""Golden Gun"", yet it amuses and surprises enough to stay in the lower-middle range of Bond films, never devolving into the embarrassing realm of ""Die Another Day"" or ""A View To A Kill"". Get a little, lose a little; yin and yang.",The Man with the Golden Gun
73,I_Ailurophile,A missed opportunity,4,10 May 2021,"'The man with the golden gun' should have been a better movie than it was.It had so many advantages: An outstanding cast, including Christopher Lee and Hervé Villechaize, plus Maud Adams and Soon-Taik Oh, all given great characters that they portrayed very well. It had topical context, with the oil embargo and energy crisis of the 1970s providing a solid foundation for an overall plot that was pretty well thought out, and a little more broadminded than many other 007 films.It had a swell opening scene introducing Lee's antagonist, Scaramanga, and Villechaiz's henchman, Nick Nack. It established their personalities, which exceed those of most Bond villains, and suggested a showdown worth sticking around for. It had a raucous, electrifying theme song performed by Lulu, and a fantastic score by repeat Bond composer John Barry that often echoed the theme's attitude, if not also its chords.Unfortunately, none of these things save it from being a rather middling, mostly unexciting entry in the Bond franchise. Those are some pretty significant items in the ""pro"" column, yet they stand alone, and the rest of the film falls in the ""con"" side. The most inspired I felt while rewatching this once again, giving it another try, was imagining a fun movie that could have been made following the minor characters who only appear for one scene, or two at most. 'The man with the golden gun,' itself, isn't a very fun movie. It's just unsatisfying.Solid though the general plot was, the picture falls apart in the details. While Bond isn't quite as lascivious with women in this movie, there's plenty of questionable, unnecessary focus on women's bodies at a few points throughout. Action scenes are at once silly and over the top, as Bond films are infamous for - but also just ho-hum. Case in point: the flying car is bad enough, but the preceding chase is a point in the film where I almost wanted to stop watching so I wouldn't have to hear that awful slide whistle sound effect.But it gets worse still, because while most of the characters in 'Man with the golden gun' are written reasonably well, two prominent ones are emphatically not. For one thing, in the mentioned chase, Bond is paired with one of the most unlikable characters of the entire series. Clifton James returns as dimwitted, loudmouthed, ignorant Louisianan Sheriff J. W. Pepper, supposedly to lend some comedy to this sequence, but he automatically mucks up the film with him like he did in 'Live and let die.' In the moments before when we again meet his character, now on vacation with his wife, he makes horrid remarks to and about the locals in Bangkok. I don't think for one moment the screenwriter is capable enough to differentiate between poking fun AT racism, and having fun WITH racism.And the other unfortunate, prominent, poorly written character is none other than the requisite Bond girl, ""Goodnight."" Throughout most of the picture she acts like a total ditz, with a total lack of common sense that's unbecoming of the position she supposedly holds. To be fair, since I don't think I've seen Britt Ekland in any other movies, I can't rightly judge if the terrible characterization is more the fault of bad acting on her part or the writer's bad screenplay. But since that writer is Tom Mankiewicz, who also had a hand in a few other weak Bond films - I can only assume it's his albatross to carry. And, gods help us - he is again paired with regrettably repeat 007 director Guy Hamilton, who shares the same mark of shame.But what of antagonists Scaramanga and Nick Nack? They seemed to have been the focus of Mankiewicz's screenwriter energy, certainly. Scaramanga is a cold, calculating killer - yet professional, and witty, and genuinely thrilled at the prospect of meeting James Bond. Henchman Nick Nack is devious and untrustworthy, and has it out for the heroes as much as his boss, but there's an undeniable amiability about him that's charming. Together, these two bad guys are honestly fun, and even playful.That sadly leads us what is likely the greatest fault of 'The man with the golden gun': Francisco Scaramanga, unparalleled assassin for hire, and James Bond, star spy master of Her Majesty's government, are supposed equals. The entire movie builds up that relationship between the characters - and again, Scaramanga himself is given dialogue where he expounds on how he relishes their meeting, and the opportunity to match skills against each other. Yet they don't really get the chance to play off that apposition they share, as the showdown feels like it's over all too quickly, becoming outright anticlimactic. This point is further accentuated a few minutes later when the narrative flow of the film dictates that the actual climax of the plot is simply Bond's retrieval of the MacGuffin despite Goodnight's bumbling ""help.""As one last half-hearted cinematic jest: Just as an exciting opening scene was followed by Lulu's upbeat titular theme song, the let-down of the rest of the movie (and the climax especially) is capped off with a reprise of the theme that is notably slowed down, as though all available energy had been expended long before and Lulu is now running on fumes. I'm reminded of the trope of hired musicians at a gala who abruptly stop playing as a guest interrupts, only to unconvincingly try to pick right back up and liven the mood again after their departure. The dichotomy of the theme's use is striking, and it would be funny, if we didn't just spend 2 hours watching that guest's unwelcome outburst.To be clear, 'The man with the golden gun' isn't the very worst of the Bond movies. The root premise is pretty good, and most of the characters are written well, especially the villains. That's more than some other 007 flicks can claim. But it's not enough to make this at all thrilling, or defy otherwise lackluster or dubious writing, even without considering the tiresome excesses of the franchise.'The man with the golden gun' isn't entirely bad, but it's definitely very disappointing. What could have been a very good movie, very conspicuously fumbled.",The Man with the Golden Gun
74,adamjohns-42575,A better attempt the second time around.,3,26 August 2020,"This Bond story far exceeds the first instalment of the Roger Moore years. It feels a bit more like he's a spy in this one. It's still got a lot of unnecessary comedy, especially in the shape of JW Pepper and some of James' puns my Gruncle could come up with, but it just has a better feel about it. It's still not brilliant, but again I am comparing it to Daniel Craig, which I just can't help, the man is a God.
I think perhaps that there are too many car and boat chases and not enough detective work going on and a lot of the situations and meetings are all very convenient.
There is also a lot of time spent ensuring the cultural aspects of the country they are in are shown, he's in Asia so there must be martial arts and temples, etc.I quite like Rog in the role, although he already seems a bit careworn in only the second film, but Britt Eklund did not do well in her part. At least her nightie matched the bedroom I suppose, but she was just another ditsy blonde playing at being an agent. I hope to God that the British government would never employ someone so inept who blows up an island that could have been very beneficial to the world?
Christopher plays his part well and although a little bit creepy in his pervy way, Nick Nack was a great character too.
It's still very seventies, very sexist, very racist and quite bad taste in a lot of ways, but an enjoyable enough watch for a Saturday afternoon.",The Man with the Golden Gun
75,davidmvining,"Lee is great, buoying a movie that doesn't deserve him",6,17 February 2020,"Roger Moore's second James Bond adventure seems caught in between tones. On the one hand we have flying cars, cartoony stunts, a henchman, the inexplicable return of a Louisiana sheriff in Thailand, a laser gun, and a third nipple. On the other we have Bond with an edge again and an antagonist who feels like a real threat and a late soliloquy about how he and Bond are mirror images of each other. It's all arranged in a rather overly complicated fashion designed to include some kung fu because it was popular at the time. I think it's a step up from Live and Let Die, but only just.James Bond gets pulled off a mission because he's received a golden bullet with ""007"" etched into it, implying a real threat from the known gunman Scaramanga. Bond won't sit back and let the threat sit, so he goes to Southeast Asia to search out the man with the golden gun and face him one on one. Through a series of actions in Hong Kong and then Thailand, Bond comes into contact with Hip, a local contact who helps Bond navigate the foreign country, and Goodnight, one of the prettiest but also probably the single worst Bond girl in the franchise. Yes, Britt Eckland is really good looking, but Goodnight is an idiot who's only desire is to sleep with Bond. She's boring and a complete waste of space that occupies the last half of the film.Moore has a different job to do as Bond here. In Live and Let Die, Moore felt like little more than a lothario who used his job as an excuse to find exotic women to sleep with. Here, Bond, as written, feels like he should have been played by Sean Connery. He's much less universally flirtatious without women, going so far as to threaten to break a woman's arm if she didn't give him information. That doesn't feel like something Moore would do (and, reportedly, he was really displeased with having to do it at all), and it's an odd moment to see. Most of the rest of the time, he's able to largely be the Bond he had created in Live and Let Die, but the performance is marred by those moments that don't fit.The MacGuffin of the film is a piece of technology that's supposed to make solar power actually feasible as a large scale energy source. Luckily for everyone involved, it's pocket sized and can move around easily. Narratively, it's disposable and doesn't really matter. It does end up powering a solar laser gun late in the film, but it's secondary to Scaramanga himself.In this bit of a mess of a film, there is Christopher Lee's Francisco Scaramanga. He is a great villain. He's intelligent and has a code of ethics to follow. He's given opportunities to kill Bond but doesn't take them because he doesn't feel the need to. Bond is a nuisance, one that entertains and intrigues him to a certain extent. When he does get to the point to kill Bond, Bond has given little other choice, but the prospect of killing Bond excites Scaramanga at that point. I think the late stage idea of them being mirror images of each other is really underdeveloped (look to The Dark Knight where this same idea plays out much better), but even without that, Scaramanga is great.I just wish he was in a better film. The film he is in meanders around Southeast Asia, dealing with a MacGuffin it doesn't really care about being passed around by other, unimportant antagonists. Turning the film into a steadily building showdown between the two, clearing up the messy plot with a more streamlined and focused one that more took advantage of the implications of two mirror images going after each other would have made this a better film. Instead, it's just a middling Bond picture with one of the best Bond villains. And seriously, Goodnight is just the worst.",The Man with the Golden Gun
76,Spleen,"When Austin Powers appears in ""The Man with the Golden Schlong"", you'll know THAT series is in trouble, too",3,8 May 2002,"When Roger Moore took over as caretaker of the Bond franchise he was handed a good portion of the momentum and goodwill that had been generated during the Sean Connery era - and he spent it all on ""Live and Let Die"" (which, miraculously, DOES feel like something of a continuation from where Connery left off).  He started his next film with no reserves.  It shows immediately - and never stops showing.  There atmosphere is all wrong, there's no energy, precious little REAL ruthlessness (when Moore does the dirty on someone he comes across as distant and vague, as though he's a butler).  Nor does he have a title song by Paul McCartney or a babe as luscious as the young Jane Seymour to support him this time.  He's clearly come down in the world.  He's no longer up against supervillains plotting to take over the world; even if you'd resigned yourself to expecting, say, a mere drug baron trying to corner the American market in narcotics, you'll find the villainous plotting (when it's at last unveiled, all too late) terribly disappointing and earthbound.Another black mark: the two most memorable supporting players are the short guy from ""Fantasy Island"" (serving as, what do you know, butler, on, what do you know, an eccentric millionaire's secret fantasy island), and the tobacco-chewing redneck sheriff from ""Live and Let Die"", serving up the same cheap, painfully over-the-top schtick as before, only there's more of it, and in order to work him into the plot at all they had to have him take a holiday in Thailand (as if such a redneck would EVER go to Thailand!). They're memorable, but you kind of wish they weren't.At the time of writing I've seen all of the James Bond films.  This was the last I managed to lay eyes on.  It's obvious enough why it proved so elusive.  It may not be quite as BAD as ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" or ""Moonraker"" - I'm not sure on this point, and I don't care - but it is, in some sense, the biggest embarrassment: the least timeless, with all the silliness of any other Bond film, yet none of the grandeur which the silliness sometimes made possible.  Yes, it's directed by the guy who did ""Goldfinger"".  No, I don't understand how this could be either.",The Man with the Golden Gun

Lots of fun, 'hokey' action and the title theme by Lulu, is such a memorable song, that encapsulates both Bond and the seventies perfectly. Scaramanga is regarded by many Bond fans, as the best ever baddie and his weapon of choice (an assembled golden pistol), one of the finest weapons in film history.",The Man with the Golden Gun
78,eric262003,Silly Movie With the Toughest Villain,8,3 November 2008,"Even though heavily criticized for its overly campy features, ""The Man with the Golden Gun"" features one of the best villains in the Bond franchise, Scaramanga played by the talented Christopher Lee. I think he along with Renard in ""The World is Not Enough"" ranks as Bond's most fearsome adversary. Scaramanga is just as equal as Bond in terms that his actions are just as unpredictable as Bond's. By locating the film in Bangkok, the scenery is so uplifting, that it adds the right texture in keeping the movie interesting culture-wise. Unlike other villains from the Bond series, Lee evens the scale of Scaramanga's character by examining his evil and his good intentions (especially with his alliance with his diminutive sidekick, Nick Nack Herve Villechaize). Scaramanga works convincingly above the other Bond villains through both the strong compelling character development and his physical features. Scaramanga is rightful at the top of list as one the best villains along with Blofeld, Goldfinger and Jaws.One of the funniest aspects of ""The Man with the Golden Gun"" is the Bond girl Mary Goodnight (Britt Ekland, Peter Sellers' wife). She is a very awkward and clumsy almost to the point of nearly killing Bond on more than one occasion during his battles with Scaramanga. What's interesting about Miss Goodnight is that unlike the other Bond girls who have unusual jobs that at times may be secretive and mysterious, Miss Goodnight is rewarding in that she's more developed and more exciting to watch along with Maud Adams as Scaramanga's mistress Andrea. When we look at Scaramanga, we are almost looking at an evil clone of Bond. His personality is like Bond's, he even has the suave voice like Bond's. The only differing factors is that he has crude humor and that in the tradition to the Bond series, and that he's destined to cause havoc wherever he goes.",The Man with the Golden Gun
79,pc95,One of the Better Moore Films with Great Villain,7,5 May 2013,"Recently I rewatched ""The Man with the Golden Gun"", starring Roger Moore and Christopher Lee. While one of Moore's better outings with a villain at least as suave as Bond himself, Mr. Scaramonga, the film is a bit zany and kooky sometimes. I especially liked Lee and Villachaize (Tatoo from Fantasy Island) as an odd and esoteric couple. (spoiler) There seems to be 2 Bond Girls here, perhaps one too many it would seem for the script. The locales are very good, however Q's inventions are nearly non-existent, and the other (main) Bond Girl ""Goodnight"" played by Britt Ekland is a goo-goo eyed push-over and ditz - too much for my fancy. The final duel is interesting though not climactic enough and to add the goofy J W Pepper played by Clifton James seems out-of-sorts for a Bond movie. Nevertheless with the locales, and villains, I liked this movie and recommend it for Bond fans - it's clearly not in the top tier for Bond films - maybe in the top 10 to 15 of films. But Worthy 7/10.",The Man with the Golden Gun
80,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,Bond goes kung-fu grindhouse,7,17 August 2013,"Supremely silly, but still quite good, Bond adventure. Ignoring about 99.2% of Ian Fleming's weakest novel, as Bond (antihero in the book, turned into suave super spy in film) is both searching for, and being hunted by, Scaramanga (villain in the book, turned into anti-villain in the film, he even jovially offers Bond a glass of champagne at one point) and his gold-plated .45 and bullets.Bond's search for Scaramanga takes him to Macau, Hong Kong, and ultimately Thailand (all replacing the books rather dull setting in Jamaica) and an anticlimactic duel in Scaramanga's very own personal island fun park, in an ending possibly inspired by the ghost town sequence in the book Diamonds Are Forever, and which can be guessed from five minutes into the film's run-time.Potentially good mystery/ action thriller is drenched in one-liners and gags, but it is still fun to watch Roger Moore, clearly having a good time with it, in all of its splendid locations, that it is easy (for me, anyway) to overlook its goofball contrivances and just sit back and enjoy the ride. Britt Eckland looks good, even though her character is annoying, it is easy to see why Bond wants little to do with her. She and Hervé Villechaize needed better written characters. Hervé Villechaize might have made a great henchman, had his character been handled completely straight, and not played solely for laughs (Who would be afraid of a midget? Imagine then, if his character ended up being a cruel, ruthless killer, he would then have the element of surprise) Overall, it is not very Fleming-like, but still a lot of fun and more enjoyable than some have said. A good mix of adventure and kung fu genres.",The Man with the Golden Gun
81,brando647,"One of the Weakest 007 Films, Not Without Its Charm",6,21 February 2015,"I am a self-confessed Roger Moore apologist when it comes to the 007 films. I understand why there's a segment of the fan base that abhor the Moore films for being as campy as they are, but his films really were some of my favorites when I was younger and the nostalgia alone keeps my love for them alive. But even I have to admit that THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN is undeniably the worst. When I was young and had trouble sleeping, I would pop this VHS in to guarantee I would be out cold within an hour. It's disappointing because there were a lot of cool ingredients gathered here to construct one of the coolest 007 movies ever but poor writing and shoddy pacing ruin it. It opens so promisingly; instead of the usual scene of James Bond (Moore) going to M for his latest assignment, he arrives to the news that MI6 has received a special package for our favorite secret agent – a golden bullet with 007 inscribed on the side. We're led to believe that the legendary assassin Francisco Scaramanga (Christopher Lee) has set his sights on Bond, and Bond is removed from any and all assignments until the situation is resolved. So Bond begins a search that will lead him from Lebanon to Thailand in search of the ""man with the golden gun"" to confront him. This would've been the coolest 007 adventure ever but the movie then sidelines all the cool stuff for a solar cell plot.This frustrates me to no end. The Scaramanga/Bond plot would've been more than enough to create a cool adventure that breaks away from the normal secret mission trope and turn this into a more personal venture. Bond wouldn't be out to save the world this time; he'd be saving his own skin. But, as Bond follows the trail to Scaramanga, he discovers that it ties into MI6's current situation with a solar power expert who has created a device called a ""solex agitator"" that is apparently the most efficient solar cell ever created and could solve the world's energy crisis. This leads to detours that ruin the film's pace, causing a horrible sag in the middle where Bond is sent to die in a karate school (because the film is set in Asia so, you know, martial arts!) and then engages in yet another boat chase (though not as painfully long as the one we suffered in LIVE AND LET DIE). This is about the time when my attention drops and I tune out. The first 45 minutes or so of the movie are great and then it ramps up again in the final half hour when Bond arrives at Scaramanga's private island for the confrontation we'd all been waiting for – the world's greatest secret agent versus the world's most deadly assassin. But everything in the middle, especially all instances of Sheriff J.W. Pepper (yes.he's back), and the clichéd villain lair (Scaramanga's solar power planttotally unnecessary addition that comes with the solex plot) ruin what could've been something fun and different.THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN was Roger Moore's second film as James Bond and he had pretty much found his groove by now. He had the suave, debonair demeanor but his action scenes never felt genuine. Part of the charm of his era, in my opinion. As stated, I'm a fan. Our villain, Francisco Scaramanga, has the benefit of being portrayed by one of the coolest character actors ever, Christopher Lee. Of course, he's excellent here. I only regret that he's wasted when he becomes more of the prototypical Bond villain in the end with his master scheme of ransoming the solex technology from his massive island lair. Keep it small here, guys. Keep it personal. It would've been fantastic. His henchman is also one of the more memorable, Nick Nack (Hervé Villechaize). Scaramanga's diminutive French man-servant is just as deviant as his boss and, let's face it, just as cool. The movie's only failure in the character department is our Bond girl, Mary Goodnight (Britt Ekland). I'm hesitant to blame any of this on Ekland because this just comes across as poor writing. Goodnight is a fellow MI6 agent and she's absolutely worthless. She fails at just about every job she's given and her only objective over the course of the entire movie appears to be hooking up with Bond. She's a ditz who puts herself and/or Bond in harm's way on a regular basis due to her lack of awareness, and she throws a tantrum when Bond beds Scaramanga's woman/the movie's femme fatale, Andrea Anders (Maud Adams). Adams is a much stronger woman. Her character is stronger-willed but she's put herself in a dangerous position by getting in bed (literally and figuratively) with Scaramanga. She's great and it's no surprise the filmmakers brought her in again for OCTOPUSSY.THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN has a lot of problems but, keep in mind, I still prefer it over THUNDERBALL anytime. The what-ifs in my mind about what we may have gotten had the producers been willing to take some more chances and get a little more creative with the material will forever bother me. But the movie boasts some cool villains and beautiful (if not well-written) women, and I love all of the sequences set in Scaramanga's funhouse of death. This may be one of the weaker 007 adventures but I still can't bring myself to hate it. Mediocre, maybe. Horrible, nah.",The Man with the Golden Gun
82,Gislef,Seriously Underrated,8,18 September 1998,"Yes, there's a few problems.  Scaramanga's solar plant set is pretty much wasted, while the funhouse is overused.  However, Christopher Lee is my favorite Bond villain:  a cool, suave, anti-Bond who does his own dirty work (like Yaphet Kotto in the previous flick).  Yes, Goldfinger might be menacing, impressive, and can shoot someone when pushed, but give me a villain that can go face-to-face with Bond any day.  Herve Villachez, freed from having to be the tough Oddjob-type bodyguard/menace, provides both comic relief and a certain amount of plot diversion as someone trying to kill his boss.  Britt kind of grates on the nerves after a while (she's probably the shallowest of Bond female leads), but Moore is adequate, and the stunts and scenery are spectacular.",The Man with the Golden Gun

84,coltras35,""" No-one can catch him, no hit man can match him For his million dollar skill.""",8,13 April 2021,"This tenth 007 adventure originally meant to be filmed instead of OHMSS, starring Roger Moore and shot in Cambodia, however that didn't happen due to an uprising in the aforementioned country, and was consequently shelved.Fast forward to 1974, Roger Moore stars in his 2nd Bond film, and continues to grow in the role, showing his usual suaveness and eye-raising demeanour, but this time with a grittier style. In some scenes, the shadow of the first cinematic Bond looms, like in the rough interrogation of Maud's character, and though rough-handling women isn't Moore's style, he executes that bit his way, and comes across like a bitter accountant asking for his bill to be paid. There's militaristic coldness; he's almost angry that he was forced to act in such a way.The story: There are two plots, the main story deals with Bond's attempts to find ace hitman Scaramanga ( Christopher Lee) before the elusive assassin fires a bullet with ""007"" on it, and the 2nd one is that both Scaramanga and the British government are in pursuit of a vital component for a solar energy converter, and whoever builds this converter will have carte blanche where solar power is concerned, which means millions dollars. Both plots gradually dovetail in to one, and that's what makes this entry a little unique. Purely singular chase plot would be hard to stretch to 2 hours.The Man with the Golden Gun gets a lot of criticisms for being silly, campy, outrageous, and not intense and dark like the early Bonds, but they fail to realise this was 1970s. Campy humour was in, and besides, hippie culture and the Watergate scandal made people weary/suspicious of governments, and as Bond is a servant of the government, a lean, dark serious Bond film wouldn't go down too well.Personally, like most Moore films, TMWTGG is enjoyable, full of pizzazz, humorous, full of great one liners (""I am now aiming precisely at your groin. So speak now or forever hold your piece.""), but there's some edge - the fight scene in the caravan is quite tough and well-choreographed, Bond is left with a bleeding lip. Compared to Live and Let Die, TMWTGG lacks action but it's has a good car chase (spoilt slightly by the whistle stop sound), a neat karate sequence in the high-kicking school ( Roger's Bond shows cunningness by kicking karate guy in the face when he bows with out looking), and there's a tense finale in the fun house, though it should've been a bit longer. Christopher Lee (fangless yet still deadly)as Scaramanga drips with menace, and his interaction with Bond is amusing. The rest of the cast - Britt Ekland, Maud Adams, and Herve - are great. The title song rocks.Not as good as LALD, but it's still a solid Bond adventure.",The Man with the Golden Gun
85,pyrocitor,Funhouse - hold the fun,5,15 July 2015,"""He loves only gold,"" barked Shirley Bassey, setting an appropriate standard with the undisputed classic, Goldfinger. Indeed, gold has been good to Bond, gilding the titles of two of the franchise's highlights, including 1995's bold, post-cold war reinvention GoldenEye. ""But,"" fans of the series whisper darkly, ""there is another."" The exception to the golden rule. We speak, of course, of The Man with the Golden Gun.To its credit, the film gets off to a rather impressive start, introducing an antagonist so compelling the entire post-credits stinger is devoted to him in his element, rather than Bond's usual splashy hijinks. Embodied by the imposing Christopher Lee, the debonair, icily proficient Francisco Scaramanga presents an antagonist who (finally) poses a genuine threat to 007! The script echoes this tension, keeping the conflict taut (Bond, targeted by Scaramanga, must beat his prospective assassin to the puncher, shot), with an intriguingly topical ""energy crisis"" subplot slow-burning in the background to keep things interesting. Wasting no time, Bond flits around Southeast Asia, with the normally suave-to-the-point-of-being-cuddly Roger Moore demonstrating a noticeably steely edge, slapping Maude Adams' femme fatale around enough to make Sean Connery wince, and pilfering grim one-liners from Dirty Harry (""This rifle is pointed precisely at your groin, so speak now, or forever hold your piece""). He's even suave enough to sell TWO poop jokes(?!) as clever and terse. What a tense, gripping spy adventure, just what one would expect from Goldfinger director Guy Hamilton! I can't wait to see what happens next! oh yes you can.Once Bond, accompanied by requisite kung-fu cop Hip (the cheerily charismatic Soon-Tek Oh), trails Scaramanga to the Thailand estate of shady entrepreneur Hai Fat (the classy but largely wasted Richard Loo), things take a turn. Almost imperceptibly, the thrilling Southeast Asian setting begins to become exploited for its dubiously stereotypical potential – see Bond be embarrassingly subjected to sumo wrestler combat! See Bond be sent to karate school for no purpose other than a protracted montage designed to piggyback off the recent popularity of Enter the Dragon (the only upside: this is likely the only moment ever to occur in a 007 film where Bond takes the backseat in an action sequence to two Asian women). Before you know it, Roger Moore has pushed a small Taiwanese boy off a boat, as the film spirals into steadily incomprehensible subplots clouding its prior focus. All the while, the Lulu/John Barry title theme (catchy at first, grating when repeated ad nauseum) continues to twinkle on in the background, marking every set change with a stereotypical gong, and providing some of the least thrilling chase accompaniment imaginable. Things aren't looking promising.And then, just when the audience's political correctness senses were already tingling, in swaggers Cliffton James' J.W. Pepper. That's right – back by unpopular demand, the unfathomably obnoxious, unfunny, and all-around offensive redneck sheriff who already nearly harpooned Moore's debut in Live and Let Die. And this time, he comes with a chewing-tobacco-swilling mouthful of jaw-dropping racial slurs. What – you're not laughing? Pepper's braying even ruins an otherwise fairly entertaining car chase, although the film's infamous corkscrew car jump stunt being marred by a ludicrous slide-whistle that would put Bugs Bunny to shame is a pretty good indication of the shameful mess the film has devolved into. Just in case the bar wasn't lowered enough, however, Hamilton (now firmly channelling the unforgivable camp of Diamonds are Forever, rather than Goldfinger) has his previously compelling antagonist escape in a plane-car. Yes. A plane-car. If it sounds implausibly silly, even for the 1970s, it's because it is.If anything, this is all nearly worth it for the immediate cut to Bernard Lee's M exhibiting the most spectacularly grumpy, incredulous facial expression in cinema history. ""Of all the fouled-up, half-witted operations!"" he rumbles. Bernard Lee: you may as well have just spouted the poster quote.At this point, it's purely up to Christopher Lee to keep this dire mess afloat. Thankfully – when Hamilton finally remembers he's still around – Lee doesn't disappoint. A cocktail of icy threat (his eerily calm monologue recount his first kill is one for the ages), preening self-satisfaction (witness him predatorily caressing Maude Adams with his brazenly phallic titular weapon), and his bizarre giddiness when confronting Bond demonstrating volumes of a fractured human being seeking validation at all costs, Scaramanga remains, in many ways, the Bond villain to beat. His climactic shootout with Bond, bizarre funhouse setting and all, thankfully adds a welcome splash of tension that momentarily reminds us of the film that was (the spectacularly beautiful scenery of Scaramanga's Taiwanese island also gives the film a welcome bump of quality). Naturally, Hamilton quickly pulls the rug out from under us with the most unsatisfying resolution imaginable, followed by an excruciatingly long and dull ""oh no, everything is exploding"" denouement. Ah well.And, lest we forget, Britt Ekland, evidently instructed to act as little as possible, also manages to put forward her candidacy for most irritating, asinine 'Bond girl' in the franchise's history as the loathsome 'Mary Goodnight,' so awful that even Moore appears incapable of hiding his disgust when sharing scenes with her. Hervé Villechaize is momentarily fun as Scaramanga's eerily omnipresent henchman Nick Nack, but even he is reduced to an embarrassing annoyance by the end. As such, it's left to the infallible Desmond Llewellyn to scrounge some scraps of humour as an oddly chipper Q, but saving the film is beyond even his technical wizardry.The Man with the Golden Gun's devolution from compelling beginning to risible finale remains one of the 007 franchise's biggest bellyflops. Although the film isn't a complete write-off, largely thanks to Christopher Lee outclassing the film surrounding him like a suffocating sarcophagus, there is little else 'golden' about Hamilton's final product other than misguided intentions gone haywire. One for the more forgiving Bond diehards only.-5/10",The Man with the Golden Gun
86,Maciste_Brother,A nice change from the usual formula,7,12 June 2007,"Often cited as one of the worst James Bond films, THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN is one of my favorite of the series. Though I've seen every 007 films, some several times, I cannot describe myself as being an avid fan, so I can't be bothered with who was the best Bond and which film was most faithful to the books and which Bond girl was the best, etc. Differentiating one Bond film from the next is almost like differentiating one Twinkie from another Twinkie: simply put, it's formula film-making. With GOLDEN GUN, I can sorta see why some might think it's not up to the usual 007 extravaganza: it just doesn't follow the formula like other Bond films. There are no gadgets here and the ending is not as spectacular as other Bond flicks or some characters (the sheriff) might seem trite but of all other 007 adventures, this is the most down to earth one. I love the fact that there's no huge battle at the climax or ridiculous gadgets (the invisible car in DIE ANOTHER DAY, for example). This a Bond adventure that can actually be described as being sorta believable, which is no mean feat. What's remarkable about GOLDEN GUN is the cinematography. The composition, the natural colors, the realism of it all. I've just watched the latest DVD edition and the image is clear and beautiful. Gone is the grubby cinematography of LIVE AND LET DIE. But it's also not as super-slick as other Bond made before or after this one. It's an odd thing to cite beautiful cinematography for such a commercial project as this one. The most stunning scenes are at the end, when Bond flies to Scaramanga's secret base.The other great thing about GOLDEN GUN is casting Christopher Lee as Scaramanga. It's his best role/performance ever. And he's the best villain in any 007 film. Scaramanga is a real character, not a cartoon villain like 90% of Bond villains. The fact that the story is about two men going mano a mano is also a nice change from the tired ""villain who wants to dominate the world"" plot line. Casting Lee as Scaramanga was a stroke of genius. He's what makes THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN so memorable.Lastly, the other memorable element is John Barry's score. It's one of his most evocative for a James Bond film. When I hear it, I can't get it out of my mind.As Bond girls, Britt Ekland and Maud Adams are absolutely gorgeous. Though Adams' acting can be described as stiff, she's one of the classiest and is the saddest Bond girl ever (her actions propel the story) while Ekland is funny as the ditsy operative. The belly dancer at the beginning was, hmm, scary looking though. The film's biggest weak points are: the script, which is sorely underwritten in some spots; the re-introduction of JW Pepper character, which even if he's quite funny here, is just too improbable; and the blatant AMC product placement. The last two points almost make GOLDEN GUN ""jump the shark"" but after the excellent climax, all is forgiven.But the big glaring mistake in THE MAN WITH GOLDEN GUN, and probably the main reason why so many Bond fans don't like this film, is the fact that Bond doesn't appear before the opening credits. No kick-ass intro action scene with Bond in a jet-pack or falling out of plane without a parachute that sets the tone for the rest of the film. I have to admit that the film seems to be missing something because of that.Even so, there are still many other reasons why GOLDEN GUN is my favorite: the entire karate school scene, which is the high point of the film. The abrupt ""kick to the head"" joke was even copied years later with Indy shooting the big man with the big sword in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK; the arena scene (excellent direction there); the whole 1970s look; a confident Roger Moore who gives his best performance as 007 and says some of the funniest one liners of the series with impeccable timing. And let's not forget about Herve Villechaize as Nick Nack. He almost steals every scene he's in, which is either good or bad, depending on how you like him. In closing, THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN has just the right balance of seriousness, action, acting, exotic locations and humor.",The Man with the Golden Gun
87,Joxerlives,Roger's second outing and a little better than it's predecessor,7,16 March 2014,"An interesting Bond film, concentrating at first very much on the character of the villain rather than of the hero (did you recognise the actor playing the hit-man as one of Blofield's Vegas hoods in 'Diamonds are Forever'? I wonder if it was intended to be the same character?). You genuinely get the idea that Scaramanga is one of the few Bond villains to be a genuine match for him, complete with his own impressive set of deadly gadgets, beautiful women and expensive tastes. His backstory is intriguing too, notably this is a unique villain in that he never seeks out Bond or vice-versa, their meeting is arranged by his mistress who wants Bond to kill him for her.Maud Addams is a great Bond girl, beautiful and tough yet so terrified of Scaramanga who keeps her as a virtual slave in a gilded cage and yet kills her in cold blood and dismisses her as replaceable with barely a second thought. The scene where Bond realises she's dead and takes her hand almost tenderly as he searches for the McGuffin (because of course for 007 the mission comes first)is actually quite touching, that he is sorry that he couldn't save this doomed heroine. Still, she gets to come back in Octopussy, the first Bond girl ever to do so. Britt Ekland by contrast is utterly terrible, just existing to screw up and be the butt of many jokes. Nice humour though, Bond kicking his opponent in the dojo whilst bowing is terrific, a move that preceding Indy shooting the swordsman by many years. The kick-ass schoolgirls are great, Bond's ingenuity in the final shootout (all very Avengers, especially the episode 'Game') is very clever and do love his ""I'll have to owe you line"". Good stuff but I'll be glad when we get on to the two classic Moore Bonds.",The Man with the Golden Gun
88,Beta_Gallinger,"Another long Bond film, with some rather dull moments, but it's not all bad, and eventually gets better",7,15 August 2008,"The year after Roger Moore first appeared in the role of James Bond in 1973's ""Live and Let Die"", marking the beginning of his twelve-year stint in the role, he returned for the ninth film in the franchise, and his second of seven. Recently, knowing that this wasn't the most widely praised of all the official Bond films, I watched it with fairly low expectations, but I think my expectations were at least slightly surpassed. Like the first film starring Moore, this one didn't blow me away consistently, but I found a lot of it entertaining, mostly later in the film (if it wasn't for that, I doubt I could rate it any more than a 6/10).Francisco Scaramanga is a renowned hit-man who uses a golden gun with golden bullets, which is why he is known as ""the man with the golden gun""! MI6 receives a golden bullet with ""007"" on it, which suggests that James Bond is Scaramanga's next target! Because of this threat, M decides to dismiss Bond from his duties until the problem is solved. Nonetheless, Agent 007 sets out in search for Scaramanga, and during his search, he witnesses the assassination of a man who turns out to be a scientist creating a device that can harness the sun's power! Bond must track down this machine, and on his mission, he must go through Andrea Anders (Scaramanga's mistress), and Nick Nack (the hit man's servant), as he is assisted on the mission by Mary Goodnight, a mission which eventually leads to a showdown between the secret agent and his main foe! Like ""Live and Let Die"", this one has some tedious moments, unsurprisingly, and for a while, it seemed to me that it was turning out to be slightly inferior to Moore's first Bond film, but like I said, I was more impressed later in the film, with a decent amount of suspense and humour. They brought back Sheriff J.W. Pepper, the stereotypical Southerner introduced in ""Live and Let Die"", for comic relief in this movie. The character made me laugh in the 1973 Bond film, once again gave me some laughs this time, and as I stated in my comment on the first film featuring him, I don't see why I should feel guilty for finding Sheriff J.W. Pepper amusing if I'm willing to laugh at Canadian stereotypes. One very memorable sequence is where Bond chases after a car with Pepper inside with him, which is both suspenseful AND humorous (humourous thanks to the presence of Pepper). After that, a lot of suspense takes place on the island.Like ""Live and Let Die"", this second Bond film starring Roger Moore is rather polarizing with Bond fans, but both films, while not the best, I have found to be reasonably satisfying, and in my opinion, while Moore can't quite match Sean Connery (the first actor to play Ian Fleming's famous character, as I'm sure you know), he was a decent replacement, unlike George Lazenby, who was only in one film in the franchise (1969's ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service""), in between Connery's last two (1967's ""You Only Live Twice"" and 1971's ""Diamonds Are Forever""). Christopher Lee is also impressive as the main villain in this particular movie. So, while I wouldn't watch ""The Man with the Golden Gun"" expecting to be blown away, I would say it's worth watching, though some would obviously disagree.",The Man with the Golden Gun
89,vip_ebriega,The Weakest of the Bond films.,3,8 May 2007,"My Take: Christopher Lee's turn as the villain can't save this silly, mostly boring 007 entry. I have long regarded ""The Man with the Golden Gun"" as the weakest entry, not just of Roger Moore's, but the entire franchise. This film boasts a fine performance by Christopher Lee as the lead baddie Francisco Scaramanga, but Moore is obviously unsatisfying in this entry and Britt Ekland only manages to steal a scene in the last half hour in her sexy bikini, otherwise she's totally useless. The film concerns an attempt to assassinate James Bond. An attempt by assassin Scaramanga and his golden gun, which is mainly composed of everyday items, all made of gold. It's up to Bond to stop him, which leads him to Thailand, a confrontation with Scaramanga and his feisty little sidekick Knick Knack (Herve Villechaize), a Kung Fu battle and a boat chase (once again).On some parts, the fantastic stunts are fun. But for most parts its a bit boring, and filled with the silliest elements even for a Bond film. Even the title song (sung by Lulu) is arguably the worst of all the Bond theme songs. An attempt to make a goofier 007 movie isn't always successful (see DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER and OCTOPUSSY), and this one most likely demonstrates the worst. Worth seeing if you're a Bond fan, otherwise a weak and rather unsatisfying entry with too few moments with Lee and the stunts.Rating: *1/2 out of 5.",The Man with the Golden Gun
90,one9eighty,A duel between titans... my golden gun against your Walther PPK.,7,10 August 2020,"In Bond's 9th official outing, Roger Moore returns to battle ""The Man with the Golden Gun"".While attempting to recover a ""Solex Agitator"" (a device that can harness the suns radiation to make a powerful weapon) MI6 receive a golden bullet with ""007"" engraved into it. Believing Bond is the next target for the renown super assassin and triple nippled, Francisco Scaramanga, M wants Bond off the case. Bond thinks differently though, the only way to beat the assassin is to beat the assassin first. Cleverly, Scaramanaga isn't initially after Bond, he regards him highly, but Scaramanga never misses; and when an attempt on Bond's life is seemingly failed, Bond soon realises the bullet wasn't meant for him (this time anyway), it was meant for the person it hit, the scientist working on the ""Solex Agitator"". Bond now must kill Scaramanga, before he kills Bond.This is Moore's second outing as Bond and is a marked improvement on ""Live and Let Die"". For me, he is a lot better here, more assured albeit still tongue in cheek with his approach and quips. Christopher Lee plays Scaramanga and is one of the best and most memorable Bond villains. In fact, he is the evil mirror image of what Bond is. While Moore plays Bond as welcoming and charming, Lee plays Scaramanga as menacingly confident and direct - straight to the point. It is understandable then that the 'World's most expensive assassin' needs one shot of his golden gun to take down his targets, and he never misses. Scaramanga even compares himself to Bond in one particular monologue, claiming that ""ours is the loneliest profession"". What is more menacing than somebody who needs one sight of his target to finish the job, even from the shadows. It is also this simplistic approach that brings some normality to the film, previous outings had started to become to camp and over the top, taking the Bond film franchise in a direction that the books never did. Now I do know that the book to this film and the film are miles apart, but this film worked because at the heart of it, it was simple, a few complications and twists were thrown in to make it look less simple, but once you get to the heart of it, it's two (almost) equals facing off against each other.In terms of side kicks or henchemen, Herve Villechieze (Fantasy Island) appears as Knick-Knack. I do not actually think the film needed him. This felt like it was part of the formulaic aspects that previous films called for. Villechieze does well in his role, he is melevonant and mischievous and even get's away with shushing Bond. He nearly steals every scene he is in, if not certainly demanding attention form the audience when he appears. Britt Ekland and Maud Adams are cast as the Bond girls, Adams actually acts as a temporary vehicle to progress the film. She may be wooden at times, but she has a beauty in the sadness she portrays too. I will refrain from going into detail about Ekland, I do not think she was added to give much to the story in terms of brains. Bernard Lee, Lois Maxwell and Desmond Llewelyn return to their usual roles which makes the film feel like home. On the downside of the casting, Sheriff Pepper (Clifton James) reappears, which for me is a mistake - it feels like a forced casting to give some American humour to the film. Sure, there are other moments of comedy scattered in the film, but adding the Sheriff again felt like the biggest forced part.Style wise, the cinematography in this film is brilliant. The colours, the scenery, in fact the whole cinematography is great and as far away from ""Live and Let Die"" as it is possible to get. Everything just feels cleaner, slicker, more colourful and a lot cleaner. I cannot say Iiked the hall of mirrors much in the later part of the film, this was too much like ""Enter the Dragon"", but to be fair, films borrow and lend from one and other. There is a part in the karate school during the film where Bond goes for knock out blow instead of messing around, much like was used in ""Indiana Jones: Raiders of the Lost Arc"" some years later.This film sees the return of a more spy like hero, rather than a comic superhero he was becoming. Something that could be truer than super villains in hollowed out volcanoes, or with giant lasers. It is a quieter and more subtle film than the others and then a lot of people expected or remember. It is still cheesy at times, but it is not super cheesy. While Moore is not my favourite Bond, in this film he does exceptionally well, and the film really tried to get the franchise back on a good track. In Lee's Scaramanga you have one of the best Bond villains in the franchise. A great iconic theme tune (sung by Lulu) starts off what is a great film in my opinion, one I certainly enjoy more than others. It bridges the gap between Connery's dark Bond and the comic Bond that Moore brought in his first outing. Directed by Guy Hamilton and written for screen by Richard Maibaum and Tom Mankiewicz, this is a family friendly Bond with a sprinkling of darkness. Action, adventure, thrills, spills, romance, comedy and tensions await you in the 125 min film.In terms of Bond films this is an 8 out of 10.In terms of movies in the long and illustrious history of film I would give this a 7 out of 10.",The Man with the Golden Gun
91,Stampsfightclub,Average Bond adventure,7,10 August 2006,"Personally I'm not a huge fan of James Bond films because of all the similar conventions used and the lack of realism always puts me off but however this Ian Fleming adventure is one of the more creative and engaging Bond adventures. Roger Moore reprised his role as the English secret agent to sufficient effect as he brings his charm to the central protagonist in an attempt to capture the slickness and charisma that is always expected of Bond. This Bond film shows the character seeking out Scaramanger when he hears the villain is after him. It sounds crazy and in a sense it was for me but it was a different method for Bond to seek out the villain who is also looking for him. This film differs from other Bond films because it's a more tactical approach. Bond tries to use all the clues to great effect and for once I was able to follow the plot, even if the majority of clues found are over exaggerated but still very engaging. The action scenes are kept to a minimum which is good because I feel there are always too many action scenes which try to win over the fans. Having scenes where Bond is using his knowledge to effect instead of act first and ask questions later. The acting by Moore is as interesting as ever as he stars as Bond, delivering the typical back stabbing sarcastic lines as expected. The majority of cheesy catchphrases are funny when Bond gets his way with the women and treads on the bad guys. The character of Scaramanger is appealing but he is not a classic Bond villain. Lee performs well but many viewers will feel he wasn't as strong as was necessary to convince the audience to his power. A lot of information towards the end is thrown in and the film has jumped instantly from a flowing to a confusing couple of scenes as the ideologies put forth will mislead the audience and make them think too much too late. If you find yourself bored one afternoon then watch it, don't go out of your way. It is more interesting than the likes of other Moore Bond adventures such as Moonraker and Live and Let Die. It is one of my favourite Bond adventures but doesn't compare to Goldeneye or 'the world is not enough'",The Man with the Golden Gun
92,eminkl,Quirky titular killer nudges this into the top half of Bond's catalog,7,22 April 2020,"A nice return to form for the series, after wading in cheese up to their knees with the preceding Live and Let Die. It won't be giving From Russia With Love or Goldfinger a run for their money, but as the back-to-basics reality check that the series so desperately needed, this is more than acceptable. Roger Moore confidently plays a tougher, more businesslike Bond this time around, and spends most of the production flexing his detective chops in search of a rival assassin with nothing more to go on than the color of his weapon and a quick, curious nipple count. Stocked with fresh, exotic locales, skimpy beauties dressed for the beach, an adequate number of wacky, themed sidekicks (as in, less than the full dozen of the former picture) and a cool, legitimate master threat, this is pretty much the root formula for a good adventure with 007. Occasionally it gives in to a passion for pointless boat chases, and a few bad remnants of the era rear their head at inopportune moments (what was with the slide whistle during that massive car jump?) but such silly bits of self-indulgence are a part of the franchise's heritage at this point. Excellent work by Christopher Lee as the quirky titular killer nudges this into the top half of Bond's catalog.",The Man with the Golden Gun
93,The_Movie_Cat,The glorious heights of kitsch,6,22 August 2001,"WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS
I couldn't stand The Man With The Golden Gun the first time I saw it. Sandwiched between the style of Live and Let Die and the silly spectacle of The Spy Who Loved Me/Moonraker it seemed lacking in both class and event. Stripped of all invention, save for gimmickry, this is James Bond at its most basic, its most formulaic. The weary predictability of scenes  including the ""shock"" reappearance of the henchman at the climax  showed a series devoid of all inspiration. I note that this was the shortest time between consecutive Bond entries since the mid-60s, in order to capitalise on Roger Moore's impressive first box office. Sadly, due to disappointing returns, it also has the distinction of having (Legal wrangles for the Dalton/Brosnan changeover notwithstanding) the longest gap between follow-ups, with another movie not being produced until 1977.Yet watched a second time this one is actually a great deal of fun. For not even counting the competent direction and rewardingly exotic locales, this is first and foremost a movie that revels in its own awfulness. This is no more evident than in the title song, enthusiastically performed by Lulu. Starting with some cranked-up, jingly-jangly guitars, this frankly bonkers pop song accelerates straight through the theme titles and doesn't even bother to synchronise with them. A bawling Lulu meanwhile launches into barely disguised innuendo, including such lines as ""He has a powerful weapon"" and ""who will he bang?"" Why doesn't she just sing ""he gives me one up the cacker"" and have done with it?This is a film so stupid that it trashes its own showpiece stunt (a corkscrew jump with a car) by placing a silly tin whistle sound effect over the top. Having oriental and rag time renditions of the theme tune playing within the film itself is cheesy genius, while Bond's kicking a Kung-Fu fighter in the head while he bows could easily have inspired Raiders of the Lost Ark. Also a bonus is M asking ""What do you know about a man called Scaramanga, 007?""  only to have Roger, tongue rammed into cheek, reciting over forty seconds of exposition.The racial/deformity characteristics for the villains seem even more tasteless this time around  three nipples for Scaramanga, a French Midget for his henchman  while a pointless later scene implies a black servant is a potential rapist. Britt Ekland doesn't give much of an impression and is strictly a sexist ""bimbo"" characterisation, but she does look lovely throughout, particularly in the bikini. (Which got her the part, apparently).Though maybe what's really lacking is anything resembling a plot. It is nice to see Christopher Lee out-suaving Moore; even though you know when Bond meets the world's greatest assassin there can be only one winner. Though having him win the day by using trickery in a glorified funhouse is also a little unsatisfying, as is him alluding to the word s**t. This is the witty, gentleman spy we've grown to know over the years? As Scaramanga, Christopher Lee is a more believable villain than usual because he doesn't overplay. His affected and understated insanity work far better than the usual ranting megalomaniac does, even if this isn't at first evident.As for Roger Moore, his performance has already spilled over into puerility after just one movie, though there are complications with the character. After his debut and before his older, craggier appearances, there's a nastier, vicious edge underneath. Combining this with a barrage of puns produces a slightly arrogant portrayal, and seeing him bed Maud Adams after beating her is unsettling. There's also something so flippant about Roger c.1974-79 that means he fails to command the attention for a film's entire duration.Just when you think it can't get any sillier, along comes redneck Sheriff J.W.Pepper from Live and Let Die. There's even a scene where Moore does a Jim Dale-style Carry On double take when accidentally swallowing a bullet. Watched in context, this is just another example of the degeneration of the series during the mid-70s. Seen in isolation, The Man With The Golden Gun is endearingly awful and a must-see.",The Man with the Golden Gun

98,K3nzit,One of the good ones,7,3 January 2020,One of the better movies in the series. Despite the fact that I'm far from a fan of Roger Moore as Bond. The villain is played by the legendary Christopher Lee and Bond girls by Sweden's Britt Ekland and Maud Adams. Clifton James makes a return appearance as Sheriff J. W. Pepper - The funniest Bond character ever.,The Man with the Golden Gun
99,LeRoyMarko,So-so,6,30 April 2001,"Not one of the best Bond films, by far. A little too much bad comedy for my taste. The sheriff J.W. Pepper character is not at all funny and Nick Nack doesn't deliver the fun that we expect from him. The ladies are beautiful -just like in other Bond movies-, especially Goodnight, played by Britt Ekland. Roger Moore is good in his role, but I think Christopher Lee surpasses him with his great portrayal of the villain.Out of 100, I gave it 72.",The Man with the Golden Gun
100,Igenlode Wordsmith,Mirror image Bond,7,26 May 2009,"Roger Moore is far from being my Favourite Bond, so I went into this film without any great expectations, prompted chiefly by curiosity as to Christopher Lee's role in it. But to my surprise and pleasure I found that I actually thoroughly enjoyed it.Christopher Lee, as promised, is excellent, aided by an intriguing script which enlists audience sympathies on his side in the pre-credit sequence before we are made aware of his identity, and which presents him as, frankly, rather more resourceful and in control than Roger Moore's Bond. The obligatory sequence in which the villain has Bond in his power but carelessly omits to kill him is given an interesting new twist by the revelations about Scaramanga's actual assassination intentions, and Lee's subsequent performance makes the final showdown psychologically credible.At this stage of Moore's tenure, his portrayal of Bond had yet to settle down to its later self-caricature, and in fact I found that the character is not depicted in this film as especially sympathetic: this is effective as a lot of the humour here is at Bond's own expense. I can see that real Fleming aficionados might find this 'disrespectful' approach alienating, but as I had always found Moore's Bond rather annoying I have to say that I enjoyed watching his misadventures and the quips at his expense: it was only with the re-approach of the smug action-hero element towards the end of the film that my tolerance began to fade.The women, I'm afraid, were rather a disappointment. Britt Ekland might have fared better as an exotic temptress but seemed wooden in the unrewarding role of the English-rose agent Mary Goodnight, although the plot does provide a plausible rationale for having her spend the entire last act running around in a bikini. Maud Adams manages a little more psychological conviction as the double-crossing Andrea but, for a girl who takes armed showers, appears equally ill-equipped to take care of herself.One unifying theme which ultimately proves significant is that of the cardboard cutout or model that comes in some manner 'to life'. Another, of course, is the concept of a 'golden gun' itself. The famous car stunt, I'm afraid, I assumed to be a model shot (a modern generation will probably take it for CGI), but there are plenty of stunts and chase sequences for those who relish that sort of thing.Worth watching for Christopher Lee alone and a surprisingly enjoyable performance by Roger Moore. The final explosive sequence is generic and the coda fairly unfunny, but with Bond films both are beloved by fans and more or less traditional.",The Man with the Golden Gun
101,mikayakatnt,An enjoyable Bond film that's memorable,7,10 February 2021,"You know it's a film from the '70s when one of the big plot points revolves around the energy crisis.20 minutes into The Man with the Golden and I was ready to hate this movie. An inconceivable plot where some assassin sends a bullet with 007's name on it. Like, isn't he supposed to be a SECRET agent? Also, Bond blurting out Scaramanga's entire backstory when asked seemed a bit of lazy writing. Show, not tell, y'all.The plot itself seemed a bit too... ""small"" for Bond. A man who has saved the world many times over is now bothered by this challenge of a duel.Yet, as the movie progressed, I saw why this film solidified itself in the Bond universe. Exotic, beautifully otherworldy, locations and set pieces. A sophisticated yet cold-blooded antagonist. And a variety of action that breaks the typical shoot-kill-shoot-kill action movies. Not to mention Bond-style humor. The pros for this film still hold well to this day.Many people don't like Roger Moore's portrayal of Bond, but this was one of his better performances. Though, he does visibly stumble in the more physically demanding scenes.A Bond is only as good as his adversary. And Christopher Lee plays an unforgettable performance as Francisco Scaramanga. Hiding away on his tropical island, the man with the golden gun plays a cool, sophisticated killer. His wish to prove himself as the world's best assassin is his pure motivation.And Nick Nack. Herve Villechaize plays a big role in the film as Scaramanga's servant. Though his height is used as comic relief, his presence was a bit terrifying as he could blend in any crowd. There were times the pacing of the movie slowed down only for Nick Nack to appear and wreak havoc.The pacing of the film itself seems to have many fillers and some plotholes. Yet enough happens at each place for me to be enamored more by the beauty of each location to care. This movie seems to be more about style than substance.Now for the part that bothered me the most. The film's ""Bond girl."" Many people have ranked Mary Goodnight as Bond's worst companion in the entire franchise. And I have to agree. Mary Goodnight plays the somewhat airheaded eye candy that is more comic relief than serious character. Every time she tries to assist Bond, she only hinders him. Her character is more frustrating than anything else.But that's not Britt Ekland's fault at all. She did the best she could in a screenplay that did not value its women characters. Shame that there was much potential for more.4.5/5 but with cons I have to knock this down to 3.5/5. It's an enjoyable Bond film that is worth its entry into the Bond universe... even if the plot doesn't make sense upon second glance.",The Man with the Golden Gun
102,perfectbond,Very unappreciated,8,17 November 2003,"Bond and Scaramanga face off in a clash between titans. I know I'm in the minority but I liked this film even more than The Spy Who Loved Me as the best of the Moore Bond films. Roger Moore and Christopher Lee were superb in conveying their stature and competition with each other. Britt Eklund though not a gifted thespian made great a Bond girl on her looks alone. And Knick Knack can still be taken seriously in the context of the tone that the Moore films chose to take. Connery and Brosnan purists will shudder at his appearance though. If you like redneck comic relief then Sheriff Pepper makes a welcome return. If you think he makes the film too much of a farce, you'll have to endure him as a blemish in this otherwise excellent film. 8/10.",The Man with the Golden Gun
103,timdalton007,The Man With The Golden Gun? More Like The Film Made With Fool's Gold,2,24 October 2011,"If Live And Let Die was the film that saved James Bond, then The Man With The Golden Gun is the film that just about killed it again. With the success of Roger Moore's debut Bond film, producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman sought to follow it up as a fast as they possibly could. This rush to follow up one success produced one of the least successful films of the series.Roger Moore follows up a good debut performance with a performance that is anything but good. Like Sean Connery in You Only Live Twice and Diamonds Are Forever, Moore's performance is basically sleepwalking his way through the film. His line delivery is flat virtually the whole way through no matter what the situation is be it facing down villains, seducing women or making any one of the horrible one liners. The result is one of the worst performances of any actor in the role.Much the same can be said of Britt Ekland as Mary Goodnight. Goodnight embodies the very cliché of what a Bond girl is: a pretty face and not an ounce of acting talent. She does little more in the film than whine about how Bond is treating her yet keeps trying to get into bed with him. Outside of this whininess and helping to get the last act of the film going, neither the actress nor the character add much to the film otherwise. The result is pretty close to the worst Bond girl ever.Much more interesting than either Bond or Goodnight is the villain: Francisco Scaramanga played by Christopher Lee. Scaramanga is almost the anti-Bond: he's suave, charming, seductive and a man who kills for money. Lee plays the role brilliantly, encompassing all of those aspects into his performance. This villain, in the hands of a lesser actor, could easily have been one dimensional, is instead a fleshed out character that is far more interesting than anyone else in the film. In fact, it's almost a shame that Christopher Lee never got the chance to be James Bond himself based on his performance here.The rest of the cast is almost a disaster. Virtually the entire cast is played for laughs whether it is Herve Villechaize as Nick Nack, Richard Loo's over the top performance as Hai Fat and of course the unnecessary, cringe-worthy return of Clifton James as J.W. Pepper. Soon-Taik Oh's performance as Lieutenant Hip is okay, but heavily undermined by some bad dubbing. Even the usual supporting cast members disappoint such as Bernard Lee's grouchy M. If there is a shining star of the supporting cast its Maud Adams as Scaramanga's mistress Andrea Anders who, like Scaramanga, outshines the rest of the cast. The result overall is one of the worst Bond casts yet assembled.The problem with the entire film is that it all feels rushed and lacks polish. The production design and cinematography are both good, but they lack something that worked so well in the previous Bond films. Maurice Binder turns in his first set of lackluster title sequences as well, further undermining the success of the film. Even the score from John Barry shows this lack of polish. Compare the score for this film with that of You Only Live Twice, another Bond film set largely in Asia, to illustrate the point. The score lacks Barry's usual lushness as it feels shockingly cramped and unoriginal. Much the same can be said of the title song as well. Barry is even guilty of taking the film's one truly good stunt piece and undermining it with a silly piece of music. Indeed, the entire film feels like it is being played more for laughs then for suspense, something that proves to be the undoing of it. Where does the fault of that come from though? Nothing else in the entire film is as big a culprit in that department then its script. It's a script filled with a lack of logic, overly convenient plot twists and bad one liner's. After a suspenseful pre-credit sequence, the film becomes little more than a list of Bond film clichés that undercuts suspense for the almost two hours that follows right up to the point that it manages to undermine its own climax. Writers Richard Maibaum and Tom Mankiewicz, along with director Guy Hamilton, simply reuse the formula they used in the two previous Bond films with the result being stale and unoriginal.At the end of the day, it is easy to see how this film ends up being named one of the worst Bond films ever. Despite an excellent villain and at least one good supporting cast member, this is a film that embodies everything that can be bad about a Bond film. Bond himself is uninteresting, the girl is window dressing, it's played for laughs and it's utterly formulaic. The Man With The Golden Gun? More like a film made with fool's gold",The Man with the Golden Gun
104,Bogmeister,BOND#9: Super Secret Agent vs.Supreme Assassin,6,9 June 2007,"MASTER PLAN: steal a new solar energy device, a solex agitator, and kill Bond as a perk. Roger Moore's 2nd outing as 007 has him in conflict with the world's premiere assassin, Scaramanga, a crackshot who uses a golden gun and golden bullets, charging a cool mil per kill. It sounds exciting, but ends up as one of the least interesting Bonders, an almost by-the-motions adventure. The actor who plays the mobster going thru Scaramanga's weird challenge in the pre-credits sequence also played a similar gangster role in ""Diamonds Are Forever."" It's kind of clever, as Bond sort of appears here, but really doesn't. This loopy set-up, however, which we return to at the conclusion when Bond enters the challenge, seems like a parody of the 'killer-maze' concept, eliciting eye-rolling rather than awe. The title song by Lulu is 'Bassey-light' - a subpar copy of Goldfinger and Diamonds Are Forever - and the lyrics are sophomoric. So far, we're seeing lame attempts to copy better elements from previous Bonders, and this continues throughout most of the movie. Bond makes his standard entry into M's office, but instead of being given a new mission, he's taken off one, due to his being apparently targeted by the Scaramanga character. Bond, of course, prefers being on the offensive and decides to trackdown his opponent (with M's tacit approval) rather than waiting around to be shot. This quest takes Bond to Beirut, Macau, Hong Kong, Bangkok and, eventually, off Thailand, to an island where Scaramanga has set up a really nice home base for himself.Q returns to this one (after being absent in the last one ""Live and Let Die"") in a couple of scenes, but dispenses information rather than any gadgetry; they're still good scenes. The strategy here continues from the previous film, that being more concentration on pure detective work and away from the gadgets. In fact, much of the gadgetry involves guns and ammunition, the tools of the villain - he assembles his gun from a cigarette lighter. On the downside, this film also followed the previous film's negative aspects; the last one emulated the blaxploitation trend in movies at this time; this one parroted the martial arts craze of the same time (Bruce Lee and so on) by including a few silly scenes of such fighting. Even worse, there's a ridiculous battle with a sumo wrestler - and it didn't have to be. The filmmakers seemed to be ridiculing their own superspy concept in these scenes, piling on the stupidity by returning the redneck sheriff of the previous film, who happens to be vacationing in Bangkok. Even Bond, or is it Moore, says 'oh, no...' when he sees this guy, mimicking the thoughts of the audience. Worst of all, though, is that the middle hour of this film, during which Bond seeks his nemesis, is rather boring, with such bad elements as mentioned above acting as filler to expand the story to two full hours. There are two femme fatales here - one is another clumsy agent (again repeating an element from the previous film) and the other is the villain's love slave. The latter makes more of an impact, containing tragic elements similar to Bond's love interest in ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service."" The other one, Bond's ally, comes across as somewhat silly and not very flattering in terms of depicting female agents.The main villain (played by tall actor Lee, best known for his Dracula portrayals in Hammer films, the sorcerer Saruman in the ""Lord of the Rings"" films and one of the villains in the last two Star Wars pics) could have been one of the great Bond adversaries. He's presented as Bond's opposite number, the dark version of Bond, if you will, with the same skills but none of the compunctions or morality. But, the best the story could do with such a potentially interesting opponent is give him some kinky aspects (he makes love only just before a kill) and an exotic deformity (a third nipple). Lee seems to downplay all the dark aspects, coming across as too cheerful and normal in his scenes; they even dressed him in dull clothes, squandering the chance to show off his lean, towering figure. His henchman, of course, is even worse; he can be amusing and irritating, sure, but these are not the characteristics of a good henchman in a Bond thriller. Bond himself is a bit more ruthless than in ""Live and Let Die,"" as if Moore was instructed to act a bit tougher (or, more like Connery), and he actually gets a bit bloodied in one fight scene (not the martial arts one), so we can't say he waltzed through without a scratch again. After most of the film as straight espionage/hunting, we do see some impressive sets unveiled at the villain's home during the climax, an exotic setting, with some hi-tech wizardry. The final duel is not very impressive, lacking any suspense, as if the filmmakers were at a loss and just got it over with. There is an impressive car stunt in the middle of the film, ruined by, what else, silly sound effects. Bond would return in ""The Spy Who Loved Me.""

106,grendelkhan,"A definite improvement, but still not quite there.",7,27 November 2012,"Live and Let Die was a bit of a mixed bag as Roger Moore's debut as James Bond. It has some good performances and amazing stunt sequences, but it descends into laughs at the wrong time, occasionally, and it catered too much to stereotypes. This time, we get a better villain and some great set pieces, but a bit of a schizophrenic plot.This film succeeds greatly due to the presence of Christopher Lee as Scaramanga. This is a man who may be Bond's mirror image; a charming killer who enjoys the good life. He could be Bond's biggest test, and in many ways, is just that. Unfortunately, the producers weren't satisfied with just pitting Bond against his opposite number and had to throw in a solar weapon plot on top of things. The two seem to be at odds here. There are amazing stunts, but the central piece, the car jump, is undercut by an out-of-place JD Pepper.The film has a great cast, with Maud Adams and Britt Eckland providing the beauty to accompany Lee's beast. Soon Tek-Oh makes for a fine ally, even if the producers think we can't tell the difference between a Korean and a Chinese actor. Then there is Herve Villachaise. He is a fine actor and the idea of going the opposite route for the henchman is intriguing, but Herve never pulls off deadly. Someone like Deep Roy, Michael Dunn, David Rappaport, or Peter Dinklage could have done so. Instead, Herve comes off as more comic than dangerous.The sets are fantastic, making for a nice return to form, with the MI-6 base, inside the capsized ship, truly memorable. Scaramanga's island home is another brilliant locale, mixing nature's beauty with man-made scenery.For the most part, the film is an entertaining romp. It deviates into comedy a bit too much every once in a while, but not for very long. Moore is completely comfortable in the role, proving that Bond can survive without Connery. Christopher Lee is the perfect assassin and plays his cat-and-mouse game with Bond, keeping you on the edge of your seat. It's a shame that the producers couldn't trust that battle to carry the film and needed the death ray mcguffin as a backup. For the most part, you ignore it until the climax, as the Bond/Scaramanga rivalry commands center stage. Unfortunately, it derails the ending. Still, this was a film that proved that Moore was going to work out in the long run.",The Man with the Golden Gun

109,FilmFanInTheHouse,The only good thing to come out of this film is Christopher Lee,6,15 January 2007,"The Man With The Golden Gun is Roger Moore's second Bond film, and it lets it down big time. The story is about recovering the solex agitator while stopping Scaramanga (Christopher Lee). Firstly the good things about the film. Christopher Lee is one of the best Bond villains on film. His presence makes him menacing and terrifying, whilst remaining calm and cool. Hes one of the few Bond villains who enjoy Bonds company before planning to kill him. His weapon of choice are also a highlight. His golden gun with its one shot kill ability is impressive in not just its power but its construction.There is also a wonderful car stunt which was and still is in ways impressive, but one thing which lets it down is the spinning sound effect added after. Add to this the pathetic fun house, which easily shouts at u the conclusion of the film. Once you've seen that Scaramanga had a wax dummy (which all move, thanks to the movable actors) of James Bond, you know that a switch will take place (one of the films biggest goofs i may add).After all this, it isn't impossible to watch the film.

110,jhaggardjr,Silly but fun 007 movie,7,21 May 2000,"""The Man with the Golden Gun"" is a sometimes silly, sometimes fun James Bond adventure starring Roger Moore. This movie, the 9th in the 007 franchise, takes the super spy to the Far East where he investigates a man named Scaramanga, the villain of the title played by veteran horror movie star Christopher Lee in an excellent performance. His presence, the exciting car stunts, and the fabulous Asian locations are the main attractions here. Britt Ekland as Goodnight is without a doubt the ditziest Bond girl in history. She had me laughing out loud most of the time she was on screen. Same goes for Clifton James' Sheriff J.W. Pepper, who reprises his role from the previous Bond film ""Live and Let Die"". Maud Adams fares better than Ekland as Andrea Anders, Scaramanga's love interest. Adams would eventually become the first actress to play different Bond women in two 007 films. She played the title character in the 1983 Bond film ""Octopussy"". Also on hand is the late Herve Villechaize (before TV's ""Fantasy Island"") as Scaramanga's diminutive sidekick Nick Nack. This character is also laughable. Moore is good as Bond, but he's not the best James Bond. Moore is better than Timothy Dalton, but Sean Connery and Pierce Brosnan are better than Moore. Sometimes Moore had me laughing at the antics he goes through in this movie. This is one of the funniest Bond movies of the series, and that's why its so much fun.

But Bond also makes himself a target for the deadly assassin who holds a healthy respect for Bond, but doesn't mean he won't take down the spy. In my opinion The Man with the Golden Gun is a solid Bond film with great action and a good theme song. But the biggest thing that held this movie down for me was the main character himself James Bond. At the start of the movie he was a big jerk, like he tried to break a girl arm to try to get answers out of but she didn't know nothing, But as the film went on he wasn't such a jerk like the beginning of the film. I got to admit I actually liked Roger Moore as James Bond in this film, he felt like Bond towards their end of the film. The villain in this movie was so good and so interesting, and Christopher Lee played him so well. The visual effect's in this movie was well done and for a movie that was released in 1974, it had some pretty nice effect's, better than today's effect's.

Should have been Moore's debut",8,6 August 2010,"Bond movie #9 of 23This movie comes across as a fan boy's dream...what if Bond was pitted against the world's greatest assassin? That's pretty much the movie. It's a comic book scenario, but it works a lot better than more stock-standard franchise scenarios. Comic book adaptations nowadays would give more time to the principle villain's back story, which this movie doesn't...though the theme song does a pretty good job of giving this kind of information on the villain.Many years ago I watched this movie on VHS. Rewatching it again the other week as part of a Bond movie festival on free to air TV here in Australia, I have to say that more than one scene rung a bell with me. That's a compliment to the visual imagery in this movie. Not that many movies have scenes that survive from childhood to adulthood, I don't think.Bond movie clichés - Exotic locations: Hong Kong, Macau, Thailand.Plot: Hired assassin Francisco Scaramanga signals to Bond's superiors that Bond is his next target. To protect Bond, his current mission is mothballed and he goes into hiding. Bond decides that offence is the best form of defence.Gun barrel shot: Check. Moore's sequences look professional compared to Connery's later efforts...someone should have taught Connery some proper technique! Pre-title sequence: A really interesting sequence which sets up the plot. Scaramanga is one of the more interesting villains in the Bond universe. He has a really freaky chest too! His character is established in this scene and whets the appetite for his inevitable duel with Bond.Theme song: Lulu's song, whilst not being a classic for Bond movies is nonetheless one of the franchise's superior efforts. Stylistically it's similar to ""Goldfinger""...i.e. a song about the principle villain of the movie.Q Branch: A staple of the franchise now. They do some bullet analysis in this movie.Moneypenny:More 'dancing' with Moneypenny by Bond. After the high point of the Bond series in ""On her majesty's secret service"", these exchanges become even more meaningless. It all seems pretty pointless.Silly female character names: A bit subdued here...Goodnight. Choo Mi is an amusing name though!Misogyny: Bond roughs up a woman to get information. Moore's Bond is carrying that torch from Connery's time. Roughing up women is still a staple of the series up to this point.Wine fetish: Not sure if my notes signal that this trait continues...Bond's ""know all"" manner ebs and flows in the series...he's more obnoxious in some movies than in others.Bond girls: Britt Ekland as Mary Goodnight is my pick as the most attractive love interest in the series to this point. Her relationship with Bond has a hue to it which I don't think has been replicated again...sort of a swingers vibe to them...sure, casual sex has always been a part of Bond's activities, but it just feels different here.End teaser: Check.Watch for: * Moore's superior portrayal of Bond here...he's not the ponce of his first up effort in ""Live and let die"". I.e. he has less of the Hugh Hefner about him here...and less of the Prince Philip demeanour too.* Timeless topicality...the energy crisis is discussed. A quarter of a century later, this topic is yet to lose its relevance.* 002 is mentioned. Another mention of Other spies who are licenced to kill. Scaramanga is supposed to have been his killer.* There's an amusing fight scene here...makes me wonder if it was the inspiration for a funny fight scene in the first Indiana Jones movie, I think.* Bond being rather ungentlemanly with a weapons maker (Lazar).* The Macau Casino scene has an oriental sounding Bond theme...it's a pity that this doesn't appear on compilations from the series. Might have been on Connery's ""You only live twice"" where there was a similarly interesting use of oriental sounding music.* The return of one of the most annoying characters in any Bond movie...he first appeared in ""Live and let die"". Hmm...who thought that character was funny first time around? Wonder what Americans made him both times? * A fantastic stunt...in the literal sense of ""fantastic"". Some absurd technology.* Hervé Villechaize. Not sure if I heard him say ""De plane boss! De plane!"" as Bond approached from the sky! * Note to self - verify that the Queen Elizabeth I (QE1) really is beached in Hong Kong.Overall, an entertaining movie...interesting plot compared to Moore's debut in the role. I'm aware that many people consider Sean Connery to be the greatest embodiment of Bond, but having seen Moore's movies recently, it seems that Moore has the lion's share of superior movies. He doesn't get enough credit for being in so many good movies, in my view.",The Man with the Golden Gun
113,willcundallreview,"Not the best Bond, but hard to find what is bad",6,22 March 2014,"Rating-6/10The Man with the Golden Gun is a Bond film that maybe is nowhere near the best, but manages to be a quirky different paced Bond with a more intricate thought story and a villain who nearly or maybe even does overshadow Bond. It is full of adventure but maybe holds back on the action and stunts but still manages enough to be a fun film to watch and the story takes the upper level here, as opposed to the things we see happen. I felt it was a strongly OK film and here is why I felt so.The story is slower and much more reserved than most of Connery's before but I personally felt that is was a good crime film, the villain was illusive and we didn't meet him before the final part of the film. The plot is solid as well and it's Bond being a secret agent again, now he does hold back on gadgets and stunts yes but if anything this Bond is one of the most rational Bond's of this kind of era as although the villain is superbly ambitious, he is also just simply an assassin.Moore is at his same self as his first film and performs well enough not for the Bond to become boring and very stale. Christopher Lee is the biggest character in this with his villainous performance and terrific acting skill making him one of the most memorable Bond villains around. I felt the entire cast did an OK job and as I said when times were more quiet with just Bond kind of walking around, the cast made it dramatic and nice and managed to create an interesting film even though the plot is subdued.The script, direction and cinematography are all basic and don't deserve any extra praise in a sense, I did however enjoy whoever the location scouts were because some places used are beautiful and literally make the film slightly better. The sets are also brilliant and on a large scale too making this Bond one of the most realistic Bond's for a little while. I also did enjoy the few stunts in this film, especially the Boat scene with Bond which is similar to the one on Live and Let Die(in more ways than one).The film as I have said is slow and can take a little while to get started, you have to really be patient with this one and I personally didn't feel rewarded fully, but it was a good try of a film. It misses gadgets and stunts in parts where they could come in handy and especially the gadgets are needed more because they make Bond who he is and they really don't use them here in this film.Bond fans alike will maybe not like this as much as others and some may enjoy it, I can imagine among the viewers in the modern era, views will be mixed and split peoples decisions. People who enjoy the more suave Bond will like it too because he acts more like he is undercover the entire film rather than fight and shoot, the humour is also there we expect of Moore and although not his funniest, it isn't really annoying either.Overall a 6/10, maybe I did overate this film but I felt coming from watching it that it was entertaining and although quite long to say what is going on in it, it still pleased me as a Bond series film as well. This film is worth the watch I say even if your not watching Bond's in order or something, I feel it will entertain you, although not as much and anywhere near other Bonds before and after it.",The Man with the Golden Gun
114,majikstl,"""Another poor victim has come to a glittering end.""",5,22 June 2006,"You don't review James Bond movies, you evaluate them, rate them according to how well they meet expectations. There are certain things one has come to expect, even demand of a Bond film and each individual effort either delivers or it doesn't. So, here are ten elements that make a Bond film a Bond film and how THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN rates on a scale of 1 to 10: Title: THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN: Exceedingly lame, the title might be an accurate description of the film's villain, but it is almost embarrassing in its attempt at sexual innuendo. 4 points.Pre-Credit Teaser: A forty-year-old stereotype of a gangster (black shirt, white tie, fedora, etc.) is lured into a cheesy funhouse, that wouldn't even cut the muster at a fifth rate carnival, to do battle with Scaramanga, the world's highest paid professional assassin. This is supposed to foreshadow a duel of the titans confrontation between Scaramanga and Bond. Instead it introduces us to the rather tacky quality of the entire movie. 5 points.Opening Credits: Same old same old from Maurice Binder. 4 points.Theme Song: As bad as the title is, the attempt to turn it into a theme song is even worse. The music itself is catchy enough, I suppose, and the instrumental theme that pops up on the soundtrack now again is decent. But the lyrics are just plain awful in their attempt to cross themes of sex and violence: ""His eye may be on you or me. Who will he bang? We shall see."" Ouch! Even pop diva Lulu can't do much with such numbingly bad material. 1 point.""Bond, James Bond"": Were it not for the bits of campy humor peppered throughout the film, I suspect that Roger Moore would just nod off. It's only his second film and already he seems bored -- but with this material, who can blame him? 5 points.Bond Babes: As Scaramanga's mistress, Maud Adams is surprisingly poignant as a woman trapped in a corrupt world and controlled by an abusive man. She shows more depth than we have come to expect from a Bond Girl, but predictably her character is killed off far too soon. And, unfortunately, the film's heroine becomes Mary Goodnight, played by Britt Ekland, the one-time Mrs. Peter Sellers. Though we are supposed to believe she is a British agent, Goodnight is a one-joke ditz of the sort that suddenly became a Bond cliché. The two cancel each other out. 5 points.Bond Villain: It is said that Ian Fleming wanted his cousin, famed screen Dracula, Christopher Lee, to be the villain in the first Bond film, DR. NO. That didn't work out, but it is hard to say if it was worth the wait to see him here. Lee is a class act and one of the legendary screen villains of all time. Unfortunately, he is saddled with playing one of the dullest Bond villains of all time. Scaramanga seems to be as noted for his good manners as for his bloodlust. Lee seems to be enjoying the role and there is nothing intrinsically wrong with his portrayal, it is just that Scaramanga doesn't seem all the threatening. Why doesn't Bond just shoot him and be done with it? 5 points.Bond Baddies: As sort of a Mini-Me version of Goldfinger's Oddjob, Nick Nack is apparently an all purpose butler, henchman, adorable sidekick and source of comic relief. At less than four feet tall, Hervé Villechaize is certainly not very threatening, but pound for pound and inch for inch, he is probably one of Bond's more memorable adversaries. 8 points.Sinister Plot: The world's most notorious hired assassin apparently has a contract to kill 007, though considering Bond dodges three or four assassins in every one of his adventures, it's hard to see what the big deal is. Anyway, Bond is working on an assignment involving a missing scientist involved in harnessing solar energy and it turns out that Scaramanga is trying to take control of the world using solar energy. Wow, what a coincidence! And how lame. 3 points.Production values: Whatever ill that can be said about the film as a whole, it will always be cherished by Bondophiles for the infamous spinning car jump. In an attempt to jazz up their image, the carmaker AMC somehow persuaded the Bond producers to let them supply the cars for TMWTGG (just as Fords costarred in GOLDFINGER and Chevys in LIVE AND LET DIE), which is the only possible reason that Scaramanga would be driving a Matador. Anyway, it is also the only possible reason that Bond would commandeer an AMC Hornet to give chase. After a fairly well staged chase through the streets of Bangkok, Bond must catch up with Scaramanga by crossing a river via a half-collapsed bridge. Thus, the car trick from two ramps twisted in opposite directions. A neat trick. And if all Matadors could sprout wings and fly like Scaramanga's, maybe AMC would still be in business. 10 points.Bonus Points: Clifton James, as the big-bellied, tobacco-spitting, none-too-bright southern sheriff, J.W. Pepper, is back and for no apparent reason beyond being a desperate attempt to repeat a joke that fell flat when used in LIVE AND LET DIE. Minus 5 points.Summary: THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN was used as evidence that the Bond series was wearing out its welcome. Despite trying new things with the character and the formula, the film seems listless and uninspired. It is a low point, but it is also the lull before the rebirth that would come with THE SPY WHO LOVED ME.Bond-o-meter Rating: 45 points out of 100.",The Man with the Golden Gun
115,michaelarmer,The Man With The Golden Shag,8,31 March 2020,"This is proof that Roger Moore's first was no fluke, another great addition to the franchise.It's a very well made film, good direction, good photography and good music, the title song was good, and it has the authentic locations of Hong Kong and Thailand which add to quality, also many of the characters were played by people of the same nationality, but not all. Not too much daft stuff that crept into later films, but the daft character of Sheriff Pepper was brought back from the last film; it was ok in that but not good in this.Roger is great as Bond, not to many off the cuff remarks, and acted well. Christopher Lee as Scaramanga is the star pull as the bad guy, the best actor and he played his role well, Herve Villechaize was good as Nick-Nack, the rest were Ok, Britt Ekland did well, but Maud Adams looked like a rabbit caught in the headlights. Clifton James reprised his over-the-top character of Sheriff Pepper, but it detracted from the film, this repetition was not good.Bond Themes:- The intro and usual titles with song, the MI6 crew were all there, Helicopters, but no Festival, Belly Dancer or Train Scene, no Felix Leiter, no SPECTRE, no KGB, not much in the way of Gadgets, although there was advanced technology such as Little Nellie, Lasers and the rising deflector. They did have Cars but not too fancy, just a few AMC's from USA.
Henchmen:- 2 in this Scaramanga himself, he also became the lead villain after he killed the crime boss Hai Fat, and Nick-Nack, the shortest Henchman (followed by the largest in the next film), despite his inclusion being a caricature it seemed too work without being too daft, well until he got shoved in a suitcase near the end.Bond Girls:- Just 2 in this one, but 2 absolute stunners, Goodnight (no.27) was the first, played by Britt Ekland (Sweden) he had already had her before apparently, but shagged her again at the end just to make sure, normally Britt would easily be the most beautiful in any film, but this time she was up against another even more beautiful Swede - Maud Adams, playing Andrea Anders (no.28) but she was a baddie and got killed soon after Bond shagged her. She returned in Octopussy to be shagged as a different character but a bit older and not quite as gorgeous then.Despite the inclusion of Sheriff Pepper and a couple of other daft moments, it was pretty good, if not for them I would have scored it a 9, but as it is only 8, unfortunately it went downhill from here!",The Man with the Golden Gun
116,malkane316,Quick reviews!!,7,14 February 2005,"One of the more dodgy Bond films, but unlike the others, this one's faults and weirdness works to its benefit. Bond is on the hunt for a powerful device which sucks the power of the sun, making a doomsday weapon. Scaramanga, the world's most sought after assassin is also on the hunt for it, and it seems he wants Bond too. He believes Bond would be his most difficult adversary, and soon the two meet for a stand off.The film has many breathtaking locations and brilliant sets, and the hit-man plot adds depth the 'world destroyer' theme. Britt Ekland is of course gorgeous, and is OK in the role, but does not do much. Adams is good in a moderately tragic role. Lee as Scaramanga is excellent, a worthy opponent for Bond, equally matched in all areas, charm, knowledge, skill. Lee's performance ensures that the film does not slip into stupidity, but stands out. The stunts are OK, the film dealing more in fights with ninjas and sumo wrestlers. The final encounter is also good, tension building as Bond waits to hear the shot that will kill him. Villechaize is good as Nick Nack, although his demise is embarrassing, and the reappearance of GW Pepper is an odd one, and probably unnecessary. However, it is still funny. The car chase which follows is one of the best in the series. Also, Lulu's song is refreshing.7 out of 10",The Man with the Golden Gun
117,theshadow908,Not bad.,6,14 February 2007,"The Man With the Golden Gun is the ninth entry into the James Bond series. In this film, a hit-man named Fransisco Scaramanga has put his sights on Bond, and Bond aims to find out why. With the help of his partner, Agent Mary Goodnight, Bond tracks down Scaramanga to find out what other things he's involved with. As the mission goes on, a deadly game of cat and mouse ensues between Scaramanga and Bond. This is an entertaining Bond film, but you can see that the series is beginning to turn more toward comedy and campiness.James Bond's mission in this film is pretty cool, and it leads to some awesome action scenes, but the film makers are starting to move more toward campiness in some cases, and that kind of wrecks some scenes. The James Bond movies started off as serious spy films, but now they're turning into your average action hero film. The gadgets are getting more and more far fetched as well. One scene shows Scaramanga escaping in a car that transforms into a plane. The cat and mouse scenes between Scaramanga and Bond are kind of cool, and Scaramanga makes for one of the more sinister villains Bond has faced. The writing is kind of weak in some scenes, and Moore's one liners seem way too over the top.This is only Roger Moore's second outing as Bond, and already he's starting to seem not right for the role. He's too wooden, and his acting is far too cheesy. Christopher Lee delivers a good performance as Scaramanga, but you can't expect anything less from Christopher Lee.Overall, this is an entertaining Bond film, but it's just not up there with the originals.6.5/10",The Man with the Golden Gun
118,Rammstein-2,"Great film, great Bond",7,1 February 2000,"Yep. This is another really good one. The plot is fairly simple, though they had to fit in some heavy-duty destruction device just to make Bond interested in Scaramaga in the first place.

119,waqassaleem-85201,Average,5,31 May 2021,Rodger Moore's second film as James Bond is just average. The second half of the film brought the film down. If you like James Bond movies only then watch it other than that better to skip it.,The Man with the Golden Gun
120,mnpollio,The worst in the series,2,27 March 2007,"Roger Moore's second effort in the James Bond role produces the worst in the series - hands down. The plot has something to do with legendary assassin Christopher Lee purportedly targeting the secret agent and then makes nonsensical plot turns regarding laser beams and flying cars.Bond: Moore is game, but he still seems to be struggling. He has neither the heft nor the acting talent to make up for a lousy Bond production. His lightweight approach to role still had not yet paid off.The villain: One would think a veteran baddie like Christopher Lee would bring something to the role, but he is a surprisingly forgettable Bond villain. The less said about the obnoxious henchman played by Fantasy Island's Herve Villechaize, the better.The women: Two of the worst Bond women on record. Adams' cheekbones contribute her performance in a ludicrously underwritten role as Lee's frightened mistress. And if Ian Fleming could see Britt Ekland's rendition of Mary Goodnight, he would spin in his grave. No argument that Ekland is a beautiful woman, but she is a grade-A dolt in this film. Completely weak and inept, a total obstacle rather than an assistant to the hero, and she actually cringes in fright when the diminutive and totally nonthreatening Villechaize approaches her.I hated Lulu's title track at the time, but it has improved in retrospect. Unlike many of the Bond films, the pacing is stagnant, the plot is especially stupid and there is nary a thing to recommend it.",The Man with the Golden Gun
121,EvanKevelson,Without question the best Moore Bond film,7,26 February 2021,"Personally when I rate a Bond Film a rate it only in the context of all Bond Films pre-Daniel Craig (being he is a reboot not a continuity Bond). These aren't deep message films they are action films based on a covert MI-6 agent whose missions are to infiltrate, gather Intel and kill when necessary. The Rating also has to be looked at From a historical perspective not only factually but sociological norms of that particular era.
So if I see a review that depicts racism(lack of black characters) or depiction of Connery or Moore as a sick misogynistic animal... I know the reviewer is ignorant of what audiences where pleased by between 1962-1977 etc... They also are just as fanatic in liberal ideology as a religious conservative fanatics. These were till 1973 ""Guy Films"" not date films.
Criticizing Bond on a ""morality"" basis is the same as criticizing looney tunes for excessive violence. It's moronic.
Critics really killed this Bond film and as I stated probably Moore's best Bond film out of three good entertaining Bond Films.
Christopher Lee (aka Sarandon) made this film. For the bulk of the film this is the first time Bond as a character is on the defensive. Yes...yes... the ""solar plex"" and he saves the world but only because Christopher Lee like Reverse Flash had to be the best narcissistic villain that Bond faces. Purely choosing Bond to prove to himself he was the best assassin alive. (They could have just gone to a shooting range).
The private island a classic signature of the independent megalomaniac like Goldfinger's Fort Knox display table. That becomes becomes the staple of all the Moore villains, insane wealthy megalomaniacs bent on World Domination. That structure like I've said defined Roger Moore as a Campy, smooth but not a ""macho"" bond but Bond the Player.
Fantasy Island's ""Little Person"" was hysterical! Just when you think Bond is safe and the mission over he pops out of a storage compartment, Classic!
Still after Dr No-Thunderball the #5 top Bond 1964-1999 has not been met.",The Man with the Golden Gun
122,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,Moore's favorite 007 Bond movie ever - Mano E Mano Bond vs Scaramanga,10,27 March 2021,"The Man With The Golden Gun is such an Epic movie in my opinion! I love this movie to death!!!!! This is the second movie that Roger Moore did and My favorite Roger Moore's movie as Bond. When it comes to Roger Moore as James Bond, most people praise ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" and ""For Your Eyes Only."" But I prefer The Man with the Golden Gun over The Spy Who Loved Me and For Your Eyes Only. I really enjoy this film I love that all effects are practical and done for real. The explosions, car chases, boat chases. Roger Moore does all his own stunts. I love Karate and martial arts fights in this film. I love mano e mano between Bond his Walther PPK gun and Scaramanga his (Golden Gun) on the finale on Scramanga's island. Mary Goodnight is sexy, hot and fiesty in this movie. I love that Roger Moore kicks one of the bad guy's in Hai Fat's karate school in the face and fights of Chula (Chan Yiu Lam).Roger Moore with his enthusiasm and charm still did a great job playing his character. In the face of Energy Crisis 1973 Britain still did not fully recover from the crisis. So they made to face the Energy Crisis at that time. Bond 007 once again goes and kicks ass. Bond becomes a target of an assassin called Francisco Scaramanga played by actor Christopher Lee. So Christopher Lee and Ian Fleming were cousins in real life and Christopher Lee said that Francisco Scaramanga was his favorite role he ever played. I love this movie. I have a friend that he consider it, his favorite Roger Moore film and so do I. He said this is his favorite Roger Moore film. I have another co worker that told me that her friend visit the island Phuket Scaramanga Island but is now called James Bond Island. A Scaramanga Island in which Bond and Goodnight escape. I love Scaramanga's Golden gun.007 is now the target of this known assassin and Scaramanga well know assassin holds A Solex editor unit in his hands. He has a high tech solar plant in possesion. He is planing to sold the plant to the higest binder. He uses Solex editor unit from the sun for his powerful laser weapon. MI6 gives a Bond a mission to get that Solex Editor Unit back, because this was the face energy of the energy crisis. Britain did not overcome the crisis. James Bond on a mission get's assasigned by Mary Goodnight (Britt Ekland). The first lead brings him to Beirut later to Hong Kong and meets his contact in Hong Kong, Soon-Tek Oh as Lieutenant Hip. Soon-Tek Oh plays a good guy in this movie, he plays the bad guys in Missing in Action 2: The Beginning and Steel Justice with Martin Kove. Bond brings him to Tailand and to Hai Fat who is Scaramanga's contractor and boss. By the finale Bond brings him self to the island Phuket Phang Nga Bay, Thailand which is bad ass.Director Guy Hamilton demended that Bond is more a tough guy like in the Ian Fleming novels so Bond had to twist Andrea Anders arm and Roger Moore hated that scene. Moore said that he could use his charm. The other scene Roger Moore hated was that scene in which Bond pushes a boy out of the boat. Roger Moore, Britt Ekland, Christopher Lee and Herve Villechaize did all great job. Actress Britt Ekland was terrified the explosions. That's one of the reasons why I love this movie to death and it is one of my favorite Bond films of all time. Because I love the island Phuket Phang Nga Bay, Thailand I love the explosions. Bond and Goodnight escape from the island that was done for real. Britt Ekland was only in bekini and Roger Moore grabed her while they were running away for their life from the exploding plant that wasn't acting that was real!!!!! They almost got killed Roger Moore felt Ekland's terrified skin and it was for real.This movie deserves to be called one of the best Bond films it is in my top 10 Favorite Bond films and I consider it a classic that's just me. This is my favorite Roger Moore film, I baged my mom so she asked my aunt to tape me this film on VHS and my aunt did tape me this film and Live and Let Die. I forgot to meantion but I enjoyed the kickbox match in here. I love that it is the face of the energy cirisis and the final shots makes this film more realistic. Even the fights are realistic when Bond bleeds during the fight. Mary Goodnight is one of my favorite Bond girls. I love, love this movie incredible to death! It's shot with camera in a full widescreen presentation. Love this movie to death.R. I. P. Roger Moore, Christopher Lee, Herve Villechaize, Soon-Tek Oh and Richard Loo.",The Man with the Golden Gun
123,dasa108,"Until its premiere, the best Bond movie starring Roger Moore and directed by Guy Hamilton.",7,29 August 2021,"In this film we have the only villain who is presented with the Bond formula: ""my name is Scaramanga, Francisco Scaramanga"". The formula of a western with a martial arts background, all mixed up with the classic Bond formula, stands out in this film. The result improves thanks to a slightly more interesting story and that although it has flaws at least it maintains the interest. I must be clear: the villain's motivation is stupid; no one in their right mind would hesitate to kill an enemy quickly if that would get rid of a problem. But in this case Scaramanga does not hesitate to demonstrate his folly, obviously proven by his lack of knowledge about his sordid plan to sell solar technology (""I don't know how this works,"" says Scaramanga with remarkable candor). Beyond this we can say that it is an improvement after two bad films. One more piece of information: Bond's assistant (Britt Ekcland) has such an unprofessional demeanor that it's surprising how those who hire people like her continue to be nuclear potences.",The Man with the Golden Gun

125,stormhawk2021,A decent Bond but not an excellent entry,5,27 June 2017,"I enjoy this particular entry about on the same level as Moore's previous Bond flick ""Live and Let Die"", some intriguing elements but the final product comes out to be above average. Once again Moore is fantastic and having the awesome Christopher Lee as the villain is genius casting. I also liked how this film played around with the idea of having Scaramanga being an evil-version of Bond. It's just a shame that Lee is criminally underutilized and the plot takes a few too many detours (Ex. The really pointless martial arts tournament sequence). Thankfully, the Roger Moore era of the Bond franchise is about to finally take off in the next entry ""The Spy Who Loved Me""!!",The Man with the Golden Gun
126,jonathanruano,A Boring Experience...,5,10 July 2010,"The set-up for this movie is great. Former KGB agent turned professional assassin, Francisco Scaramanga (Christopher Lee), whose identity and whereabouts are unknown, has apparently sent a golden bullet to James Bond (Roger Moore) to announce that he intends to kill him. James Bond is immediately taken off his assignment and instructed either to go into hiding or find the elusive Scaramanga and kill him. He decides upon the latter course.After this set-up is explained, it becomes apparent that the weaknesses of ""The Man with the Golden Gun"" greatly outweigh its strengths. Christopher Lee is a terrific villain and, if he was given more lines and more screen time, his performance alone could have turned ""The Man with the Golden Gun"" into a decent film. Unfortunately Lee is given little to say or do throughout this picture, which is a shame because he plays Scaramanga terribly well (in the few scenes that were allotted to him). As for Roger Moore's James Bond, the verdict is mixed. The problem with Roger Moore is that everything is a joke to him, even when he is in the most trying situations, and therefore we never feel that he is in any danger. The outcome predictably enough is that ""The Man with the Golden Gun"" loses most of its tension and suspense. To a certain extent, a movie has to seem real to its audience to be entertaining; but Roger Moore's cornball remarks belie the notion that the world of James Bond is genuine. But more than the characters, ""The Man with the Golden Gun"" is a casualty of a flawed vision. Director Guy Hamilton and the producers have packed this movie with boat chases, car chases, a silly karate school, and Scaramanga's incredibly dull fun house. This decision not only crowded out the film's human characters (especially Scaramanga), but also drained this film of all its excitement because the scenes themselves are dull. One reviewer suggested that ""The Man with the Golden Gun"" was the worst Bond movie that he had ever seen. I personally think that ignominious honour should go to ""A View with a Kill"" or ""Quantum of Solace."" But ""The Man with the Golden Gun"" certainly is one of the least impressive Bond films. It may have a great villain (though he unfortunately gets little screen time), sexy Bond girls (Maud Adams and Britt Ekland), and an amusing performance by Bernard Lee (as ""M""), but unfortunately these small virtues are not enough to save this film from the trash heap.",The Man with the Golden Gun

Then, I found them exciting and fascinating. Now, I only find them boring, stupid, ridiculous, confused, bizarre, unpleasant and very sexist. The plots are completely uninteresting.This Movie,""The Man with the Golden Gun"", is one of the worst... for one thing, that they are using an extremely short actor, in the way circuses showed up ""dwarfs"" for money before everyone learned of human rights. And Scaramanga's kinky love-play with the gun involved, before he is going to shoot someone, is very sick and unpleasant, and certainly not anything I would let my kids watch. In Sweden the Bond movies are nowadays shown on television in the afternoons, and I find that highly inappropriate.The only thing that still holds up in the Bond movies, are a few funny situations, Bond's quick repartees, Miss Moneypenny's unrequited love which is so easy for a woman to identify with, Q:s funny and ingenious technical gadgets, etc..

On the whole Roger Moore and Christopher Lee are extremely entertaining in it and in that category the film isn't too bad. It's filled to the brim with crazy action and all the 'typical' stuff you'd find in a Bond film.The film, however, follows a pattern to such precision it stops being a serious film and becomes an intentional parody of itself. This is something that I feel very conflicted about as a Bond fan. I always find tremendous satisfaction when a Bond-film doesn't take itself too seriously, but this film is already winking at the camera.The film is recommendable as a brain-free action-comedy but serious Bond-fans are gonna have a hard time swallowing some of the insanity that takes place.",The Man with the Golden Gun

Nothing in the plot makes up for having to put up with those two elements in a movie!  The ""heroine"" is especially pitiful, being of no help (except in getting herself kidnapped) and is just plain pathetic when she pretends to reject Bond only to show up in his room later.

132,PCC0921,They Shouldn't Have Rushed This One,7,10 January 2021,"I have always felt, to properly enjoy the James Bond mythos, you should see all of the Bond films. New, old, Connery, Lazenby, 60s, 90s, you name it and this one should also be seen. What makes this one important was the fact that it was Moore's 2nd after an enormous successful bow as Connery's successor in ""Live and Let Die"". Moore came out of the gate in that film declaring that he didn't want to look like the new Sean Connery, but more of a re-boot of James Bond and Moore's donation to the character was to make him more witty, hence, the one-line jokes that eventually made Moore famous.On a lighter note, this film would launch the career of Harve Villechaize and where would we be without ""The Plane, The Plane!"". It also would try to cash in on one of its new comic-relief characters that debuted in the last film, Clifton James, as Sheriff J.W. Pepper, who would gain fame as Porky in the Porky's movies of the 80s. It also was Maud Adams first Bond film and that is interesting, because she still holds the history-making moniker of being the only woman to be a Bond Girl twice (not counting Ursula Andress who is in two different franchises). Also, I don't count Lois Maxwell as Moneypenney from the 60s to the 80s and Judi Dench as M in the 21st Century. When Adams did it a second time, as the title character in 1983s ""Octopussy"", it would also be the last film that my favorite Bond director Guy Hamilton would direct.One neat thing about this film was the fact that it was a very early commentary on the big oil companies trying to shut out solar power from being an energy player in the world. The film would also foreshadow an energy crisis coming even before Jimmy Carter arrived on the scene two years later. The film has all the bells and whistles, comic relief, Bond girls, bad-guys and action needed for a Bond film. There are some great shooting locations, especially Christopher Lee's bad-guy island. Soon-Tek Oh (of MASH fame), would play Lt. Hip and along with Hip's nieces they turn out to be the most entertaining characters in the film.Still, the film is a disappointment. What kills this film is a number of things. After doing the last film only a year before probably had something to do with it, because the next film wouldn't come for another four years and for my money, that film, ""The Spy Who Loved Me"", would be the best ever of the Roger Moore series. This film is a lost film between ""Live and Let Die"" and ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" and rightfully so, because the mad dash to get this one out of the can kills it. A beginning scene in Lee's Funhouse has a wax figure of Bond in it that clearly is Roger Moore in make-up - sloppy. There is sloppy editing, especially the fight scene at the Karate school. The film is shoddy and all those cool characters I mentioned before become lost, along with this film.7.1 (C MyGrade) = 7 IMDB",The Man with the Golden Gun
133,BumpyRide,Solex Agitator?,7,4 June 2007,"Despite having some serious flaws with the script and character development, this movie does have some very good scenes sprinkled throughout. The highlight for me was first of all, Scaramonga. Finally we have a villain not bent on world domination but gunman against gunman. I also found most of the scenes with Knick Knack to be very enjoyable especially the dueling scene and at the wrestling match. Amusing to find him so well rounded that he's even a French Chef. Goodnight on the other hand could have been better developed instead of the typical, accident prone blonde (think Three's Company). She is enjoyable nonetheless. I also found the filming on the island and the interior sets to be very well done. Even Roger Moore gives a believable performance with very little humor thrown in for good measure. A lot to like but if they could have bypassed Sheriff Pepper this would have been a highly regarded film more than it is.",The Man with the Golden Gun

""I sure am boy!""",6,1 August 2003,"No one can catch him, no hit man can match him so what chance does Roger Moore have you may ask in this his 2nd outing of Bondage. Christopher Lee is the titular assassin Sacaramanga who dispatches his victims with his trademark firearm and, in a biazaar bit of hero worship that surely puts his sanity in question, has a life-size mock up of James Bond in his basement. Lets hope Bond doesn't get in there because he could pretend to be his facsimile or something and may get a lucky shot off.This is the Bond that comes complete with third nipple, pint sized side kicks and Maud Adams who Bond fails to recognise when she pops up under the name of Octopussy 9 years hence. Its retains the cut price look of many 70's Bonds and has few surprises although Lee is fairly good in the title role and excludes suitable amounts of gleeful menace but, like Live and Let Die most of the film is Bond is transit from A to B with the occasional expositionary scene chucked in for good measure and little action.Not the series' finest hour.",The Man with the Golden Gun
135,aura772,The world's greatest villains tried to kill James Bond. Now it's Scaramanga's turn to try,7,14 October 2007,"The Man With the Golden Gun ditches the original novel almost completely (the book was set in Jamaica, for a start, whereas the film is located in the Far East). However, it is still a fairly entertaining entry is the long-running series, and features three strong reasons for tuning in: 1)a classic Bond villain in the shape of Francisco Scaramanga 2)a classic villain's henchman in the shape of psycho dwarf NickNack, and 3)a stunning Bond girl in the shape of Mary Goodnight. There'a also the most outrageous car stunt ever seen in a motion picture, rendered all the more impressive by the fact that it is not a computer enhanced sequence but was filmed for real (including that infamous loop-the-loop in the red sports car).Bond is played by Roger Moore for the second time. Moore is relaxed and easy-going in his usual manner, but shows a bit of the old Connery toughness during a couple of martial arts fight sequences. His mission is simply to stay alive this time, having been targeted by world renowned hit-man Francisco Scaramanga (chilling Christopher Lee). Moore decides that rather than waiting around to be shot, he will hunt for Scaramanga himself, and his search takes him to Beirut, Macao, Hong Kong and, finally, a privately owned Thai island. En route, he discovers that Scaramanga has bigger fish to fry than simply killing 007, as he also plans to use a powerful solar device to power-up a deadly laser gun that he has had built.It's a surprisingly slow-moving film for a Bond flick, with more talky scenes than is customary. However, the action when it comes is pretty memorable. The comedy relief provided by Clifton James (you may remember him as a mouthy cop from Live and Let Die) is somewhat irritating and hurts the film more than it helps it. Lulu's title song is dated, but catchy. I would rate this an an enjoyable Bond escapade, definitely worth catching for series completists and fans of action bonanzas, but it isn't really the best of the bunch and isn't even the best of Moore's films in the series. If you're only going to see five minutes of the film, though, you simply must tune in for that afore-mentioned car stunt.... awesome!",The Man with the Golden Gun

138,carologletree,"Moore's Worst Bond Film, and Possibly the Worst of the Original Official Series As Well",4,7 January 2016,"This film deserves its reputation as one of the worst Bond films. In my opinion, this is the single worst Bond film from the original official series.Let's start with the highlights. Roger Moore is still doing considerably well as Bond, even though it wouldn't be until the next film that he truly hits his stride. Christopher Lee is quite entertaining to watch. Herve Villechaize is absolutely adorable as Nick Nack.The locations in Thailand and China are very enjoyable and fairly atmospheric. Also, I like the theme song by Lulu more than most people.It doesn't offer much other than that. The plot is rather uninteresting, and not much really happens that's noteworthy. There isn't nearly enough action, and there is too much campiness, even for a Bond movie.Maud Adams is smoking hot and Britt Ekland is somewhat attractive, but ultimately they are both wasted. I thought the ""superfluous third nipple"" thing was disgusting.Christopher Lee is a great actor, but that sadly doesn't change that his character Scaramanga is one of the least threatening villains in the series. As a villain, he's actually a pretty interesting character, but they don't give him nearly enough to do. BIG waste.Moore and Lee tried, but they just couldn't save this movie. Like ""Diamonds Are Forever,"" this is one I would recommend only to the most die-hard of fans, but not anyone else.RATING: C-",The Man with the Golden Gun
139,LuboLarsson,Better than the last,7,7 July 2002,"Although an improvement on Live and Let Die, this is not one of Bond's better adventures. They still tried to be getting away from the Bond formula with this one. Moore is on good form though and Cristopher Lee always makes a good villain. But the actual story is a bit poor, and where are all the action set pieces?, apart from the car chase and jump, which I agree was ruined by that stupid sound effect. The Bond girls are alright though, Britt Ekland is a bit too silly, but looks great and Maud Adams is very good and earns her special place in Bond girl history by appearing again in Octopussy (as a different character). Thankfully the next Bond film was a classic that saved the series.",The Man with the Golden Gun
140,C22Man,Needed a man with a golden touch,3,11 July 2015,"Title: A mouthful, but gets straight to the point.Bond Review.Pre-Titles: Scaramanga is stalked by a gangster in his fun house as he tries to locate his golden gun, which he does and he kills the gangster. This is a well-staged and intense opening that does well in presenting just how dangerous Scaramanga is. It gives us some tension and action straight away which is always a good way to open, just a shame we don't get any sign of Bond.Theme Song: Lulu's title track is one of the worst in the series. The tune is totally lacklustre and the lyrics are terrible, with innuendos about guns and powerful weapons. Lulu's scratchy off-key vocals only succeed in making everything sound even worse than it already is.Plot: Bond is informed that the world's most expensive assassin Scaramanga has made him his next target and Bond decides to hunt him down. During this Bond becomes embroiled in the hunt for a missing solar energy harnesser that Scaramanga has links to. The plot with Bond going off again someone as dangerous as himself is set-up solidly, but it is still a let-down. It should have been seen as an intense battle between the two and made to feel more important than it is here. The solar energy device is clearly just tagged on to give Bond more to do and feels completely unnecessary.James Bond: Roger Moore goes against his usual portrayal for a more hard-edged approach and it doesn't really work. With such a foe a tougher turn makes sense, yet Moore isn't very convincing in the scenes where he acts tough and in other he acts so calm that you doubt he's even worried. He is still as debonair as ever, but he just isn't that much fun to watch.Bond Girls: Britt Ekland makes great eye candy but she is truly woeful as Goodnight. She just plays the role like a stereotypical ditzy blonde and it's not remotely believable that she's an agent. She looks dumbfounded throughout and delivers some already bad lines horribly. Maud Adams is simply okay as Scaramanga's mistress Anders. She certainly shows the desperateness of the character, but she isn't given anything that interesting to say or do.Villains: Christopher Lee pretty much saves the film as the confident Scaramanga. Lee brings his usual touch of class and dignity to the role, really selling the idea that Scaramanga is Bond's equal. Lee just has a magnetic screen presence and his scenes are easily the most interesting. Dwarf actor Herve V is charming and rather amusing as butler/henchman Nick Nack. It is certainly a unique villain, but he simply isn't a convincing threat.Support: Clifton James returns as sheriff Pepper and really isn't used well here. There is no need for him to feature, the jokes are painful and his mugging for the camera quickly wears thin. Soon-Tek Oh is pretty good as Bond's ally Hip and Bernard Lee is great again with more screen time than usual.Action: The action scenes are pretty bland. Kung-Fu is featured which is fun and gives us something different, but then we get Hip's nieces beating up an entire dojo which makes a mockery of the area. We do a get a pretty cool fight scene over a gold bullet and a well shot car chase through Bangkok, but that's the only good stuff. The final confrontation is such a let-down and has none of the tension required, whilst watching Bond 'fight' Nick Nack is both awkward and ridiculous. We also get a truly incredible stunt with a car leaping a bridge, which is then totally ruined by having slide whistle sound effect over the top of it. Score: John Barry's score is just decent here. To be fair there is nothing that good on screen for him to enhance, but the music feels a little rushed. There is nothing here that fits into the film or sounds catchy and it's by far Barry's weakest work on the series.Production Values: Visually there is nothing special here, this is pretty much the most average looking Bond film you'll see. Hamilton has shown before he has a good eye for shots, but he clearly isn't on top form for this one and it shows. Bangkok is quite a good location and lends itself perfectly to the exotic adventures that Bond goes on, while the private island that Scaramanga uses does look beautiful. The production design is lacklustre with a lot of the sets looking like they are from the 1960's and most of them being bland, even if we do get a couple of good ones like the hidden headquarters in a ship. The pacing and editing is also very uneven, as at times things seem to be flying along and at others it feels like it's unnecessarily slow. The writing is again weak, apart from a couple of Scaramanga's lines I can't recall any of it and most of the humour feels very forced. Conclusion: Golden Gun is one of the weakest films in the series. Almost nothing seems to work here and there are a lot of bad choices made. Christopher Lee is the only standout by making a classy and compelling villain. As said Moore is iffy at best here, Ekland is terrible, the action is weak and there just isn't anything interesting on screen most of the time. The writing is very poor, there is no need for such broad humour or numerous goofy moments in what really should be a very grounded film. Overall though this feels like a wasted opportunity, a lot of the ingredients were there for an exciting Bond film and what we get is one that has to drag itself to a finish.",The Man with the Golden Gun

142,Mikew3001,A Kung Fu Bond comedy,7,12 August 2002,"""The Man of the Golden Gun"" isn't one of the best James Bond movies but has been one of the most successful ones of the series in Germany and other countries. Based on Ian Flemings last 007 novel, released in 1966 two years after his death, the book is often considered as his weakest story. Filmed in South East Asia and Arabia in 1974 with Roger Moore in his second Bond appearance after ""Live And Let Die"" (1973), this one follows the footsteps of his predecessor.""Live And Let Die"" started a new concept and added more elements to the film that attracted younger audiences - black main actors, funk music, voodoo settings, fast car chases Bullitt-style through the streets of New York and James Bond in flares. ""TMWTGG"" follows that way and imitates the large success of the Kung Fu movie wave of Bruce Le, Chuck Norris and David Cararadines ""Kung Fu"" TV series. Funnily, Roger Moore (*1927), who the most popular Bond actors amongst teenagers, is the oldest of all five Bond actors until now.Unfortunately, ""TMWTGG"" misses too many elements of the former Bond movies. The whole style here is rather comedy like and typical seventies style - the dull and non-melodic title theme, song by former sex starlet Lulu, is a low light of the series. John Barry's score misses the lush power and gentle grooves of his sixties Bond tunes. There are plenty of typical silly jokes who rather belongs to Kentucky Fried Movie, and Kung Fu fighting all around. There are no big thrills, but some very lame pacing, some simply boring moments and an unnecessary return of LALD's American redneck sheriff J.W. Pepper who was probably added to attract American audiences.The biggest mistake is the lack of a real villain. Christopher Lee gives a very fine performance as killer and Millionaire Scaramanga, but is too Gentleman-like to be considered as a real super villain. When he's talking of his childhood as an orphan in a circus with a small elephant being his only friend, he rather becomes a lovable character. His servant Nick Nack, a witty dwarf, isn't also menacing enough.The Bond girls are also no high light of the film. Britt Eklund is just a stupid ""Holly Goodnight"" who gets on your nerves very fast, and the much better acting Maud Adams, who returned to the series in 1983's ""Octopussy"", has just a minor supporting role.The positive aspects of the film are some good fighting sequences, a motor boat chase through Bangkog, the very fine settings in South East Asia with very nice photography and a showdown on a pretty ""Dr. No"" like island in the Southern Chinese Sea. Pierce Brosnan's 007 returned to this region in 1997's ""Tomorrow Never Dies"".""The Man With The Golden Gun"" is at least a nice family movie and some good fun to watch - and a good exercise for Roger Moore to develop his own Bond style that he fully showed in the great ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" in 1977.",The Man with the Golden Gun
143,movieman-200,A valiant attempt that falls short of expectations for a Bond caper,6,12 June 2005,"The Man With The Golden Gun (1974) is Roger Moore's second outing as 007, and something of a letdown after his meteoric introduction in Live & Let Die. After receiving a golden bullet marked with his double-o number, Bond is relieved of all duties and asked by his superior, M (Bernard Lee) to disappear for a while. Instead, Bond plots to stake out Francisco Scaramanga (Christopher Lee)  the man with the golden gun. Unbeknownst to Bond, Scaramanga doesn't really want him dead. The bullet was actually sent to Bond by Scaramanga's girlfriend, Andrea Anders (Maude Adams, in her first appearance in a Bond movie). Unfortunately, Bond realizes that Scaramanga's intentions to annihilate the world through harnessing a destructive solar device have brought him full circle in his original mission; that of recovering an experimental Solex converter that was stolen from British intelligence.The film is justly famous for several fantastic set pieces, including a three sixty mid-air roll over car stunt, another featuring a car that turns into a plane, the novel staging of two fun house sequences, and, the climactic showdown on Scaramanga's island, in which a miniature model of the doomsday device appears remarkably full size  even under today's scrutiny in special effects. The film is also notable for pint size Bond villain, Nick Nack (Herve Villechaize, of Tattoo fame on television's Fantasy Island). The Bond girl on this occasion is the largely forgettable, Mary Goodnight (Britt Ekland), a vapid flaxen-haired bubble head to whom the concept of zero refrigeration goes unnoticed until a complete thermal meltdown of the island is imminent.MGM/UA's DVD is disappointing. Colors are dated and faded. Contrast levels appear a tad low. Fine details are lost in a barrage of age related artifacts and digital anomalies including edge enhancement and pixelization. Blacks are rarely deep or solid. Whites are more of a pasty pale yellow. The audio is mono and strident. There's not much to recommend either the picture or sound elements. Extras include two documentaries, an audio commentary, some promotional junkets, stills gallery and theatrical trailer.",The Man with the Golden Gun
144,martinpersson97,Even better than the previous,9,25 March 2020,"Live and let die was a fun reimagining of the franchise and a fine starting point for Roger Moore, but this is where he really shines.Right off the bat, we are introduced to the titular villain of the film, Scaramanga, played by the late Christopher Lee, and he is always incredibly satisfying to watch. As always, Lee delivers a fantastic performance and feels right at home in the shoes of a villain - he acts as a bit of an anti-James Bond, in the sense that he's a killer agent himself, so that opens up for some interesting moral questions.Moore continues to shine as the replacement for Connery and Lazenby, of course, so not much else to say there.Overall, this movie hits the nail on most account that makes the series great; fun music numbers, amazing action scenes and an overall sense of adventure and fun. Whilst it may not be the best in the series, it's a step above the previous one and stands out a lot primarily because of its charismatic villain.I give it a 9 out of 10!",The Man with the Golden Gun

146,michelerealini,Beautiful landscapes in a so-so Bond adventure,6,4 October 2005,"Let me say I like Roger Moore very much, because I grew up watching his films -he's the first Bond I've ever seen. Many people prefer Sean Connery, who is really unique, true... But how can I say Roger Moore is not good? I've also a lot of affection for Moore because I watched on TV, when I was a kid, ""The Persuaders"" series.Although that his second Bond outing is not very good. That's not his fault at all, the screenplay is not good and the story itself is not very interesting. Everything is a little slower than usual, the film has neither the liveliness of ""Live and let die"" -the first Moore Bond flick- nor the liveliness of the previous episodes.Here Bond has to face a refined assassin -that's all, there isn't a real thrilling intrigueOn the other hand landscapes and John Barry score are fantastic. Also the cast is strong, because Christopher Lee and Britt Ekland bring a lot of glamour. It's a pity that the movie doesn't match the usual standard.At the time producers Albert Broccoli and Harry Saltzman didn't get along well with each other any more. In '75 their partnership broke up and let Broccoli alone at the command of 007 empire. Maybe this tensions had an influence on ""The man with the golden gun"", who knows...Luckily in 1977 Bond came back with one of the best films of the series -""The spy who loved me"", a real classic, the definitive Roger Moore entry as Bond.",The Man with the Golden Gun
147,fletch5,Goes below the standards,5,22 September 2000,"It's amazing how uneven the Bond series really is. All the films work on the entertainment level, but there are major fluctuations between their quality standards. But this one goes below them.""The Man with the Golden Gun"" is pretty surely the lowest point in the series. It has too many silly moments and is extremely tiresome, not having even a sign of some enthusiasm. (And I thought ""Thunderball"" was hard to sit through!) A good example of the lacking energy is the car chase sequence which couldn't be more tedious. The karate crap is ridiculous, as well (like the voodoo nonsense in ""Live and Let Die"").Britt Ekland's Goodnight is by far the worst Bond girl of all time; the character is so helpless that it's painful to watch. Maud Adams is strangely cold in the role of Scaramanga's mistress. However, Christopher Lee does a reasonably good job as Scaramanga, stealing the show from Roger Moore.By the way, this isn't the first time we see a golden gun in a Bond movie.

148,kylehodgdon,Too Wacky. Should Have Been A Bit More Serious.,4,6 March 2010,"I have never really been one who likes Bond films. I have only seen a few of them and I should say that this one is probably one of my least favorites. I'm going to start with the worst. The silliness of this movie sticks out like a sore thumb. I would have rated this movie a whole point higher, then I saw the chase scene that looked exactly like something straight out of ""The Duke's of Hazard"", complete with an outrageous car jump with a sound wacky effect. That was really bad.I also feel like this movie tried to fit way too much into it. You have a funhouse, a car chase, a casino, a boxing match, a bayou boat chase, a karate sparing event, and a private island all serving as locations throughout this movie. That is way too many. Had they just stuck with some of those and improved the action that occurred in them, I think it would have made for a more successful plot.For the positives, I did really like the villain in this movie. An assassin who uses a golden gun is a very good Bond enemy. Christopher Lee does a good job with that character. The rest of the characters in this movie, from Nick Nack, to Goodnight, to Bond himself, all work well. With all the different locations, you would really not think this movie would be boring, but it did indeed bore me at times. The plot is a big problem throughout the film. Someone who really likes the Bond genre would probably like this movie more than I did. If I was to make a suggestion I would advise someone to seek out a better 007 film. I'm sure they would not have to look very long to find one.",The Man with the Golden Gun
149,rjsf96,When Bond Went Bad,6,29 October 2015,"It's hard to say exactly what went wrong with The Man with the Golden Gun. Because its problems are numerous and there is almost nothing to like or appreciate about the film.James Bond is hunted down by Francisco Scaramanga; a man who prides himself upon killing his enemies with a single golden bullet. Hence he is known by the formidable name of the man with the golden gun.There are little pleasures to be had though. John Barry returns to score the film and although it's his least memorable it possesses certain energy to it. Oh if only the film had borrowed some of this energy then at least the whole affair would not feel like it is running on fumes.Christopher Lee as Francisco Scaramanga is the most enjoyable and entertaining aspect of the film. Yet he overshadows James Bond. We really should not root for the villain but this time we cannot help it. The film lights up whenever Lee is on screen and it remains fitting that he is the only character that we care about throughout the entire film.The Man with the Golden Gun sadly suffers from a plethora of problems. Scaramanga's loyal servant Nick Nack is mind bogglingly silly. From the way he acts and speaks almost like a comedic act. It just does not suit Bond's nature and goes against what we as loyal fans have come to expect from the franchise.The Bond girl Goodnight only makes an appearance so that we get to hear incredibly awful dialogue filled beyond comprehension with double entendres. What's most insulting though is how she acts around Bond. She sways from ignoring his charm to falling in love with him. She even lets Bond put her in a wardrobe so he can bed another woman. Never mind the fact that she almost blows up a small island from her bottom. Though who can really take this instalment seriously? A man with three nipples, a flying car and a fun house. This all reeks of nonsense. Because that's all that The Man with the Golden Gun is nonsense. Bond fans really did deserve better and so did Christopher Lee; the only point of interest in one of the weakest Bond entries in memory. Luckily, The Man with the Golden Gun is one of few weak points in Bond's cinematic history. We can only hope that its mistakes shall never be replicated again.",The Man with the Golden Gun

Third nips are horrible
Nik Nack is a little irritatingPositives from the film;
There are some very attractive women in this film who have great abdomens i.e the Belly dancer and Miss Goodnight in her bikini. Britt Ekland is stunning in this film.
Considering I hated JW Pepper in the last film I actually thought how he appeared in a cameo role this time was great. He's growing on me worryingly!
Hip and the girls karate moves are slick and the young Asian kid trying to sell the elephant is a good comedic scene. 'bloody tourist'Interesting points;
I noticed a goof in the film. The gangster at the start cocked his gun when in the funhouse and then again when he saw scaramanga. It was also interesting to see James Cossins who I recognised from Fawlty Towers.Good ending as it went full circle in the funhouse and this time Scaramanga is outwitted by his own bond dummy.

Christopher Lee is top notch as Scaramanga, who lives on an island off China and employs a lethal dwarf, played by Herve Villechaize, as his manservant.Yes Gun is corny, but has several stand out scenes, the fight at the kung fu school is a more than competent cash in on the Bruce Lee films, the scenes in Scaramanga's funhouse are clever and the chase through Bangkok is good fun( until the car jumps the river). Also Lulu's theme tune is seventies cheese at its best.Of interest Maud Adams had a minor role as Scaramanga's lover, later she would become a mature Bond girl in Octopussy.",The Man with the Golden Gun
153,mmuggi,"Scaramango isn't the worlds best assasin, but a resonable enemy",8,15 September 2020,"The Man with the Golden Gun is the 9th EON movie. This time, it's the world's best assassin after Bond.There's the first Bond movie where I think there are some plot twists and they work for the movie. The film explains itself really well, and although there are things in the film that could have been resolved differently and better, it is one of the better Bond films.Scaramanga is the worlds best assassin, and although Christopher Lee does a fine job, the film could have benefited from making him more mystified, so the movie could have actually created a kind of psychological thriller where one could have let the plot circulate around whether Scaramanga actually exists, or whether it's just Bond's psyche that started playing him a trick. James Bond is also reasonably pressured in this film, because the audience have never seen him threaten and hit a woman repeatedly.There are no notable plot holes in this film except how James Bond came up out of the small hole where the powerful ray of sunshine flowed down through. If he was hit by the beam, he would have been badly burned, and we'll never see James Bond come up.
Clifton James repeats his role in a minor cameo as Sheriff J. W. Pepper, which brings some humor to the film. However, it is incomprehensible how a stupid blonde like Goodnight can in any way be a secret agent.All in all, it's a great James Bond movie. One never doubts that James Bond naturally survives, but it had a classic Bond setup, and then Bond has also stopped scooping out his misconceptions about spirits.",The Man with the Golden Gun
154,wrestlingsitewebmaster,The Man with the Golden Gun,8,28 September 2005,"The weakest of Bond films to date partly because the relationship between producers Harry Saltzman and Albert Broccoli started to crumble for reasons unknown, but heck it was enjoyable! But one of the major flaws in the film is that all of the characters are ill tempered, and most of them are dosey eg Sheriff Pepper and Hip.Christopher Lee who played Francisco Scaramanga was superb and Roger Moore was superb as well. This was the last film that Cubby Broccoli and Harry Saltzman made together because of personal problems between them, but that would understand why the film seemed rushed. M in this film who was played by the fantastic Bernard Hill was so bad tempered for no apparent reason (he told Q to shut up twice) but did have one of the best lines ever in a Bond film:M - ""It's even got your number on it"" (Hands 007 a golden bullet with 007 on it} 007 - ""I mean who would want me dead?"" M - ""Jealous husbands, Outraged chefs, Humilated tailors the list is endless!""Hip on the other hand is not a very good character. When he 'arrests' Bond he forgets to tell him that he is on his side (the stupid twit) and even then he really doesn't do much.This was still enjoyable and this ranks up with other Bond film like Goldfinger and The Spy Who Loved Me, as one of the best Bond films ever because it has memorable characters eg Nick Nack (RIP), Scaramanga and Sheriff Pepper.Overall Grade - B-",The Man with the Golden Gun
155,eamon-hennedy,Fun frolics with Roger.,8,18 March 2004,"While far from being the best Bond film in the world, The Man With The Golden Gun is certainly one of the prime examples of how much fun a Bond film can be. It's certainly more light hearted than previous Bond films and is certainly a prime example of what was to follow after the three year gap between this and the next Bond film, although The Man With The Golden Gun is Moore on a smaller scale, with the bad guy in this case, Scaramanga, in a wonderful turn from Christopher Lee living in secluded island instead of living in space or an underwater city. Instead of world domination being the forefront of the psychology of the villain he is instead just looking to square up with Bond to see who is the greatest assassin in the world. All of this is done with tongue firmly in cheek, which may explain why this was considered a disappointment in 1974. There are many overt comedic touches here, such as Nick-Nack, Scaramanga's right hand man, a three foot individual who is more like an overtly psychopathic Kato from the Pink Panther films, who employs assassins to test Scaramanga, instead of leaping out from behind walls and such. The Bond girl, Goodnight, played by Britt Ekland, is a bimbo blond who obviously has a low IQ and gets into more trouble than solving the case, while the car chase, which sees the return of Sergeant Pepper from Live and Let Die is entirely played for laughs.I love it, after the strangeness of Live and Let Die, it was nice to see something like this, which was more of the reliable Bond formula, although with the more comedic slant. Moore relishes the one liners, while Christopher Lee appears to be really enjoying himself playing a villain who isn't Dracula, while the Bond girls Britt Ekland and Maud Adams are great in vastly different roles to one another. The Man With The Golden Gun is great fun from beginning to end. The film is pure candy with great chase sequences and moments of great action. Quite simply it is the film with the golden fun.",The Man with the Golden Gun

157,henrymadman,More action please.,10,29 September 2007,"The Man with the Golden Gun, released in 1974, is the ninth film in the James Bond series, and the second to star Roger Moore as the fictional British secret agent James Bond. In the film, Bond is sent after the Solex Agitator - a device which can harness the power of the sun. He teams up with agent Mary Goodnight against Francisco Scaramanga - The Man with the Golden Gun. The action finally culminates in a duel between the two men.The Man with the Golden Gun was the fourth and final film in the series to be directed by Guy Hamilton. The script was written by Richard Maibaum and Tom Mankiewicz. The film was set in the face of the 1973 energy crisis, a dominant theme in the script  Britain had still not yet fully overcome the crisis when the film was released on December 14, 1974.8/10",The Man with the Golden Gun
158,cordaro9418,It's a James Bond movie....,6,10 September 2008,"For those who said that Moore's debut in the previous film hardly separated him from Connery were given a ton of ammunition on this flick.Moore actually does a fair job of guiding his 007 through a poor story and mis-matched supporting characters (J.W. Pepper!?), but it was just too much film to carry. Maude Adams is far better remembered as a mature Octopussy than the ripe young Bond Girl she plays here. Christopher Lee, well, he's Christopher Lee... no problem. Moore versus such a great villain would have worked in another film, just not this one. Too convoluted and heavy... even the AMC bridge jump is lost on this piece.As for Lee, like Walken in later film, his great villainous play gets too lost in the mired down script.Still qualifies as a popcorn film, but a bathroom break is allowed.",The Man with the Golden Gun
159,98nurdinm-1,"This Golden Gun doesn't bang...it goes ""phut""!",5,14 July 2005,"Roger Moore's second outing as James Bond 007 and truly one of the worst James Bond movies in the series...is what you would probably expect me to write. And yes, I would really like to write that. The problem is that I believe as a critic you should try to give a film as fair a review as you can.In fact, ""The Man With The Golden Gun"" starts well for three reasons - all three of these reasons are linked, as the film starts with the three best characters.Firstly we have the Man with the Golden Gun himself, Fransisco Scaramanga. One of this film's undeniable strengths is the presence of Christopher Lee as the main bad guy. This character is truly the dark side of Bond, a man with the same tastes of good food, good drink and damn good women, and someone who must kill for a living. But Lee plays it as an obsessed cold-blooded killer, with no apparent care for his girlfriend. Speaking of which, may I introduce the second good thing about this movie, Maud Adams as Andrea Anders. A sort of updated version of Domino from ""Thunderball"", Adams is beautiful and also a very good actress. We can tell that this is a kept woman, starved of real love and affection. The scene in the bedroom with Scaramanga is suitably chilling, particularly Lee's face when she does not give in to his toying around with his golden gun. It is a pity that she becomes a sacrificial lamb when she does, and does not carry on in the script. The third good thing about this film is Nick-Nack - it's a great contrast to see the very tall Lee up against the petite Herve Villechaize. He has that wonderfully devilish look in his eye whenever he is plotting something, and it is great that the script constantly keeps us guessing as to which side he is really on.After the opening sequence however, it goes downhill very quickly. Moore is good as Bond, but the scene where he interrogates Andrea seems rather cold and Connery-esquire. Moore has a certain style for Bond, as have all the other actors who have portrayed him, and so the script should have stuck with Moore's interpretation.The script is not great, though several elements are intriguing. The relevance of the secondary plot - the Energy crisis - is still strong today, though I don't think the producers had guessed this when making the film. M has a few wonderful put-downs as well, and in fact seems increasingly exasperated by almost everything Bond does in the film.The script turns truly awful with the introduction of Mary Goodnight, played by Britt Ekland. Ekland could have been a very good Bond Girl, but the script takes the original character - the strong, secretary-type woman from the Fleming novels - and completely weakens her. She is, without a doubt, the weakest Bond Girl in the entire series. Her only relevance seemingly that to provide Bond with a woman at the end of his mission. He has other reasons to fly to Scaramanga's island - he has the Solex, though this is thanks to the incompetent Goodnight.The return of JW Pepper is not a welcome one either - why would he want a test drive in a car in Bankock when he lives on the other side of the world? Leutentant Hip is the second most bumbling person next to Goodnight, and even Q is told to shut up by M twice. The script does pick up dramatically well when Bond and Scaramanga meet. The dialogue between them at the dinner table is superb. The duel at the end of the film is also very good, with quite a bit of tense atmosphere; though after watching the pre-titles sequence we know how Bond will eventually get rid of Scaramanga. The music is okay by John Barry standards, and this is rather worrying, considering the rather lacklustre score provided by George Martin in the previous Bond film, ""Live And Let Die"". The opening theme is truly dreadful, the lyrics grating along with their cheep sexual innuendos:""He has a powerful weapon""That sort of thing.Perhaps the reason for the poor quality of this film was the fact that the relationship between Albert ""Cubby"" Brocolli and Harry Saltzman was disintegrating rapidly - an interesting discussion about 200 or so elephant shoes springs to mind, as well as a planned elephant stampede. Maybe it was Guy Hamilton's fault - he had made two Bond films already, and in my opinion ""Thunderball"", Terrance Young's third Bond film, had been Young's weakest. Maybe it was the original source material - the book is an interesting but short novel, the last full story Flemming ever wrote, and it would not have had enough to fill more than an hour, perhaps an hour and a half at most. They needed something to fill in the gaps as it were.Whatever the reasons, ""The Man With The Golden Gun"" is perhaps the very worst of the Moore series. But don't let this stop you from watching it. Every Bond film has it's positives, and this film is no exception - it is perhaps one of the best performances by Christopher Lee since his first Dracula and until the ""Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy.5/10",The Man with the Golden Gun
160,freewillyfan,The Man with the Golden Gun,7,1 November 2019,"This is the second Roger Moore Bond film. This film is quite goofy but fun. The plot is pretty average and the Bond girls were ok. The villain and henchman were very good. Roger Moore is pretty good but I felt that the people making this were still trying to decide what kind of Bond he was going to be. Some of the location are good and the action is quite fun as well. Overall, it is enjoyable if you are good with the goofy parts of it.6.7/10",The Man with the Golden Gun
161,ogdendc,Slow Bond,6,4 August 2015,"The opening scene of this one is slow, like the rest of it. NickNack (Herve Villechaize) is not a good actor and 52-year old Christopher Lee (Scaramanga) is clearly using a body double for the action bits. I don't think Lulu's theme song has weathered the years as well as she has done though she certainly belts it out.Bond's opening scene is more traditional this time with M (Bernard Lee) and Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell), though Desmond Llewelyn's Q eclipses James Cossins as Colthorpe.We're still in the 1970s with its brown suits, brown cars and product placement Brut aftershave.Bond still has his one-liners (I've lost my charm! Not from where I'm standing) but they are weak.Maud Adams never was a great actress and yet Britt Ekland is handed the doormat role of Mary Goodnight. Scenes with Lee and Adams are unconvincing due to the age difference. Clifton James reprises his mouthy cop from Live and Let Die and in the process hurts the film more than he helps it.The car chase is good, though.",The Man with the Golden Gun
162,TimBoHannon,The Absolute Nadir of the Bond Series,2,7 February 2012,"""To me, the Bond situations are so ridiculous, so outrageous. I mean, this man is supposed to be a spy and yet, everybody knows he's a spy...What kind of serious spy is recognized everywhere he goes? It's outrageous."" -Roger MooreIs that really what James Bond is supposed to be? ""Dr. No"" is not a comedy, and the movie's villains learn about him only via their own local spy network. Only after the events of that movie do Bond and the SPECTRE organization know about each other. Auric Goldfinger likewise knew nothing of him at first. Even Kamal Kahn in ""Octopussy"" believed him to be an adventurer and blackmailer. People did not attend the first seven Bond movies expecting to howl in laughter, nor do they today, nor did the readers of Ian Fleming's novels. ""Diamonds Are Forever"" began a very sad era for the James Bond movies, and ""The Man with the Golden Gun"" is the saddest example of how far they fell. By a large margin, it is the worst of the James Bond movies.James Bond movies began by setting the trends, not copying them. As the years have passed, the James Bond movies have been best when they move with the times without placing their identity in them. Just as ""Live and Let Die"" heavily pilfered from the, and I hate to use the word, ""blaxploitation"" genre, ""The Man with the Golden Gun"" often tries to make itself like the emerging martial arts movies of the time. That sin is bad enough on its own, but it is made even worse because those movies, while popular and new, were poor quality.One sequence in the middle of the movie most gloriously displays both faults mentioned so far. Remember, everybody knows James Bond is a spy. The screenplay forgets this, and he walks into a trap only to be defeated by a midget disguised as a gargoyle. Of course, the midget waits until after Bond defeats a sumo wrestler (in Thailand?) in a truly unfunny fashion.The following degenerates into brain-freezing silliness. Bond is forced to fight in a martial arts school but quickly escapes in time for his ally Hip (Soon Tek-Oh) to show up with his early teenage nieces. What comes next involves the two girls effortlessly beating half of the school, the getaway car leaving without Bond, an unfunny encounter with a young boy selling wooden elephants and the racist Sheriff from the previous movie (Clifton James) spouting his garbage before being given his comeuppance by a baby elephant.Bond (Roger Moore) is drawn into action when a golden bullet with his code number shows up in the mail. How far these movies have fallen since the time when Bond punched one of his best friends in the stomach to keep that number secret. Only pricey assassin Francisco Scaramanga (Christopher Lee) is known to use such bullets. Bond decides to find Scaramanga first, but his reputation precedes him. Yes, another character says that. What an international celebrity our ""secret"" agent is! His female teammate is Mary Goodnight (Britt Eckland), the kind of person who can make everybody in a room think, ""Does she understand anything?"" Her most important purpose is to prolong an already boring movie.The early part of the story has the potential to turn into a neat battle of two extremely skilled people constantly trying to gain the upper hand. Instead, ""The Man with the Golden Gun"" continually comes back to an annoying MacGuffin that made me think ""that again?"" and roll my eyes in frustration. Boredom rules the movie. It has its share of great sets and scenery, but very little interesting action or story happens around them. Director Guy Hamilton spends inordinate amounts of time on camera shots that desperately needed to be shortened or cut altogether. That flaw is magnified with a screenplay that also needs major editing.The final act is the worst. It is at this time that the movie is supposed to give its best. Instead, the boring MacGuffin dominates once more. This segment does have one of the series' defining moments when Bond tells Scaramanga that he only kills under the orders of his government and that those he kills are themselves killers. Unfortunately, the decision-makers behind the most recent Bond movies may be losing sight of that. If they do, they will be losing the essence of the character.Maud Adams plays a minor but important role, and the only one who earns praise for her acting. Scaramanga's puny sidekick is a complete embarrassment, Britt Ecklund plays a role that would make any actress look bad, and Christopher Lee has been better in every other part I've seen him play. Bernard Lee and Desmond Llewelyn have some amusing moments as M and Q, but some of M's lines and reactions, are out-of- character. Roger Moore is no longer tentative and unsure, but now smart, suave, and courageous. The problem is that the entire movie is embarrassingly fatuous and Moore is too serious. Even the signature stunt, whose awesome difficulty I did not realize until I watched the DVD feature, is completely ruined by a dreadful sound-effect. The encore appearance of the imbecilic Louisiana Sheriff butchers the rest of that action scene.""The Man with the Golden Gun"" marks the end of what I call ""The Unholy Trilogy"" in the Bond series. Fans around the world also detected that a great deal was missing, and voted against ""The Man with the Golden Gun"" with their money. Some real soul-searching was in order on the part of the producers, who did make the series right again. I only save this a one star rating because of James Bond's character defining line and Q's great return after a one movie absence. Overall, it is a boring, bad movie of interminable length. The Bond series survived this golden misfire, but barely.",The Man with the Golden Gun
163,Robinson2511,"A Great Bond for a Great Film, Mostly!",7,24 January 2016,"After the wonderful Live and Let Die introduced the best Bond ever into the franchise, the producers set their sights on the Man with the Golden Gun as their next film, the result was an extremely underrated Bond film.The Man with the Golden Gun features assassin Francisco Scaramanga who apparently has a contract on 007, so Bond sets off to kill Scaramanga first.This film has a very comedic tone, much like Diamonds are Forever and certain moments in Live and Let Die, but it feels like it's ramped up quite considerably in this film, but then, I don't mind that. Roger Moore gives a very Sean Connery-like performance here almost as if he was told to act more like Connery. The result is a kinder awkward performance as Roger Moore had his own interpretation of Bond in Live and Let Die, and returning to a Connery-style performance just doesn't suit him.The rest of the cast are pretty awesome, Britt Ekland very much like Jane Seymore as she plays a role that works off Roger Moore extremely well, and while Jane Seymore gave an excellent performance with great lines and a good back-story, Britt Ekland is HOT! Her performance and character is also pretty damn good too!Maud Adams plays a role that doesn't take full advantage of her suburb acting skills, fortunately she would be cast as Octopussy 9 years later. Her character is the character I sympathise with the most in this film, Andrea, Scaramanga's lover who is trapped in a hateful relationship with this cold-blooded assassin, however Bond treats her like crap with Andrea copping about 3 right-handers from Bond in one scene, and doesn't really try to help her at all, taking advantage of her later in the film, just before she is killed by Scaramanga.Then there's the brilliant Christopher Lee playing assassin Scaramanga, the titular 'Man with the Golden Gun'. As well all know, Christopher Lee is awesome in everything, and here is no exception. He plays the role with such villainy that he really is credible as a worthy opponent to 007. This was a brilliant casting choice.Clifton James makes a return as the hilarious J.W Pepper, and gives another brilliant performance. Pepper is hilarious in this film shouting his mouth off in every scene, and I love that he actually teams up with Bond in this film to fight the bad guys, he's only used for comic relief and disappears from the film without any closure, but he always delivers a laugh.The Kung-fu scenes are pretty nicely made, if a little cheesy, however Kung-fu was all the rage back in the early 70s so the inclusion of this scene is pretty smart, even if the scene of two school-girls taking down an entire fight school is a little overblown.Then there's the infamous car flip. Bond and J.W Pepper are chasing Scaramanga who has Britt Ekland's Mary Goodnight in the boot, and realising that going the long way round would take too long, they decide to jump and curved bridge doing a full 360degree flip in the air. This is one of the coolest stunts in the history of film, spoilt by the notorious whistle sound effect placed over it. Damn!The finale is pretty awesome. Scaramanga challenges Bond to a duel around his island which includes his rather strange fun-house. It's weird and fun and pretty much what you'd expect this film's finale to be like. And after posing as a statue of himself the Scaramanga had in the funhouse for some reason, Bond shoots and kills Scaramanga. Bond and Goodnight take a nice boat journey back.For the third time in a row, the main villain's henchman shows up at the very last minute to cause one last helping of trouble for Bond and his Bond girl. Hervé Villechaize who plays a suitably slimy performance as the dwarf henchman Nick Nack, shows up simply to throw bottles at our heroes who deflect them with the use of the back of a chair. Bond traps him in a suitcase and continues with the voyage.So... The Man with the Golden Gun is a fun but campy Bond film that receives way too much hate as the worst Bond film ever, seriously how is this worse than Quantum of Solace or Die another Day? Personally, I find the Man with the Golden Gun to be a very fun film and you know what, I even like the theme song. Lulu's the Man with the Golden Gun is a fun, bouncy theme that I really enjoy listening to, take that haters!I do find it quite ironic that Guy Hamilton, the director who directed the classic critically acclaimed Goldfinger, later directed three consecutive Bond films that have each divided the fan base. Diamonds are Forever is a film that many people enjoy, however it has also been slated for it's campy tone! Live and Let Die was regarded as a classic in 1973, however it hasn't aged overly well and is now considered by many people to be a mess with it's racial overtones. And I've explained the Man with the Golden Gun. Irony, who needs it?!The Man with the Golden Gun works well as a bouncy comical thrill ride with some very funny elements, such as the Kung-fu segments and the inclusion of J.W Pepper, which I do rather enjoy. There's nothing wrong with a comical Bond adventure, pretty much every Roger Moore film was made for laughs, maybe with the exception of For Your Eyes Only, Roger Moore even said so himself that he played the role for laughs.The Man with the Golden Gun is not supposed to be taken seriously, and if you accept that, you'll find it to be quite a fun adventure that is a nice way to spend a couple of hours!

164,cartesianthought,A good premise with too much filler and gags.,5,20 December 2015,"The beginning starts a plot that's a welcome change to the formula. Instead of a global terrorist, it focuses on Bond versus and assassin of equal wits. Christopher Lee (in his role of Scaramanga) plays the villain perfectly and is the reason why this movie is worth watching; he's joined by the pint-sized henchman Nick Nack. Roger Moore may have been a wrong pick for this movie since he's more of a lover than a rival assassin to Scaramanga, and the scenes of Bond being threatening felt out of character.The ending of this movie concludes things tightly with a duel between the two assassins, but most of the movie's middle was just full of random gags, chase scenes, sumo wrestling and kung fu. The film had no sense of direction. They should have either fleshed out the story or cut out 30 minutes from it and just make it a short. It also hurts that the Bond girl (Britt Ekland as Mary Goodnight) exists just to be ditsy and half-naked. This movie is a real tragedy - wasted potential.",The Man with the Golden Gun

166,Theflyace,"Bond Month #9: Um, the film that killed the franchise? Not really",6,17 October 2013,"This film was considered back in 1974 to be the film that absolutely killed the franchise. I do not agree with this criticism wholly. The man with the Golden Gun is certainly not the best of the franchise, but it is certainly not the bottom of the barrel. So what's the story about this film, let's see what's what.The story entails a notorious assassin named Scaramanga (played by Christopher Lee) who tries to steal a most very important MacGuffin, I mean a device that will seize control of the already depleting energy crisis. Scaramanga sends MI6 a gold bullet with Bond's ""007"" number engraved, meaning he will kill him should he try to interfere. But of course Bond does and must defeat Scaramanga and save the SUN! Yeah the story is a bit on the weak side, but there are some good moments, especially with Christopher Lee and his girlfriend Andrea played by the gorgeousness known as Maud Adams. Both are very well scripted characters and played very well. In fact, Scaramanga was initially written by Tom Mankiewicz as Bond intellectual equal, which kind of shows, but the producers and director toned it down to a very bad degree. And we have one of the best car stunts of the series (but it's almost ruined by a slide whistle, watch it muted!!!!!!) The rest is bland. Roger Moore isn't very interesting this time around, and he seems to be trying to impersonate Sean Connery, bad idea Roger. Sheriff Pepper is back, ugh, why???? He's so awful in this movie it's not even funny. Then there's Mary Goodnight. God god she is so bad I wanted to shoot her with a golden gun myself. She's ditzy, annoying, and not useful at all. I won't talk about Herve Villechaiz much, but i found him acceptable. The action is mostly blind filler, and the final climax for me is too slow.Actually the one line that made the movie memorable was at the end when M speaks to Bond on the phone. M asks, ""Where's Goodnight?"" Bond replies, ""She's just coming sir."" That's really funny.Overall, I'm not so sure about this adventure, sometimes I like it, sometimes I don't.So this isn't the best film, but it's not the worst either, for me it falls into the small category (in my opinion) of ""okay to watch."" Well, onto the more famous of the series, The Spy who Loved Me.",The Man with the Golden Gun
167,m-ozfirat,Good but marks the beginning of a decline,7,23 March 2016,"I like Roger Moore as an actor who has a refined and amiable performance as proved in his Pre- Bond film career. The previous Bond Film he did Live and Let Die demonstrated that he was capable of playing Bond to the same epic level as Sean Connery had done. However this film though enjoyable as it is and should not be treated with antipathy is the beginning of the end of the classic Bond films in which it diverts away from its original sources in to a meaning of it's own. However in context to the review I will start with the Good points of this film first:-The lead cast is good with Roger Moore, Britt Ekland and Christopher Lee who play their acting roles well with good character representation. The character of Nic Nak is especially grasping and intriguing as a villainous sidekick. The music by Lulu and opening titles are good. These major strengths make the film an overall success. Now the downside: - As a stated this unlike the previous Bond is when it starts to decline with Roger Moore who proved despite being a good actor was a good Bond but did not upheld it in his later films. The story lines begin to become cheesy and corny that becomes a pseudo-Bond film away from the original spirit and style of the classic novels as previously it had been scrupulously adapted to film and this deterrent spoilt the film brand. The story line of the Man with the Golden Gun should of been autonomously the later film Licence to Kill made 15 years later one film to much was used. This later film is the closest to this films original source content which would also of ensured standards of authenticity.",The Man with the Golden Gun

I was glad that they brought him back again, after his funny performance in ""Live&Let Die"". The highlight of the film was the amazing AMC Hornet car jump. I was glad to see AMC cars in it. They were at the bottom, out of the big three car makers, and so was this Bond movie to most critics, but I am going with the underdogs,and to say that this Bond movie deserves better recognition than it received.

Roger Moore's my favorite Bond but I didn't like him here as much as in just about all his other movies. Britt Ekland was okay but not great. And I'm usually easily pleased by most Bond girls (I actually liked Tanya Roberts's character in A View to a Kill).The climax was pretty disappointing. The fight between Bond and Scaramanga should have gone on longer. The flying car was kind of dumb. And I thought it was kind of pointless to have Sheriff J.W. Pepper in this movie. And I was kind of hoping he'd meet that kid somehow and give him the 20,000 bahts (it is a Roger Moore Bond movie, after all, so it's not like it would have been an unbelievable coincidence).Overall, it wasn't wonderful but not that bad either.",The Man with the Golden Gun

Thanks for that.Since the seventies, I don't know how many times I've viewed this movie.It's by far my preferred Bond movie, because it doesn't take itself seriously.The story is also very straightforward, not the twisted obscure complexe scenarios they often put 007 in, to make up a fake unrealistic story.The solar energy idea still remains modern, after half a century!The Island, oh my god, what a fantastic location in the Thailand Sea.And Briit Ekland, cute, sexy, naive and funny, pushing the solar button with her butt. Never saw her as good again.The car stunt? Screw it, fantastic, never done ever, despite the comic sound which underlines how the movie makes Bond a laughable character, more than once, at the most dangerous moments.When the little boy wins 20000baht just to show 007 how to open the fuel on his boat. And the fat clumsy American Policeman helping Bond through his pursuits.

I was disappointed with this film for a number of reasons and it seems to mark the point with several Bond films that weren't going anywhere as time would tell. Sometimes they weren't up to the point and are rather dreary or dated and er...er.. yawn. Even so, the computerised systems all around us have become totally dated as computer technology changes through the decades. Despite the good points I gave for the earlier Bond film Live and Let Die, this one there with the ""Golden Gun"" in extreme cases is much too tedious to get excited about and its rather boring. One interesting fact about the Bond girls in this film is that Britt Ekland already had a disastrous marriage to Peter Sellers while Maud Adams was later to appear as a leading Bond girl in Octopussy eight years later.",The Man with the Golden Gun

174,DMP-2,"""I never did nuthin` like that before"" ""Actually, neither have I""",8,29 April 2001,"For Roger Moore's Second Bond outing we get a pretty mediocre film. I will say it is definitely better than Octopussy (1983), A View To A Kill (1985), and by far better than the horribly boring Moonraker (1979). It is actually also better than a few of Sean Connery's films; From Russia With Love (1963), Never Say Never Again (1983) (probably just slightly better than this one), and definitely better than You Only Live Twice (1967).           The films few good points are firstly its handful of excellent action sequences. Also the return Sheriff J.W. Pepper is a real treat who put his mark in the best action sequence of the film, the car chase scene, which is where the line I have placed as the title came from. Also the villains are excellent, Christopher Lee as ""Scaramanga"" gives one of his best performances. Although not to forget the brilliant performance my Herve Villechaize as ""Nick-Nack"" who would be the foot stool for the creation of Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999)'s Mini-Me.
          The film is pretty mild on action, but high on comedy. If your a fan the comedy Bond films of 70's this is probably the funniest. I think that was probably the error with this film, the producers focused to much on the comedy, and not enough on the plot or the action sequences.
      The film could been better also if they changed the theme song. Lulu's performance of the song ""Man With The Golden Gun"" is not very good. They should have used the version written by one of rock's greatest artists, ALICE COOPER, who actually wrote it in hopes that they'd use it. That move may have given the film that much more luster.

178,sterlinrivera-2000,A Spectacular Bond Film,9,16 January 2020,"The Man with the Golden Gun is a big a step up from Live and Let Die, and is an all around interesting and cool Bond film.The film is about James Bond (Roger Moore) finds out there is an invention that got stolen, and it apparently can turn the sun's heat into a massive weapon. He travels to Hong Kong, and crosses paths with Francisco (Christopher Lee) who is very skilled at being a hit man. Bond joins forces with a woman named Mary Goodnight (Britt Ekland) and together they track down Fransico to a hideout where they can have a final duel.The film is very solid. It has a very nice and straightforward plot, and ran in a pretty smooth pace.
The acting was great. Moore did a perfect job yet again, and Christopher Lee did a great job playing the villan. Ekland also made for a solid Bond girl. Not one of my favorites, but still pretty good.
This one also had some good action. I do like the idea of the actual golden gun being a deadly weapon, and makes for a cool idea to the film.Overall, The Man with the Golden Gun is spectacular from beginning to end, and I would easily say it is the second best Moore Bond film and one of the best of all time.",The Man with the Golden Gun
179,tonynworah,Above Average,6,17 June 2011,"The Man with the Golden Gun is Roger Moore's second movie as James Bond in which he is pitted against a world first class assassin called Scaramanga who has three trademarks; his working tool is a golden gun, his price is $1m a hit and he has (yikes) three nipples.Under the belief that he has been marked for assassination by Scaramanga, Bond begins a subtle cat and mouse hunt game to kill his killer first.Later his personal quest merges with his earlier assignment; to resolve the energy crisis by finding one of their solar scientists.This movie just like the novel is arguably the weakest in the Bond franchise. It still has some elements of fun though; like Bond's encounter in the karate training school(trust the Bond filmmakers to exploit the current raging movie cliché), a car chase, Bond's fight with a dwarf.There were several scenes that beggar beliefs.A ""police officer"" arrests a ""dangerous criminal"" like Bond and feels comfortable to holster his gun while enjoying a comfortable ride with Bond in the back.Scaramanga who spares Bond's life temporarily in order to have a pistol duel with him, unaccountably does the unexpected.At the beginning of the film, a gunman is inexplicably hired by Scaramanga's man servant to kill Scaramanga.The plot holes can sink the titanic.Despite Roger Moore's enjoyable performance and Christopher Lee's chilling performance as the The Man with the Golden Gun, the film just managed to scale the level of being above average.",The Man with the Golden Gun
180,connorbbalboa,"Better than the previous one, but still not great.",4,3 March 2017,"*Sigh* I know. You all must think I hate Roger Moore as Bond. I don't. He is capable as James Bond and when he and the script get it completely right, like with The Spy Who Loved Me, he can pull off his sense of humor very well. It's just that most of the movies he has been in really are quite bad. Actually, this one isn't as crappy as many of the others; I would rank it third behind The Spy Who Loved Me and For Your Eyes Only. It still is quite mediocre.In this one, Bond is investigating a plot by the villain Francisco Scaramanga (the awesome Christopher Lee), who personally wants to kill him. Along the way, he tries to avoid sleeping with the pretty hot, but pretty useless Mary Goodnight (Why did the Moore films have most of the dumbest Bond girl names in the franchise?), gets into a car chase with the annoying Sheriff J.W. Pepper (Clifton James) from the previous film, Live and Let Die, in the passenger seat and the famous ""slide whistle"" car spin, gets put into a martial arts school (don't ask), and makes out with Scaramanga's girlfriend (Maude Adams), who wants Bond to put him down.Christopher Lee is the actor I love watching most in the movie. He does not have a bad line or moment. He's just the absolute king here. The sad thing is, besides killing Bond, his plot isn't that much to care about. He merely wants to use a certain device to control solar power, its prices, and who gets it. It's not really a threatening plot. Like with the heroin in Live and Let Die, not everyone uses solar power. Plus, what is he going to do with the money? He seems to have a content life just challenging people to death matches with his one-bullet golden gun. Look, I'm fine with Bond villain schemes that aren't about taking over the world. If I wasn't, I wouldn't have liked films like Casino Royale and Skyfall so much. For them to work, though, a personal scheme has to hurt a lot of people for it to be a major concern, and really, the only people who will be affected by this scheme are the really rich guys that actually have solar power and the people who are targets for personal assassinations that Scaramanga gets payed for.Moore is better as Bond here, and doesn't calculate his performance so much. When he tries to be cold, however, like when he interrogates Scaramanga's girlfriend, he isn't very organic. Connery would have brought more brute strength and cold-hearted lust to it, considering that his version of Bond seems to be quite at home with moments like this. Britt Ekland as Goodnight does not do a very good job and is probably the worst actor in the film. She's pretty hot, like many of the Moore Bond girls, but useless and when Bond is trying to recover that solar power device, she almost gets him killed or seriously injured. One other character here is a smaller person named Nick Nack who serves Scaramanga. I don't understand what he wants, and besides that, he's also quite annoying. The most confounding moment is when he tells Bond that he'll inherit everything from Scaramanga if he kills him. Wasn't Nick Nack supposed to be Scaramanga's friend? But it turns out that he was still loyal to Scaramanga as he tries to kill Bond after he has sex with Goodnight. It's just confusing.Besides that, some of the action is fun, although the whole situation with the martial arts school has no purpose, and Moore's improved performance certainly helps, but the uninteresting secondary scheme of the villain and the goofy bits that seem to be a trademark of most of the Moore films don't. Bottom line, The Man With the Golden Gun has its moments, but it is very average.",The Man with the Golden Gun

There is at least a sexual innuendo every two minutes in this movie. Apart that action is bit above the previous Bond. Scenery is great. Of course the plot contains its share of inconsistencies, such as when the villain acquires an industrial empire just by killing it's previous owner ... The villain has a very small staff this time. The intro and conclusion scenes are great. And the whole plot is scientifically half-believable, which is an improvement over the average Bond's.

183,Pinback-4,"Not Moore's best, but not his worst either.",6,28 September 2000,"Roger Moore's second assignment as James Bond has turned out to be the least talked about and the least seen Bond film in the entire series.  Many fans also think this is the worst Bond movie ever, but that honor goes to MOONRAKER.  Seeing it on the DVD version recently, I enjoyed it much more now than I did in the past.  The picture quality and soundtrack are much improved.  The story concerns Bond tracking down a smooth hitman named Scaramanga who charges a cool million for each contract.  He wants to develop a solar powered kind of laser weapon so he can sell it to the highest bidder so he can retire.  His henchman is a midget who is more annoying than threatening.  Bond's companion is Mary Goodnight, a secretary played by Britt Ekland, and she ranks as the weakest Bond girl in the series (though Tanya Roberts gives her a run for her money in A VIEW TO A KILL). Christopher Lee is good as Scaramanga, but he never achieves the proper degree of menace that is required.  Other characters, like the Hong Kong agent and Sheriff Pepper, make perfunctory appearances.  Maud Adams does OK in her first Bond film as Scaramanga's mistress.  The car jump across the bridge would have been better without slow motion and the cartoon sound effect.  Scaramanga only has one man overseeing his power plant, and he spends most of his time ogling the bikini-clad Ekland.  The funhouse is amusing and so are the karate fights.  Roger Moore is more comfortable in the role here then he was in his rookie outing, but he wouldn't fully grow into the character until the next movie.",The Man with the Golden Gun
184,souther02,"""Who'd want to put a contract on me?""",10,27 January 2011,"A lot of JB fans consider this one of the best. Then there is another group that believes Connery was virtually the best. All the James Bond fans I've known were or are men. More about that later. Herve Villechaize was famous for Fantasy Island, was an actor cursed with dwarfism. It is a curse, because the person with the affliction develops different physical problems over their lives. Herve is Nic Nac in the Bond movie, and is the sidekick of Scaramanga, a self-employed hit-man who lives like a millionaire. He makes his home in the Far East, on an island. Scaramanga is played by Christopher Lee, the Dracula legend. The criminal is as evil as any undead creature, and is a marksman, a killer, who uses golden bullets on his victims. The golden bullets have no special power, but they are Scaramanga's trademark, and a sample of his ego.. The movie has a lot of different dimensions...action, suspense, romance(this is Bond), but the movie is known for humor, because of the presence of the sheriff. J.W. Pepper recognizes the ""British secret agent from Britain"" right away.. On the serious side of this spy movie(based on Ian Fleming's novel), there is one of the most beautiful ""Bond's Girls"", Maud Adams who hails from Sweden. Her character in The Golden Gun is very much a kept woman, and her keeper is Francisco Scaramanga. There is a little of everything in the movie, including an unusual airplane. But there is much killing, as there is in any crime film. A very entertaining piece of celluloid from 1974, of course produced by Albert Brocolli.",The Man with the Golden Gun
185,bock_g,Moore well-balanced.,8,27 September 2018,"The ninth official film and the late Roger Moore's second outing as James Bond is considered by many fans and critics to be one of the worst in the franchise. I disagree. While the film is far from the great entries like From Russia With Love or On Her Majesty's Secret Service; it is a well-balanced flick with the right amount goofiness and suspense of a decent Bond film. The plot follows Bond searching to kill a high-paid assassin, Scaramanga (played with great charm and menace by the late Christopher Lee). The first half of the film is the cat and mouse game between Bond and Scarmanga which is quite suspenseful and hard-edged. This is exemplified in a scene where Bond follows Scaramanga's trophy mistress (played with grace by Maud Adams) into a hotel room, and twists her arm for information. It was considered a controversial decision on behalf of director Guy Hamilton (whose cheap, gimmicky style of directing actually works in this film than it did in his two previous films) who attempted to ""toughen"" Moore's Bond like Connery would do every second he comes across a women with valuble information. Personally, I think the scene works the way it did because it fit the gritty tone of the plot than if Moore (which he does in his later films) were to woo the girl for information. Moore's Bond seems more stern than his previous and latter films, but it's still complimented by his subtle sense of humor. Moore's most clever one-liner is in this film where Bond points a gun at a Portugese gunsmith in Macau who makes bullets for Scaramanga and utters, ""So speak or forever hold your piece"". The latter half of the film is more gimmicky with a car chase involving Bond (with the bumbling Clifton James reprising his role from the previous film on his side) Scaramanga and his dwarf henchman Nick Nack (played menacingly by Hervé Villechinze) in Thailand; only to end with the villain flying away much to the dismay of the local Thai authorities. Bond tracks Scramanga down to his private island in Phuket to rescue the blonde sidekick Mary Goodnight (played by Britt Ekland who looked gorgeous in the bikini) and to discover the villain's ultimate plan (something to do with solar power and taking over the energy market I presume, it's the typical Bond villain motive); killing the villain in a duel-turned maze chase and blowing up the island. Although the plot point of the solar energy MacGuffin could have been discarded or kept at the pre-title sequence; the film is a well-balanced Bond flick with beautiful girls, exotic locales, gimmicky gadgets, a whimsical score by John Barry (with a catchy and suggestive title song sung by Lulu) and some great suspense.",The Man with the Golden Gun
186,jonny_mcclatch,"A steady film, but the franchise was still adjusting to Moore.",7,20 March 2020,"Sean Connery left on undoubtedly his silliest Bond film, well the canon Bond movies at least. Live and Let Die somewhat got away with looking like a more serious film, The Man with the Golden Gun however almost certainly goes too far with the new brand all at once. A kung fu Bond, three nippled hoodlums, aeroplane cars and a midget with a gun. The plot is overly exuberant, Bond tries to find a device that harnesses the power of the sun while Scaramanga chases it and Bond for no real reason other than the plot saying so. My last criticism is Britt Ekland as Goodnight, another Bond girl who just seems to be there as a notch on his bedpost except more annoying. The worst part is, my guess is that she and Christopher Lee were chosen having worked on The Wicker Man released maybe a year before and you can see why. It's a good movie and she was great in it, so I can only assume it was a choice to make Mary Goodnight as hopeless as she is.There are quite a few things that redeem the film a good bit, it is at least a fun movie with a good theme song. Christopher Lee was a brilliant choice for a villain even if Scaramanga was a bit cartoonish, he was at least a villain that seems to be on power with Bond throughout the course of the film. As always the action is solid, as silly as the kung fu idea is it was at least enjoyable to watch and it works to Roger Moore's strength, his brand of humour. I liked that the boat chase wasn't as serious, it's a nice change of pace for the franchise which often took itself too seriously. It has one of the best stunts of the entire series even in spite of the slide whistle sound effect. The Golden Gun itself and idea of only needing one bullet, it gave the film a bit more edge, especially for the end of the movie.They also introduced Maud Adams to the series, maybe not the performance she is remembered for but certainly wasn't that bad in this one. Lastly the locations are arguably the best part of this film, Thailand, Macau and Hong Kong are beautiful and suit any Bond film down to the ground a real highlight of this James Bond outing.",The Man with the Golden Gun
187,tomasg-69814,One step forward for Roger.,7,28 January 2016,"A lot fresher than ""Live And Let Die"", this Asian adventure of James Bond does entertain some more than it's forerunner. But this story, who partly is a comment to the energy crises at the time, didn't do quite that good as was expected in the cinemas. Some mild crises was going through the big 007 machine as well, but that's something for the other logs to handle. I'm not going to.The movie, released just the year after LALD, works well some forty years later, and do entertain with the usual pattern and con texture for Bond movies. Known best for the spiral jump with the AMC car. (The first movie stunt scene who was calculated by a computer, I've read. True or false?) Two beautiful (Swedish) women battles for James Bond's favor in the sack, a very well skilled actor in Chris Lee as villain, with a midget wing man mostly for laughs. Those pieces fits together really well. Roger Moore's Bond career was still to peak; here he's still quite fresh, but keeps to build up his own 007. Before the triple of movies that made him quite immortal in the history of James Bond, I think this one is just equal to average ranking points speaking in terms of his whole 007 career.

Director Hamilton's flair and virtuosity are still evident throughout, the locations are first class and Christopher Lee is absolutely terrific as Scaramanga, but the film is utterly let down by an inept script and a cursory lack of 'pompous largesse' - an abiding characteristic of the Bonds. Thus, it does feel sort of being deflated with a long hiss, at least in its second half. And last but not least, the film is crucially marred by Moore's funny inability to adopt an edgier idiosyncrasy for his persona.

So what if the villain doesn't want to rule the world? That only tends to be the scenario in the most tired and lackluster entries in the series in any case. Moore is just great as Bond, hard, nasty, witty and ever ready with some quick escape routines. Not the best in the series? Maybe so, but it's a darn sight more intelligent and entertaining than either of Brosnan's efforts to date. At least this was a Bond who was worthy of the trust of nations, rather than the machine-gunning Rambo-like moron served up in ""Tomorrow Never Dies"". Some like Connery best, but after watching this film again (I saw it when it first came out and have rewatched it constantly since) all I can say is I think you're missing something truly great in 007 performances. Well done Rog. Shame the ending wasn't properly thought out, but then neither of Brosnan's first two efforts were worked out at all, so that hardly seems a criticism. And as for Lee as Scaramanga, just listen to the monologue from Fleming's book in the kick-boxing stadium. Lee was a sort of cousin of Fleming's, and when he delivers that line he's saying it for Ian. A great villain, a great film.",The Man with the Golden Gun
190,jackhamel1987,Another blip in the franchise!,5,7 April 2013,"Oh dear. The Man with the Golden Gun for some time was considered the worst Bond film (along with A View to a Kill), until Die Another Day came along anyway. As with most of Roger Moore's films, they were either hit or miss, and this one really was a miss because of yet another confused plot that hadn't chose the subject it wanted to really focus on (much like Diamonds are Forever).In the opening sequence, a Las Vegas hit-man is hired and sent to kill master assassin Francisco Scaramanga (Scene stealing Christopher Lee). Scaramanga is too good, however, and kills the Hit-man with his iconic Golden gun. Subsequently, Bond is sent a bullet with '007' on it, and this is traced to Scaramanga. Bond and MI6 naturally assume that Scaramanga wants to kill him, so Bond is sent to kill Scaramanga first. And this is where the plot loses it. It turns out that Scaramanga doesn't care about Bond really, and in fact respects him. Instead, this is all about some 'solex agitator' that can turn sunlight into electricity. Scaramanga has this agitator, and uses it in a laser to blow things up, and wants to sell it to the highest bidder. This, mixed in with some cartoonish action scenes (complete with scene-wrecking cartoonish sound effects), ruins this film and it's a dreadful shame.This film should never have included the solex agitator and the whole 'electricity' thing. This should have focused on Scaramanga and Bond in a face-off. That would have made for a stronger, more believable plot, and it would have played to the strength that this film had, which was the wise casting of Christopher Lee as Scaramanga. If it wasn't for him, this would be truly dreadful. As it is, Moore does an all right job, but Lee really does haul it up a notch as best he can. This doesn't even make the most of the Bond girls. Maud Adams is far better than Britt Eckland, who suffers because of her poorly written part. This is much like Diamonds are Forever.

This movie will have you falling asleep in a matter of minutes. Christopher lee is IMO one of the worst villains as he seems more like an insane little boy than a villain. Roger Moore as usual dishes out stupid one-liners while exchanging them with one of the worst Bond girls ever. Mary Goodnight has got to be the dumbest Bond girl to date and she does nothing but drag out the movie when she is captured. This movie also has THE worst henchman EVER in a Bond film. Knick-Knack was a horrible henchman and I would grunt every time he showed up on screen. He tries to add comedy to this movie but the comedy bombs. This movie gives a lame villain, a dumb bond girl, and a useless henchman and I still give this movie a 5. The plot was very boring but I like the concept. If they had followed through on it this movie would have been great. The car chase was not only comedic but it was very cool as this showed some car stunts never seen before in a Bond movie. The ending scene was clever even though I hated the concept of a Fun House for a villain. Nothing is spectacular in this film except the great plot idea and the car chase and stunts. This is one of those movies that could have been great if given the right actors and a thicker plot. This movie is just screaming out for Sean Connery as I feel he could have made this work. I do wish Connery did this movie as I feel it would have been better. Overall this is just a reason why Roger Moore is the worst Bond ever.",The Man with the Golden Gun
194,trekfan2001,Underrated Bond,7,14 June 2003,"I've only seen this movie twice. The first was on commercial TV where it was cropped to 4:3 and filled with ad breaks. For some reason I wasn't really impressed by the film and thought it was too long. However, I recently watched it on DVD and was pleasantly suprised by it. In the proper 16:9 aspect ratio and without any commercials, the movie seemed to flow much better and I found it much more enjoyable.While I don't think it's the best Bond, I think many people here underrate TMWTGG. Scaramanga would have to be one of the best and most interesting villans in all the Bond films. The locations (Hong Kong and Thailand) would have to be right up there with some of the most exotic ones and as usual, it has the good looking women.*** May contain spoilers ***However, my biggest problem with this film is J.W. Pepper. Both the boat and car chases were ruined a bit by having Pepper in them. He was over-used enough in Live And Let Die. Why did they have to bring him back for this one?*** end spoilers ***Anyway, a good bond film that is constantly underrated. I would give it 7/10",The Man with the Golden Gun
195,A_Friend_of_Sarah_Connor,Where did they go wrong? (SPOILERS),4,15 October 2004,"Roger Moore's first outing as James Bond, ""Live and Let Die"", was successful and it proved that the actor was appealing to audiences. While he wasn't as popular as Sean Connery yet, the producers were confident that Moore would be a sufficient enough draw. Therefore, they decided to immediately start production on the ninth Bond epic, ""The Man With The Golden Gun"". There clearly should have been a longer gap between films, as evidenced by the quality of the TMWTGG.There are so many aspects wrong with the film that it's difficult to pinpoint the absolute worst. An uneventful story that goes nowhere, abysmal acting, too much focus on comedic elements, and direction that feels like a made-for-TV-movie are all major distractions that contribute to the film's low rating, but there's also the fact that ""The Man with the Golden Gun"" is one big wasted opportunity; the film would've benefited from some tweaks to the script and a better director.The story (which takes little from Ian Fleming's novel) goes like this: a golden bullet with ""007"" engraved on it shows up at MI6 headquarters. It's soon linked to the infamous hit man Francisco Scaramanga (Christopher Lee), nicknamed ""the man with the golden gun"" for obvious reasons. Afraid for his best agent's safety, M (Bernard Lee) pulls Bond out of his current assignment and tells him to lie low. But Bond decides to go after the hit man on his own and soon finds that they're both on the trail of the same item: the solex agitator, a device that harnesses the sun's rays and converts it into energy.One of the biggest problems with the movie is the solex agitator sub-plot. By trying to capitalize on the energy crisis of the mid-seventies, the producers over-complicate a story that should've been solely based on the hunt for Scaramanga. There's a further misstep when it's revealed that the assassin has no interest in killing Bond after all; it turns out that the villain's girlfriend, Andrea Anders (played by Maud Adams, who's stuck in a thankless role) sent the golden bullet to MI6 in the hope that Bond would kill Scaramanga and free her of the hit man's grasp.This twist makes most of the film redundant—if Bond isn't interested in killing Scaramanga, should the audience care? Of course, by this point in the story, Scaramanga had taken the solex, so Bond was almost required to dispose of the killer. But then the villain's intentions are completely reversed: he talks about having always wanted to duel Bond, even though earlier in the movie he said that he couldn't care less about the British spy. This change of heart only seems like a last ditch effort to justify the ""duel of titans"" featured at the end.This haphazard plotting only emphasizes the deficiency of any actual story and there are parts when the movie comes to a standstill. It's clear that Guy Hamilton was at this point completely tired of the series; his shoddy direction lacks any grandeur that even the more ""realistic"" Bond films possessed. To his credit, he did try a more low-key approach similar to ""Live and Let Die"", but it just doesn't work; the film doesn't feel like the ""event"" a Bond film is supposed to be.It's obvious how boring the movie is when Hamilton's action scenes prove to be duller than usual. Hamilton depended on these scenes to hide his incompetent directing, and the absence of anything memorable makes the movie feel longer than it actually is. If this wasn't bad enough, the film's humour verges on the edge of self-parody and it often gets in the way of the story. The worst example of this is the scene where Bond does a 360-degree role in an AMC Hornet. The stunt was done for real and is amazing just by itself, but the producers added in a slide whistle in post-production, almost ruining the scene. In short, Hamilton's uneven direction causes the viewer to lose interest long before the end credits.As for acting, we rarely get such uninspired performances. Roger Moore was still trying to ""find"" the character and he sometimes comes across as unnatural. As the henchman, Hervé Villechaize is woefully miscast. The idea of a midget villain is ludicrous and Villechaize's performance is completely non-threatening. As Mary Goodnight, the main Bond girl, Britt Ekland has little to do and does little. Her character is annoying and dim-witted, ending up as one of the worst leading ladies in the series. And why bring back J. W. Pepper? He was mildly amusing in ""Live and Let Die"", but his return is unwarranted. About the only person who's competent is Christopher Lee as the cold and cunning Scaramanga. Lee nails the part perfectly, almost overshadowing Moore in multiple scenes.Things don't get any better as the film progresses, simply because the story doesn't go anywhere. The set design is bland; I can only imagine what Ken Adam could've done with Scaramanga's fun house. Even the typical Bond elements are lacking: the pre-credit sequence and the titles themselves are boring and Lulu's title song is one of the worst in the series. Musically, the movie doesn't far well at all—how could this be the same John Barry who wrote so many classic scores? To be fair, there are a couple of things I did like: the golden gun was neat and there were a couple of smart lines in the script.With ""The Man with the Golden Gun"", producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman proved that they could make stinkers just as well as classics like ""From Russia With Love"". TMWTGG is easily one of worst films in the Bond series and it's no wonder that it was also one of the least successful. I can go on describing how unsatisfying the film is, but the limit is only a thousand words. 4/10",The Man with the Golden Gun
196,asdodge,"""Golden Gun"" Undeservedly gets a bad rap",9,12 December 2008,"While some can never get over Sean Connery not being Bond, and while 'Live and Let Die"" may be more fun, ""The Man With the Golden Gun"" may be one the of the best made of all Bond Films.No, this movie did not have many of the tell-tale eye-candy and explosive action of other Bond films, it had a thorough story, instead. it also lacked the megalomaniacal world-conquering super-villain, replacing such tomes for a true and realistic espionage story. We often forget that Bond is a ""spy,"" not a superhero. Some get so caught up in the formulaic Bonds (the last couple of Connery's, the majority of Moore's and Brosnan's), that good spy adventure movies get lost or ignored.In this movie, Bond must track down a hard-to-find killer who has apparently marked Bond for death. In the midst, a new energy technology (the ""Solex"")has been stolen and is being put up for auction to world powers who may exploit it for weapon technology. These two plots intersect in the person of Francisco Scaramanga, the ""man with the golden gun,"" a hot-shot assassin who is the perfect foil to Bond's personality. Scaramanga is played aptly by Christipher Lee and has all the genteel education and affectations as Bond, but with a 180-degree moral view.The movie is quieter and much subtler that the explosive ""Live and Let Die"" which preceded it and the return to the more-formulaic cheesy-super-villain Bond films which followed (""The Spy Who Loved Me"" and ""Moonraker."") The lone weakness of this film is the one formulaic character of the clumsy and scattered-brained female agent. Ms. Goodnight (Bond's secretary in the novels), who is obviously in the film for eye-candy and sex. The movie is often listed as a ""bomb at the box-office"" which is not true, it made several times its cost, but did not do as well as ""Live and Let Die"" (which was a fun movie and did well- probably from the action and the curiosity of audiences to see the new Bond), and later Bond epics. But remember, this came out in 1974 when the world was in the midst of a economic crunch and most movies did not do well in theaters in 1974. The three years taken between this movie and the next (""Spy Who Loved Me"") saw a major change in America and led to the Bond movies' financial successes again, even with poor scripts and lame stories (""Moonraker"" ""View to a Kill"").In my opinion, ""Golden Gun"" is the smoothest of the Moore era and ranks up there with ""From Russia With Love,"" ""Goldeneye,"" and ""Casino Royale (06)"" as the best-made Bond stories. It may not have all the expected formulaic parts of the more popular films, but the plot is stronger, more realistic, and the storyline much less chaotic than most other Bond films. This is Bond being what the Bond of the novels was- a spy and hit-man. If you are after good stories and not easily distracted by the usual allotment of Bond bimbos and unbelievable super-villains, this is a must see.",The Man with the Golden Gun

198,Nic673,Why do people hate this film so much?,9,17 September 1999,"The Man with the Golden Gun is arguably one of the better movies or more intelligent of the series. I think it is only the second time in the series Bond is not up against a megalomaniac who wants to bring the world to its knees in some sort of way. It was interesting and invigorating with Dr. No and Goldfinger, but then the series got lacklustering. This is definitely one of Roger Moore`s best outings. I`m like the some of the Fleming novels that are based on Bond or not. So, personally I think most of the movies in the Bond series suck seriously. Unlike, all Connery`s movies after Goldfinger, all Brosnan, The Spy Who Loved Me, and Moonraker; I actually think this one of my favorite Bond movies. Christopher Lee has to be rank in the series as one of the best villians. His characther is definetly in same class of Dr. No, Goldfinger, Largo, and Sanchez. This is also another Bond movie like On Her Majesty`s Secret Service, For Your Eyes Only, and Licence to Kill (Which were three other great installments in two the series)that doesn`t worry about gagdets and actually put more in to the storyline and character development. Roger Moore has almost resemblance to Fleming`s character neither does Connery. Stil, I don`t see good reason why people hate his Bond interpretation so much same with Dalton and Lazenby(In my opinion are probably two the best James Bonds).",The Man with the Golden Gun
199,crawfrordboon,Interesting concepts and a lot of positives spoiled by silly errors. Spoilers,7,3 April 2004,"Following hot on the heels of Live and Let Die, Roger Moore's second Bond movie The Man With The Golden Gun is a troubled and confused affair. The plot primarily concerns a duel between 007 and Francisco Scaramanga, the world's highest paid and deadliest assassin, played wonderfully menacingly by Christopher Lee. There are plenty of memorable moments, mostly whilst Lee himself is on screen, and the fight sequence between the two protagonists, the culmination of the movie, is probably the best paced and directed sequence, let down by an obvious and irritating conclusion (Bond wins the fatal moment of surprise by posing as a wax dummy of himself in Scaramanga's lair).
A jokey camp feeling, ludicrous events and situations, and some rather weak dialogue undermine the rest of the film. For example, during the car chase in Thailand, the 360 degree car flip, which was technically brilliant as a stunt and perfectly executed, was overshadowed by a cheesy circus-style sound effect. Sheriff Pepper, the red neck bumpkin sheriff from Live and Let Die, is for some reason brought back, adding to the spoof dimension as he hollers and shouts in his distinctive Southern accent on the streets of Bangkok. For some reason he is buying an American car whilst on holiday there. Scaramanga's car turns into a plane, two schoolgirls defeat a horde of martial arts expert in the cheesiest fight scene in history, Bond impersonates someone by walking into a highly guarded house wearing a fake nipple as a disguise, and Britt Ekland is for some reason repeatedly refused the opportunity to sleep with 007. It's almost like an Austin Powers movie.There are so many problems with the plot I won't go into them all, but suffice it to say that for a Bond film the script is highly sloppy, with errors such as including a whole fight scene just to allow Bond a couple of one-liners. Most of the plot developments lack any kind of logic, and even obvious slip-ups are made, like M ringing Bond on Scaramanga's personal bedroom telephone. Again, this was for a gag. Additionally, all the characters are bad tempered and terse, which adds negative energy to the piece. The preference of director Guy Hamilton for set-pieces and silly humour over coherent and structured plotting and quality dialogue, the staple of a good Bond movie, encapsulates the problems experienced by TMWTGG.There are positives however. Apart from the Pepper and Goodnight characters, each individual role is well crafted, with Herve Villechaize visually effective as a henchman. Maud Adams is good as Andrea, although she would surpass this in the title role of Octopussy nine years later. Lee gives a simmering and deadly performance as the main villain Scaramanga, and adds tremendous screen presence almost allowing us to overlook the many plot holes. In fairness, Roger Moore looks quite uncomfortable and stilted as Bond, but nevertheless he holds up quite well and is a fairly strong positive for the movie, despite his character being involved in far too many seaside-style jokes.The locations, cinematography, set design, and choreography were well done, as you would expect from such an experienced crew. Despite the flaws in the written material you can still rely on this as technically pretty well done, despite what appears to have been a fairly limited budget. This was the last movie to be co-produced by Broccoli and Harry Saltzman before the latter left the franchise, selling his stake to the studio. Perhaps the imperfections in the movie could be attributed to the deterioration in the working relationship between the two, but I think that the scriptwriters Richard Maibaum and Tom Mankiewicz must shoulder some of the blame too.   
In conclusion this is a fairly flawed and inferior entry into the Bond canon. The purists dislike it, and not without reason, but despite the many dead ends and holes in the script, as well as the usual Bond habit of setting out to do one thing whilst accomplishing another, there is still enough overall quality to make this enjoyable viewing. Despite its many problems, The Man With The Golden Gun is still a lot of fun with numerous memorable moments to make it worthwhile, though if I had to offer a shining example of the Bond movies to win over non-fans, it would not be this.As a Bond film: 3/10. As just another movie: 6/10 Interesting concepts and a lot of positives spoiled by silly errors. Spoilers",The Man with the Golden Gun
200,David198,Not quite as bad as the critics claim,7,5 April 2004,"This and Moonraker are probably the most-slated Bond films of all, and there are certainly good reasons.  (SPOILERS AHEAD)The cartoon-like sound effect that ruins the 360 degree car leap, Sheriff Pepper and his racial discrimination, the most bimbo-like Bond girl ever, the climactic duel with Scaramanga that doesn't even happen, the dozens of grown men floored by two karate-chopping girls, Bond left behind by his getaway car - the list of awful moments goes on and on.But there are compensations.   The stunning scenery of Pang-ha Bay near Phuket and the amazing island that is now known as 'James Bond Island' even on maps, Britt Ekland in a bikini (though apparently the producers had seen her when pregnant and assumed she was bigger-bosomed than proved to be the case, hence the conservative bikini-top!), the beautiful Maud Adams, Christopher Lee as the cool and calculating villain, the British HQ in the sunken QE1 with its Avengers-like odd angles - the film has a lot going for it.

201,ianbrown65,Kung-fu fighting can't save jaded ninth outing,4,16 January 2021,"Few remember Roger Moore's second James Bond outing with much enthusiasm, and then only for Christopher Lee's nicely underplayed eponymous baddie, a model for the rule less can be more.He steals the film's two best scenes with nicely calculated understatement - the killing of the evil Bangkok industrialist Hai Fat ('He always did like that mausoleum... Put him in it.') and his first encounter with Moore in the kick-boxing stadium with the dead Maud Adams between them.The scene in the kung-fu school isn't too bad, although by now the Bond films were following trends not setting them.It was all starting to look tired by 1974; the flying car, the bland and uninteresting solar complex set (designed by Peter Murton), and John Barry delivers his least sympathetic score, as if for a different film. Editing of the action is also a long way from the bravura cutting of Peter Hunt. Even the key stunt, the spiraling car jump, is cheapened by a badly misjudged sound effect. The product-placement is also increasingly blatant.The narrative relies increasingly on farce - a bikini-clad Ekland accidentally activating the solar-energy complex when her bottom nudges the control panel, while Sheriff JW Pepper, the red-neck Louisiana lawman from the previous film, kills any pretence of credibility.The mawkish scene where Moore and Ekland discuss the dangers of their profession over dinner is cringing. Worst of all, Moore's second stab at the part makes Bond an insufferable cigar-in-mouth boor, with none of the warmth or humour he brought to his television roles.Flaccid direction from Guy Hamilton didn't help either.",The Man with the Golden Gun

203,mcfische,"Good film, wrong Bond",6,22 August 2003,"Could have a spoiler or two""The Man With The Golden Gun"" sounds very underrated, much like ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service,"" in my opinion the best of the Bond films. Like OHMSS, this film, while gaining much criticism, is one I find to be a very good Bond film. However, the timing of this film was off, which may explain why it didn't do too well at the box office on it's original release.This film is the only Bond film yet that doesn't deal with world domination but say that on the DVD case. The plot is refreshing after all of the assignments 007 gets; a private duel between Bond and Scaramanga, the man with the golden gun. Christopher Lee does an excellent villain. I can see why he didn't play Dr. No like his cousin Ian Fleming wanted; he wouldn't have fit the part. Scaramanga is exactly what Lee describes him as; the dark side of Bond. The villain's servant for once doesn't do all the work. Scaramanga does all the killing and deals himself. Nick Nack is only a manservant, and a very amusing character. Very funny how, after all that time trying to kill Scaramanga to get the island, he tries to kill the one who killed the man with the golden gun. We get the usual performances of M, Q, and Monneypenny, all good. I must confess though, that compared with all the other performances of M by Bernard Lee, this time he seems too hot-tempered and not calm enough. At least he's started calling Bond by his name sometimes instead of always calling him 007.This film has it's faults, like all movies. The biggest one is, AGAIN, pathetic female characters. Goodnight is a stupid blonde version of Moneypenny, Scaramanga's girlfriend could've been a heck of a lot tougher, and the tough girls in the movie barely show up at all. It's been since OHMSS; give us a good Bond girl already >={ And what was the point of throwing in the solar-powered generator? From what it sounds like, Scaramanga's plans for it suit a humanitarian rather than a Bond villain. The film would've worked just as well if Scaramanga had just Bond in mind. And last but not least, Roger Moore doesn't play the part right for his era of Bond films. He isn't a light-hearted gentleman agent; he's the elegent, ruthless Bond that was Sean Connery. Had this film had Connery and been made in the 60s, it would've been a lot better.All and all, I can't give this film more than a 7 out of 10.",The Man with the Golden Gun

I remember watching this film a few years ago as a kid and thinking it was good enough. Yes, the film is entertaining enough, an easy going plot with a few cool aspects, but there's really nothing too special.The main thing that was hyped up about this film were the islands and the solar-powered laser on it. This was pretty cool, as well as the long half hour (?) stand off where Bond has— what, 6? 8 bullets—while his opponent—who also happens to be CHRISTOPHER LEE (Saruman from The Lord of the Rings)—has a single shot. This, as well as the bonus-fight-scene- ending, was pretty cool.This movie was going to get a 6.5 but there is just a single scene that ranks it up. If you watched Live and Let Die then you remember that super long and awesome boat scene. Well, one of the parts that made that scene so good was the funny redneck Sheriff. Well, HE MAKES A COMEBACK! Bond meets him while chasing his enemy, and, well, it makes for some GREAT laughs!Because of that scene, I give The Man With The Golden Gun a 7 out of 10 for having some good laughs, and interesting features in the film.",The Man with the Golden Gun

208,dmbjam29,So Close to Bond Greatness,5,18 March 2007,"The thing that upsets me the most about ""The Man With The Golden Gun"" is the potential that it could have been a great movie.It has some excellent ingredients. For instance, the acting ensemble was superb. Christopher Lee as Scaramanga is one of the better villains, Maud Adams and Britt Ekland were radiant Bond girls, and Herve Villechaize was entertaining as Nick Nack. The locations were certainly exotic with Bond traveling to Macau and Thailand. The story was pretty basic, but entertaining enough.However there were many downfalls to this movie. I felt the scene when Bond escaped the Karate School was poorly assembled. The pacing seemed awkwardly composed and it interrupted the flow of the film. However the most asinine decision in the Bond franchise is what makes this movie's value free fall immensely. The pointless, stereotypical, and obnoxious sheriff from Louisiana that we saw in ""Live and Let Die"" has somehow decided to take a vacation with his wife to Thailand!!Not to mention the irrationality of that type of character to be traveling to Southeast Asia for his precious vacation and in the early 1970s none the less. His presence makes this film one of the worst in the franchise. A movie where such a useless character is in the film for a solid 20 minutes plus is unacceptable.This Bond movie frustrates me the most. It has so much potential to be the best Roger Moore film and possibly one of the better Bond films in the whole franchise, but you visually watch the film unravel, it's too much to handle by the end.

When I first got acquainted with all Bond movies some 25 years ago (say around 1987), I was quick to consider this movie to be one of the worst film of the series ever. I watched it again and again, and my opinion remained the same for a very very long time. I came back to it recently upon release of the Blu Ray disc, and I must say I am now most impressed with it. I have seen it several times in the last 6 months and it's quickly becoming one of my favorite Bond movies. Why? Because it's extremely well crafted, has beautiful locations and an interesting and fun music. Also, the plot is not completely out of this world and Roger Moore is very good as Bond in this movie. I would dare say it may even be his best Bond performance. To sum up, I urge you to (re)discover this movie. It's rather subdued in tone, may be abnormally so for a Bond movie. It's definitely no extravaganza like, say, the Spy who loved me or Die another Day, but an attentive viewing of the Man with the Golden Gun should prove very rewarding.",The Man with the Golden Gun
210,edblogr,One of the best,9,16 October 2021,"This is one perfect and beautiful time capsule from the 70s.One that didn't age badly, unlike most of the other, so-called ""serious"" Bonds from that era that are practically unwatchable. It is precisely because of the perfectly dosed self-awareness, self-irony and humor. This is evidenced throughout the whole film, in scenes like real full contact fight in the ring and close-ups of a two
brutal head kicks, just after the typical 70s kung fu ballet in the scene earlier. And, obviously, there is a lot of totally politically incorrect humor, typical for that era. The scene when Goodnight nearly kills Bond by squeezing a button with her ass ... or ""She's just coming sir"" ... third nipple ... Phuyuck wine ... I'm still giggling. Priceless.Furthermore, Bond is a far more interesting person here, rude and ruthless when needed, charming and calm when not. Completely unlike the lifeless facade with a smile that the script transfers from one set to another, as in later Bonds.The scenes of Thailand are astonishingly stunning even by today's standards.The film is not perfect, there are bad moments, primarily Sheriff Pepper (regardless of it being internal joke they used to react to the experience with the racist American South during the filming of LALD), the unique car stunt scene destroyed by whistle effect, as well as few less important little things here and there.Still, to me personally, Top 5 Bond.Objectively, no doubt in the first 10.There is one, almost Night Shyamalan moment, the moment Andrea asks Bond, ""I need 007. Who do you think sent that bullet to London with your number on it?"" ... The f..k? It's not about Scaramanga wanting to kill Bond, it's about Andrea wanting to get rid of Scaramanga. By Bond.

211,axemblue,Eh?!,5,7 July 2005,"If you want a Bond film that's crammed with 1970s cheese, look no further than ""The Man With The Golden Gun"", because this is the polar opposite of the dark and intriguing ""Licence to Kill"". Bond films, with the possible exception of ""Licence"", have never been known for their plausibility, but this one seems almost cartoonish. Bond (Roger Moore) is assigned to track down a critical part for a solar power device; at the same time, he suspects that Scaramanga (Christopher Lee), an infamous assassin with deadly aim who possesses a three-piece golden pistol and charges one million dollars per target, is after him.The late Hervé Villechaize (of ""Fantasy Island"" fame) plays Nick Nack, Scaramanga's diminutive henchman, who is almost impossible to take seriously as an insidious dwarf and takes any and all drama out of the movie's last scene. Meanwhile, Britt Ekland is Mary Goodnight, quite possibly one of the most unattractive and unappealing Bond girls of all next to ""Die Another Day""'s Halle Berry. And Sergeant J.W. Pepper (Clifton James) returns for more hijinks during Bond's investigation in Asia.How cheesy is ""Golden Gun""? Let me count the ways. The title theme, sung by Lulu (""To Sir With Love""), is pretty campy and resembles sort of an advertisement for Scaramanga's services (""If you want to get rid of someone/The man with the golden gun/Will get it done...""). Bond remarks in M's office with nigh-absolute seriousness that Scaramanga's most distinguishing characteristic is an oblique third nipple. (Don't ask me.) The interior of Scaramanga's island hideout resembles a sort of carnival fun house from hell, and Nick Nack's running commentary doesn't help. While in pursuit of Scaramanga, Bond gets his car to perform a spiraling jump across a broken bridge (apparently the first computer-calculated movie stunt) that looks fairly cool but is defiled by a stupid ""boi-oi-oing"" sound effect. And Scaramanga makes an escape in a car that flies around like an airplane. I kid you not.Perhaps the only saving grace of the film is Lee's performance as the title role. From horror films to ""Lord of the Rings"" to ""Star Wars"" and everything else in between, the guy definitely knows how to act and addsdramatic tension to what otherwise threatens to be a train wreck of a motion picture. ""Golden Gun"" isn't a bad way to spend a couple of hours, but there are several Bond films I'd rather watch in its stead.",The Man with the Golden Gun
212,Orpington,"No masterpiece, but still an underrated Bond",6,18 August 2003,"The Man with the Golden Gun is one of the most reviled entries in the Bond series, and its poor performance at the Box Office, coupled with the breakup of the Saltzman/Broccoli production partnership after the film's release, made it look for a time as if OO7 had reached the end of the road.  However, while it does have some serious faults, TMWTGG is in fact quite a reasonable OO7 adventure, and does not deserve the bad press it gets.Among the positives is one of the more interesting plot lines of a Bond film, as OO7 engages in a personal duel with his alter-ego Scaramanga, a fearless assassin who has sworn to take our hero's life. Scaramanga is played with real charisma and presence by Christopher Lee, that master of villainous acting, who is in fact a cousin of Ian Fleming's. Lee was slated to play Dr No before the part was given to Joseph Wiseman, and having waited another 12 years before finally becoming a Bond villain he makes the most of the opportunity.  Roger Moore, in his second appearance as Bond, tries to bring out the tougher side of the character, and in one scene he even strikes a woman. Moore is nowhere near as convincing a tough-guy actor as Sean Connery, and in most of his films he avoided portraying OO7's darker side, but it is refreshing that he at least gives it a go here, making TMWTGG a bit grittier than many Moore-era Bonds.Another good thing about the film is Nick Nack, Scaramanga's tiny henchman. Herve Villechaize plays him with the right mix of impishness and menace, and he provides Bond with a pleasingly different challenge to the giant, silent henchmen found elsewhere in the series. As for locations, director Guy Hamilton (in his last Bond film) provides many excellent shots of the Far Eastern settings, and Scaramanga's luxury island hideaway is gorgeous to look at; I also like the deadly maze Scaramanga uses to trap and kill his enemies, a novel feature of the film which I think works quite well.On the downside, there is once again far too much wacky humour. Unbelievably, the wretched JW Pepper was brought back for another round of feeble redneck ""comedy,"" this time as a tourist in Thailand, and there is one particularly stupid scene where two young girls karate-chop their way through an entire martial arts schoool. There are also deficiencies in the Bond girl department, with Britt Ekland's stupid and bungling Mary Goodnight not only being a sexist caricature, but also unbelievably irritating to boot. She is one of the very worst Bond girls, and things would have been much better if Maud Adams had taken the Goodnight role. As Andrea Anders, Scaramanga's mistress, she is demure, impressive, and far more sympathetic than Ekland; she certainly deserved to come back for another bite of the Bond cherry, and would eventually do so in Octopussy.  As for other faults, the film goes on too long (although the final showdown on Scaramanga's island is quite well done), and in Lulu's awful title song it has the worst Bond theme of the entire series-or at least it did, until Madonna came along. The silly whistle during the otherwise excellent car stunt is another black mark against the film.Overall, however, I think TMWTGG probably ranks as the second-best Bond of the 70s, after The Spy Who Loved Me.  It is not a very inspired film, but for all its flaws it provides some decent entertainment, and is a solid, diverting entry in the series.",The Man with the Golden Gun
213,divineangel,Underrated Moore Bond,7,21 September 2006,"Altho there's a lot of hate for this second Moore 007, I never understood it. For a change, most of the witty dialogue works well. I think it's one of Moore's best Bond performances.So let's break it down: The Good: - Roger Moore is witty and action ready. His fight scene in the belly dancer's room is pretty good. Tough and violent. Don't know about that cigar, but it adds a little extra somethin'.Herve Villechieze as Knick Knack. Not threatening, but a fun memorable sidekick with lots of playful malevolence. I love it when he shushes Bond.Christopher Lee. Nuff said, tho they didn't build up this character to the level they could have. Where are those deleted scenes between him and Moore (from the trailer and photos)that obviously exist? John Barry. Yes, Lulu's song is ridiculous. Still, I love the brassy music and this is one of Barry's most memorable catchy Bond scores. Especially during the karate scenes and the jazzy swing of Scaramenga's fun parlor.Kung fu. The Bond films always lucked out when it came to latching onto the culture of the day. 1974 was the height of kung fu exploitation and Bond was there. Still have BLACK BELT magazine featuring this on the cover...The Bad: - Miss Goodnight. Giving Bond a ditzy helper...well, bad night.Lack of compelling plot. The energy cell and Scaramanga are too loosely tied together and the film shouldn't have tried to pull a Blofeld at the end.Production design. Ken Adams is sorely missing here. And what's with that ONE GUARD in the massive solar laser set? Missed opportunity there.The Ugly: - JW Pepper.Slide whistle.",The Man with the Golden Gun
214,The_Eighth_Passenger,Extremely underrated outing for 007.,7,26 January 2010,"Guy Hamilton returns for what I consider to be jointly (along with On Her Majesty's Secret Service) the most under rated 007 flick. Despite having many things going against it The Man With The Golden Gun manages to be one of the most entertaining and memorable Bond films.The female lead, Mary Goodnight, is weak. Weakly written and weakly acted (by Britt Ekland) she gets by on her looks and somehow manages to not annoy me as much as other rubbish Bond girls despite being a completely useless klutz. Maybe it's the great performance of Maud Adams as secondary Bond Girl Andrea Anders balancing it out that keeps things tolerable. A special mention must go to the belly dancer Bond seduces to get information from as she is the ugliest girl 007 has locked lips with thus far in the series. Grace Jones would challenge her for that title 11 years later. Moore is again good as Bond, I especially love the scene where he smacks Adams to get information and threatens to break her arm – what a ladies' man! I don't know why but I really like a darker, edgier Bond and when Moore does it he does it very well. He doesn't even seem angry, like Timothy Dalton might be, good ol' Rodge is just like ""Yeah, I'll shag you, then batter you and possibly kill you if I don't get what I want from you"" all while keeping his poker face on. I love it. Scaramanga isn't a great villain but Christopher Lee elevates the material 100% - a true thespian. Hervé Villechaize as Nic Nac should annoy me to no end being as he is a gimmicky and silly henchman but he is actually genuinely funny and watchable. Lois Maxwell was always quite plain compared to her female co-stars but she was still somewhat attractive. Here, for the first time, she looks old. It's like watching you Mum flirt with the milkman. They should have sacked the character after this one but they kept on letting her embarrass herself for a few more years, poor old girl. M has my favourite moment of his in the series when Bond asks who could possibly want him dead; ""Jealous husbands, outraged chefs, humiliated tailors, the list is endless!"" Lee's delivery and Moore's reaction are priceless.The title song by Lulu is disgustingly bad, easily the worst of the series but John Barry's score is top notch, one of his best. The music playing in Scaramanga's fun house during the opening sequence (which is blindingly good by the way) is tonally almost certainly the best work he's done with the series since From Russia With Love.Of course, this is a Guy Hamilton film so there has to be some random dumb 'funny' jokes. Sheriff J.W. Pepper, that 'loveable' hick from Live And Let Die pops up to inject more 'fun' into proceedings and when Bond is attacked by Sumo wrestlers he defeats one by grabbing his bum cheeks really hard then giving him a wedgie. Yes, you read that correctly. Scaramanga's car that becomes a plane is also pushing it a bit too far for my taste.TMWTGG features one of the best stunts in any film ever, as 007 leaps a car over the gap of a broken bridge while doing a barrel roll. This stunt was down for real and it is phenomenal. Forget about the CGI highway scene in The Matrix Reloaded, forget about whatever daft Jason Statham movie you sat through last, THIS is the real deal. For some bizarre reason though they put the sound of a sliding whistle on the soundtrack as the car makes its jump but even the ridiculousness of that decision in the post production process cannot ruin one of the greatest moments in action movie history.I am a huge fan of TMWTGG, despite its many flaws it is hugely enjoyable and always entertaining. I am at a loss why so many consider it to be one of the worst of the series but to me it will always be Bond at if not his best, his very above average.",The Man with the Golden Gun
215,mdouglasfresno,Worst Bond Ever...Until Moonraker,1,3 February 2007,"Worst Bond movie ever? ""Man with the Golden Gun"" or ""Moonraker""? Yep, when I first saw ""Man With the Golden Gun"" I thought it was the worst excuse of a Bond movie imaginable. Dumb plot. Icky sidekick Nick-Nack. Poor actress in lead (Britt Ekland). Uninspired title song. And totally out-of-place, unfunny slapstick humor (""Sheriff J.W. Pepper rides again!""). But five years later I saw such shenanigans as a pigeon doing a double-take, Bond horseback riding to the strains of ""The Magnificent Seven"", and Jaws strolling hand-in-hand with girlfriend in ""Moonraker"" and I knew rock-bottom had been reached. Such efforts as ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" and ""You Only Live Twice"" look like high art next to these turkeys.",The Man with the Golden Gun
216,cortlahman,"This ""Classic"" really sucked",5,13 May 2009,"In the last 3 years we've seen a refreshing change for the Bond series. Casino Royale was so good that watching this older film now just makes me wanna vomit. Everything from cinematography to casting has improved dramatically since these films of the 60's, 70's and 80's.This entire movie is torturous. Back then people must have had incredible attention spans, because some scenes are drawn out for 20 minutes for no apparent reason. There are two awful chases that go on forever and have Bond paired up with an annoying American sheriff. All of a sudden this movie turns into Dukes of Hazard in one incredibly cheesy car jump. People have complained that QoS had shots that were way too short and didn't show what was going on clearly enough. The opposite is true with this film, for some shots go on endlessly.Why oh why is the main villain, Scaramanga (the awesome Christopher Lee) frickin' 50 something years old? If you wanted someone dead, would you seriously consider hiring a geriatric hit-man? If you made a young child watch all of these early 007 movies they'd be under the impression that everyone back then was older than 45. Even Roger Moore in this movie makes the 41 year old Daniel Craig look like he's just out of high school.I also find that whenever the writers are in doubt with these films, they just send Bond to Asia. Asia is a perfect backdrop for action movie filler while not having to worry about any sort of coherency. You can have Bond fight 30 guys, some sumo wrestlers and then have him go on a boat chase down a river. Perfect.I would only recommend watching The Man With the Golden Gun to see Nick Nack. His Ewok like stature at least makes him memorable compared to the giant Monsieur Scaramanga. As well, if you've played the incredible Goldeneye 64, it gives some insight into the origins of the unlockable Golden Gun.",The Man with the Golden Gun

219,bejwak,Better than given credit for,8,2 January 2002,"I think this movie is dismissed too easily by some of the reviewers. Moore is my favorite bond although Brosnan is good. How can people say this is the worst Bond Movie when you have DR.No and Thunderball. Everyone mentions the ruined car jump scene with the comic whistle and they are right. That decision should have lost someone their job. This does not distract from the movie as much as the tarantula on a glass sheet in DR.No. Tarantulas are not dangerous so Connery could have let it be on him instead of the cheesy special effect. However most people don't like Sheriff Pepper, I loved it. Britt Ekland was a weak bond girl but she filled the bikini nicely. All in all this is an enjoyable movie that can be watched many times.

221,thomas-williamson-ga,Roger Moore VS. Christopher Lee,8,2 March 2011,"Moore is back for his second outing as James Bond. How does he fare from his first outing? Well, pretty much the same. For those who read my review of Live and Let Die, I wrote that I would further get into the character that Roger Moore brought to Bond. Before I get on with reviewing Man with the Golden Gun, let me state that Moore's portrayal of 007 is more comedic and cocky than what Connery brought. This works to some degree yet I have also found it to be somewhat overused as well. You see much of Bond's arrogance in Man with the Golden Gun probably more so than the future bond films that follow. Does this ruin the overall experience? No, it doesn't. However, it does affect my rating for this movie in particular. This is especially the case with the character of the British Agent known as Goodnight. This was her only appearance and I'm glad. Her character while certainly attractive was simply annoying to me for reasons that I won't go into because it would somewhat give spoilers for those who haven't seen this. All that being said, there is much to like about Man with the Golden Gun which is why I generously give it 8 out of 10 stars. For one, a trend that we see in the Roger Moore series is the return of certain characters for later films other than Felix Lighter and the British secret service. In Golden Gun, we get the return of J.W. Pepper from Live and Let Die. Now some reviewers and critics have stated that Pepper's return wasn't needed. While that might be true, I still found him enjoyable especially when he and Bond play off each other. Now getting to the other main character and memorable villain of the Bond franchise... Christopher Lee as Scaramanga. To me, this character is part of why I generously give Golden Gun my preferred rating. If I may go off subject for a moment, Christopher Lee was outstanding as the villains he played; mainly Dracula from the Hammer series. For him to have played Dracula eight times says something about the performance he put into that character. OK, now back to the subject at hand... The famous duel near the end of Golden Gun is still exciting as when I first viewed it. As for the other characters in Man with the Golden Gun, most are somewhat interesting except for Agent Goodnight. While some will not agree with me on this, they can at least agree that her character did not add anything significant to the franchise although it could be argued that a number of Bond girls were no different in that aspect. Despite the minor flaws, the major attributes are what make Man with the Golden Gun worthy of the 007 series. In fact, Man with the Golden Gun contains the second of the James Bond theme songs that I really like with the first being the theme song from Goldfinger. I will include preferences to other Bond theme songs in my future reviews of the 007 franchise.",The Man with the Golden Gun
222,rharvey-74630,The film that almost killed the franchise,6,16 May 2019,"This is one of the weakest entries into the series and is a perfect example of the campiness of the Moore Era with the Disneyland fun house of the villain, silly martial arts scenes, and Fantasy Island's Tattoo as a henchman and the nonsensical return of Sheriff JW Pepper from Live And Let Die. The film even ruins a great car stunt by including a completely unnecessary kazoo whistle sound effect. The plot doesn't even matter because there's so much silliness going on. Every Bond Ally comes across as a nitwit; it's a wonder he survived (although the franchise almost didn't). All of this said; the film also has a mean streak running through it: M is angry in every scene, Bond slaps a woman (out of place in a Moore Bond). It's an odd combination.
What bothers me most about this film, is how much it wastes one of the best villains: Christopher Lee's Scaramanga. Lee overshadows the entire movie. He deserved better. At the very least, the movie prompted the producers to bring their A game for the next one.",The Man with the Golden Gun
223,sonomarcng,Maybe nostalgia but I like it.,7,12 May 2020,"Just rewatched this movie in my mid-thirties and it reminded me of all the times I saw it in my teens and I remembered the whole thing almost.

224,williamwallace-30771,an average bond movie,7,19 August 2015,"The Man With the Golden Gun was to be Harry Saltzman's last bond outing before he sold his share in the Bond series to United Artists probably to ensure the maximum inconvenience to his partner Cubby Broccoli whom is alleged he detested. It's certainly not premium Bond more average: at times it I really think it threatens to turn into an episode of The Avengers, especially with Scaramanga's fun house, his midget servant Nick Nack, it's human statues or the off-kilter angles of MI6's Hong Kong HQ located in the rusting wreck of the Queen Elizabeth all of which are just bizarre, not to mention Roger Moore's more Steed-like Bond (Said it before I will say it again I miss Connery). Although there are hints of the awful lows yet to come in Moore's time – Bond being saved by a pair of schoolgirls (seriously like what) or defeating a villain by pretending to be a tailor's dummy (huge question mark for me) – this is still recognisable an old-school Bond film (just about) , with thankfully few gadgets, although it's disappointing that the producers provide Scaramanga with an island lair and super-weapon to give Bond something to blow up at the end (a rather half-hearted effort to be sure and just so they could sell the film with few special effects): instead of a private army, Scaramanga simply has Herve Villachaize and a maintenance man).I really think that Britt Ekland's irritating 'typical silly woman' comic relief act was a bit hard to take in 1974 and to be honest it gets worse with each passing year, but Christopher Lee's Scaramanga is one of the more interesting Bond villains (its the only saving grace for the film actually), not least because of his imagined empathy with his prey – he regards himself as Bond's moral and professional equal (if you take Moor as Bond maybe he was better), its the kind of pathological snobbery Fleming's books were full of but the films increasingly abandoned. I do wish they had put more of this in all of the films but oh well.",The Man with the Golden Gun
225,megunticook,Not so bad,7,22 June 2008,"I hadn't watched this film since my teen years when I first got into the Bond films and watched them on television. I picked up one of the new enhanced DVDs and watched it with Roger Moore's commentary. First, the picture looks stunning. It's amazing what they've done. I thought, at best, it'll be nice to look at. But I was surprised how good it was in both story and performance. While it entirely ditches the plot of the novel, the writers did manage to keep some of the character history which gave it some legitimacy as an Ian Fleming adaptation. It also added some depth to the villain that could sometimes be lacking in the series. The film relies more on drama and light suspense than gadgets and action; it's more of a cat-and-mouse game than a race to save the world. The only drawback to the plot is the inclusion of the Solex. I suppose this was added in an attempt to reflect the current world energy crisis, but its handling of it gives a grounded, gritty action/drama film a bit too much of a sci-fi touch. Scaramanga's Fun House set is a bit silly for the proceedings as well. Might have been a bit more interesting had the two stalked each other through the streets of Hong Kong. But the locations are beautiful, John Barry's score is better than I remember and Moore balances toughness with his trademark light touch very nicely. And he's a delight to listen to on the commentary track. I will be pick up the rest of his films (replacing those I already have) just to hear his recollections.",The Man with the Golden Gun

227,Alexeb110,"Good casting, bad casting. (SPOILERS)",6,4 January 2003,"""The Man with the Golden Gun"" has two big problems: for one, there is not really much of a plot. Just a mash of fights and clever ideas that weren't used to their full potential. And two, Britt Ekland played an English Spy. Why? Why did the producers cast a Swedish actress with a thick accent as Mary Goodnight, an ENGLISH secret agent that aids James Bond? Well, she looks great in a bikini, and thats about it. She muddles the part up by her inability to act through her Swedish accent and her faux English one. It's too bad, really. But, Christopher Lee makes one great bad guy (Scaramanga). He is as suave and as dangerous as Bond, and he looks like he might be a match for Bond. Christopher Lee also has a midget henchman! Very cool. Scaramanga also only wants to kill Bond, in a duel. That's a lot better than some world domination scheme.

Comedy, action, suave & dashing villains, beautiful women and our hero. I think Christopher Lee IS the best Bond villain. Not just saying that because he's my favorite actor, but it's definitely his best role- good points: he gets to smile, tell jokes, have normal K9 teeth, gets a beautiful girlfriend, he charms you and scares you (okay, so I was little when I first saw it!!!). But he kills Maud Adams! Anyone who knows me can confirm that this nearly traumatized me (!). I think she should have been a villainess but I think they just added her character in as a plot device. Shame, because when (apart from some early Hammer films) did Christopher Lee get the girl.Anyway, it's light hearted, if it were close to reality we'd hate 007! It's got comedy, action, romance, the performances are good. I know they're just Bond films but I think it helps if the actors are adequate.

Bond films are basically templates for the manipulation of fixed elements which generally don't change from outing to outing.  In no particular order, there's the pre-title sequence (in TMWTGG, pretty tame - but then it's just a re-do of ""From Russia With Love isn't it?)  the title song (awful - along with ""Tomorrow Never dies"" the worst ever - I'm not really making much of a case so far, am I?) the Villain (Christopher Lee - outstanding, one of the best ever), the girls (Maud Adams - total hottie, Britt Ekland, damn fine too and who really seems to be enjoying her work in the film), the car (AMC Hornet - cool), the gadgets (Lee's Car-O-Plane rocks!), the one-liners (some great, some meatheaded and offensive)and Bonds suits (oh goddawful!).The usual backroom team all make cameos - M seems to have some sort of grudge against the world and Moneypenny appears far too little.  The franchise can change Bonds as often as it likes, but it has never recovered, in my opinion, from the loss of Lois Maxwell's Moneypenny.  the unctuous redneck from ""Live and Let Die"" reappears, although we are comforted somewhat by the fact that he is dragged off to a Thai prison at the end, hopefully to be locked up for life.So there's very good in this film - Lee is stupendous, Moore seems game for most of it and Ekland has fun - and there's the wrongheaded and dumb (redneck, slide whistle).  But on the whole that good far outweighs the bad, I think, and we are left with a film which strings along a good story line, reveals more about Bond's psyche than any of the pretentious twaddle dished out in the Brosnan films (and it's not a pleasant message we get about Bond, either) and gives us lasting pillars to the legacy of the series.  It's not ""Dr. No"", it's not even ""The World Is Not Enough"" but it is by no means the worst Bond film and it's certainly one which deserves to be revisited by the cognoscenti and valued for what it is - a period piece which saw the series at a crossroad, which they successfully negotiated.So, maybe all you flinty hearted Bond fans, it's time for a thawing of the freeze that surrounds TMWTGG, and we welcomed the little runt back into the fold.  Come on - you know you wanna.....",The Man with the Golden Gun
236,robertlloyd777,Has a few good moments,4,7 February 2003,"I judge Bond movies on their villain, bond girls, score, and plot.Villain- I think that Scaramanga is perhaps the one of the best villains that the series has ever had. He is Bond's equal in nearly every way. I personally thought that the producers could have done a better job of how bond kills him, because scaramanga's death should have been much better. I also liked Nick Nack. Now I really don't think that he was very threatening, but, like the whole movie in general, was there simply for laughs. He was a good, interesting addition to a rather uninspired movie.Bond girl- It's regretful that Maud Adams was not the lead in this film, but I guess Cubby fixed that in Octopussy, (one of Moore's best)Britt Eckland is sexy, and looks ravishing in that bikini, but is a ditzy blond, who has no place in a bond movie. I have not seen such a cruddy performance until Tanya Roberts in VTAK.Score- I love bond music, but even I have a hard time listening to this score. The lyrics are pretty ridiculous, and Lulu sounds ridiculous singing it. Good guitar work though.WHAT I LIKED ABOUT TMWTGG *****SPOILERS*****1. Great villain. Lee is, in my opinion, the most sinister screen presence in film. He was a great choice for Sarumon, and Count Dooku. Now this movie would have been worse if it were not for him. (As far as bond movies go, it is pretty darn bad)2. More down to earth plot. Yes it is fun to see bond save the world from some homicidal maniac, but I liked how in this movie, bond's objective is at first to find out why Scaramanga wants to kill him, but then to get that solar cell thing that will solve the energy crisis. It is important to remember that there was an energy crisis at the time that this movie was made.3. Maud Adams. I think that this actress has probably contributed most to the bond series. In this movie, she is an intriguing, but depressed and lonely, mistress of Scaramanga, who is supposed to make love to him whenever he is going to make a hit. In his eyes, she is simply a valued possesion, and not a human being. (Remind you of Sanchez and Lupe in LTK?) She was the title star in OCTOPUSSY, and was perhaps one of the sexiest bond girls ever.WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE ABOUT TMWGG1. Too much humor. I think that this film MR, and AVTAK were the worst of the Moore era. This is by far the worst of the three. First, we see the return of Sheriff Pepper, from LALD. His role in that movie was borderline stupid, bit here, it's just plain annoying. The only character more annoying was Jar Jar Binks. The idiotic slide whistle when the car does that awesome stunt pretty much ruins the whole sequence.2. Incompotent allies, namely Goodnight and Lt. Hip. I personally know ditzy 16 year old cheerleaders who could have outsmarted her. Luckily for her, bond at least put her to good use in the sack at the end. Lt. Hip was a bit more subtle in his stupidity. First was when Scaramanga killed the scientist, and Hip, posing as a Hong Kong policeman, pretends to take him. He doesn't ONCE tell bond that he is working for MI6, from the time he takes him to the car, to when he escapes from the boat. Second is where bond is held hostage at Hi Phat's kung fu school, where Hip's teenage nieces incredulously defeat hundreds of black belt martial artists. When bond tries to escape who drives off into the sunset with out bond? Third, is the Kickboxing match where bond meets Scaramanga. When bond manages to get the solex, he gives it to hip. Who does hip give it to? MARY GOODNIGHT!!!! WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD GIVE A REVOLUTIONARY ENERGY PRODUCING DEVICE TO MARY FREAKING GOODNIGHT!!!! hopefully MI6 fired him.
So in conclusion, this movie has a good villain, but other then that, one of the worst bonds ever.",The Man with the Golden Gun
237,thiinkerca,very underrated,10,11 June 2003,"Excellent bond film with good combinationo of a tough Bond by Moore with good jokes and an excellent villain. Moore's early outings had a real Fleming sense to them, this one catching it best. Not many gadgets, just good action. Moor unfortunately is extremely underrated in the role. He is correct in that the franchise always wanted humour, and truthfully these movies are not real spy films. If they were, anonymity would be valued more than the superspy status he holds. As a result he played it best. This movie, in terms of performance, Moore came closest to the Fleming characterization, though the movie had some funny and bizarre sequences like the dojo. Still that was explained effectively. Christopher Lee, brought the right amount of cool, by being more relaxed and underplaying when talking to Moore's bond. It creates a good contrast. Britt Ekland's part was that of a neophyte agent, and in this was perfect if somewhat bumbling. But again the humour was well placed. The reality is if this was not played with some laughs, it becomes a grime spy tale, that while very Fleming in nature is not agreeable for the public. It is important to remember this movie came out during the Church hearings regarding CIA activities. The Spy game was shown to be one far more despicable than people imagined. As a result films like the Kremlin letter, that came out just a little earlier failed because of their reality and grimness. People should separate the books and films and give the due to Moore's interpretation. Connery who used to be my favourite, over the years comes across to cocky, belligerant and thinks he can seduce his way to victory. Moore was superior and though the movies had humour, is that a bad thing?",The Man with the Golden Gun
238,Raysing,Ambitious,6,29 June 2019,"The Man with the Golden Gun is another enjoyable Bond flick, but with seemingly
fluctuating levels of production/execution. I get the impression some parts were too hurried and rushed. Lee is brilliant, but he could've been so much more here. Some subtly would have made Scarramanga more believable.

240,ConStar8788,Moore's best turn as Bond...,10,5 July 2008,"The Roger Moore Era as James Bond is always a subject for lively debate. There are those who believe he held the role well, while others say he never came close to the standard set by Sean Connery.Both views are correct somewhat, with the second being more accurate. Moore was not Connery. But for two films, ""Octopussy"" and ""The Man With the Golden Gun,"" he came pretty close.The plot behind TMWTGG is strong but its execution could have been better. However, that is the only complaint. Moore turned in his best mix of humor and Bond attitude. He comes quite close to Timothy Dalton's interpretation of Bond in ""The Living Daylights,"" and to Pierce Brosnan's Bond of ""GoldenEye."" That's a compliment.But as focused as Moore was for this film, it was the supporting case that lifted this film, primarily Christopher Lee as Bond's nemesis. Lee is a master of his craft and takes a role here that could have been great, but wasn't written very well -- yet still manages to elevate it to outstanding.If you're looking for great performances by a Bond girl, Britt Eklund's turn as Agent Goodnight may be the best of any Bond film. She plays the role of rookie agent and the many facets of her character (rookie, ditzy blonde, yet also fiery and strong) with great balance. And no one in history looked better in a bikini.And then there's Clifton James as Sheriff J.W. Pepper, improving greatly upon his first performance in a bond. James steals every scene he's in.Top it off with one of the five best car tricks (the spiral bridge jump scene) in movie history, and you have an entertaining film.The movie drags in some places and the special effects (aside from the car chase) aren't up to Bond code looking back on it all, but that doesn't stop this one from being one of the top films of the Bond series. Give it a shot.",The Man with the Golden Gun
241,ages_hence,My Ever Changing List Of Favorite Bonds,10,19 May 2007,"It always feels wrong to say that Sean Connery is not my favorite Bond. He invented the role...he is Bond. So perhaps it is a fine line to say that my favorite Bond movies are with Roger Moore. My introduction to all Bonds in my youth was through TV. Unaware of promotional campaigns or what was already existing on film... Bond weeks were a treat. It was a shock when I had three days straight of Sean and suddenly this Roger guy showed up. The TV guide only said it was a Bond movie. As a kid I'm waiting for the real Bond to show up...I didn't like it...for about two minutes : ) Most of Roger's Bonds have that one great stunt and one great chase and all of his movies have great music. Never mind the fact that he is great too. Much has been made of his turning Bond into a comedy act but he carried the series and it is why it exists today. And anybody with open eyes and ears will realize that he played a very tough Bond in this flic. The biggest disappointment to me is the sad decision of minimalizing a terrific car jump with a quirky sound effect. It always made no sense to me to hear this sound effect with the stunt...it has the effect that you are not watching a real stunt at all ... that it must be some trick and not the real life, death defying jump that it was. If George Lucas can remake Star Wars ... please Bond producers....I'd rather have a moment of silence than hear that annoying sound effect. OK enough ranting....what to say about plot and scenery? Great thing about Bonds is the travelogue. Nobody in America was travelling to Bangkok or Hong Kong in the numbers of today. This was exotic. When they talk about a ""Bottoms Up Club"" and ""Peninsula Hotel"" with green limos....this is real life. Bond was filmed on location and a boat race in Bangkok canals is a boat race in Bangok canals! An original plot and character in Scaramanga ....loved that golden bullet idea and it created a better atmosphere for Bond and M to develop an on screen chemistry in at least three scenes together. Robert Brown was a great M but for me the best James Bonds are with Bernard Lee. So sit back and watch a terrific cast, hear terrific music, and tour the great cities of Asia!",The Man with the Golden Gun

243,FilmDog-1,Thank God They Didn't Make Many More Like This,1,17 March 2002,"When looking at the whole of the James Bond series, there aren't that many films which come under the catorgory of 'total trash'. Sadly this one does. Because of this, the film has been one of the lowest money making films in the Bond series; only banking $98 million.Although the reason for this could have been between the relationship of the two producers, Albert R Broccoli and Harry Saltzman (by the time the next Bond film would come out 'The Spy Who Loved Me' Saltzman would break the partnership in two because of finaicial troubles). Almost every part of this film is uninspired this of course doesn't highlight the acting. A wonderful and classic villian is played by Christopher Lee (who has family connections to writer of James Bond Ian Fleming; they were cousins) who in many ways is the darkside to James Bond, (in which we see in the dinning scene on Scaramanga's island). There isn't that much to say about this film. From the outset it feels more of one of Moore's continues 'Saint' episodes. Although the 'leap into the unkown' jump that has a car jumping a spectacular 360-degree car jump in only one take, is (and still is) a great and wonderful piece of footage; clouded by the dark and dull shadow of the rest of the film.",The Man with the Golden Gun

It has all the style and suave humor you could possibly want. It has a fantastic baddie. Probably the best. Would Die-hard be voted the greatest action film time and time again on Mr Willis's presence alone.No! Alan Rickman was a massive part of what makes that film great. In the same way that Christopher Lee makes this film great. He is totally believable as a man with complete control over his life looking for a high stake challenge. There is a car stunt that was years in the planning and has never been recreated even after NASA released the mathematical equations they drew up to make it possible in the first place. Exotic locations and very cool cars (and other vehicles) top it all off.Yes at times its OTT and a bit silly. Other times it's all action and suspense.

246,aclasschris,Golden Gun is Golden Surprise!,7,6 January 2006,"Roger Moore's second outing as Agent 007 puts him against the evil trick shot artist/assassin, Scaramanga (Christopher Lee). Hailed by many Connery fans as the film that marked the downfall of the 007 franchise, 'The Man With The Golden Gun' turns out to be one of the most pleasant surprises of the entire series and one of the 'better' Roger Moore films. 'Gun' does take some getting used to, in fact, more times than not, you need to see it a few times to really begin to enjoy the film. The cast is great, one of the better ones of the entire series. There are two leading ladies in this film, the wonderful Maud Adams, who would later star in Octopussy (1983), and the terrible Britt Ekland who just acts so dumb and hopeless that it almost angers viewers. The villain Scaramanga is top notch as well as his comical, yet silently evil assistant, Nick Nack, played by French painter Herve Villechaize. The plot of the film is very interesting, the locals are exotic (which is always an extremely important part of a bond film), and Roger Moore continues to develop his character from a Connery-clone to putting his own, charming spin on 007. All-in-all, 'Gun' is another good 007 adventure and is quite possibly the 4th best Roger Moore Bond film. Any fan of the series should give it a second look before they hail it as 'bad'.",The Man with the Golden Gun

248,paldredge,The Man with the Golden Gun,4,3 November 2005,"11-3-05 Review #2.I love all the Bond films. Continuing my review of all 20, from least favorite to #1 favorite. The Man with the Golden Gun ranks #19.By no means a bad film. The rating may say 4 stars, but I am only comparing this with other Bond films. This 007 feature is in a way one of the most unique of the bunch. First off, how can you have a better villain than the great Christopher Lee. And he is very good in this film. Not just a card board baddie. You feel for him some and understand him a little. Maud Adams is great as well. And Britt Eklund as Mary Goodnight is very attractive too, if a bit whinny. The score really helps in this one more than in some others, and is used well. And although bringing back the Sheriff from Live and Let Die is a little coincidental and corny, it's still pretty funny. There's an awesome car jump that is just unbelievable. There is a nice scene in which 007 fights (is chased by) a school of karate students. And the picture is a bit more focused than Moores first 007 film Live and Let Die, which took a while to build up steam. But on the down side, the film has many slow points and some of the cheesy moments from the Roger Moore era start to come through. I really like Moore, but sometimes he gets a bit to hammy. The story was original and different but they could have pushed the envelope a bit. It all turns out pretty predictable. There is very little of a climax. The last gun duel between hero and villain was sort of a let down, although it was cool how 007 tricks the title villain. And the last action scene is 007 fighting tattoo from Fantasy Island? Cute, but I expected more action in the last half. So I give The Man with the Golden Gun a 4.5 compared to the other Bond films. Stay tuned for my next review of ""The World is Not Enough"".",The Man with the Golden Gun
249,ffolkes,"""Flat on his coup de grace""",10,21 September 1998,"Despite it's unfortunate performance at the box office, 'The Man With The Golden Gun' can be viewed today as one of the very best films in the 007 series. After making the role of James Bond very much his own in 'Live & Let Die', Roger Moore develops a nastier streak for his second outing in the part. For the first time in the series since Goldfinger's potentially castrating lazer, Bond seems genuinely worried: here at last he is faced with an adversary armed with sufficient knowledge of his skills and movements to finally engineer his destruction. That Scaramanga, the titular 'Man With The Golden Gun' fails in this task is due merely to his pompous professional arrogance. Moore delivers his finest performance as Bond here (though his wardrobe was clearly in need of some work, viz the awful green safari suit), and is matched perfectly by horror icon Christopher Lee as Scaramanga. The girls are great too - Maud Adams turns in one of the best female performances in the series, and for my money, Britt Ekland is the finest looking of all Bond's bed mates. A cutting line in wit (with even Sheriff Pepper made a little funnier), some spectacular set pieces and a dark quality absent since 'From Russia With Love' add up to make this a contender for the title 'Best Bond Film'. It could well have been an outright winner, but the logic of Scaramanga rather falls apart in the finale (how can he have all of the technical equiptment when he hasn't a clue what it does or how to use it). Still, this is a minor quible. A great film.",The Man with the Golden Gun

252,Derekflint-726-995720,Oh...the pain.,2,29 July 2017,"I should preface this by saying I've been a hard-core James Bond fan since my first viewing of GOLDFINGER on the big screen, back in 1964, at the tender age of 10. I've seen the Bond movies at their best, and then with this title in mind, definitely at their worst. I was in the Navy back in 1974, at the Great Lakes Naval training facility, and my buddy and I used to go into Chicago on the weekends. We'd go to the USO, where they would give us sandwiches and cokes, and sometimes free tickets to the movies. I saw that MWTGG was opening that Friday, and asked my buddy if he wanted to go see it. He never saw a James Bond movie in his life (!), and so I told him that he was in for the time of his life! Anyway to make a long story short, he was dazzled and had the time of his life, while I sat in my chair, cringing at what I was seeing on the screen and wondering, ""what have they done to my James Bond?"" I should add that I didn't badmouth the movie to my friend, since he had such a great time, but just wondered to myself, ""is this the end of the series?""If I could express my feelings about MWTGG, I'd say that it was the closest a James Bond film came to be like one of Columbia's Dean Martin Matt Helm movies. I remember whenever a new 007 film premiered, it was like Christmas time! I sensed things were starting to go wrong when DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER came out. Production values were down, bits of slapstick humor we're starting to be thrown in and the writing just wasn't up to the previous standards. The Bond movies were starting to copy trends, instead of setting them, as the previous films had. LIVE AND LET DIE came out, and for some reason , which I can't explain, everything worked. Although, with the debut of Roger Moore, we were definitely seen a new kind of James Bond. The movie was a lot of fun, and the small bits of comedy were reigned in by the overall action and adventure. Followed up by GOLDEN GUN, however, and everything seemed to just spiral downward. I can't go into details, without a ton of spoilers, but we were seeing , what should have been a classic with the great Christopher Lee as the villain, a movie that, like all the other studios were churning out, a parody of the series, itself ! Fortunately, the excellent THE SPY WHO LOVED ME followed, and the series got back on track.",The Man with the Golden Gun
253,Chelios24,Definitely underrated,8,13 February 2007,"This movie is often derided as one of the worst Bond movies. And some of the critics' points have merit. There is some ridiculous humor in this, and the ending seems tacked on, ridiculous, and unnecessary. But just because there are three weak points in the film doesn't make it as bad as people say. The acting is top notch for a Bond film. Roger Moore convinces you that he is James Bond in his second outing, if you weren't already convinced by Live and Let Die. There are some stellar action scenes. The action scenes are involving, they're not aimless and uninspired. Not to mention they're EXTREMELY well done, some of the most entertaining sequences in any action movie. Scaramanga, played by Christopher Lee, is quite possibly the best Bond villain. That the acting for the character is amazing goes without saying, it's Chris Lee we're talking about. He's sinister, sadistic, and doesn't have a massive plan of global domination. In many ways, this film is the most private of the Bond films. In the end it comes down to Bond vs Scaramanga, mano a mano, as Scaramanga puts it, ""the battle of the titans."" Finally there's a villain to match Bond, and as Lee also put it, Scaramanga is ""the darker side of Bond."" If you want to see Bond battle inner demons represented in other characters, this is the movie for you. He's also probably the most evil villain, even without the domination plot.Nick Nack, the midget henchman is....unique. Some people find it over the top, but his humor in the film (with the exception of the finale) is actually quite creepy and understated. He actually adds to the overall uneasiness of this movie that makes it so good. The humor itself is also fairly good, but you have to at least accept Moore as Bond to think so. But there are some weak points: The Sheriff from Live and Let Die returns unnecessarily, and his humor hurts the story. There is an awkward point where Moore is being attacked by a sumo wrestler, and he grips the wrestler's butt in a close up shot that seems a little....weird. And of course, the ending is tacked on and ridiculous. It just comes out of nowhere and is a little too slapstick for me. But overall, those few low points don't distract too terribly, and while it's not the absolute best of the Bond films, it's really good and terribly underrated.",The Man with the Golden Gun
254,momma-28991,"Not the best, not the worse",7,27 July 2017,"While not the best Bond film, TMWTGG is definitely memorable. Christopher Lee is fabulous as Scaramanga, and Herve is great as his sidekick Nick Nack. They are two of my most favorite Bond villains. The golden gun is cool, the fun house is great, and the island lair is awesome. I was sad to see it destroyed at the end.Maud Adams is very believable as Scaramanga's frightened girlfriend. She plays her role well and looks beautiful in every scene. The musical score was quite nice. I liked the main theme song, and I really liked the musical montages throughout the film.The main problem that I had with this film, is that Roger was not playing Bond in his own style. I have since read that it was the director who wanted him to play the role with more toughness, while Roger did not particularly enjoy some of the scenes that he had to do. Such as the scene where he slapped Andrea across the face, and twisted her arm behind her back and threatened to break it. I did not care for that scene and found that it just didn't suit Roger's style. I also strongly disliked the scene where he pushed Goodnight into the closet and had sex with Andrea right in the same room. Then when Andrea leaves and he gets Goodnight out of the closet, he does not even apologize. Simply that it was all in the line of duty and not to worry because her time will come ? Yuck. He came across as such a cad in that scene. We know all too well Bond's penchant for hopping from one woman's bed to another, but Roger always played the role with charm and humour. While never committing to one woman, Roger's Bond always seemed to genuinely care for the women he was with. His behavior in these scenes were out of character for him, and they made me dislike his character. So glad he went back to his usual style in the next film.This is definitely not Moore's best Bond film, but it is certainly not his worse either. The villains are great, the island hideaway is great, the music is great, and Maud Adams does a great job with her role. Roger is as handsome as usual, and he does have some funny lines (ie: when he aims the gun at the guy's crotch and tells him to talk or forever hold his piece), but he was not playing the role his way, and seeing him playing Bond as a ""brute"" and a ""cad"", just didn't suit him. Still an enjoyable watch, but definitely not my favorite.",The Man with the Golden Gun

It has a exciting plot and of course a great Bond villain, the one and only Christopher Lee as the ruthless hit-man Fransisco Scaramanga.When a golden bullet arrives at the headquarters of British intelligence with ""007"" engraved on it, the British believe that James Bond is the next target for international assassin Scaramanga. 007 is given the assignment to kill Scaramanga before he kills Bond and collects his $1,000,000 fee.On the other side this movie has flaws. I can admit that! The title song is horrible, man just read the lyrics. Goodnight is a horrible and annoying character. I laugh every time Britt Ekland says "" Oh James "" and "" Oh Darling "".It's action here but not too much. Many has considered this movie as a slow bond movie. I love the action scenes here.

Great action for a Bond movie.Scaramanga is maybe one of the best Bond villains I have ever seen. Ranks high with Red Grant, Max Zorin and Franz Sanchez as my all time favourite Bond villain.I love the music of John Barry in this movie. It sets the mood for the film at once. Roger Moore is also good as Bond. We see a little Connery in him. Take my word, it's the last time you are going to see Moore punch women and kids.Still today it's my favourite Bond flick. Moore has never been this good, if you don't count For Your Eyes Only. Highly recommended for Bond fans! 10 out of 10",The Man with the Golden Gun
259,tiepilot-geo,"Great? Not Really, But a Must-See Anyway",6,3 July 2011,"Is this the best Bond film? No. Is it the best Roger Moore Bond film? No. Is it a must-see for Bond aficionados? Yes. For one reason: Christopher Lee is quite possibly the only actor in a Bond film who not only knew Ian Fleming, but who was already one of the inspirations for characters in the Bond novels. Lee knew Fleming when both were involved in what Churchill called ""The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare"" so while he doesn't play the same role here, Lee is quite possibly the only actor in a Bond film who could genuinely say he'd been the real thing. And any movie in which Christopher Lee appears is probably worth watching just for that.",The Man with the Golden Gun
260,robert_hmr,The Worst Bond Film,3,18 December 2006,"The weakest of the Bond entries so far, The Man with the Golden Gun represents the series at rock-bottom. Maybe it's because the partnership between Broccoli and Saltzman was quickly dissolving, since this was the last movie that they would produce as partners. Whatever the case, almost every aspect of this film seems insipid. The screenplay is filled with inconsistencies and absurd situations (the return of Sheriff Pepper is unforgivable). The emphasis on humor is almost to the point of slapstick. All of the characters are irritable and there is barely any regard displayed even among the regulars. Mary Goodnight, the female lead, is a childish and immature character who's role as a seasoned MI6 agent is extremely hard to believe. This is especially evident in Bond's constant and completely understandable annoyance with being in her presence. Lieutenant Hip is a moron, and several of 007's predicaments are a direct result of Hip's stupidity. The opening song by Lulu is one of the most bland and forgettable, even compared to the songs that followed in future Bond installments. To be fair, the film is not a complete failure. Francisco Scaramanga, played by the immensely talented Christopher Lee, is easily one of the best Bond villains ever. Too bad this great character and actor were wasted on such a weak movie.",The Man with the Golden Gun
261,ZBoyer2000,One of the best and most unique Bond films to date?,8,11 August 2001,"This film, ""The Man With the Golden Gun"", was one of the best, if not the best, film in the series. The action was constantly high, as Bond traveled from Beirut to London to the South China Sea and everywhere in between. The climactic battle between Scaramanga and Bond was also very suspenseful, and you'll never believe the ending. It doesn't matter if you are a Bond fan or if want to get acquainted with the movies, as this one will keep you hooked.",The Man with the Golden Gun
262,postman9889,Christopher Lee = Redeeming Factor,6,16 February 2007,"I am a huge, Insanely huge Bond fan, but this one is pretty bad. I still love it, but there are to many problems with it to say it's a great film. Ironically, Lee portrays one of the best Bond villains. There are too many plot holes and other mistakes that make no sense. For instance, Bond is captured then taken to a martial arts school. He ""fight""...and I use that loosely, especially with Moore bonds...and his Chinese contact just drives up. How did he find him? How did he time it perfect? etc etc. That is just ONE example.I own it to complete my bond collection, but it's worth at least one viewing. ""Moore"" if you are a fan.",The Man with the Golden Gun
263,breaker33,Weak Bond film,4,19 January 2009,"This was my first film that I watched in which Roger Moore portrayed James Bond. Well it starts off well as Scaramanga (Christopher Lee) kills an Italian Gangster as a training exercise. As the story progresses further, the audience discovers that both men are searching for the Solex agitator a device used for solar power. At this point the film has captured my attention. However, after that it just descends into clichéd car chases, dumb characters and illogical plot lines. Clifton James made an appearance as Sheriff Pepper and I have to say he was highly detrimental to the film. His character came off as a bad parody of a Southerner as well as being a racist. Britt Ekland plays Goodnight a fellow MI6 dispatched to accompany Bond on his journey. She comes off as an extremely dumb agent. There was one scene in the film--although this might be to move the plot forward--where her actions were totally astounding. In addition, the last 5 minutes of the film were awful as they seemed to rip off Goldfinger.I will post a few positives for the film. First the cinematography was great with excellent shots of Hong Kong and Thailand. Christopher Lee was believable as Scaramanga--Bond's nemesis. I thought the theme song arranged by John Barry and sung by Lulu was up to par with previous Bond theme songs.So a quick summary, avoid this film if you have not watched a lot of the Bond canon as there are several which are much worthier than this one.",The Man with the Golden Gun
