0,Leofwine_draca,Julia Roberts' worst,1,10 June 2018,"I should admit to harbouring a pathological hatred for America's sweetheart, Julia Roberts, and all of the rom coms that she's persevered in making over the years. MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING is one of her very worst, in which she plays a most deplorable character who thinks nothing of going for a bridegroom shortly before his wedding to somebody else. The humour is forced, the character morals completely offensive.",My Best Friend's Wedding
1,SnoopyStyle,Subversive Giggly Fun,8,5 April 2014,"Julianne Potter (Julia Roberts) is a relationship-phobic food critic. Her best friend is her ex Michael O'Neal (Dermot Mulroney). They have a pact to get married at 28 if there is no other prospects. She is about to turn 28. When he calls her, she thinks it's about their pact but it turns out that he is getting married to giddy bad-singing Kimberly Wallace (Cameron Diaz). Julianne is shocked and jealous. She starts to a scheme to separate the couple with the help of her gay editor friend George Downes (Rupert Everett).This could have been a darker subversive plot as the story follows Julianne's scheming ways. However Julia Roberts does it so adorably that it is a very light fun romp. If there is somebody more adorable, it has to be Cameron Diaz. Rupert Everett has some great joyous scenes. Dermot Mulroney is a little stiff but he fits the role. I am glad that it ends the way that it did. The songs are a hoot, and Diaz's laugh is infectious.",My Best Friend's Wedding
2,jboothmillard,My Best Friend's Wedding,7,5 June 2006,"This is the film that basically relaunched ""pretty woman"", Golden Globe nominated Julia Roberts back on the star board, and quite rightfully so. Basically she plays Julianne Potter, who once had a relationship with now best friend Michael O'Neal (Dermot Mulroney). After a phone call she probably thought it could have gone further, but then she hears that he is getting married. Now she is trying everything she can to put a stop to the wedding of Micheal and fiancée Kimberly Wallace (Cameron Diaz), and maybe get her man back. Along the way she gets help from another good friend, the great gay character played by BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Rupert Everett, George Downes. In the end though, she realises that Michael loves this woman and she allows them to marry, but she still gets a nice dance with George. Originally in the story she was meant to get her man back, but I and the test audience are glad they changed it. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music for James Newton Howard, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. Julia Roberts was number 29 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and Rupert Everett was number 39 on The 50 Greatest British Actors. Very good!",My Best Friend's Wedding
3,moonspinner55,"Overbaked scenario is too animated and frivolous, yet the performances save it...",6,15 October 2006,"A situation comedy with a serious center struggling to get out. Julia Roberts is at the top of her game here, playing a food critic who makes a snap decision to sabotage the upcoming nuptials between the male friend she harbors secret feelings for and his over-eager fiancée. Super-slick commercial package is lively and fast-paced to a fault, however the dark side of Roberts' character is never dealt with satisfactorily (and it's clear director P.J. Hogan hastens to make her likable despite her deceit). Those who normally shun ready-made Hollywood vehicles with practically no depth will still find Roberts giving a sparkling star-turn, and Rupert Everett is very suave as her gay best friend (every sitcom should have one). **1/2 from ****",My Best Friend's Wedding
4,sunwarrior13,A Refreshingly Entertaining Romcom,9,2 October 2012,"My Best Friend's Wedding is a film that stars Julia Roberts.A woman realizes that friends can be lovers, but now has to convince the friend in question in this romantic comedy.Cameron Diaz, Dermot Mulroney, Rupert Everett, and Philip Bosco co-star to play key supporting roles.It was directed by P. J. Hogan.Michael and Julianne were romantically involved in college, and after breaking up, they have managed to remain close friends. For years, they have had a pledge that if both were single when they turned 28, they would get married. Shortly before her 28th birthday, Julianne is lamenting the sad state of her love life when she gets a call from Michael, who announces that he has important news. Julianne is convinced that Michael is going to ask her to marry him, and she is crestfallen when he announces that he's engaged to Kimmy Wallace. Kimmy seems like the perfect woman for Michael because she's sweet, pretty, bright, and adores Michael, and her wealthy family is just as fond of him as she is. But now that Julianne has realized how much she loves Michael, she's not about to give him up without a fight and isn't afraid to fight dirty. Julianne's uneasy ally in the battle for Michael's affections is her friend and editor George Downes, a cheerfully out-of-the-closet homosexual who is not prepared when Julianne asks him to pose as her boyfriend.One of the best romantic comedies of the 1990's, My Best Friend's Wedding not only gave Julia Roberts a delightful vehicle for her crowd- pleasing comeback, but it further distinguished itself by avoiding the conventional plotting of the genre.Thanks to her charming performance and a subversive spin on the genre, this movie is a refreshingly entertaining.Rupert Everett scored rave reviews for his scene-stealing performance as Robert's gay friend who goes along with her scheming, and even as she makes her character's needy desperation disarmingly appealing, Roberts wisely allows Diaz to capitalize on her charming time in the spotlight. As the romantic outcome remains uncertain, the viewer is held in a state of giddy suspense, and director Hogan pulls off some hilarious scenes that could easily have fallen flat in the hands of a less talented filmmaker.Also, Hogan does manage to make his attractive leads look like complete idiots, no mean achievement in image-obsessed Hollywood.No wonder it happens to be the second most popular film of Roberts after Pretty Woman.",My Best Friend's Wedding
5,studioAT,Average Julia Roberts rom-com,2,31 August 2016,"Your enjoyment of this film rests squarely on one thing - can you ignore the fact that the main female character is actually a horrible person? Judging by the positive comments about this film and the box office takings people clearly can, and that's largely down to the performance given by Julia Roberts.Away from that though this film is only half decent. It's a bit slow and none of the characters are that endearing. Throw in some weird jokes, an odd musical sing a long and some paint by numbers supporting characters and apparently that's all you need.Julia Roberts is a shining light in another wise forgettable film.",My Best Friend's Wedding
6,preppy-3,Very good comedy drama,8,31 May 2005,"Successful food critic Julianne Potter (Julia Roberts) gets a call from old boyfriend Mike O'Neal(Dermot Mulroney) telling her he's going to get married to a beautiful girl named Kim (Cameron Diaz). He wants her to be in the wedding party. Julianne realizes she still loves Mike and decides to sabotage the wedding.The film starts off with a GREAT opening (four women lipsynching and dancing to ""Hold Him, Kiss Him, Love Him"") and just keeps getting better. Roberts gives one of her best performances; Mulroney is equally good--and drop dead handsome and Diaz does wonders with her underwritten role. The film does have its dark side but never TOO dark. Also Rupert Everett turns in a great performance as Roberts gay best friend and has some of the best lines. A particular highlight is the ""Say A Little Prayer"" number in the restaurant.This isn't perfect...it goes on a little too long; there is a real needless crude joke involving an ice sculpture and Roberts does something so incredibly stupid towards the end that I had trouble buying it. Still this is a very good movie. I give it an 8.The movie ends with Roberts dancing with Everett--originally the studio wanted that out--they didn't think an audience would be able to accept the lead actress dancing with a gay man! Turns out test audiences LOVED that ending. Times have certainly changed--it would get by without a problem today.",My Best Friend's Wedding
7,writers_reign,A Groom With A Rue,7,10 May 2012,"From what I've read here on IMDb this one split the vote straight down the middle, seems you either love it or loathe it. I found a lot to admire and little to dislike. It comes out of a long tradition that dates back to the earliest talkies; attractive, affluent people, living in luxurious apartments/houses, wearing expensive clothes, dining in expensive restaurants and generally being charming and romantic. We've been there with Cary Grant and Irene Dunne, Grant and Katherine Hepburn, Grant and Ingrid Bergman, Fred and Ginger, Claudette Colbert, Audrey Hepburn, Franchot Tone, Bill Holden, Doris Day, Rock Hudson and now the new generation, epitomized here by Julia Roberts. The story is relatively unimportant, all we ask is twelve reels of escapism, a set piece or two, a song or two, lots of laughter balanced by the odd tear, a soufflé' that segues into a lemon mousse and sends us out into the night with a smile on our face and warmth in our heart. This one delivers as well as any and better than most.",My Best Friend's Wedding
8,zardoz-13,Julia's Madcap Comedy of Errors,8,31 July 2009,"Hollywood movies have always dictated what constitutes model behavior. The Production Code of the 1930s kept husbands from sleeping in the same beds with their wives. Gangsters could live high on the hog, but they had to forfeit their lives in a blaze of gunfire at fade-out. And all movies had to feature heroines and villains. Movies still tell us how we should behave, especially if we want to be considered good. If you want to learn what constitutes appropriate social behavior in a Hollywood movie, consider the characters that receive rewards for good conduct and draw punishment for bad conduct. Lately, Hollywood's moral compass has gyrated. Nowhere has this moral compass gyrated more drastically than in the winsome Julia Roberts' comedy ""My Best Friend's Wedding,"" co-starring Dermot Mulroney and Cameron Diaz. Initially, ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" appears like just another chick flick, but ""Murial's Wedding"" director P.J. Hogan tweaks the formula for some innovative results. ""My Best Friends' Wedding"" easily qualifies as one of Julia's best roles. She plays the wicked wench who wants to steal her best friend Michael O'Neal (Dermot Mulroney of ""Young Guns"") away for the woman Kimberly Wallace (Cameron Diaz of ""The Mask"") whom he has vowed to marry.The premise in ""Waiting to Exhale"" scenarist Ronald Bass' screenplay is that Michael and Julianne (Julia Roberts of ""Mystic Pizza"") have agree to marry each other if they have not made a trip to the altar by age twenty-eight. As the deadline approaches, Michael phones up Julianne. He surprises her with the news that he is going to exchange vows with a 20-year old heiress whose father owns the Chicago White Sox baseball team. Julianne is literally floored by this revelation. She has dreamed always that Michael and she will wed. Anyway, Michael also wants to Julianne to fly to Chicago and help him get through the wedding. Afire with incendiary jealousy, Julianne wings her way off to the Windy City fully prepared to fight for the man she loves. Then she encounters Kimberly. Cameron Diaz resembles a peachy Michelle Pfeiffer. She conjures up one of the most giddy, vulnerable, fresh-faced performances in seasons. Kimberly drives like a maniac through traffic. She begs Julianne to fill in for her Maid of Honor who broke her hip while line dancing. Overwhelmed, Julianne agrees. What the filmmakers cannot salvage in this shallow script, they more than compensate for with their comedy of errors routines and plot twists. In ""My Best Friend's Wedding,"" Julia Roberts resembles poor Wily E. Coyote in the Warner Brothers' ""Road Runner"" cartoons because everything that she does to sabotage Michael and Kimberly's plans ironically strengthens their love. It's fun to see Julia play the scheming bad girl. Usually, movie stars prefer to play roles that make them look idealized. As the villainess, Julie has more to work with here than if she were the bland heroine. She is the character who goes against the grain. In Hollywood movies, you must go with the grain and embrace status quo values to emerge triumphant. I won't spill the beans about how Julianne tries to wreck the wedding because it is one of the movie's brightest scenes. Roberts delivers another attractive but sympathetic performance. Mulroney seems rather wooden as Michael, while Diaz bubbles with both energy and sincerity. Veteran character actor M. Emmet Walsh of ""Blood Simple"" sheds his slime ball movie image to impersonate a lovable old uncle type. British actor Rupert Everett provides the movie's major plot twist; he is cast as Julianne's boss George Downes. George is a gay character! Hollywood movies before ""The Bird Cage"" usually treated gay characters as lepers. Rupert Everett, however, stands out as the movie's number one scene stealer! Witty, urbane, sartorial, and charismatic, he is neither swishy nor limp-wristed. George is the kind of gay character that Hollywood doesn't classify as queer. The filmmakers emphasize this point when George is presented as the sole character with any common sense in this comedy of errors. Suddenly, gays are winning kudos for acting like heterosexuals! George's advice to Julianne never goes awry, but Julianne does nothing but make one mistake after another. Hogan never lets the frivolity frizzle. ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" doesn't waste time, and Hogan knows when to toss in some erotic humor, such as the icy statue of David gag. Upbeat musical interludes always punctuate the film at the right moments. Indeed, ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" may be the most easily sung along with movie of the year. The scene in the karaoke bar and the seafood restaurant ripple with genuinely infectious good spirit.Shallow but frothy, ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" emerges as certainly more than an average chick flick. Hollywood has experienced the kind of attitude change that makes ""Wedding"" look ahead of its time. Rarely do major Hollywood films embrace homosexuals as charitably as ""My Best Friend's Wedding."" Ultimately, ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" seems to say that it is okay to be gay, but that nobody has the right to interfere with a marriage that is made in Heaven. Moreover, as financially successful as ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" has been at the box office, could this mean that gay characters will be lining up as the new sidekicks for straight characters?",My Best Friend's Wedding
9,Calicodreamin,Neither rom nor com,5,7 September 2020,"I didn't find this particularly funny or romantic. Both female characters have no depth and are dreadful archetypes. The storyline is in poor form and doesn't lend itself to being rewatchable. Rupert Everett is the only saving grace in this, he's divine.",My Best Friend's Wedding
10,evanston_dad,Why Doesn't Julia Roberts Just Get Some Female Friends?,4,17 July 2009,"An unpleasant comedic vehicle for Julia Roberts about a woman who realizes too late that she's in love with her male best friend and decides to sabotage his engagement so she can have him for herself.Roberts is game, but the movie is pretty bad. It makes the main character so sadistically unpleasant that not only do you not root for her and her buddy (played by an unappealing Dermot Mulroney) to get together, you hope bad things happen to her to punish her for her crimes. Not a great set up for the character with whom we're forced to spend most of the movie.Cameron Diaz plays the fiancée as a perfect little blonde, and Rupert Everett plays Roberts' OTHER male best friend, this one gay, who looks bored to be in the movie.Grade: C-",My Best Friend's Wedding
11,anaconda-40658,A Wedding Worth Attending.,9,9 July 2015,"My Best Friend's Wedding (1997): Dir: P.J. Hogan / Cast: Julia Roberts, Dermot Mulroney, Cameron Diaz, Rupert Everett, Philip Bosco: Great romantic comedy about penetration. Julia Roberts and Dermot Mulroney promise to marry each other at twenty-eight if both are single by that time. When she is invited to his wedding she plans to split it up. Cameron Diaz enters as the fiancée and hooks up with Roberts hoping to enhance upon friendship. The result is heart-warming with fine comic timing by director P.J. Hogan who previously made another wedding film called Muriel's Wedding. One of Roberts's best performances as she overcomes formula elements with a great sense of integrity. Mulroney torn between two women and avoids entrapment within formula by still being genuine. Cameron Diaz enters with a blast of enthusiasm and where many such films would portray her in negative light, it is a great spin here that she is not the enemy. Her sincerity provides tension when Roberts schemes. Rupert Everett steals scenes as Roberts's gay editor who is there when needed and while he provides many great laughs, he is also in the best place during the last scenes. Philip Bosco has a small role as the wealthy father of the Diaz character whom is used unknowingly within the schemes of Roberts towards the third act. It is not about love, but about acceptance. A very funny wedding worth attending. Score: 9 / 10",My Best Friend's Wedding
12,FlashCallahan,Coffee anyone?...,2,17 February 2015,"After Michael tells his best friend, Julianne that he is getting married in four days, she goes straight to Chicago to help him 'prepare'. But she has every intention to stop the wedding and steal the groom from Kimberly. Over the next three days, she tries everything to split them up. Finally, on the day of the wedding, Julianne tells Michael she loves him and kisses him, but unbeknown to them both, Kimberley is watching them. Now Michael has to decide whom he loves most.....Romantic comedy writers in the late nineties must have been running out of ideas when they came up with this, because the film doesn't work in any way, unless your some bitter friendless misery.Which is how I'd exactly describe Roberts character in this film. It's not Roberts fault, she's perfectly fine in her role, it's just that I kept asking myself whilst watching this 'how on earth am I suppose to sympathise with such a scheming, snobby, unhappy piece of work like her?'.And the answer was, I couldn't. Julianne is a totally unlikable character, similar friends,who are just as consumerist savvy as her and give her the wrong advice.My advice to her would have been, forget the wedding, get over yourself, get new friends, and come back down to earth and live in the real world for a few days, you are not that important really......But saying that,the rest of the characters are just as plastic and as false as each other and are a million miles away from 'real' people. It seems to me that the writers believe that everyone has to be rich, live in wonderful apartments, have jobs they love, and have dinner parties every night.Well, that's not the case for 98% of the population of the planet! a little bit of reality would be nice now and again.A horrible film, full of hateful, plastic characters, horrible scenarios, and embarrassing, cringeworthy dialogue.The most anti-romantic comedy. Would make an ideal double bill with Sex and The City 2, just to tell you that rich people can be unhappy too!!!!Thanks film makers....",My Best Friend's Wedding
13,safenoe,6.3???,10,18 October 2016,"I love My Best Friend's Wedding. I don't know if IMDb gives more weight to the ""jaded/cynical/edgy"" vote because 6.3/10 (as at 19 October 2016) is hard to believe (with nearly 100,000 votes). Amazon has My Best Friend's Wedding at 4.3/5, and that's more like it at least.This was Julia Roberts's comeback movie (just like The Truman Show was Jim Carrey's comeback film) and both movies have one thing in common...an Australian Director. PJ Hogan directed My Best Friend's Wedding, and Peter Weir helmed The Truman Show.My Best Friend's Wedding doesn't have a conventional, happy Disney- type ending, it's quite a somber ending, but still uplifting and I guess realistic. All the characters hold their own. Rupert Everett (George) owns this movie and I read in his book that the original script only had a few lines for him, but his incredible and magnetic performance encouraged the production to thankfully enlarge his role.I especially like the scene where George leads a stirring rendition of I say a little prayer in a restaurant.",My Best Friend's Wedding
14,Smells_Like_Cheese,One of the better rom com's,6,11 May 2008,"I recently saw ""Made of Honor"" in the theater and everyone said that it was just a rip off of My Best Friend's Wedding, which I had never seen, never had an interest, but I figured I might as well see it. So I rented it the other day and watched it today, My Best Friend's Wedding has all the ultimate cliché's of a typical chick flick, but I think the reason I'm so gentle on this movie is because it's one of the first's to have it, so it was semi-original for the time. I mean we got the gay friend, the over perky blonde, the guy who can never take a hint, and our leading lady who is actually a horrible person, but for some odd reason we like her anyways. Julia Roberts, as horrible of a character she played, she made the movie likable and something you'd just wanna see how the story will play out until the very end.Julianne has been best friends with Michael for 9 years, they tried dating, but it never quite worked out. But they made a promise to marry each other if they never found someone else, but when Michael found someone so quickly while staying in Chicago, a perky young pretty girl named Kimmy, Julianne realizes that she does want Michael. But obviously, it's too late, so she wants to break up the wedding and win Michael to herself.My Best Friend's Wedding is actually worth the look if you're into romantic comedies. I'm not really, but this wasn't a waste of time to me, it actually had some funny moments, back when Cameron Diaz was actually cute and funny, don't know what happened to that girl, maybe she just got cocky. But her and Julia Roberts made a fun pair and made the movie work. I have to admit that the most ridicules moment but some how cheesy funny was when the group at lunch broke into the ""I'll Say a Little Pray For You"" song, it was so random and unbelievable, but I think that's what made it funny. My Best Friend's Wedding is a decent enough film for a watch, if you're into rom com's, this is one of the better one's.6/10",My Best Friend's Wedding
15,OllieSuave-007,"Not funny or very romantic, but OK overall.",6,5 March 2014,"This is a romantic comedy starring Julia Roberts as Julianne Potter, who falls in love with best friend Michael O'Neal (Dermot Mulroney) - the day he decides to marry someone else (Kimberly Wallace). Therefore, Julianne decides to sabotage the wedding.Roberts did a fine job in her role, providing us with some light comedy in an otherwise crazy movie. Cameron Diaz plays bride-to-be Kimberly Wallace, who did an unconvincing and unappealing portrayal of the character. Mulroney did an equally unappealing job portraying the groom-to-be, making you hope that Julianne (Roberts) is successful in breaking up the wedding. And, it looks as if Rupert Everett was just thrown in the film for good measure, for he wasn't too into his role. But, he did make a good consoling friend for Roberts.Overall, it's not a boring or an awful movie, but it has some flaws in the acting and character development and is not one of the better romantic comedies I've seen.Grade C",My Best Friend's Wedding
16,thesar-2,"Indeed, She's The Bad Guy",10,20 June 2011,"How true was My Best Friend's Wedding? Well, I've lived it, and yes, I was the bad guy.Sure, I didn't sabotage a wedding, nor someone's life. But, I didn't partake in a lot of the jealousy and plots she did, sadly enough. So, I'm neither proud or ashamed of what I did in my own existence, I can safely say, what she did in this fantastic movie, was true-to-life.Let's get the synopsis out of the way: non-committal Julianne (Julia Roberts) has a best (male) friend, Michael (Dermot Mulroney) she once dated and they made a pack: if neither is married by a certain age, then they will settle (is that the right word – even though they didn't state that themselves?) and marry each other. Julianne receives a call/voice mail out of the bluecoincidently enough, close to the birthday of said agefrom Michael. Immediately, she thinks it's a proposal. Close enough: he's announcing his (quick) engagement to Kim (Cameron Diaz) and he wants Julianne to be there for him.While thrust into the wedding arrangements and ""best man's role,"" she plots to apply a large wedge between the happy couple in order to get Michael all to herself, despite her own spiritual conscience and a physical one, in the form of her (other best) friend, George (Rupert Everett) and his constant pleas for her to do the right thing: be honest with him and let the happy couple marry.The movie is both extremely humorous and deep. It's heartfelt and real, while delivering fantastic one-liners with a great soundtrack. It could literally happen, and probably does – again, I'm proof.Okay, mine dealt with a best friend of mine that I was in love with for many years. Though we ""acted"" upon it multiple times – and I am surely downplaying that, my half of the relationship was built on pure love. Unfortunately, not only was the feelings not reciprocated, but I was told constantly, despite the repetitiveness of the actions, that this was anything but unemotional.I saw a lot in Julianne that I saw within myself. Hers, thankfully, ended in a weekend per the movie's timeline. Miserably, mine lasted seven years.Enough about me. Suffice to say, I KNOW WHAT SHE'S GOING THRU. And beyond that, the movie lifts me up, makes me laugh and definitely makes me cry – each and every time I see it. It's both lighthearted and deep. It has fantastic scenes individually and on a whole – such as the singing group, led by a wonderful Rupert Everett for ""I Say A Little Prayer."" It's one of my all-time favorite films and soundtracks.Ever been through this? Have you ever loved someone so much it hurt? Physically? Ever act on it, even though you know that was the wrong course?WATCH this movie. Live it. Love it. And watch one of the most realistic endings Hollywood has ever produced. It may not be the finale you were looking for, but it's the most honest.",My Best Friend's Wedding
17,theowinthrop,Charming comedy of belated realization of love,10,8 July 2007,"Julia Roberts is Julianne Potter, the food critic for a magazine edited by her closest friend (in New York City) George Downes (Rupert Everett). Her very closest friend, since college, is Michael O'Neal (Dermot Mulroney), a sports columnist. Julianne and Michael once were even closer as lovers, but when he proposed she said no. But it was a relationship that survived that rejection. Now she gets word that Michael needs her in Chicago. He is marrying Kimberly/Kimmie Wallace (Cameron Diaz), the daughter of a billionaire (Walter Wallace - played by Philip Bosco), and Michael needs Julianne to be there. The news of the on-coming nuptials upsets Julianne. She suddenly realizes she really does love Michael beyond the point of their close friendship. And so she goes to Chicago determined to derail the wedding, and replace Kimmie as Michael's bride.If one thinks of Julia Roberts from her performance in PRETTY WOMAN, where her poise and self-confidence did not hide a vulnerability from the criticism of others, then her performance in MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING is an eye opener. Basically, Julia's Julianne is a would-be villain. It's Cameron Diaz's Kimmie that we should be cheering on. From the real start of the film (the opening credits) we see how truly joyful she is about the entire on-coming marriage - singing about it with a chorus of her bridesmaids. But Julianne is not a mean villain - she's desperate as she realizes the blunder she committed ten years earlier in rejecting the proposal. Now she has to move heaven and earth to undo the error.We watch her try a variety of approaches at driving a wedge between the engaged couple, including trying to make Kimmie look ridiculous at a Karaoke bar (a small mistake here: the Kimmie who sang in the credits sounded quite good, while in reality Kimmie has no singing voice as shown in her trying to sing in the bar). In her desperation Julianne even drags in George from New York to be her ""fiance"" in order to try to make Mike jealous enough to dump Kimmie. This is embarrassing to George (he is a proud homosexual), and he manages to partly humiliate Julianne by playing the gooiest and most ardent of fiancés in front of the main bridal party.Still she perseveres when she realizes there is an ""achilles' heel"" to the loving couple: Mike wants to remain in his life on the road as a sports columnist, and Kimmie (who had plans for a professional career in Chicago) really wanted him to take a big job in her father's organization to remain in Chicago. Roberts uses this to make a serious dent in the relationship of the loving couple.But is this enough? As the ever wise George brings it to Julianne's attention at the end: if she is chasing Kimmie and Mike, who exactly is chasing her?MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING works quite well, particularly in the performances of the four leads, and many of the supporting cast (Bosco, M. Emmet Walsh, Rachel Griffiths and Carrie Preston - the latter two as Kimmie's two bridesmaids cousins). Of the leads, Mulroney is the quietest (effective but not given many moments to shine - look at his dance scene with Roberts on a Chicago tour boat, and his referring to another character as the mucus out of the parasites on pond scum). Roberts and Diaz play well off each other, both recognizing the rivalry that is between them but not letting it get ugly. But best is Everett, playing a man who knows how to be convincing even when he hates being convincing. It is not (as some critics claimed) his picture - he did though dominate those scenes that he cropped up in. It is only fitting that he is there at the conclusion, to help pick up the pieces for Roberts. ""Radient with charisma"", he rolls off his tongue at that point. And he is!",My Best Friend's Wedding
18,ElMaruecan82,Chic Flick!,8,22 December 2017,"In the AFI Romance's montage, the image of a smiling Julia Roberts running in the airport was inserted in the 'climactic races' part, when you know it was only to meet her friend, you have an idea of how misleading the image was (although that was quite a bump when they 'met'). That's the best thing about P.J. Hogan's ""My Best Friend's Wedding"", it toys with all the expectations and actually delivers a story where you never exactly know what will happen till the end. That it stars Julia Roberts could be seen as its best asset, but even in her finest romantic comedies, say ""Pretty Woman"" or ""Notting Hill"", let's not kid ourselves, we knew exactly how they would end. In ""My Best Friend's Wedding"", we sort of figure out that she's not going to win, but the certitude doesn't come up immediately and still, there's the whole mystery about how the revelations will all unfold and the hurts be done with each characters' arc closing in a satisfying way. This is a love triangle and a school case of intelligent screen writing. The credit goes to Ronald Bass and I'm pretty sure a few more one-liners would have sealed its chances for an Oscar nomination.Now, take the set-up, we all know it but it's a delightful one. Food critic Julianne Potter (Roberts) gets a phone call from her best friend Michael O'Neal (Dermot Mulroney). Together they forged a pact that if no one found true love at 28, they were going to marry each other, the call almost rings like a proposal, except that the proposal was done and Michael is getting married with Kimmy Wallace (Camerone Diaz) a 20-year dizzy girl from a very wealthy Chicago family. Julianne is flabbergasted, her poor Michael has obviously fallen in a trap, or is just too blind to realize he's doing the blunder of his life. Naturally, she decides to sabotage the wedding.Once the pieces of the game are placed, you've got to wonder who's got the most thankless role. Is it Julia Roberts because she's the closest to an unsung villain and there's never a moment where we empathize with her or accept any of her plans to ruin the idyll between the couple to be. Or is it Cameron Diaz whose performance as Kimmy resembles her smiling and overly naive Mary in the Farrelly Brothers' film and she looks like the eternal victim too dumb (or enamored) to realize that she just asked her worst enemy to be her maid of honor. Or is it Michael who doesn't see what's going on and has literally jeopardized his happiness without realizing it? In a lesser script, the film would have been cringe-worthy or mean-spirited.But this is a quality screenplay. As a matter of fact, none of these characters have a thankless role, Julianne is given her moments of redemption, but they're never played as ""what have I done?"" but rather ""what am I doing?"" she does question herself but it strikes that she genuinely loves Michael and she's acting out of selfishness more than meanness. I liked that she really sticks to her original plans until she realizes it's definitely over. Michael isn't just the good looking playboy playing hide-and-seek with his feelings, Mulroney plays him as a rather articulate man who's also unsure about his feelings and do have a few demons to get rid of, with both Julianne or Kimmy. In a way, even Julianne's plans allows him to settle some records.As for Kimmy, she may not be the brightest bulb but she's given her finest moment at the climactic confrontation and again, the film doesn't go for the cheap, easy and spectacular way. In another movie (Anne 'cough' Hatthaway, Kate 'cough, cough' Hudson), there would have been a big cat-fight with parts of the wedding cake being thrown at the guests, but this film plays in another league, the whole thing is dealt in an adult, and funny way that makes us reconsider our initial anticipations. That's how a film should work, surprising, heart-warming and fun. Ronald Bass' screenplay made me realize why I disliked screwball movies like ""His Girl Friday"" or ""The Philadelphia Story"", if ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" was a George Cukor's film, it would have probably ended with Julia Robert's plans working all the way.But it's played perfectly in the film, because the characters are all three-dimensional and sympathetic. But if none of them have thankless roles, the juiciest role belongs to the scene-stealing Rupert Everett who plays Robert's gay friend, George Downes, an editor who knows what to say, who handles his identity with very good charm and spirit and who's responsible for possibly the three best parts of the film. His unforgettable introduction to Kimmy with all the frenetic laughs and one hilarious slap in the butt that I suspect was unscripted, the signature scene where everyone sings ""A Little Prayer for You"" and naturally, the ending, you can't make a good romantic comedy without a nice ending. And I couldn't think of a better way to close it.Speaking of Rupert Everett, this was an Oscar nomination performance because that's exactly what supporting performances are supposed to be, they enhance the appeal of the film with a limited screen presence, it's a role that plays like a Greek chorus, a comic relief and a voice of wisdom all in once. And it's not every guy who can't take pride from stealing the thunder of Miss Julie Roberts herself...So, ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" is one of these experiences that slowly grows on you and you end up realizing twenty years after that there have been a very few romantic comedies as good or better as ""My Best Friend's Wedding"". Julia Roberts will turn 50 soon and the film reminds us what a gem for romantic comedies (or so-called chick flicks) she was.",My Best Friend's Wedding

20,inkblot11,"Wonderfully funny romantic comedy, but, it also has some very poignant moments, resulting in tears for most viewers",8,18 August 2009,"Julianne Potter (Julia Roberts) is a well-known restaurant critic, living in the Manhattan area. She still has not found Mr. Right but, she may have a ""back-up"" plan. Long ago, a close friend, Michael (Dermot Mulroney) and she agreed that if neither of them were married by age 28, they would walk down the aisle together. She confides all of this to work colleague, George (Rupert Evertt), who is properly skeptical. But, sometimes fate is unkind. As Julianne is telephoning Michael to ask him to honor their commitment, Michael decks her with a curveball. It seems he has recently become engaged to Chicago native, Kimberly (Cameron Diaz) and he would like Julianne's presence at the wedding in a few weeks. Thoroughly bewildered, Julianne realizes that SHE loves Michael, too, and that she will try her best to break up the happy twosome before the final vows. Flying to Chicago, she is greeted by both Michael and the lovely Kimberly, where, in short order, they ask her to be the maid of honor. Horrors! Smiling, Julianne can do nothing but accept. However, that still doesn't throw off her determination to win back Michael's affections. But, needing moral support, she asks George to come for a stay in Illinois, also, and ""pretend"" to be HER fiancé, even though he is gay. How will it all shake down? This is an absolutely winning romantic comedy, very funny and very touching. Sometimes, when one party finally realizes that friendship has turned into love, alas, it may be too late, for our beloved may now love another. The result can only be heartbreak and temporary misery, even though a friendship still exists. That is the rough plot line here, underneath a bevy of truly humorous scenes. Therefore, while viewers will laugh heartily at all the right moments, tears may fall at the end. The main cast members, Roberts, Mulroney, Diaz, and Everett, are all wonderful, as are the supporting actors and actresses. The scenes in and around Chicago are nice, the costumes are terrific and all of the other production values are quite high. As for the script and direction, they are skillfully humorous, energetic and poignant. If you are a devoted romcom fan, this one is not to be missed. It is, even after all this time, one of the best ones ever made.",My Best Friend's Wedding
21,vincentlynch-moonoi,"""Good"" film; Julia Roberts is downright mean-spirited here",7,1 June 2014,"This was a pretty good romantic comedy, though two things bothered me about it. Our heroine is Julia Roberts. Heroine??? She's actually being quite despicable in this role -- actively deceiving everyone in an attempt to steal a man who is ""her best friend"" from his fiancé, a rather sweet person, even though she had years to marry the guy! And, to a large extent, her actions are simply out of spite. I guess her turn for the better in the climax is supposed to restore her goodness to our eyes...but it didn't quite work for me. The other issue I had about the movie was that it seemed long, although it comes in at only 105 minutes...and I'm not quite sure what I would have edited out. Maybe it was just my mood that evening.Now despite my reservations, I still classify this as a pretty good film. Perhaps more because of the acting than the plot. Let's face it, Julia Roberts -- nice or not -- is pretty hard to beat. I was pleasantly surprised by Dermot Mulroney; I never paid him much attention, but he is REALLY good here! It almost seemed as he was living the part, rather than acting it. Cameron Diaz is surprisingly charming here as the fiancé; perhaps we have typecast her in other types of roles; I enjoyed her performance. And, Rupert Everett is along as the ""heroines"" best gay friend...I think he had a copyright on that kind of role. And the supporting cast does very nicely, although no one stands out (but there is an early role here as a bellboy for Paul Giamatti).Is this a great film? No. But it's good. Definitely worth a watch...at least according to its nearly $300 million box office.",My Best Friend's Wedding
22,tabuno,An Insightful Look At Romantic Relationships,9,6 September 2020,"Julia Robert stars in this unique twist on the typical romantic comedy and offers the audience a much more underlying somber and reflective look at relational conflicts and love and regret and reality. My Best Friend's Wedding incorporates the usual comedic embarrassments, but it is the edgy, almost biting, cloying element of uncertainty of how the end of the movie will turn out that becomes the star of the show. Rarely does a romantic comedy take a much more sobering look at difficulties in intimate relationships, lost loves, and regret, and somehow offer up realities that audience can truly appreciate. With both sadness and acceptance, and happy moments most of us can identify with Julia Roberts.",My Best Friend's Wedding
23,slightlymad22,One Of Roberts Best Movies,7,11 December 2014,"Whilst light on laugh out loud moments, this movie has a certain charm that makes it irresistible to dislike.The brilliant Rupert Everett completely steals this movie, and that is no small feat given the fact that the three leads (Julia Roberts, Dermot Mulroney and Cameron Diaz) are all excellent.Plot In A Paragraph: When a Julianne's (Julia Roberts) long-time friend Michael (Dermot Mulroney) says he's engaged to be married in three days to Kimmy (Cameron Diaz), she realises she loves him herself... and sets out to get him, with only days before the wedding, she finds herself as maid of honour with the bride determined to make her, her best friend. The movie does not take you down the road you think it will, veering off unexpectedly in places. You start off rooting for Julia Roberts to pull off her mission, but as she resorts to more and more underhand tactics, (the email was simply devious) you actually start to hope she fails and want Diaz to keep Mulroney and the wedding to go ahead.All the leads are superb, smiling that killer smile, Roberts has never been better, while Diaz is excellent in one of her first good roles and the handsome Mulroney makes an engaging romantic couple with both Roberts and Diaz.

With every shananagan she pulled, she dug herself into a deeper and deeper hole. Finally, her antics were found out causing bitter feelings.

I can't say it's a clever and genre defining movie but the truth is that it's very entertaining, has a funny and dynamic plot, and best of all, it tries to get out of the mold of generic romantic comedies.The plot is well known and works perfect as a bizarre love triangle. I mean bizarre because one of the three is aided by her gay best male friend.The humor is enjoyable and easy to follow and it's mixed perfectly by the bits of drama towards the ending with the wedding.Julia Roberts is sexy, and funny.

But will she change her mind?Bottom line I really liked this film. The story has been done to death before as in 2008 Patrick Dempsey starred in a film similar to it called Made Of Honor,the cast is good I was always a fan of both Julia Roberts and Cameron Diaz and as for the rest it was pretty good too.Not Oscar material here but it is an enjoyable flick.

30,dwpollar,Promising comedy turns into predictable mess...,5,27 May 2007,"1st watched 5/26/2007, 5 out of 10(Dir-P.J. Hogan): Promising comedy turns into predictable mess ½ way thru the movie. Julia Roberts as Julian stars as a woman trying to break up the wedding of her former best friend, played by Dermot Mulroney, because she's decided that she's the best person for him. She gets help, encouragement and advice from her gay friend, played excellently by Rupert Everett, providing some of the best moments in the movie. Julia is initially irresistible as always and the first half of the movie is very funny, but all of the sudden the movie turns introspective and loses it's comedic flair and Julian starts making stupid decisions where we can't really tell what's going on with her. We start questioning whether she really wants Mulroney's character or not. She plays the movie out like she does want him, but writing a fake email from his boss that would ruin his relationship and put her in jail is the last straw. It's then sent accidentally and all hell breaks loose, as far as the movie's concerned. From this point on(actually a little earlier), we don't know who to route for and we no longer care. The problem is that the movie goes on and on after this point even to the point of trying to make us all happy by providing a funny moment at the end with her gay friend. This is one of those movies where you feel manipulated as the audience has to go thru all the ridiculous scenarios to get to the ending that you've lost interest in anyway. Too bad, because the movie definitely had potential but even Julia's charm couldn't rescue this one from mediocrity.",My Best Friend's Wedding
31,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,Good romantic comedy that will touch you and make you feel warm inside,9,17 November 2005,"MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING, in my opinion, is a good romantic comedy that will touch you and make you feel warm inside. If you ask me, Julia Roberts, Dermot Mulroney, and Cameron Diaz dazzle! My favorite parts are when Julianne (Julia Roberts) chases after Michael (Dermot Mulroney) as he's chasing after Kimmy (Cameron Diaz) and when Kimmy and Julianne yell at each other in the women's restroom at Comiskey Park. One thing I hate about this movie is Cameron Diaz's singing. My friend covered his ears when she sang ""I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself."" No offense, Cameron, but you sang better in THE MASK, albeit your singing voice was dubbed. Anytime I watch this movie, when ""I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself,"" ""I Say A Little Prayer,"" or ""The Way You Look Tonight"" is performed, I always sing along. I also get this feeling that makes me feel good inside and makes me want to cry. In conclusion, there is a moral to this story, and that is, ""Never take your relationship with your boyfriend or girlfriend for granted.""",My Best Friend's Wedding
32,davispittman,One of my favorites of its genre,9,1 April 2017,"To me this romantic comedy/drama sets itself apart from most others of its kind. It's got a great script that has all the necessary aspects. It has scenes and lines that are truly funny, meaning that the comedy is actually effective. It also has moments of sentimental value, scenes where the drama factor comes into play. And I loved both kinds of scenes! Both the comedy and drama worked here. The romantic aspect works pretty well in this film too. The chemistry between Mulroney and Roberts worked and the chemistry between Mulroney and Diaz also seemed to work. This brings me to the cast and their performances. Of course Julia Roberts delivers on her lead performance as Jules, its no gamble to bet on Roberts to turn in a wonderful performance. Dermot Mulroney is pretty good also, in the beginning I wasn't quite sure whether he would fit the role well, but as the film progressed I quickly saw that yes he did fit it well. This was one of Cameron Diaz's first film roles, and I thought she did a very good job with her role as Kimberly Wallace, funny, bubbly and very likable. The acting was overall was good and they all lifted up the script to reach its full potential. The ending is one of my favorite endings to any movie, very touching and sentimental, and it's not the traditional romantic comedy movie ending, which in this movies case, is refreshing. I suggest this fun movie to anyone and everyone. 9/10.",My Best Friend's Wedding

34,triple8,Decent enough-Cameron makes the movie.,6,30 December 2004,"I think this movie is about a 6.5. Like many movies, Wedding had both positives and negatives. I liked that the main story had a bit of originality unlike a lot of romantic comedies. It was a refreshing and interesting plot. But for some reason the movie didn't really capture me until the end. I think there were a lot of moments of boredom and I liked the realistic subject matter, where two friends promise to marry, better then the actual movie, or how it was played out, itself. In spite of that, I can see where this is a movie that will definitely grow on you and I recommend a second viewing as I plan to do, have a feeling I'll like it a lot better the second time around.I didn't think Julia and Dermot's characters had ANY chemistry till the end and it seemed Julia was in almost every scene(not to take anything away from her-she did a good job with this role.) The situation-two friends promising they'll marry at a certain age-is something I dug and certain aspects were very true to life but other situations seemed hopelessly contrived and very sitcomish. I'm a bit mixed on this movie, in many ways, it's your typical romantic comedy but in a few ways it's not. I think the characters really come into their own towards the end and I'd have liked to have been as into it before that, certain scenes as mentioned were a bit contrived and dull. But how I loved Cameron in this! SPOILERS: I liked the way the movie veered off with the different type of ending and I think Julia Robert's' ""Jules"" became much more fleshed out and multi dimensional the more time went by, Ms. Roberts was very good in conveying the sadness and pain of not ending up with the man she loved. I've always liked Robert's movies, but since seeing this and 2004's Closer, I'm starting to think I've misjudged her and she has a lot more dramatic range then I initially gave her credit for. I think that this is an OK movie, but not great, had it's positives and negatives, was neither remarkable or dreadful and rates about a 6.5.",My Best Friend's Wedding
35,Spleen,The last wedding was better,6,14 December 2001,"Spoilers follow ... and actually, what happens at the end isn't all THAT obvious, so you might want to heed my warning.The premise: Julia Roberts is in love with Dermot Mulroney, who is about to marry Cameron Diaz, so she (Roberts) rushes off to disrupt the wedding by means fair or foul.  There are two complete mysteries here.  One is Julia Roberts's interest in Mulroney.  Her other friend (Rupert Everett) manages to be far more interesting, not that this is hard - so surely she realises she can do better?  Perhaps women see these things differently.  At any rate, I'm far more profoundly puzzled by the second mystery: how could Dermot Mulroney possibly even THINK of marrying the milk-and-water Cameron Diaz when Julia Roberts is an option?  This is a film where A lusts after B and B lusts after C, when you'd expect it to be the other way around.Everyone makes the wrong choice at the end, including the director. Clearly, we're meant to be wallow in Julia Roberts's tasteless amorality, such as it is, as she plans to split up a couple she doesn't want to see together - so we might as well wallow properly, by watching her succeed. Why not?  There's no particular need for Roberts and her old flame to get married afterwards.  We'd be happy enough, probably more happy, to watch her fail to get what she wants, so long as she achieves what she sets out to achieve.  -I'm not saying this is the ONLY kind of ending I'd accept.  The main problem with the actual ending is its sheer arbitrariness.  The film reminds me of the mental processes of a poor chess player (like myself) who considers all the possibilities and then plumps for whichever one he happened to think of last.The really sad thing about this film is that its director is P.J. Hogan. Hogan's previous film had been ""Muriel's Wedding"", one of the best Australian pictures of the past decade (and in my opinion, of all time). Then he went to Hollywood and made this ill-conceived thing, in a pedestrian, unremarkable fashion.  And he hasn't made anything since. (Note: I've just checked up on this.  He has another film coming out in 2002 - and anyway, it's not as if he's an old man, so perhaps no harm done.)",My Best Friend's Wedding

She also has a boyfriend and I'm alone and yes, I do compare all girls to her. But that is as far as the similarities between the movie and my life go. No way that I would ever try to get between her and her boyfriend and certainly not when they decide to get married. Still, I loved the story and the idea behind it, but I can't say the same about the whole movie. There were so many things that ruined it for me. For instance: what was all that singing about? Is it really necessary to hear Cameron Diaz singing out of tone for more than two minutes? Do I really want to see the whole family singing a song about love, in the middle of a restaurant? There is only one answer to these questions: the fast forward-button. The same for Cameron Diaz' character. Damn, I start running, kicking and screaming for help if I ever meet a girl like that. I really don't see what is so great about an overactive, lunatic 20-year old with too much money to spend. Even though there were many things that I hated, I can't say the same about the plot. I admit that I didn't expect to see what I saw. Congratulations to the makers that they made the movie end in this way. If all the scenes that annoyed me would have been cut out, I would have loved this movie, although I don't know if much would have been left of it. Now it crossed the line too many times, annoying me just a little too often.

And by pining I mean trying to destroy their wedding. All the actors are in top form here Julia Roberts is so great in against type form and Cameron Diaz is fantastically charming but it's Rupert Everett as Roberts's gay best friend who steals the show.

39,blott2319-1,Forever and ever this movie will stay in my heart,9,13 October 2020,"There's so much that is smart, different, and genre-defying in My Best Friend's Wedding. It's definitely structured like a romantic comedy, but things don't fall into place as easily for our protagonist here. In fact, *spoilers* she's actually the only villain in the film. She is the one who is trying to ruin things and the comedy comes from the fact that we watch as all her lies and deceit come back to bite her. The plots she concocts are insane and sometimes on the borderline of illegal, but all in the name of love. The irony is that this movie takes some of the crazy stalker behavior that could be treated as romantic in a different rom-com and shows how damaging they would be in reality (particularly if the feelings were unrequited.) I think that's why I enjoy this movie so much, while I hate other films where a protagonist has to suffer. In this case, it is her own fault she winds up being embarrassed and humiliated, so I can accept that she deserves it.Across the board this cast is marvelous. The fact that they cast Julia Roberts as the protagonist is perfect, because she is well-known as a romantic lead, and we naturally assume she is meant to end up with the guy. I like that Cameron Diaz is playing a girl who is extremely likable, and one who acts a bit ditzy, but as the movie progresses we find that she isn't a complete push-over. Dermot Mulroney does a great job as a guy who is dealing with some complex thoughts and conflicted emotions. Figuring out what your heart wants is a challenge, particularly when more than one person you love is around, and I feel he shows this in his performance. The true shame of My Best Friend's Wedding is that Rupert Everett is not in it more often. He is out of the picture many times, and I always wish he was present, because he is absolutely hilarious. His comedic contributions are stellar, and even in a few remote phone calls he made me chuckle.The other thing that I adore about My Best Friend's Wedding are the musical numbers. I love that they come about in a way that makes sense organically for the story, and yet when they get going the songs often become stylized and feel like they are straight out of a traditional musical. It's toe-tapping fun, and since they are all covers of existing songs, the tunes are solid (and it makes sense that the characters would know them.) The film is a great mix of comedy with some more serious romantic moments. There are certainly aspects of the story in My Best Friend's Wedding that I can admit don't make a ton of logical sense, and the behavior of Julia Roberts's character borders on pure psychosis. That being said, in this kind of light and fun movie a little suspension of disbelief is allowed. Every time I watch My Best Friend's Wedding I find it strangely satisfying despite the fact that it doesn't end with the perfect conclusion you might want.",My Best Friend's Wedding
40,Mister-6,"The ""Wedding"" zingers....",10,8 May 2000,"For a while, I was getting concerned about the direction Julia Roberts' career was taking, after misfiring in such dismal duds as ""Mary Reilly"" and ""Michael Collins"" where she seemed so shell-shocked that her radiant smile was nowhere in sight.Thank God she rebounded for ""My Best Friend's Wedding"".  This film, while not perfect, is a shining example of what makes Julia so radiant and desirable in the right role.  And she sure gets it here.As Julianne Potter, Julia gives the same sweet, radiant glow she offered us in ""Pretty Woman"".  Seems she's fallen in love with her best friend for ages Michael O'Neal (Dermot Mulroney) - unfortunately, it's on the eve of his wedding to an effervescent, perky girl (Cameron Diaz) who does her darndest to make Julianne her best friend...as well as her maid-of-honor.  Of course, Julianne does what any right-thinking young lady would do: everything in her power to break up the wedding of the title.This is not as melodramatic as it sounds: this is, in fact, one of the brightest, smartest and all-around funniest comedies of the decade.  All the lead characters make the absolute most of their parts and revel in the glory of love, double-dealing and flat-out lying.  Along with being extremely romantic, this has to be the most cleverly-plotted love story ever: for every plot thought up by Julianne, there's a twist or foul-up that has everything to do with true love and/or blind devotion.There are great faces in the background, too.  Susan Sullivan, Philip Bosco, the great M. Emmet Walsh all lend able support and offer their own fine support.  But how can I mention them in the same paragraph without adding Rupert Everett into the fray?  As Julianne's gay editor/friend, he adds great color to all his scenes, especially at the dinner with the wedding party at the seafood restaurant (you've seen it, you know what I mean).I won't spoil anything by saying that true love wins out in the end; face it, would you WANT to see Julia Roberts as a BAD GUY?  Maybe you would, but not in a romantic comedy.  In fact, the main surprises lie in the twists and turns that lie throughout this film.  Every twist makes the story all the more interesting and (incidentally) funny.  Of course, the music makes the proceedings all the better (with a heavy assist from Dionne Warwick on two occasions).So to recap, what else can I say: if you love Julia Roberts, love stories, comedies and weddings, here's your movie.Ten stars and a copy of ""Dionne Warwick's Greatest Hits"" on CD for ""My Best Friend's Wedding"", where true love wins but true friendship comes in a close second.Keep up the good work, Julia.",My Best Friend's Wedding
41,Atreyu_II,Bitter and crude,6,2 October 2007,"""My Best Friend's Wedding"", really...Even though I don't dislike it, I can't say that I enjoy it either. This movie is intended to be a romantic comedy, but doesn't convince me because it fails.Yes, it has some humor and some funny moments (especially by Rupert Everett's character, George). However, the rest of this movie's humor ends up being ridiculous and somehow annoying. Besides, this movie isn't sweet or truly romantic for a love story.Also, the character played by Julia Roberts (Julianne or simply Jules) is pure evil, rude, jealous, selfish and greedy. Her intentions are dark. What she does is really mean: she tries to steal her best friend's bride to get him back, but she (Jules) never let him love her when he loved her.Some catchy songs can be listened in this movie, especially ""I Say a Little Prayer"". The marriage at the end is beautifully made and the final scene is comical. Rupert Everett is hilarious in this movie and I like very much Cameron Diaz's character (Kimmy Wallace) in this movie. She's enchanting, adorable, sweet and beautiful: the opposite of Jules.Overall, this is a bitter and crude movie. Not a keeper or a movie to watch over and over.",My Best Friend's Wedding

I must admit that it was generally enjoyable, but a few moments absolutely ruined this picture for me.  More specifically, I had a hard time liking this movie after the pitiful scene where everyone breaks out into song.  That is the best example of how this film occasionally stepped over the line and went from ""cute"" to ""dumb"".  This film definitely has some good moments, but overall, it's a little too annoying for my tastes.",My Best Friend's Wedding
44,TheOtherFool,Just your typical Roberts vehicle,4,3 April 2004,"There's something about Julia... I don't like. Although she played in some OK movies (Erin Brockovich and The Pelican Brief come to mind) her acting is just no good... That and the fact she plays in so many crappy romantic comedies AND the fact that everybody thinks she's pretty, while she clearly is not (come on, folks) just makes me dislike her. How she ever stole away an academy award that belonged to Ellen Burstyn I will never forget. It's just how I feel about Ms. Roberts.In My Best Friend's Wedding, it's no difference. The movie tries to be snappy, at times even a bit dark, but it doesn't work. The 'interesting' part of the movie apparently is that Roberts is playing the not to nice girl in this one. So what, that's how I always felt about her... The story's pretty lame and I couldn't care less for the characters involved. I'm sorry...There is a good sing-a-long somewhere near the end of the movie (I'm a sucker for those) and Everett steals the show in a funny role as Roberts' gay friend, but that's not enough to really make it work. 4/10 (and I'm being generous).",My Best Friend's Wedding
45,Isaac5855,"""What would Lucy do in this situation?""",8,20 July 2006,"Julia Roberts' considerable on screen charisma anchors MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING, a romantic comedy with a twist that may or may not have you cheering for our girl to come out on top. Roberts plays a food critic named Julianne who learns that her ex-boyfriend Michael (Dermot Mulroney) is getting married and he asks her to come to the wedding and be his ""Best Man."" Upon her arrival for the wedding festivities and meeting the bride-to-be, Kim (Cameron Diaz), Julianne decides that she wants Michael back and pulls out every dirty trick she can think of to break them up. This mission gets complicated when the fiancée asks Julianne to be her maid of honor. There are a lot of comic situations that arise from this premise, but it is a little unsettling as well because, deep down, we know that what Julianne is doing is wrong, but part of us wants her to win, whether we want to admit or not, because Roberts still manages to evoke our sympathies as Julianne especially when we learn that it is Julianne who broke off the relationship with Michael and that his new fiancée gives him everything that Julianne couldn't't...like the ability to be affectionate in public, but seeing Michael so happy ignites the Mr. Hyde in Julianne. She even asks her gay best friend, George (Rupert Everett) to pretend to be her fiancée to make Michael jealous. The scene where George tells Kim's family how he and Julianne met is hysterical. Whether or not Julianne succeeds in her mission should not be revealed here for those who haven't seen the film,but know that the film works for the most part thanks to some smart writing, a winning performance by Roberts and a scene-stealing turn by Everett as George. It's not PRETTY WOMAN, but if you accept that going in , it's a pleasant ride.",My Best Friend's Wedding

It is odd because I feel like this is one of my favorite Julia Robert's performances, but her character is so bad (in the sense that she is almost evil). I found myself wanting her not to have anything go her way at all, but I guess that was the point of the movie. Has a lovely 90's feel to it, and Rupert Everett is definitely the MVP! I need more of his character.",My Best Friend's Wedding
47,SKG-2,Funny and winning the whole way,9,25 February 1999,"Before I get to why I really liked this, I'd like to clear something up. I've read a lot on how Rupert Everett's character is single.  He is NOT. There are two voices on the answering machine that Julia Roberts screams into in that scene (the other one is named Werner), and he says when he first comes to visit that he has to get back that evening because ""we have this thing with Werner's family back in the Hamptons.""  Just wanted to clear that up.  Anyway...I thought this movie was really funny, and while it does get serious in the second half, for the most part, that serious part doesn't bog the movie down.  And when it's funny, particularly with the ""I Say a Little Prayer"" sequence, it's hysterically funny.  I also liked how, if you didn't know any better, Julianne's actions would seem, up to a point, as if a best friend would react.  Roberts was very good, Cameron Diaz as well, being the most un-self-conscious performers I've seen in a while, and Mulroney is good. But Everett steals the movie, and I'm upset he didn't get an Oscar nomination.",My Best Friend's Wedding
48,pfgpowell-1,Dishonest 'romantic' comedy without wit or romance,2,23 September 2005,"Ever since this film came out, I have been curious to see it because of the premise: the idea of a woman in love with a man intending to wreck his upcoming wedding and win him for herself was promising. What could be made of it? Furthermore, the premise is neutral: either a very good film could be made or a very bad one. Well, this isn't at all very good, and if it isn't very bad, it came damn well close. Only big bucks Hollywood production values and a couple of big name actors prevented that. This film was on TV in the UK tonight and I made a point of watching it. Almost from the start I had decided what kind of film I thought it would be, but before sitting down to write these comments, I decided to skim through a few of the other reviews. And they only confirmed my worst fears. One said if you like this sort of film, watch it. Another recommended it highly to all Julia Roberts' fans. Fair enough. But if you enjoy good, intelligent, witty, truly romantic, funny and poignant films, I recommend you give this one a miss. I don't mean to get heavy, but, oddly, anyone IN the US who is puzzled as to why many, many people OUSIDE the US should regard Yankee narcissism as increasingly insufferable should spend a little time simply analysing My Best Friend's Wedding. It seems to encapsulate what is, to us non-US people, so offensive about that, in many other ways, admirable country. Apart from the Dead Hand Of Hollywood, which feels obliged to drown in sugar and schmaltz anything and everything that moves (the potentially very witty scene of Rupert Everett singing Say A Little Prayer is killed stone dead by the film insisting in that very American way of going way over the top  quite probably the American producer's insistence overcoming the Australian director's good taste), we have a very, very curious morality. For example, this film is shot through with the idea that 'to confess it to be forgiven'. I've confessed, so I am absolved, and to hell with any consequences. This film has the good grace to make Julia Roberts character finally admit that she behaved like a semi-psychopath, but even then that confession is wrapped in pseudo-romantic humour which implies: 'Aw, shucks, well that's OK then.' Then there is that peculiarly American - and thoroughly dishonest - trait of insisting 'we're all very basic and unpretentious at heart (the comparison by Roberts between creme brulee - Kim - and jello - her) while all the time exhibiting that odd and revealing American dog-in-the-manger worship and admiration for Big Money, Wealth, Prosperity. One problem of this film is that it begins to take one particular tack, then abandons it. Kim's choice of Julianne as her maid of honour in order to keep a beady eye on a love rival was quite a promising theme. But by pay day All Is Forgiven. Oh, yeah? Aslk a few women, while they are in their cups, if it really works that way. Then there was the Greek chorus of (two sisters? Cousins?), bitchy Southern belles both. They were very promising material, but for no particular reason are redeemed in the penultimate scene when they sing The Way You Look Tonight. The final judgment of this film is: looks good - Hollywood has a buck or ten to hire extras etc. - and tastes good if you like jello and sugar, but it is far too dishonest to be in any way worthwhile.",My Best Friend's Wedding
49,roghache,Unscrupulous maid of honour produces neither comedy nor romance,3,27 May 2006,"This is a popcorn movie, a chick flick, that leaves a lot to be desired all around in the ethics department. Normally I am a huge fan of Julia Roberts but in this woeful tale, she fails to come across as her typical vulnerable and endearing self.The improbable plot revolves around a food critic, Julianne, who learns just days before the wedding that her long time best friend (and former lover), Michael, is about to be married to a lovely rich, blonde girl named Kimberly. In fact Michael invites Jules to be...no, not his best man...but the maid of honour. Jules flies from her home in New York to Chicago for the wedding, not to wish the newlyweds well, but instead to steal Michael away from Kimmy and make sure the wedding never comes off at all. She has four days in which to convince the unsuspecting groom that she herself, not Kimmy, is the bride for him.My first of many problems with this unlikely tale is that former lovers do not tend to make ideal best friends for all the reasons revealed in this movie, namely lingering passionate feelings and issues of jealousy. Furthermore, Jules's second best friend (as it were) is also a man...her editor, George, who conveniently happens to be gay. Does this girl not have any female friends at all, like most young women? Actually, George comes off as the character in the movie with probably the most integrity, which isn't saying a lot in this tale of immoral fluff. He's a true friend to Julianne, flying from afar to be with her and offer comfort. He indeed gives Jules sound advice, namely to just tell the guy she loves him, and later when it's obviously not working out, to graciously let Michael go. However, George is cast as the stereotypical homosexual friend, which has all been done to death by Hollywood. Jules pretends to be engaged to George in order to elicit jealousy from Michael (just one of her countless lies), but this fabrication doesn't seem to go anywhere. They never really officially undo the ruse. By the way, I love Dionne Warwick's singing but found the entire singalong at the rehearsal dinner just too silly.Jules is a stellar example of the old expression...With friends like her, who needs enemies? She's no friend at all to Michael (much less a BEST one), having no concern whatsoever for HIS happiness, until possibly the very end. Instead she's essentially nothing more than a jealous ex lover who lies, manipulates, and connives. Jules uses every trick in the book to split up Michael and his fiancée, including attempting to get Michael fired, allegedly at the behest of Kimmy and her dad. True, she repents of this horrendous deed, but it's hard to cheer for a ""heroine"" this unscrupulous. She doesn't get Michael in the end, nor does she deserve him. One gets the impression that this is not true love, but more a case of wanting what she cannot have. For some reason, Scarlett O'Hara came to mind while I was watching this.Michael is indeed handsome, but the description that comes to mind here is ""jerk"". Frankly, Kimmy can have him! I wouldn't want to marry a man that reminisced ad nauseum about old memories with a former girlfriend right in front of me four days before our wedding. Is he too clueless here to perceive how left out and potentially jealous Kimmy feels? I was practically waiting for him to bring up past sexual escapades with Jules and expect Kimmy to politely listen! Michael is surely one of the most insensitive grooms ever to grace the big screen. Also, he sort of leads Jules on, dancing rather romantically with her while they recall their old song. Not to mention jocular references to her about having seen her naked in the past. Not my idea of a nice platonic friendship for a man about to marry another woman.Personally, I was cheering for the loving bride to be, played to perfection by Cameron Diaz. Except that it's a little hard to buy her passive tolerance of her fiancé's rather unusual close friendship with his ex girlfriend or her colossal stupidity in not seeing through Jules's motivations from the start. Otherwise, she's definitely the sympathetic character of the piece, as when Jules sets out to humiliate her rival by insisting Kimmy sing at the karaoke bar, despite her vehement protests. Of course poor Kimmy is made to look like a female needing liberation when she announces that she's quitting college in the interests of her future husband and his career. Oh dear me no, it would never do for anyone entering a marriage to contemplate any sort of personal sacrifice! I found the whole ladies washroom scene near the end tasteless and ridiculous, when all the women are cheering on the potential verbal cat fight between Jules and Kimmy. Surely the screenwriters could have come up with better than this.Just an aside, what is the point of the pathetic ice sculpture joke other than to be crude? I normally love the romantic comedy genre, but the quality seems to be sadly deteriorating these days. This isn't the absolute worst movie I've ever seen but really, it isn't that amusing a comedy nor is it much of a romance. Hopefully Jules experiences a bit of personal growth, but that's about all that can be said for this story.",My Best Friend's Wedding

54,dy158,For the love of a best friend,7,23 February 2011,"It came to 27-year-old New York restaurant critic Julianne Potter's (Julia Roberts) attention when she was having a meal with her gay friend George Downes (Rupert Everett). Longtime friend Michael O'Neil had called her to say that he is going to get married in four days' time, to Kimberley Wallace (Cameron Diaz), who is a University of Chicago student from a wealthy family.It upsets Julianne, knowing that back in college, he and Michael had made an agreement that if they were not married by the time they reach 28, they will marry each other. But not only that, Michael had only known the 20-year-old Kimberley for a short period of time. Julianne realises that she is in love with her longtime friend and set out to prevent the wedding from taking place. While at the same time, to be Kimberley's maid of honour.It sets off a series of comical sequences like taking Kimberley and Michael to a karaoke bar after discovering that Kimberley is a terrible singer and asking the gay friend George to pretend that they are engaged, hoping to make Michael jealous of Julianne. Unfortunately the plans did not work.George then advised Julianne to do the obvious: Tell Michael up front that she is in love with him. So on the morning of the wedding, Julianne finally confessed her true feelings to her longtime friend, asked him to marry her instead, and kisses him. Kimberley unfortunately saw it all and ran off with Michael chasing her, and Julianne chases him unsuccessfully...or so she thought. She spotted Michael at the train station and finally accepted the fact that she has lost Michael to Kimberley. She went to apologise to Kimberley and explained the whole situation, including that he did not kissed her back.The wedding did took place after all, with Julianne as Kimberley's maid of honour wishing them well. And she being consoled by George as well.To have Julia Roberts playing the role of the person to steal her friend's future spouse may be just wrong given one does not associate her in that kind of role, but one probably cannot help but wonder whether she can do it in the end. Whether one was rooting for Julia Roberts in her role as Julianne or not, there is also other reasons to like this film. Like the supporting cast especially Rupert Everett as George.",My Best Friend's Wedding
55,Cedric_Catsuits,A tale about friendship,8,25 May 2006,"It'd be easy to criticize this film - for a start, Julia Roberts spends most of it mercilessly trying to destroy poor innocent little Cameron Diaz's life. However, all ends well. This is not so much about the wedding, or the romance between Diaz and Mulroney - which we basically have to take as read. It's about friendship, how it's more important than anything else, and shouldn't be tampered with.Anyway, trying to analyse this would be to spoil what is a brilliantly played, very funny, and often touching movie. The four leads are magnificent, although Roberts takes the largest chunk of on-screen time. Whether she - or her character -deserves that is not important because she does do a great job. Personally I'd like to have seen more of Diaz, and maybe more of the excellent rapport between Roberts and Everett.What the heck. It's a warm, happy, beautifully directed story that will delight all but the stoniest-hearted. This movie doesn't take itself too seriously so neither will I.

Beautiful people, lavish props, staging, extras etc., high-budget, good visuals, fresh colours, many fine details to look at. But most of all I liked the ending. I am glad that the ending, just for once, was unhappy (for the heroine). Because that is what often happens in real life, and you have to go on even when you have lost - or never won - the person that you think about as the love of your life. Movies with ""unhappy"" endings - but which still show a heroin or hero who is coping with that - give comfort and inspiration for yourself to go on, too.",My Best Friend's Wedding
57,ThomasColquith,An Average Rom Com,6,6 June 2021,"This film isn't particularly memorable or great, but it isn't bad either; it is a middle of the road romantic comedy. I remember being slightly letdown when I first saw it because I had heard it was great, but it left me feeling nothing at all really, it was just there and went thru the motions. It doesn't really evoke any deep emotions or make the viewer care about any of the characters. There is no one to root for either, as the main character is kind of the villain; this premise automatically limits the film's potential.There wasn't enough character development at the beginning. Perhaps if the film began in the past, when Julia's and Dermot's characters were dating then their love and relationship would have been something worth caring about. Likewise, the other relationships were just there, and not developed. And, there really was not any truly memorable scenes or lines, it all fell flat to me. Even the singing scenes were ok, but not great, giving this whole film the feel of a Bollywood movie.On the positive side, the cinematography and audio were good, Rupert Evertt was great in a supporting role, and the film was not offensive or explicit. And it was novel, but now also humorous, to see the early cell phones on film. For these reasons I rated this film a 6/10.",My Best Friend's Wedding
58,kyle-cruse,Decently good romantic comedy,7,21 August 2008,"One of my mother's favorite films, ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" proved to be a fairly enjoyable romantic comedy. For one thing, it does not try to stick to the usual structure a film like this would have, in which the guy and girl live happily ever after together. Instead, this film strives for a more realistic ending, which, in the end, as the audience will realize, is really the most satisfying way to wrap up the story. There are a ton of very funny moments, such as Julia Roberts chasing after her true love in a truck while he chases after Cameron Diaz. The karaoke scene and Julia Roberts and Rupert Everett pretending to be engaged are also very funny and are some of the film's most memorable scenes. For me, it was Rupert Everett who really stole the show, giving a supporting performance Julia Robert's best friend that was, in my opinion, worthy of an Oscar. Cameron Diaz, on the other hand, can be a bit too annoying at times, and her role could have been improved upon in that way. Nevertheless, the film is still full of romance, laughs, and a great selection of music (one of the main reasons why my mom loved this film).

I think this is easily one of the best comedies to come out of the 90s and I actually place it on my personal best films ever list.I can't see what people don't like about this movie.First of all, these people who question how can they like a movie where the main character is so rotten just cracks me up. First of all, it's a movie people, it's not real life. Second of all, Julia Roberts' character is not a rotten person. Her character simply gets wrapped up in the moment and loses her judgment momentarily (it's a COMEDY people!!).Near the end of the movie her best friend played by Rupert Everett even asks her if she's sure she's acting out of love or out of some desire to win. I think the movie clearly shows that Julia's character and her long time friend and one time boyfriend played by Dermot Mulroney have had a long and deep friendship and that there are certainly strong feeling between the two. The fact that they made a pact years ago that if both were unmarried by the time they turned 28 they would marry each other underscores this. The movie plays itself out that Julia's character has basically always re-assured herself that if she weren't to find some knight in shining armor she would always have her old boyfriend who she does love (just not in a romantic way anymore, though she takes the length of the movie to realize this) to marry.The movie is extremely well directed. The blocking (where the actors stand in relation to the camera) and what is shown/revealed either to the audience or to other characters is top notch.The pacing is great with hardly a slowdown in the entire movie. Those times the movie does lessen the pace for a moment are to showcase a tender moment between Julia & Dermot. A particularly bittersweet scene is when Julia & Dermot share an afternoon taking a cruise through Chicago's downtown river. They share a song, a hug and look into each other's eyes and we as the audience wait to see if they profess their true love for each other, but the moment passes as they pass under a bridge and into the shadows and we realize that moments are fleeting and love can be fickle.The music is awesome in the movie with so much of it throughout the movie that the movie almost plays like a mini musical with various songs being sung in parts by characters throughout the movie.Rupert Everett is hysterical as the gay male friend and Dermot Mulroney is totally underrated in his thankless role as the put-upon groom.Cameron Diaz gives one of her best performances as the cute as a button bride.This is an outstanding example of what a mainstream, big Hollywood studio movie can be.Buy this movie.

68,boe_dye,A reprehensible tale,1,15 November 2020,"If anything, this movie is a cautionary tale. While the acting was good enough, the movie is as watchable in 2020 as it was in 1997. The problem lies in that it's an awful tale, filled with awful people who are morally and psychologically reprehensible.Roberts character is that party girl who you would hook up with in college, but never take home to meet your mother. Mulroney (Michael) is that guy who likes the side fling, but wants the stability that comes with a loyal and loving wife, and Diaz' Kimberly is the naive college girl who gets stuck in the midst of this twisted love / not love triangle between Roberts and Mulroney's characters.The ultimate problem with the film is that the only ones who would ultimately win out in the end are not Michael and Kimmy, but instead Micheal and Jules. Kimmy would eventually go on to resent giving up her life's ambitions and dreams to follow around Michael for however long, until they ""settle down"". However Michael, being the archtype that he is, would ultimately find satisfaction in having a periodic affair with Roberts character over the course of his marriage and relationship. It's almost a stereotypical narrative that has been told countless times over in real life. Michael knows almost nothing of Kimmy other than she is young and spunky, and reminiscent of something he used to want and perhaps be. Yet as Kimmy says to Jules: ""He puts you on a pedestal, but he puts me in his arms"". This is incredibly telling into the nature and psyche of Michael, who is ultimately an ego-maniac for pitting two woman at each other in order to figure out who actually loves him the most: the one who would go to great lengths to have him, or the the one who would forgive all of his sins and misdeeds no matter how poorly he treated her.(and would ultimately forgive his eventual mistress as well... because... well... why not she's just 'loving')In the end the only redeemable characters (I.E. the most honest) were Kimmy as the hapless, naive victim caught up in Michael and Jules' sadistic emotional game, and Rupert Everettes Gay BFF character, George.The sad part is that as far as romantic comedies go, this one is as delusional as it's real life counterparts who actually think that such a scenario would end up with a happy ending, rather than 10+ years of distrust, unhappiness, infidelity, and most likely a broken family.",My Best Friend's Wedding

70,raymond_chandler,Say a little prayer for more movies like this one.,8,31 July 2001,"Julia Roberts gets a great opportunity to showcase her talent here, and she runs with it. Some of her physical comedy bits are reminiscent of Lucille Ball. She plays a character that could come off as a real jerk, but her natural charm and self-deprecating manner are endearing. She displays real acting chops, especially in the scenes on the tourboat and in the gazebo. Cameron Diaz turns in a real star-making performance as a ditz who becomes a wildcat when threatened. Her acting in the karaoke bar is fearless and really establishes her character's personality.Rupert Everett, is, well, fantastic. He acts as Roberts' conscience, and delivers some of the funniest lines in the whole film.
This is one of the most uproariously funny mainstream Hollywood movies to come along in a long while. The script is packed with zingers, and the cast makes the most of it. At the same time, it has some genuinely poignant moments. Don't let it pass you by.",My Best Friend's Wedding
71,Rozinda,There's no accounting - why would this gorgeous woman want that immature twerp?,7,26 April 2009,"spoilers throughout........I unfortunately assumed that Julia Roberts would get her man so I was continually frustrated throughout this movie and at first very disappointed with it at the end and switched off feeling thorough cheated. But then I started to think about how lucky Julianne was to have avoided matrimony with the putative hero who is a total twerp and who in any case turned me off from the start. Pity I had expected that sugary ending or I'd have watched from the point of view of please let her get him right out of her system a.s.a.p and find someone worthy of her.The first time we meet Julianne's ""Best friend"" I thought, he doesn't measure up. He's wet and pretty silly. What does she see in him? Big disappointment if this is to be Julianne's husband eventually. How could she bear it? But I would give the casting director the benefit of the doubt and assume the guy measures up somehow. Well, he doesn't! Julianne goes through interminable heartbreaking frustration as she tries by fair means and foul to prise this jerk she so likes away from his chosen woman who's the deceptively sweet daughter of a billionaire and clearly both will harass the fiancé into doing what they want - such as force him to give up his chosen job of aimless sports commentator. It's very clear the guy isn't good enough for either girl but the parents will put up with their daughter's choice and the whole family will mould him to what they want for the daughter, whether he likes it or not. No billionaire's going to be happy with this aimless jerk as a son-in-law. The rich girl talks of abandoning her college career to bum around the country with her new husband but you can see this won't satisfy her for long. Julianne's underhand idea that the fiancée's dad should offer the bum fiancé a job he can't refuse makes the jerk fly off the handle and his fiancée placates him, but later admits she intends her future husband to work in the family business and you can see she'll ensure he does. His precious freedom as a bum is in danger but he can't see he's going to end up as a cypher. With Julianne he could have had his freedom - but he can't see that and for Julianne's future happiness thank goodness he doesn't! This jerk is going to get a tough awakening. His wife isn't the sweet malleable admiring young thing he thinks she is. Have I any pity for him? No! Julianne tries everything including introducing her gay friend George (Rupert Everett) as her boyfriend, which makes the jerk jealous - he is greedy, he wants both women under his control, is flattered to have Julianne chasing after him- and eventually Julianne tells the jerk how she loves him. Even that doesn't work, he now goes running off after his fiancée. So Julianne admits defeat, confesses her deceptions and wishes them well. I really didn't expect that and ended the movie feeling very disappointed, annoyed and feeling throughly cheated. But then I thought about it. The jerk isn't in any way worthy of Julianne. What on earth did she see in him? Thank goodness he didn't want her or she'd have been stuck in a bad marriage with this jerk who'd have soon let her down one way or another. He instilled no respect or confidence whatsoever in me. Whether the actor intended this or not, I don't know, but he hd to play a despicable character in the story. Diaz is good enough as the young girl though I couldn't possibly rate her acting in this as Oscar material. The actors completely outshining all the rest are of course Roberts and Everett, they are charismatic and splendid. The likely plot of Julianne finally seeing glamorous George is her man is averted since George is gay. The story ends with George assuring Julianne she's going to be OK and they are going to have a darn' good time together.I give this move 7 stars because of Roberts and Everett and because after reflection I agreed this is a good movie and it reached the right conclusion. I still would have liked a sugary ending (sentimental, me) or at least some sign of the right guy for Julianne turning up. It's worth seeing if you are happy with being irritated and frustrated time and again at the selfish jerk's behaviour and poor Julianne's despair, but I couldn't sit through it again because of Julianne wasting her time on the jerk and the jerk's stupidity infuriates me even though he needs to be stupid to ensure Julianne is freed of her longing for him!",My Best Friend's Wedding
72,TheProteanGirl,The Point Of This Movie Was...???,5,22 January 2019,"I'm all for a romcom/chickflick that has a nice chemistry and a good enough plot line (as romcoms/chickflick's can have...). I have watched probably all of them at this point. I'm a sucker for a stupid and cheesy story sometimes, as well with a happy ending that you watch and feel good about, but this was not one of those.Firstly, it was hard to root for Julia Roberts. She comes off as a nasty, bitter and overall self-absorbed person who only cares about herself. I know it is always like this in these movies to further the plot, but if you are in this situation in real life JUST TELL THE PERSON YOU LIKE THEM ASAP. I hate that scene in the store where Dermott meats her gay friend and she is like ""I wanna tell you something"" but then says never-mind, ugh just spill it...As for the guy, he is just so weak charactered. Like he has no backbone and besides the fact he's good looking he has nothing going for him. They try helping him with a job, with other things and he just doesn't do anything. Like her gay friend is the ONLY one with common sense who listens to her whine for hours and tried helping her. To me he seemed more a best friend than Mulroney's character who seemed a half-ass friend at best...My biggest problem with the movie though is the ending. I know some people will laugh and say it's cheesy to say this, but when they didn't end up together in the end I was like what? Isn't that the whole point of this movie? Who cares about Cameron Diaz I wanted the 2 of them, Julia Roberts and Malroney Dermott, to end up together. I mean you spent an hour showing us clips of them talking, her trying to get him, him looking at her with puppy-dog eyes all that to say they DON'T end up together??? What why?? Just for that it was a waste of my time watching this, and it pissed me off that they didn't just make it consistently what it was since the beginning of the movie, which is a chickflick to just feel warm about, see them together and thats that!",My Best Friend's Wedding

Yes, I guess it sends a message that you can't Always get what you want, but still Kimmy was a 20 year old spoiled rich college drop out that Michael had only known for about two seconds.

Mounds have been written about it, but let me add my voice to the maelstrom: what's up with a heroine who is a scheming, lying, conniving witch? And the ingenue-du-moment, Cameron Diaz, thankfully saves the day somewhat by being cute and perky as only she can. In fact, she even makes karaoke look good. But then she rises to the occasion by showing herself to also be a witch behind that kind exterior. YUCK. I hated the whole premise of this crap. I hated the oh-so-charming gay friend who is the only one with a clue (although Rupert Everett is fun to watch, and provided the only truly enjoyable moment in the singalong).

Julia plots to do every dirty little trick in the book to sabotage this relationship and win the heart of the man she loves.Julia Roberts is beautiful and funny (with an evil twist) in this warm comedy. There are some cringe worthy moments in this movie but overall I love it and Julia is perfect in this part. It has heart warming moments and Rupert Everett is great as her Gay friend. it's funny and would relate to anyone who knows what it's like to have a best friend of the opposite sex. I just don't understand why viewers ratings are so bad when this is a fun comedy with some scenes that will bring a tear to the eye.

81,qrt7,Better than I was expecting!,8,25 June 2001,"So much better in fact, that I was compelled to laugh and enjoy a romantic comedy.  Now for a male, that's quite something.Opinion seems to be divided, but the haters of this film seem to have half-a-dozen main gripes:1)	That Julia Roberts doesn't know whether to do comedy or melodrama.  Well, I think she needs to do both.  She's not a particularly nice character remember - quite a selfish b*tch.2)	But I want Julia to be lovely and the other one to be horrid!  Oh, and fall into the biggest cliché ever?  Get a life!  Can't you handle unconventional characterization?  That's why Jules grows up during the course of the film - normally she's a hard-nose but really can't sustain it against someone who is so nice and emotionally vulnerable!3)	The portrayal of Kimberly is sexist.  Yes, but she has squillions of dollars, so does it really matter so much?  If I had a squillion dollars, I would probably do the same!  She doesn't need to work and she knows it.4)	Dermott Mulroney was a plank.  I agree.5)	I couldn't spot the plot coming.  Well go watch a Disney movie fool!6)	 I didn't like the ending.  So?  Do you think real life always has a sugary ending?  The ending itself is reflective of the whole film.  I mean did she actually deserve to have a man?  No!  Cos she has to go through the film to grow up.  That's the point.  She's now a more mature person who will get her reward in good time.  That's the happy ending.  She's become nice and considerate.So as you can guess, I found the film bright and smart, not too mired in the woman-only scmaltz that surrounds these types of film and in fact subtly exhibited a darker side to the lead heroine that you wouldn't normally be allowed to see.Rupert Everett puts in a good performance, but the 'gay friend' thing is becoming as stereotyped as the 'high-fiving cra-zeee black man'.I would recommend this for men.  It's pretty watchable without falling into puke-inducing cliché to often.  And remember, take it at face value - 'it's just entertainment!'8.5/10.",My Best Friend's Wedding

One day Jules gets a call from Mike to say that he is getting married in four days and inviting her to the wedding.  At this point Jules realises just how much she really loves Mike and determines to split-up Mike and Kim. The film follows her efforts to do this. However, at every turn she is thwarted by the happy couple who get back together. The film did not end as I had anticipated which was good.

The addition of some photogenic and congenial characters like Robers, Everet and Diaz completes the winning formula.  I do agree with many of the other posts I read, Julia Roberts character is malicious, yet still oddly likeable. 
I am surprised that Rupert Everett did not receive an Academy nomination for Best Supporting Actor.

She proceeded to film several flops and I figured we would never see her in another good film.I guess I enjoyed My Best Friend's Wedding because of the feelings it evoked in me.  Watch the scene on the boat where Julia has to decide if she should say ""I love you"" right then & there...it made me remember a time when I really loved someone and never told him.  I found myself tearing up.  The raw emotion in Roberts' eyes during this scene was just so touching.Roberts' battled emotions throughout the film, torn between her affection for Mike (Dermot Mulroney) and her growing affection for his new fiance, Kimmy (Cameron Diaz).  I felt Roberts greatly overacted in her confrontation with Diaz, but Diaz was so believable that I soon forgot Roberts' being over the top.  Diaz was a gem and held her own with Roberts, often stealing scenes.  Perhaps Roberts knew this and might be the reason why she overdid it in this particular scene.To me, the most hilarious scenes were when Roberts became angry, especially when she telephoned George (Rupert Everett)--I laughed out loud.  Where on earth has Everett been hiding?  He is a joy to watch and his scene at the wedding rehearsal showed his gift for screwball comedy.  His reactions, to the chaos around him, are truly priceless.My husband did not enjoy this movie as much as I did, so I guess I give this a thumbs up to women viewers.",My Best Friend's Wedding

I guessed it touched a lot of people with it's memories of lost love, doing dumb things in the name of love, and missed opportunities. Cameron Diaz who has turned into an excellent actress does a decent job with a one dimensional role. Mr. Mulroney could have been one of any 50 handsome actors with a sneer.

Ant make the character likeable than who can? How could you suddenly decide that you love someone after 9 years of being friends with them? You ether know or you don't. The reason why the main character decided this is because the man she once had wrapped around her little finger wasn't at her beck and call anymore and wanted the character all to herself which is wrong. The way the main character tries to get her own way is also calculated and cruel which leaves the viewer having no sympathy for them.

If you lined up 100 good looking women and Julia was one of them you would stop looking the second you saw her. She just has that certain something that makes you want to take her home and take care of her. Enough about Julia. The movie is just plain fun. When Jules forces Kim to sing and she butchers the song but the crowd for some reason is kind to her really is cute. The acting is great and the omission of the F word but once makes this movie easy to tolerate. The actor who played Michael should play Elvis in some sort of way as his lip likes to sneak up just like the King's did. George was great and honest to Jules.

94,saraarts,Ugh,1,7 July 1999,"I'm sorry, but aside from Plan 9 from Outer Space, which had a certain innocent redemptive charm, this may be the most stupid movie I've ever seen. My boyfriend thought it was ""cute,"" but only because he loves Julia Roberts; she reminds him of someone he's still half in love with, I think. Now, while I feel this way about Rupert Everett, even his elegance and charisma cannot salve the basic flaw of this film: that the main character is absolutely despicable, and that I cannot possibly spare a flying expletive for the fate of any of the other characters.  I would have been able to just chalk all this up to yet another disappointing film viewing experience, except for the huge amount of money and talent expended in putting together this worthless stretch of plastic and the obscene commercial success it engendered.  It's a true shame; or you could just say it's truly shameful.  I understand wanting to like anything with a favorite actor involved in it.  Likewise, I understand the pressures of coming up with something new, sure-shot, and original.  Unfortunately, while this movie made a ton of money to justify its existence, a filmed revival of perhaps a Noel Coward play with the same cast and cost would have accomplished the same fiscal result with the felicitous side benefits that the end product would have been tasteful, intelligent, and genuinely witty, and that, for just a little longer, the shallow predilections of the producers and much of the American movie-going public (who just ate this up) might have remained unexposed.",My Best Friend's Wedding

It's different--with the main character being the ""bad guy"" and (spoiler) her not getting the guy--but refreshing. The casting is world-class, and the acting is wonderful. Cameron Diaz is at her best as the beautiful and hyper Kimmy, Julia Roberts is dark but great as the main character/villain, and Rupert Everett is FANTASTIC and charming as George. But my one complaint is that they made George more desirable than Michael! Throughout the movie I had no idea why Jules was crazy for this seemingly wonderful guy when the only nearly romantic part between them is when he gets the wedding ring off of her finger with saliva. But after only five minutes of watching, you'll fall in love with Rupert Everett and be sorry he's gay.

In that sense, you know a film has to be awful if you're rooting for Cameron Diaz",My Best Friend's Wedding
99,scotty12,There are much better Julia Roberts films than this,5,17 April 2001,"Unfortunately not really worth watching.  A pity, because it could have been much better, with its unusual take as a non-feelgood romantic comedy.  Any romantic comedy needs more likeable characters than are on show here though. Gay George is the only really likeable one, he does have some standout lines and situations that are funny even when recounted in other IMDB comments.  The others however - dreadful.  Jules seemed not to be sure whether to be all-out cutthroat or intrinsically nice just playing at nasty.  Dermot Mulroney's character was far too boring and chauvinistic, and not charismatic enough to have believability.  And Kimmy could have been cute and likeable, but just look at her driving!  I would like to see her get banned for life (likewise from singing).  Jules behaved badly and nearly got somebody fired from their job, but that ain't even in the same league as Kimmy!  She almost killed people on the roads and carparks of Chicago, and undoubtedly would if she were allowed to continue like that.Can't recommend this, despite Everett's best endeavours.  Julia Roberts has been so much better than this in other films (most notably Erin Brockovich).",My Best Friend's Wedding

101,rominaferraro,Awful,1,3 March 2004,"I hated it. I couldn't even focus on the plot, the characters were nauseating. Roberts' is utterly selfish, her boy friend is quite lame, and his fiancée is such a pushover that I wanted to shout at her every time I watched her. Sorry, but I cannot see the fun in an hour and a half of Julia Roberts tripping with almost any object she had near.I really hope that Hollywood will stop making movies with such awful stereotypical female characters. There are many movies with this male-driven kind of women who seem incapable of having a mind of their own. It would be great to see comedies with female characters that can be funny and smart at the same time.",My Best Friend's Wedding
102,John-76,When I first heard that Julia Roberts was playing...,8,14 September 1998,"When I first heard that Julia Roberts was playing a character that had to fight for the affections of a man, I had my doubts that it would work, after all this is ""Pretty Woman"" we're talking about.  Well not only does Julia pull it off, but you will actually feel pity for her. In a nutshell,  Julianne,  played by Julia Roberts, is best friends with Michael, played by Dermot Mulroney. When Michael decides to get married to Kimmy, played by Cameron Diaz, Julianne realizes she loves him and decides to try and break them up.Julia Roberts has never been better. Her combination of brashness and vulnerability makes the character and the comedy work. Cameron Diaz's character, Kimmy, reminding me of my girlfriend Tami, comes across as unconditionally in love with Michael. Unlike Julianne, Kimmy is not afraid to show her affections in public. Diaz plays the role with earnestness and purity. Julianne has her work cut out in trying to break this gal's hold on Michael. I was very pleased that director P. J. Hogan didn't go for the typical ""Hollywood"" ending. Since I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone, I'll just say it gave a ""good romantic comedy"" the emotional depth to make it a ""very good movie"". RATING: ***",My Best Friend's Wedding
103,YFL,"Some great moments, thanks to Everett",7,17 July 1999,"The story itself is interesting enough, but if not for the characters' variety of personalities, the story wouldn't have moved on smoothly. In general, the cast is fine. Julia Roberts as Juls manages to elicit sympathy even when she's devious, Cameron Diaz is vulnerably adorable as Kimmy, it's impossible to not like her. In the leading men section, though, the contrast is ... ! Dermot Mulroney isn't the least appealing in his role as Michael ... how could he manage to have two girls crazy over him?? In all his scenes, his execution is just dull ... worse yet, there are scenes where he and Juls connect which could've been great, unfortunately he just doesn't have what it takes.Thankfully, the film redeems itself tremendously in the form of Rupert Everett as George. It does helps that he has some of the best scenes and lines, and his finesse and charisma makes it work so well - almost too well. He steals every scene he's in with ease, and created some great moments ... most notably the infectious dining scene where he leads the whole restaurant into a catchy song, and then near the end where he has his little talk with Juls and leads her out to the dance floor.Of course, films need good scripts, and this is quite a good one. It's probably not a classic, but it still carries off everything with self-assuredness. And the ending is beautiful, with a magical touch which shows the best of friendships in a dimension which, though undeniably platonic, somehow manages to feel romantic.",My Best Friend's Wedding

I absolutely disliked it. The plot was boring, silly and inconsistent. Not even Rupert Everett could save this awful film. Definitely, Hollywood did no good to P.J. Hogan's work.

Starting with the opening number, it's a pile of crud. None of the characters (except for Rupert Everett's and Philip Bosco's) have any depth or redeeming qualities. Dermot Mulroney's character expects his fiancee, who's nearly a decade younger than he is, to give up her entire life for him (and she DOES!!!!!!!). As for the main character? Well. It's a miracle she has ANY friends at all.
Skip this one. Watch Rupert Everett in ""An Ideal Husband"", instead.",My Best Friend's Wedding

That's what made this movie extra special. Cameron Diaz was really cute on how she acted towards Dermont Muroney. Julia made this movie happen. This and Pretty Woman were one of her best work. I love this movie so much and I always will. I remember i was five when this movie came out and my mom really wanted to see it when I wanted to see Hercules. LOL!!!!!! But I got older and understood the jokes more and fell so in love with it because of how much Jules loved Michael and she always did but never wanted to see the truth. So basically she goes out of her way to win him again. She trys so hard to sabotage the wedding. That when Kim found out it was heartbreak.

112,reelcouples,Jules Potter is way too selfish to be in a relationship with anyone.,5,18 March 2011,"This was one movie ending that we thoroughly agreed with - and not because the couple got together, but because they didn't. Jules Potter is way too selfish to be in a relationship with anyone.Jules and Michael have been friends since college, and one year they made a pact that if neither of them were married by the time they were 28 (really? Did they go to school in Utah?) they would marry each other. When Michael calls on the eve (eve eve) of Jules' birthday she assumes it's to call in his marker. When she finds out that he is instead calling to announce that he's engaged to someone else, Jules suddenly decides that he's the one for her, and spends the next three days doing everything in her power to break up the clearly happy couple.Talk about wanting what you can't have. Jules doesn't want to win Michael over; she just wants to win. Is this really how you treat your best friend? Clearly not, as Jules doesn't win the guy in the end after all. Three days of sabotage - flirting, prancing about in her underwear, trying to provoke Michael's jealousy by pretending to be engaged to her best gay friend George, attempting to humiliate Kimmy, the bride-to-be, in a karaoke bar, sending manipulative emails from Kimmy's father, and finally - confessing her newly discovered ""love"" for Michael and forcing her lips on him - are all done in vain. Just when you're wondering how much farther she'll take it, Jules finally comes to the realization that Michael's love for Kimmy cannot be swayed by her cheap antics. And in the end it's Michael and Kimmy who get married and sail off into the sunset.We shudder to think what happens when George announces he's met someone. Will she prance around him in Gucci couture? Move to Chelsea? Have a sex change operation? We think Michael, Kimmy and George need to find some new friends.www.reel-couples.com",My Best Friend's Wedding

Unlike past projects that had her as the centerpiece of semi-engrossing plots involving vaguely-sketched characters, this time we are afforded a smart, well defined story (helped along by award winning screenwriter Ronald Bass, who also worked on the Julia pic ""Sleeping With The Enemy"") and three-dimensional supporting players. One wonders how many times the Romantic Comedy format can be explored successfully. This film proves that with enough diverting plot elements, and a few laughs and songs thrown in for good measure, sometimes formula can be anything but formulaic.",My Best Friend's Wedding
114,kevinwu109,Julia Roberts at her BEST,8,22 July 2000,"This was a charmingly hilarious comedy-romance comparable to ""Shakespeare in love"" (though not quite as good in terms of dialogue and cleverness.) It was much better than Something about Mary. The plot is unique in that the writers had us sympathizing with one woman in the beginning, but by the end, we are definitely not on her side. Julia Roberts was great, and so was Rupert Everret and Cameron Diaz. Mulrooney (sp?) was a bit too dry. There were many memorable scenes, both hilarious and touching. It could have been a 9 if the ending was a bit different. The final scene should have been of the wedding car pulling out, and perhaps with a Julia Roberts narration.But nonetheless, see this movie for comedy, romance and little drama.

115,ivona021,"To get married, you must figure all of the following: ...",10,8 December 2003,"I loved this movie from the beginning to the end.The story is simple: two ex's-turned-good-friends vowed to get married to each other if everything else fails by the time they are a certain age. On Jules' birthday (Julia Roberts), what's-his-name calls (Dermot Mulroney), and leaves a message that he needs to urgently talk to her. Her heart suddenly starts beating although she almost forgot all about that deal for years, but she literally drops down when all he has to ask her was to be the maid of honor on his sudden wedding! She charges up, and with the support of her best friend George (Rupert Everett, wonderfully gay and handsome), she sets a goal to win the guy, Michael, from the bride in the last four days prior to wedding. But, the young, rich and beautiful bride Kimmy (Cameron Diaz) isn't naive - oh no! She fights back -- flatters Jules, plays up her phobias and sets her up for failure as much as Jules sets up her. She uses all the charm and all the info she got from Michael, since Michael still talked about Jules in awe and respect. They are both jealous at each other. *** MILD SPOILER *** They are both good fighters, with some evil turns. They have totally different stands. While Kimmy is ready to drop out from college and follow Michael around, Jules, an independent, strong-spirited, and responsible woman with career ridicules both Michael's job and Kimmy's apparent lack of ambition. Kimmy returns strike with promise of unconditional love, which totally overwhelms Michael. However, we know that Kimmy is smarter than that: she'll promise everything in a rather shallow way, knowing that sooner or later, her rich father will take care of both her as well as Michael's career, but that Michael's pride would most likely drive him away if she offered all that bluntly and immediately. *** TOTAL SPOILER *** Jules figures that out, and succumbs to dirty scheming in order to show Michael how it's all going to end up one day AFTER he's already married to Kimmy for some time. And that's where the movie makes it clear that she is the bad guy. When her scheming goes much worse then she ever wanted it to go (a fake e-mail is mistakenly really sent instead of kept in 'drafts' for Michael to see), she almost succeeds... But then, on the wedding day, it turns out that she can't win either... And all those things come clear to her... (With George's help, naturally)... That it was all about winning, that she just felt like she'll lose everything if she doesn't win this guy, that she was a chicken and never told him her true feelings until the last moment because she really didn't feel what she tripped she did... She can do better than this guy... She needs to really believe in a guy... And it's okay if she lets Kimmy win... But she can give them her blessing, and ... dance! *** END OF SPOILER *** The movie is totally hilarious at times, especially the karaoke scene, and when George comes to the rescue. Also pay attention to BOTH the leading ladies scheming --- the movie is made so that only Jules' are 1000% apparent... But don't oversee the rest!

On the other hand he wasn't really that likable either..
It kind of annoys me that nothing really changed throughout the movie. Her situation in the beginning is the same as in the end. He doesn't even once really doubt his feelings about his fiancé and ends up marrying her. So what really was the point of it all?I give it 7 stars because of the actors and their great performances - especially Julia Roberts. And because it was entertaining.

I saw her in Erin Brockovich, which came out after this film and for which she received an Oscar. I was unimpressed. In this film, however, she turns in a finely nuanced performance as a scheming manipulator out to break up a marriage and yet manages to make us feel sympathetic toward her. I will not reveal the end of the film but will just say that it was appropriate and well done.",My Best Friend's Wedding
123,jessx2001,Bittersweet and Touching,8,10 March 2006,"Spoilers!!!! Spoilers!!!! Spoilers!!!I feel that it's hard to judge romantic comedies. They will never win an Oscar, right? Would you consider Shakespeare in Love a romantic comedy? It won an Oscar over Saving Private Ryan and that was quite a shocker. As much as I loved Shakespeare, I felt Saving was much more deserving. However, I think that belief just goes back to my initial comment. I'm not a professional film critic so it's hard to judge romantic comedies and know how to differentiate a mediocre romantic comedy from an amazing one.That being said, this movie might have been mediocre except for the endearing performances of the leads. Julia Roberts seems to have that rare charisma and likability factor that makes you care about her especially when she's in a sweet movie such as this one. However, I feel she's upstaged by Cameron Diaz in this movie. I'm not a big Cameron fan but she is so good in this movie. She makes her Kimmie character sweet and endearing that even though you might be insanely jealous of her character's youthfulness and money, you really want her as your best friend. I love the scene in the karaoke bar. That scene is totally due to Cameron's expertise as an actress. In fact, I've noticed her facial expressions and comedic timing. I hear that is the hardest kind of acting. Forget Charlie's Angels. Watch this movie and see Cameron's talent. One of these days, she will be nominated for an Oscar and may even win one. Rupert Everett is a joy to watch. His character is funny and honest and helps ground Julianne in reality. Dermot Mulroney is a little harder to judge. One piece of information I love about his character is that he loves his job which pays very little and gets no respect. I'm a teacher so I can relate to that except hopefully, teachers do get respect.This movie came out when I was 21 years old. I'll be 30 this year and after watching it recently, there's more that I can relate to. I understand Julianne's urgency to get married and her feelings of being threatened by Kimmie who is still a college student. I feel sorry for Julianne's character because she was never ready for Michael's love and when she was, it was too late. Love and relationships are definitely about timing and even though Julianne doesn't end up with Michael, it makes her a better person and even more ready for her true love.As for Kimmie, I can relate to her because I am a total romantic. When I love someone, I love him wholeheartedly and I see so much passion in Kimmie and Michael is really lucky to have someone like who;s willing to give up so much of her life for him. She may regret it later on in her life but that we will never know. How much traveling does she intend to do with Michael? I imagine it will get old and she will want to settle down. Throughout the movie, she brings up the fact that she totally doesn't want to give up her life. At this time, she is passionately in love and that's all that matters. If we were to see their lives on down the line, it may not be as rosy. Julianne may have lost Michael, but her character is better off than Kimmie, in my opinion.In any case, this movie is about a small piece of time in these people's lives. Most of us can relate to this in one way or another and it's an enjoyable movie to watch. It definitely deserves a higher rating in the IMDb. That goes to show that perhaps we don't know how to grade romantic movies.On a more serious note, a more dramatic movie dealing with lost opportunities and also romantic in its own way is Before Sunset. Check it out if you haven't seen it. It's definitely more thoughtful and dramatic than this one. However, it's definitely more meaningful for those about 27-32 years old.My Best Friend's Wedding is entertaining and undervalued.",My Best Friend's Wedding

Roberts plays it just right to make the audience unsure if we should be pulling for her or hating her for what she's trying to do. Diaz comes across as a girl a little too flighty to completely like her, but just flighty enough that part of you adores her.Second, the silly music numbers are a riot.  I won't give anything away to those who haven't seen this yet, but the scenes in the bar and Barry the Cuda's make me smile with just a thought.Lastly, the ending left me feeling both happy and sad for Roberts.

Yet another case of Hollywood not giving a damn about characters, only about silly plot gimmicks and tired, trite heterosexual romances.Rupert Everett's acting and charm carried the film up from stupidity to moments of joy.  If you are eager to see him in another good role and don't want to wait for his upcoming roles, check out Another Country, in which he has a lot of love for Cary Elwes -- quite a good film of its sort.

It would have been like rooting for Joan Crawford in ""Queen Bee"" or Gene Tirney in ""Leave Her To Heaven"" She's a latent nasty piece of work. A woman, we're told, intelligent, successful, but her feelings are of the lowest most ignorant kind. I didn't believe it, sorry. Not believing spoiled the whole fun for me. I though the premise was tapping into the worst in us and that in a comedy is really frightening. I'm sure the director, producers etc didn't do it on purpose but they obviously didn't think the whole thing through. The success of the film is another frightening aspect. Frightening on two counts - or audiences are blind and unaffected by the potential evil here or I'm raving mad and I'm seeing things. Whatever the case, I saw it and it frightened me. Two major saving graces, maybe three. The cuteness of Cameron Diaz's performance, the beauty of Dermot Mulroney and a smashing Cary Grantish turn by Ruperet Everrett. Go at your own peril.",My Best Friend's Wedding
137,pinksimone_08,Great Movie!,10,7 January 2004,"This is one of my favorite movies. 2 of the highest paid actress are Julia Roberts and Cameron Diaz and they are both in this same film. As usual, Julia Roberts' acting was great. Cameron Diaz was charismatic. The story is funny and its something that you can relate to and learn from, like to learn how to let go of someone. This is a romantic comedy and if you are not into this kind of movies then don't watch this. I really think that this movie is great because it is realistic. Try to put yourself in Julianne Potter's shoes and see if you can handle it. I recommend this movie to Julia Roberts fans!! This is probably one of her best films!!",My Best Friend's Wedding
138,mgunning,Rupert,8,4 February 2007,"A charmer of a film. Loved it. Couldn't help but notice Rupert Everett, thinking he was a better-looking (gay) Hugh Grant. I thought he was headed for a great career as a comic foil, or the gay best friend (a la Sex and the City). What happened? He ended up sort of dropping out of sight. He'd pop up once in a while in an Oscar Wilde drawing-room comedy, but mostly he was in embarrassing turkeys like Inspector Gadget.Then there was the dreaded The Next Best Thing, in which he co-starred with Madonna. Oh dear. What's that thud? Could that be a promising career keeling over dead? It's too bad, but I can't help but feel Everett lacks something that Grant has been able to sustain for 15 years. I don't know what to call it: a sense of irony? Not taking himself too seriously? Everett just seems like a narcissist, in love with his own looks. And about his looks: he hasn't aged very well. He has that slightly pinched, Windsor look, as if he's third cousin to Charles. The aquiline nose is getting beaky, and the eyes seem to be migrating closer together. I know, I hate to be cruel, but his recent memoir reveals that he truly is a narcissist, more interested in partying than in landing decent acting jobs.",My Best Friend's Wedding

The musical piece at the restaurant was nicely done, but I refuse to believe that the lead man would pass up on a smart, pretty Julia Roberts then commit to an annoying blonde whose beauty is not even skin deep (Diaz looked fantastic in The Mask but she must have been wearing one at the time). I soldiered on thru the obvious cigarette ad in the hallway, but as the wedding approached, i honestly didn't care who did what.

Even though Julianne is the most talked about woman in Michael's life , she is not the woman he would want to get married to.
He was best friends with Julianne for 18 years and their compatibility is clearly more in all walks of life and i am sure that a marriage works better if you are compatible.

It reminded me of the last time I had a fever - I hear people speak, I see people doing things, but it just doesn't quite make sense.  Part of the problem is the acting.  Julia Roberts is a little too hysterical (not in the funny sense) while Dermot Mulroney underplays a bit too much.  Put the two of them in a scene together and it's just weird. Cameron Diaz is ok in the role of the rich but slightly dumb bride-to-be, but Rupert Everett really steals the show (although I would have thought the stereotypical gay friend role has been done to death).Harmless but unsatisfying - 4.",My Best Friend's Wedding
145,avafive,Yes Rupert !!!,8,11 May 2006,"I think I like the movie most for Rupert Everett. His walk (which he describes as panther like) was amazing. he sticks to his friend, giving the only sensible advice possible. Say a little prayer for you was amazing, his story of his engagement with Julia was so delicious.Julia's mean streak was magnificent.. also her eyes when she sees her best friend being carried away.I enjoy this movie every time, and cannot miss the Rupert parts at all !Although if you look closely, the sudden love for Dermot Mulroney is not natural. Not for a minute would a character like Julianne be happy with someone like him. She could rough it in seedy hotels, but not be tied down to someone's schedules. So you are kind of relieved that Julianne walks free in the end. And she does have this magnificent friend like Rupert who drops everything and comes to her rescue. If he hadn't been gay, he would have been besotted with her and that is the kind of a man Julianne really needsI like it that Julianne remains single in the end. That is what life is like, sometimes you have to hand over your loved ones and deal with life on its own. There is no magic guy who appears the minute you are single.",My Best Friend's Wedding

Good acting and storyline. The gentlemen in the movie are also charming and handsome. It has some heartwarming parts and other parts of suspense and comedy. A must see for the romantic at heart. I always imagine Julie Roberts as sweet and innocent and although ""adorable"" as always in this movie, she plays a somewhat jealous and sneaky ""best friend"" who tries to ruin the wedding because she hasn't ever had the courage to tell her best friend she is in love with him. Is she truly in love or is she just suffering doubts about her feelings for her long time friend? We may never know. I think she's a lucky lady either way her heart is turned because she has TWO handsome male best friends in this movie! That's another cute thing about this movie... to see two strong male roles that are not vulgar or hostile towards women but romantic and supportive. A refreshing change from some other stereotypical male roles we see a lot of these days. Cool movie.. I give it an 8/10!",My Best Friend's Wedding
147,RPI_engineer,Really disappointing - poorly-written plot and skewed acting,3,13 April 2013,"I'm horribly shocked that this film is considered a romantic comedy, let alone one with many positive reviews.Whoever wrote the script and plot for this film should be shot. Seriously, how does Roberts losing the man she love in the end make it a romantic comedy worth seeing? And while the general consensus was that she was 'evil' and 'selfish', Jules struck me as more love-silly and desperate than evil and conniving (if any staunch negativity from Roberts part was intended then it wasn't well-acted at all). Roberts' character and the opposing guy both showed flaws and imperfections, but such is often the case with troubled people trying to sort out their real feelings in order to make the best relationship decision(s). Also, up until the end her friend acted as if he was secretly in love with her as well so the ending, aside from utterly depressing, didn't really make sense (unless that was also poor acting).

Cameron Diaz was totally lovable but I totally wanted to kill her for being too perfect. The ending was appropriate what with Michael getting married to whats-her-name.

150,KathyB-2,A surprisingly amusing and interesting romcom,8,9 September 1998,"This film was a pleasant surprise for me after hearing mixed responses from friends and acquaintances.  I can see why it wouldn't appeal to some people : Julia Roberts in a romantic comedy could be pretty slushy stuff; but then again if you watch it wanting that sort of thing you're likely to be disappointed.  Yes, so it is romantic and even a bit slushy at times, but has a sharp script and fast pace which keep you amused 95% of the time.One of the things which appealed to me was the way moments of melodrama were defused into comedy - check out the two girls' confrontation with an audience of women (gathered by the call ""Catfight!"") whose oohs and aahs forestall any emotional reaction we ourselves may have to the scene.Some of the camerawork is also more interesting than one might expect, with particularly powerful close-ups where one or two faces fill the screen. Julia Roberts' beauty comes through in a long shot which starts to look like a shampoo commercial: long curly hair spills around her head as she lies in despair on the floor (the public safety message being, don't ever sit with your back against a door which an irate ex-lover might wrench open at any minute); nevertheless, the proximity gives us an intimacy with her character we might otherwise miss.Another effective shot of this kind (two heads on a pillow fill the screen) drives home the theme touched on here of the devastatingly attractive gay man who is made doubly so by his inaccessibility (as more fully explored in ""Object of my Affection"").  George (Rupert Everett) is a fantastic character whose sense of fun, wisdom, sensitivity and English accent make him every girls' ideal object for unrequited love (or maybe it's just me ).The disappointing aspect for me was the film's final affirmation of sexist values and a rather superficial and one-sided view of ""real"" love - but you 'll have to watch it to see if you agree with me on that.  Basically in my opinion, some of the ending lacked the self-awareness and sharpness of the rest of the film.  However, overall I would recommend it for an amusing and sometimes clever 90 minutes of celluloid.",My Best Friend's Wedding

In contrast, ""leading man"" Dermot Mulroney appears crass, callow, and utterly devoid of charm or magnetism.

157,rebekahscheys,Julianne discovers that she is in love with her best friend on the day he tells her that he is engaged to marry someone else.,9,29 January 2013,"Although it is perhaps most well-known for its unconventional ending, My Best Friend's Wedding should be known, for its perfect blend of romance and comedy, as the definitive rom-com. Julianne Potter (Roberts) is a New York food critic, who, after receiving a mysterious voicemail from her former lover and long-time best friend, Michael (Dermot Mulroney), realizes her affection for him. Unfortunately for her, upon returning Michael's call, Julianne learns that the new-found man of her dreams has himself met someone and intends to marry her within four days.Unaware of Julianne's recently acquired feelings for him, Michael insists that she join the wedding party in Chicago and support him in his hour of need. After some goading from her other best friend, George (Rupert Everett), Julianne decides to go in the hope of breaking up the couple before they can say their ""I dos."" The ensuing madness is both enchanting and hilarious, as Julianne finds herself being continually and innocuously bested by Michael's fiancé, Kimmy (Cameron Diaz), resulting in a series of hilariously irate phone calls to George, who always happens to field them at the worst possible times (i.e. his entire family gets an earful from the answering machine over dinner.)Diaz and Roberts are perfect comedic matches for one another as the innocently saccharine fiancé and the plotting best friend, and Mulroney is so suave and sexy as ""the man of our dreams"" (as Roberts puts it) that it's incredible more of the film's female population aren't fighting for his affection. Everett is equally well cast in the role of George, the gay best friend who plays it straight at one point for Julianne's sake. His scenes provide some of the film's funniest moments, particularly when George teasingly embarrasses Julianne in front of the rest of the wedding party by launching into his rendition of ""I'll Say a Little Prayer (For You).""Aside from just its comedy, which is considerable, and its romance, which is unorthodox, ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" succeeds because its characters are fully-formed, dimensional beings who live in a very real world. Julianne, with all of her charm and charisma, is really just a desperate, wavering soul who fears what might happen if everyone finds happiness besides her. Kimmy, instead of being flat and static (as the ""other"" girl is wont to be in a romantic comedy), is a likable and endearing character that the audience can empathize with. Michael, however, is perhaps the most fascinating character of them all.Michael is both the perfect best friend- teasing and adoring, while never crossing the line- and the perfect boyfriend. He balances his affection for both of the women in his life and draws his own line regarding the ways in which he can love each of them. His decisions and character both break the traditional mold of a romantic comedy's ""dream guy"" by injecting a measure of reality and at the same time uphold it, by demonstrating that there is a way in which a strong, selfless, and moral man can exist without becoming a mere fantasy.",My Best Friend's Wedding
158,mah-prado,The best choice for a rainy afternoon.,7,2 November 2005,"My Best Friend's Wedding seems to be the typical feel-good movie, where you have a little drama going on, but then everything works out, people come back on getting along and life's good again, but wait until you see the credits rolling: it turns out to be a realistic movie, and not a feel-good one. But hey, that's not bad: the film shows many moments that you can relate to your own life, you watch the scenes and go, 'hey, that once happened to me!'. So it's kinda comforting to see that even those bad situations that you kept for yourself actually happen to everyone, even to Julia Roberts. The story is based on this two friends, Julianne and Michael, that kept the promise of marrying each other if they never got married until a certain age. The clock is ticking and Julianne starts to feel that she's actually marrying Michael, her secret crush, but then, big surprise: he got engaged to this blondie irritating girl. So that's pretty much her struggle, Julianne secretly trying to get her out of her way, so that she can live happily ever after with Michael. The film has great supporting actors, like Ruppert Everett, Julianne's gay friend, who is definitely a bonus. But, like I said, don't expect lollipop and rainbows at the ending. Again, relocate the story to your life and you'll figure it out: it shows how, sometimes, things don't go our way, but that might be just for the best.",My Best Friend's Wedding

Bought the laser as an ex-rental, and he been more impressed revisiting it.I'm puzzled by the criticisms here, people alternately say it's too formulaic, or not enough.  I think the ending, and having the lead do bad things, were refreshing.  Cary Grant did as many underhanded things in His Girl Friday, and that movie is widely recognized as great.  That had even more ""dark side"" and was still hilarious.

165,panzerknacker,funny romantic comedy with disturbing sexist undertones,7,2 January 2001,"This movie has quite a lot going for it: The script is nice enough, there's a lot of off-beat humour you wouldn't usually expect from a rom-com made in Hollywood and the acting is (with one exception) great: although I don't like her that much, Julia Roberts is good as the plotting best friend, Rupert Everett is simply hilarious and Cameron Diaz sparkles, as usual. In fact, she's so sweet and unvain that she steals practically every scene she's in (especially of course the karaoke-scene, which alone is worth watching this movie). However, while Dermot Mulroney may be a talented actor (I've seen him in 'Living in Oblivion', and quite liked him there), he's totally miscast as the guy both Julia and Cameron are crazy for. As one user pointed out correctly, he has about the charms of a floorboard - even jerky Ben Stiller would have been more believable in that role! However, what really spoiled some of the fun in this one was it's sexist message: Kimmy (Cameron) willingly gives up her career for her husband-to-be, as any good wife (in the fifties!) would have done - and Jules (Julia) never found love because she _didn't_ give up her career. And whenever Michael (Dermot) gets mad at her, Kimmy starts to cry and admits it's all her fault, although it isn't - come on people, don't you realise which millenium we're living in?! anyway, even though it has it's faults this is a pretty entertaining movie - watching it with your date might definitely be a good idea...",My Best Friend's Wedding

I love to read reviews, but the hate this movie receives is a little absurd. Whether you think this movie is morally inept or what have you....that's the point of it. Love makes you do crazy things, insane things, things you never thought you were capable of. She realizes what she had once it's gone. Then desperation kicks in. Of course if this is my fiancee I wouldn't be happy but it's a movie honestly and it's a tale of your best friends wedding. To say noone stays friends after theyve broken up is rather pathetic and untrue. Their are people who remain good friends or even best friends. There are times in our life when we're one way and then change into a different person. I know there are stories like this in real life, and honestly if he decided he loved her still and broke off his engagement then that's better than marrying someone and cheating on them. For christ sake people calm down. Anyways she loses, I cry everytime I watch this movie. Its fighting for something you desperately want and doing just about anything to get it and then letting go while trying to do it gracefully and maintain some dignity that you no doubt have lost because of your irrational behavior. Its realizing noone is chasing you...I'm sure most of us can relate even if we've kept those feelings inside and not tried to ruin a wedding. Lol. It's just a great movie.

I was extremely disappointed.The story was sweet and refreshing, the characters true and believable, but ultimately, I don't consider this movie to be entertaining. I'm not sure where all the great publicity started with this movie, but it apparently caught on with some and just snowballed.I consider myself to be a relatively open-minded male who can enjoy a good chick flick with her husband. Some of my faves are Much Ado About Nothing, Sense and Sensibility, Fried Green Tomatoes, Emma, Muriel's Wedding. This was nowhere near the caliber of those films.

I see divorce down the road for them when she starts to resent giving up her life for the life in one hotel room after another. Love does not conquer all. Julia Roberts' character is a little flaky, so it turned out best for her in the end. She'll always have her best friend because she didn't marry him. Put this movie in a collection for a rainy day, beach house, vacations, etc. In this collection I would have: Any Doris Day/Rock Hudson movie, Shirley Temple movies, Better Off Dead, Midnight Run, This is Spinal Tap, Best in Show, Valley Girl, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Princess Bride, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Old School and most Steve Martin movies - to name but a few.",My Best Friend's Wedding
173,Spider_Baby,A romantic movie... that's not romantic.,4,31 July 2005,"Sad. From the start, to the very last couple of words. This movie is based on a terrible mistake: it *has* to be something it just cannot be. The idea of a woman who does anything to split a perfect couple might be suitable for a noir, or even a dark comedy, but not for a plain romantic movie which this tries to be in every way. It is not a comedy of misunderstandings, not a comedy of deceits. It is just a romantic movie, and thus fails completely. A sad film, with lots of empty spaces. None of the characters is developed; even the main one, Julia Robert's, is dealt superficially, but actually it is a superficial character: she is simply insensible. I save: Rupert Everett, always stylish.",My Best Friend's Wedding
174,database-03676,Disappointing,2,27 December 2019,"I only watched this Film because of Julia Roberts. But this movie was extremely disappointing. The chracter of hers did not have one single part to sympathize with. Her attempts to ruin the Wedding were ridiculous and not even funny. Was rolling my eyes way too often. I could not understand why those two women were so obsessed with the selfish and arrogant Michael. The Story was not entertaining nor sad. Throughout the movie I was thinking what a timewaste.
Sad",My Best Friend's Wedding
175,ishararichmond,Ending was disappointing,4,27 January 2021,The disappointing ending ruined the rest of the film. Sad.,My Best Friend's Wedding
176,nadeen-37277,Spoiler ahead,6,21 June 2019,The only thing i liked about the movie is how realistic the ending was when everyone expected her to win him and that he will be still in love with her but in fact somethings cant wait for you forever if you are not brave enough to get it someone else will and when you are finally ready to fight for it it will late already,My Best Friend's Wedding
177,andrecollier,Horrible,1,10 January 2021,Story is just horrible. Cast is okay but they played in a lot of better movies.,My Best Friend's Wedding
178,jayprince-88316,The film made me angry,1,5 September 2021,"OK, I knew it wasn't going to be my kind of film but my gf wanted to watch it, I thought I could just sleep. Oh how wrong I was. Every scene I heard made me peak at the TV in disbelief that these 2 people were not regarded as villains. Just as bad is the fact they just got to continue this behaviour together. CD should have left them both after their first meeting. Their characters still make me angry, that's how bad it is, I just can't let it go.",My Best Friend's Wedding
179,coke_chick14,my best friends wedding,7,26 March 2006,movie: My best friend's wedding I started to watch this movie ... and I have got to say it was very good ... I could almost say one of my favorite movies ... I love the plot... until the end I believe that has got to be the worst ending I have ever seen ... I believe that they should remake the movie just because of the ending it was inappropriate and Julie should of gotten the guy no questions asked! I do not recommend this movie to people who want to see a movie with a good ending! the ending was despicable. I hated it and I think it should be burned ... but the beginning was good so I will give credit there! but DO NOT WATCH IT i would like to put a complete ban on this horrible movie! very disappointed Taylor,My Best Friend's Wedding
