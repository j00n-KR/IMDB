0,PetarNeo,Must see movie!,9,28 January 2019,"Juzni Vetar or South Wind is a Serbian crime movie and considering that majority of movies from this side of the Europe are comedy or satirical movies this one really lives up to it's potential.
Milos Avramovic, the director, puts up movie about dark underground inside Serbia and while watching this movie you will feel the goosebumps of gritty and dark moments that might be too much for some people.
Featuring some of the great actor talents from that part of Europe, you will appreciate everything that they are doing and how good it is done. It could be easily said that it is one of the best written movies recently published in Balkan area (Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bulgaria).
It will absolutely give you the realistic idea of how things are done here or were being done which is not a good thing but in movie such as this it works perfectly.
Milos Bikovic (Petar) is the main character in the movie and that guy proved how good he is because his performance will you stunned. There are also others that help elevate movie to another levels and one of them is Srdjan Todorovic (Jani) that gave a comedic aspect to movie that was so much needed in some moments because of how dark this movie is.
While watching this movie you will not take your eyes of it and if you like action with violence that is really shown on screen you will love this one because there is plenty for you.
It was a dark, gritty, bloody and violently spectacular.
3.5/4",South Wind
1,alexscg,"Rough, action packed",7,12 January 2021,"This is about ""rough guys"" in Belgrade. The main actor, Milos Bikovic, has proven to be a great charmer in ""Hotel Belgrade"", and is here performing a tough guy - a totally different role. The movie did not have the budget that American action films have, and yet it was surprisingly good. So, it will definitely not be a waste of time if you like these kinds of movies.",South Wind
2,aleksagrobar,Really great!,10,12 August 2019,"Serbia always had a good filmography!
Movie with actors who are surely Hollywood level (Nebojsa Glogovac r.i.p. ! ).
Great!",South Wind
3,CyrusXxXxX,Surprised in a good way,10,25 November 2018,Movies from Serbia always had been weird. But this movie gave me hope that our cinematography is going in right direction again.,South Wind
4,ITrifonov,Okish,5,9 February 2019,"It is a decent movie, but the high rating does not give it justice, as there are many better movies on IMDB with a lesser rating.
A normal crime story, but it has a few holes in the plot and behavior of the characters. It is ok, but you will forget it in a flash, so do not expect something exceptional.",South Wind
5,lpirc,Story hole,5,30 March 2020,"So here's my question... Maras gets in to a Police chief car like a James Bond with a desperate attempt to get his girl out of jail? And then he settles for a deal that he will go to jain anyway (not even using his leverage of knowing that police is dirty)? Then he single handedly kill 5 gangsters and goes into prison, while Car gets a reward for not doing anything, and becomes a new conection with Bulgarians.
Wouldn't it be better if Car would be the one who would convince Maras to take this deal?",South Wind
6,playstrong,Overhyped and biased,5,23 January 2019,"Long time there was no good action movie on the South-East Europe, then this movie showed up from the middle of nowhere. Nothing special, average acting, ""slim"" scenario, predictable story and too short movie for its topic.",South Wind
7,Pancevac,Ok movie,7,4 November 2018,"Movie is ok, but i wouldn't really call it great as most people do. Story is very predictable and some moments feel just forced. But putting that aside, movie has lots of funny moments.As Serbian movies go, this is definitely not best Serbian movie, you really can't compare this to movies like ""Undergound"".",South Wind
8,smilesandmusic,okay,7,7 May 2020,"The message is very powerful. It is quite realistic, but there are also situations that are definitely far-fetched.",South Wind
9,srkitodor1996,Best Serbian movie in quite a long time!,10,8 November 2018,"I heard a lot of positive things about this movie from my friends and I decided to go and watch it in the movie theater. It paid off magnificently! The movie has a catching story and every second of it is filled with drama and tension. The actors did their job brilliantly and I must say that I was really impressed.
Already, 300.000 people have gone to theaters to watch this movie. I recommend you to do this as well, you won't regret it at all.",South Wind
10,freemila,Good movie,8,17 January 2019,"Serbian cinema has improved significantly. This one has all elements of crime/ drama genre that you will enjoy immensely....Very good acting, good story line and good execution. Worth of 2+ hours of your time.",South Wind
11,pjovanovic5,"Not bad, but also not that good",6,28 November 2018,"This is another plain crime-action film, which you will forget as soon the atrocious soundtrack get out of your ears. It brings something fresh to the Serbian cinema, witch is one of the reason it is over-rated among serbian viewership.
Acting was good, considering generic scenario, although I feel that a lead actor was a miscast.",South Wind
12,comi_of_visnjica,Wasted time,7,25 December 2018,"Acting terrible. Casting terrible. Only good thing in movie are acts from Glogovac, Diklic and Todorovic. Story is funny as if some small child wrote it. In general worst movie i watched this year, thank god i didnt go to cinema.",South Wind
13,MachinaEx,"A great Balkan film, both a mediocre movie by global standard",6,11 September 2021,"Juzni Vetar (South Wind) is a Serbian crime thriller which shows the gritty criminal underworld of Belgrade and a culture that promotes this style of life. The movie by Balkan standard is as close to the western style film that I have yet seen. The main characters are good, both their past and motivation are underdeveloped and are lacking a time frame in which the era that the film portrays are set. The story is a classic tale of anti-hero vs the bad drug dealer who is masquerading as typical upper class Belgrade citizen, both when the night falls and behind the curtains he is rotten to the core! Many stereotypes are also shown (some with taste, other with not) about the Serbian culture and it's temperament, both in the end it's a spicy mix mixed with sweet taste which just doesn't cut it. To end this review all I can say is that this movie is primarily made for the Balkan audience who are going to understand it more deeply than the average viewer from the West or East.",South Wind
14,kure_su,Great movie from Serbia,9,4 January 2020,Very good action movie from Serbia. Great actors involved and good scenario is synonym for success. Can't wait to watch second part.,South Wind
15,milospanta-20346,A long-awaited breath of fresh air for Serbian cinematography,9,27 November 2018,"9/10""Juzni Vetar"" is a long-awaited breath of fresh air for Serbian cinematography perfectly combines legendary actors, such as late Nebojsa Glogovac (this movie was his last, unfortunately), with the youth (Milos Bikovic, Miodrag Radonjic, etc.), and it all works great.
Fast-paced action packed to the brim with fast, good cars and interesting characters. The story is good, although I would suspect that only people living in Serbia (or Balkan, for that matter) will be able to fully understand it. Without any desire to spoil it, I will just say this: buy a ticket and watch it.",South Wind
16,thesale-25868,Zero originality,1,15 November 2018,"The movie is simply a copy, paste of western crime/thriller movies. It didn't bring one new thing to the genre, except the awful modern mainstream Serbian music. It is naive, predictable, badly acted, etc.(all bad things).Only good thing about it is the camera work. I can't believe that some great Serbian actors like Dragan Bjelogrlic and others, agreed to be in this thing. Also these 10/10 reviews mostly come from Serbs that always have to love Serbian movies, they do not question them, think when they're watching. They are perfection to them, just because the movie is from our country. Yes I'm a Serb who found this movie to be grotesque and cringe. It mainly copied the story elements from drive (2011) and pusher (1996) and transporter (2002) and who knows how many more...",South Wind
17,stefanjankovicvagus,Not so bad but not so good either,1,21 November 2018,"The story is lame ,and even its a refreshing for watching a serbian ,,close to action movie''its not so great as people say.Its just so hyped but its watchable .the characters are arrogant cursing and angry ,the plot is fast but the main thing about movie ,the story, its nothing special, the rating is high but not represents the true quality of this movie.This is just my opinion and many people enjoyed watching .From me just 4/10.PS bulgarian song from the begining is nice and even it was released in 1998 . it got more popularity in Serbia after this movie,even it is 20 years old song.",South Wind
18,kingandja,Good,10,28 January 2021,It keeps atention from the begining. And actors are hot ;),South Wind
19,dinkopepe,Male movie for teens and guys who are never going to grow up,4,26 January 2019,"This movie is just a bad copy of excellent movies like Pulp Fiction, Rane and Munje. The plot is very badly written and there are many holes and illogicalities, like in the daily shooting scene. Serbian movies usually have bad female characters, but here we go further: there are just two types of women - pretty young girls ready to give everything for money and older housewife's who knows to cook. On the other side every single male character is funny, even in death situations. That's why I found it very inconclusive.What is the messagge of of this movie? Get rich or die tryin? Come on, guys, this is a movie for teens, but there's a little problem - it's definitely not recommended for their age.",South Wind
20,ogorcenaana,AMAIZING,10,2 January 2019,"If you want to see how things on balkan really work, watch this movie! It is full of action and it never gets boring, congrats to serbian production, awsome!!!Love from Croatia",South Wind
21,mikicvetko,One of the greatest Serbian movies.,9,25 August 2018,"Not gonna spoil it, i will just say this:
As soon as it hits theaters go and watch it, especially if you're a petrolhead. The flick has tons of cars & car chases. Defenetly worth the time, it's a great blend of comedy, romance and action. A dark, gritty crime flick that shows how corrupted our society is.",South Wind
22,micikat,I dont know,7,3 November 2018,There are great moments and there are some stupid moments.,South Wind
23,grujabratt,A solid copy of The Wounds,7,4 November 2018,"A film about a man in early twenties, being a criminal. Does this sound familiar, even a bit? Yes. I think this film is greatly inspired by the film ""The Wounds"" (Rane, the best Serbian movie ever). If comparing it directly to Rane, than it's a completely average movie. But, if you don't, then it is a great movie.",South Wind
24,igorlosic,Average B movie with Plenty of Cliches,5,28 November 2018,"A thriller about tough guys, criminals and corrupt cops in Belgrade, with some car chases and shoot-outs, the film is not bad technically, but is full of cliches and a lazy plot. The main guy, Maras, and his gang steal expensive cars with foreign license plates. The plot starts when Maras unknowingly steals a car packed with drugs that were supposed to be delivered to the main kingpin of Belgrade. Problem is, Maras steals the car from a Bulgarian thug, who is supposed to deliver the dope, while the thug is making out with a busty ""sponsored girl"" (a Belgrade term for silicone-enhanced chicks who hang with thugs), standing in front of a kiosk on a street in broad daylight, his car keys and wallet just lying there on the kiosk shelf. Maras takes the keys and takes the car, the thug notices only then and shouts distressed while Maras drives away. Now, if you're a bad*ss gangsta driving kilos of cocaine from Bulgaria to Belgrade and you're THAT clueless... I mean, really?Now everyone is Iooking for Maras and the car with the dope. There are some brutal interrogations, chases, killings, etc. which keep the film moving. However, next problem is that all the characters are also total cliches - Maras's alcoholic dad, who can only shout, the sadistic kingpin, the corrupt cynical cops who are in on the deal, etc. Everybody curses like crazy (which is actually pretty realistic) and acts macho all the way - but the only thing saving the film from the weak storyline are the actors - some of them are great Serbian actors - they are good even with the one-dimensional characters they are given to play.Some character dilemmas and ponderings follow in acts 2 and 3, but again, everything is very obvious and plays on the surface only. There are no surprises here, it's mostly painting by numbers. The ending also completely strains any believability. Maras manages to outsmart the brutal kingpin and his gang of hard-core criminals in such a silly way that it's laughable.Although the insanely high imdb score and some of the reviews are likely paid for, the movie is a box office hit in Serbia, and some people really like it. I've heard someone say that the scenes of the shoot-outs and car chases look great. Well, yes, it strives to look like a Hollywood movie made in Serbia - If that's enough to make a movie good, maybe - but there is nothing really original in this film. This ain't no ""Pusher"" or ""Drive"". It's an average B movie. If you want a good thriller from Serbia watch ""The Trap"" (Klopka, 2007), and for a film about Belgrade criminals with more substance, try ""The Wounds"" (Rane, 1998). Given the times we live in, however, I'm sure there will be a South Wind 2.",South Wind

37,jaksamilosevic,"Really great movie for Serbian standards, good movie for American standards",9,5 November 2018,"Let me start with this - If this movie was American, i would give it 7/10. But since it's Serbian, i can proudly proclaim that this is a first real action movie we ever made that looks good. So, using our standards, i give it 9/10.Production, music, sound effects, action scenes, picture, settings...it's all top notch and surprisingly good for our standards. Not really there with Hollywood, but near it.Casting was great in most of the cases - Though i think the main role should have gone to a more ''dangerous looking'' actor like Viktor Savic, instead it went to Milos Bikovic - he acted very well but i feel that his portrayal of a criminal is a bit too much romanticized.Acting is pretty good, which is expected of a huge number of legends of Serbian cinematography that star in this movie (Especially Srdjan Todorovic and late Nebojsa Glogovac). Acting was always the strongest element of Serbian movies. Younger actors did their job well, though it wasn't anything spectacular. There was a lot of comic lines and moments, in an otherwise serious movie.Story is somewhat simple and really isn't the strongest point of the movie. But it's a nice change for us in Serbia to have a movie with a plot that isn't either 1) historical 2)surreal 3)overly pretentious and thus complicated. It's a nice, regular, crime story with some cliche's sprinkled over it and few very open allusions towards inefficiency and corruption of Serbian police and state.All in all it was a thrilling movie and i enjoyed it a lot. I hope that Juzni Vetar is a taste of things to come in Serbian cinematography. We've milked comedy, tragedy, tragicomedy (especially that), surreality, period dramas and similar genres way too much (i liked them all though). Maybe it's finally time for an age of Serbian crime/action movies that are actually good.",South Wind
38,jelenaive,Unbearably full of curses,1,17 November 2018,"This movie sends really bad message to all young people. You' re The Man if you steal good cars, drive fast, use drugs, have guns etc. And about script....Serbian is a beatifull language, and All I heard were curses and curses and curses.... WHY? I felt very bad and very dissapointed when I went out of the cinema, and I was not the only one! Totally wasted two hours.",South Wind

I am sad that such amazing actors are behind this garbage movie that promotes and portrays Serbia as a counrty where its cool to be a thief, drive stolen cars, get high etc..
