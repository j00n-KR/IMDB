0,TheLittleSongbird,"Even when taken for what it is, 'Battleship' still fails miserably",3,14 June 2016,"'Battleship' had great potential to be good, with the involvement of Liam Neeson and being based on a fun board game. Plus the concept was really good. All of this is squandered by very poor execution.Just for the record, this reviewer did know what to expect. Was well aware that 'Battleship' was not meant to be taken seriously, was meant to be big dumb fun and that it was going to be silly. In my opinion, the film failed at all those objectives.It's not all bad. It is a great-looking film, it's slickly shot with good use of locations and the special effects, by far the best thing about 'Battleship' are fantastic. The sound effects are often thrilling in their authenticity too. While the acting was mostly not good at all, the best performance does come from a very enthusiastic Alexander Skarsgaard.As for the rest of the performances, much has been said about Rhianna's performance. And it is true that she is very annoying and out of place in a role that has no real point to it. Taylor Kitsch is a rather bland and uncharismatic lead, and Brooklyn Dekker's acting skills prove to be pretty limited. Being the fine actor he is, proved in 'Schindler's List' and 'Kinsey', you'd expect Liam Neeson to be a redeeming quality, he tries his best but he is underused and rather one-dimensionally gruff.The aliens exude no real threat or personality, also quite clumsily incorporated into the story. The music is loud, bombastic and not much else with too much of one mood and it doesn't always gel, and the film is under-directed by Peter Berg. Despite the fantastic special effects and great visuals, the set pieces and more action-oriented parts are heavy in stupidity and low in excitement and tension, pretty dull actually.Where 'Battleship' falls down most upon are the script and story. Using every cliché and character stereotype in the book, the dialogue is often cringe-worthy with lazy and overlong exposition and very clumsy and forced jokes. While this reviewer really tried to not take 'Battleship' seriously and take it for what it was, it was hard not to when the film took intelligence-insulting stupidity to extremes, underdeveloped so much of the drama, didn't try to make sense and in some places even took itself too seriously. The story just doesn't engage, and while it is not always fair to criticise a film for being predictable everything was just too obvious and derivative where you constantly knew what was going to happen next.Overall, despite great visuals 'Battleship' fails miserably even when taking it for what it is. 3/10 Bethany Cox",Battleship
1,Leofwine_draca,"A tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing",3,10 December 2014,"And so we have yet another stultifying Hollywood blockbuster that substitutes endless fireballs and explosions for real narrative and decent plotting. BATTLESHIP follows in the tradition of the likes of TRANSFORMERS in delivering a movie that's almost chock-full of CGI action and nothing else, resulting in a completely stultifying viewing experience.The movie starts off on a weak footing, with a lame, jokey first half-hour that attempts to set up characters we're supposed to care about. The weakest of them is unfortunately the lead; this is the guy played by Taylor Kitsch, who ties with the ridiculously-cast Rihanna for giving the most wooden performance in the movie. Needless to say these characters remain cardboard cut-outs throughout, failing to interest the viewer in any discernible way.So, in the end, we're left with a large-scale game of Battleships with humans and aliens playing each other. And the format quickly becomes repetitive: one side destroys one of the enemy's ships, the other side does the same, and so on, until two and a half hours have passed and the only thing the viewer comes out of this with is a sore neck. The action isn't even very good, relying far too much on sub-par CGI (those spinning wheel things look horrendous) and clichéd scenarios.All of the older actors in the film (like Liam Neeson) are asked to sit around and look serious, while of the young cast, the only one who stands out is Tadanobu Asano (who turned out to be one of the leads in TOKYO ZOMBIE, who knew?) who delivers a halfway-decent performance. And so it goes on, and on and on, with maximum drama and destruction all the way through, leaving the viewer feeling jaded, bored and ultimately hollow by the whole experience.",Battleship
2,SnoopyStyle,They do Blow up a lot of Stuff,3,1 September 2013,"In 2005, the world discovers another earth-like planet. A message 5x more powerful than other messages is sent to that planet. Sam (Brooklyn Decker) is the daughter of Admiral Terrance Shane (Liam Neeson). Alex Hopper (Taylor Kitsch) gets tased and arrested for stealing a burrito for her. His older brother Stone (Alexander Skarsgård) gets him to sign up for the Navy. When the aliens arrive, the Navy has to battle the newcomers.Peter Berg directs this mess of junk science based on a board-game.... A BOARDGAME. And he's going all in on this concept. The shells are even made to look like the pegs from the game. The ships are attacked on a grid just like the game. No he's not backing away from the ridiculous premise at all. There isn't really any thing these actors could do about this. Sure we don't expect Taylor Kitsch, Rihanna, or Brooklyn Decker to win awards but they do have Liam Neeson. It's illogical, non-sensible. Even if you accept this world, the science just doesn't work. But if you turn off your brain, they do blow up a lot of stuff. It is a popcorn movie without any nutritional value.",Battleship
3,Prismark10,Battle of the Bay,5,24 March 2014,"The best action adventure film not directed by Michael Bay. Just like Transformers this is also an adaptation of a best selling toy.Five alien ships arrive at earth. One of them being the communication ship is destroyed the other four land near Hawaii where US and Japanese ships are involved in naval exercises. The alien ship create a force field and are contacting their home planet for a larger invasion fleet.Our hero is Alex Hopper (Taylor Kitsch) a slacker with the aide of his older brother, also a naval officer gets him to join the navy where he becomes a hothead lieutenant aboard USS John Paul Jones. Alex is in a relationship with Sam Shane the daughter of the Navy admiral (Liam Neeson) and is in danger of being discharged from the Navy.Peter Berg is credited as the director but the his contract had the clause, 'make a Michael Bay film' and in terms of how the film is shot, edited, directed, music and everything else its a carbon copy. Its almost laughable and still it died at the box office.Given that I do not have a high opinion of the Transformers franchise, I found this film to be inoffensive, entertaining fluff.",Battleship
4,claudio_carvalho,"Despite the Nationalistic Boasting, The Film is Highly Entertaining",7,2 September 2012,"In 2006, NASA sent a signal to a planet very similar to Earth through the Beacon International Project in Saddle Ridge Station, in Hawaii.In the present days in Hawaii, the troublemaker Alex Hopper (Taylor Kitsch) gets in a big confusion to get a chicken burrito to seduce the gorgeous Sam (Brooklyn Decker), who is the daughter of Admiral Shane (Liam Neeson). Alex's brother Commander Stone Hopper (Alexander Skarsgård) forces Alex to join the Navy.Lieutenant Alex Cooper participates in an international soccer competition promoted by the Navy and in the final game, he has friction with Captain Yugi Nagata (Tadanobu Asano) and Admiral Shane promises to expel him from the Navy in the end of the international operations in the sea. Alex stays in the destroyer John Paul Jones waiting for the end to the training.Out of the blue, five alien spacecrafts comes to Earth and one of them hits a satellite and explodes, hitting Hong Kong. However, the other four land on the Pacific Ocean and create a force field around the area without communication to the outside. Two vessels inside the area are destroyed by the alien force but the John Paul Jones survives and Lieutenant Alex Cooper is the highest ranked officer on board. Now Lieutenant Alex Cooper has to take the decisions to save Earth from the alien attack. ""Battleship"" is a highly entertaining full of action sci-fi, despite the usual American nationalistic boasting in movies with Armed Forces. I had lower expectations with this film, but in the end I liked it. The story is not bad and even Rihanna has good performance. If the viewer turns the brains off, he or she will probably enjoy this film and specially the great special effects. Wait until the end of the credits for a final scene in Scotland. Last but not the least, the music score is also wonderful. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Battleship – A Batalha dos Mares"" (""Battleship – The Battle of the Seas"")Note: On 28 August 2016, I saw this film again.",Battleship
5,nogodnomasters,WHO'S NEXT IN CHARGE?,9,22 September 2018,"The film starts with a NASA announcement that they are sending signals to a nearby ""Goldilocks"" planet to see if there is any life. We then switch to a bar scene where Alex (Taylor Kitsch) is ""celebrating"" his birthday with his naval officer brother Stone (Alexander Skarsgård). He sees a young lady at the bar attempting to score a chicken burrito...which leads us to some comical events and then the opening credits.After the credits, the film jumps some undisclosed years ahead. Alex is a full lieutenant in the navy on a ship (normally takes 8-10 years to rise that high). The girl, Samantha (Brooklyn Decker) happens to be the daughter of the Fleet Admiral (Liam Neeson). They want to get married. The admiral loathes Alex because he is a gross underachiever. Everything is fun and games until...the subplots come together. At this point we can write the rest of the script. The alien ships were akin to transformers.I must apologize, but I enjoyed the film. The inane plot continuity issues and science was Asylum grade from beginning to end. I could be here all day writing about how absurd things were. But unlike an Asylum film, they didn't cheat us on a soundtrack which ranged from Henry Mancini to AC/DC. We had quality actors playing likable characters with some decent lines. And no one can beat WWII vets during an AC/DC music montage.Think of the movie as ""Independence Day"" light with cheese. Good fun, good action, break out the popcorn and park your brain at the door.No sex, no nudity, near F-bombs.",Battleship
6,kosmasp,Unreal,6,7 June 2012,"And I'm not even talking about the general concept of the Battleship game being transfered to a movie here, but about Brooklyn Decker. She's so gorgeous it should be illegal. Apart from this fan-boy outcry though and the fact it's even more unreal someone would not be cheered up in her presence, the movie is not as bad as one would expect. It's not really good either, but I guess you can watch it once. Maybe you did expect more of Peter Berg, but one thing I'll be grateful for: He did not budge. The GI Joe 2 movie will be ""redone"" in 3D now, but Peter Berg would not have any of this! Thank you sir.While the GI Joe disaster probably will be a success Box Office wise, this Battleship right here sunk (if you'll excuse the pun). Paramount kinda got the wrong message when they saw Avengers succeeding at the Box Office: It wasn't the 3D that made the movie good or successful: It was the fact, that it was good! But try to explain that to executives ... Good luck with that.",Battleship
7,jboothmillard,Battleship,4,31 August 2012,"I saw the poster for this film and rightly assumed that it was going to be a film based on the famous Hasbro board game with the catchphrase ""You sank my battleship!"", and the makers of Transformers were obviously involved too, so I did watch it eventually, from Razzie nominated director Peter Berg (Welcome to the Jungle, Hancock). Basically in 2005 NASA transmitted a signal to an extrasolar planet discovered to have similar living conditions to Earth, and they are hoping to make contact with alien life. Slacker Alex Hopper (John Carter's Taylor Kitsch) is forced into joining the United States Navy along with his Commander brother Stone Hopper (True Blood's Alexander Skarsgård), after getting into trouble trying to impress Samantha 'Sam' (Razzie nominated Brooklyn Decker), daughter of Pacific Fleet Admiral Terrance Shane (Razzie nominated Liam Neeson). By 2012 Alex has risen to the rank of Lieutenant on the USS John Paul Jones, and he is dating Sam, his brother commands the USS Sampson, and the two ships are taking part in a Naval exercise, along with other Pacific nations. During the exercise however five alien crafts have responded to the signal from 2005, coming to Earth, and one landing in the middle of the ocean near Hawaii, it is only after Alex and Petty Officer Cora 'Weps' Raikes (introducing Razzie winning singer Rihanna) go to investigate that something happens. They unintentionally activate the craft to begin expanding and flying, and then the humans fire on it, and the alien visitors blow up the Sampson and kill Stone, sink the Hong Kong based ship and cause damage to the John Paul Jones, and Alex takes command. Survivors of the Myōkō, the ship from Hong Kong, board the American vessel and give them the idea to use tsunami warning buoys to pinpoint the locations of the invisible alien crafts, using a number and letter board to fire missiles on them (just like the game). While the crew of the John Paul Jones encounter an alien that they take the armour off of and investigate, aliens are causing destruction on the nearby land as well, with now psychotherapist Sam, Army veteran and double amputee Lieutenant Colonel Mick Canales (Gregory D. Gadson) and scientist Cal Zapata (Hamish Linklater) of the alien communications facility caught in the middle of the battle. The battleship crew know now that the aliens are wearing suits as they are sensitive to sunlight, and they manage to destroy two of the three alien crafts attacking, but they are forced to have to find another vessel when the John Paul Jones is destroyed. They find the USS Missouri, old and retired, but they restore all the engines and weapons ready to once again go against the aliens, with the help of Sam, Canales and Zapata on land to use the alien array which helps control their power. They manage to destroy the remaining alien invaders, with some help from the Australians, and at a ceremony of honours Stone gets a posthumous Navy Cross, and Alex gets the Silver Star and gets promoted to Lieutenant Commander, he also asks Shane if her ca marry his daughter Sam, he refuses, but he jokes and says they can discuss it at lunch. There is also a little bit after all the credits where some Scottish children and a handyman find a crashed alien object, the man manages to crack it open, and they are all scared by whatever it is that comes out. Also starring Tadanobu Asano as Captain Yugi Nagata, Jesse Plemons as Boatswain Mate Seaman Jimmy 'Ordy' Ord, Peter MacNicol as Secretary of Defense and John Tui as Chief Petty Officer Walter 'The Beast' Lynch. Kitsch is alright as the no-hoper turned Naval hero, Skarsgård could have been on screen a bit longer, Neeson does his usual stern thing, and Rihanna in her first film gets some one- liners and is gorgeous, but that's about it. I have played the board game many times, so I was intrigued how they would fit the game play into the story, they sort of do it, the story could have been more original, it does have great special effects for the Transformers style alien ships, and some relatively engaging action and explosion sequences, a not completely terrible science-fiction action film. It was nominated the Razzie for Worst Screen Ensemble for the Entire Cast, Worst Screenplay and Worst Picture. Okay!",Battleship
8,paul_haakonsen,Prepare to be blown out of the water...,7,4 August 2012,"I initially feared that ""Battleship"" would turn out the way that ""Skyline"" did, being an empty, shallow husk of a movie with no story and was just pure CGI eye candy. Luckily, it turned out not to be. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, because it was both a good story and eye candy CGI combined into one.The story in ""Battleship"" is that Earth have discovered a planet much like our own somewhere far away in the galaxy, and with amplified equipment mankind transmits a message far into deep-space. Something picks up on our signal and heads for Earth. The alien ships contact with Earth, literally, somewhere in the ocean near Hawaii. But are the visitors friendly?...Sure, this storyline has been seen before in other movies. Worn thin? Well, not particularly, because it make for good entertainment, despite having been used countless times already.As for the acting in the movie, well I think that people did good jobs with their given roles and I was most impressed with Taylor Kitsch (playing Alex Hopper), he was the one doing the most outstanding job. And it was a shame that Liam Neeson (playing admiral Shane) only had a supporting role, would have liked to see him more in the movie. And as for Rihanna (playing Cora Reikes), well personally I didn't recognize that it was her as I don't listen to her music and much less watch her videos, but I did remember her face, just couldn't place where I had seen it. I will say that despite her music being what it is, then her performance in ""Battleship"" was actually alright, nothing memorable, but alright.Then comes the CGI effects. WOW! That was just beyond amazing. Everything looked so realistic and awesome. Lots of great details in everything, and the ship design for the alien spacecrafts was quite good, though I didn't fully understand the leaping abound on water, why not just hover, float or fly? And their weapons were quite good as well, though instead of exploding, it would have been cool if they caused implosions. Perhaps most impressive, to me at least, was the design of the body armor that the visitor were using. I loved those, and it was like something straight out of the ""Unreal Tournament"" games. They looked cool and awesome and also had lots of nice details. And as for the aliens themselves, well you don't get to see all that much of them, but they were also nicely made, man-like yet alien in a way.There was a good amount of destruction in the movie, a lot of naval ships getting blown up and sinking, and that was looking quite good. But what really had be worked up was the destruction scene in Hong Kong. Oh wow, that looked awesome, just a shame it was so short and centered to mostly a single building. But wow, that looked so great that I actually had to watch it twice.The downside of ""Battleship"" is that it is so amazingly predictable, even before you put the disc into the player you know exactly how this movie will end. And also it was just a little tad too much pro-American with the way they turned a naval museum, the Missouri battleship, into a fully functioning vessel and with the help of retired naval veterans managed to best the visitors. Sure it was entertaining, but come on, it was just a tad red, white and blue.If you like Sci-Fi movies, then you definitely should check out ""Battleship"", if for nothing else, then for the CGI effects alone, it will blow you out of the water. I was thoroughly entertained by this movie from start till end.",Battleship
9,tavm,"Despite being based on a game, Battleship was quite exciting to me",7,5 June 2012,"Since this movie was shot in a studio here in Baton Rouge, I was curious to see if it was going to be represented in Battleship. Maybe it's the bar/convenience store scenes or maybe some of the effects shots, I don't know. Anyway, I highly enjoyed this somewhat shopworn story of a screw-up joining his older brother's Navy and then redeeming himself during the battle with aliens. And it was also very touchingly patriotic when those elderly veterans joined in the fight. Really, I have no shame in saying this was quite enjoyable in a cathartic level even knowing this was based on a game by Hasbro. So on that note, I highly recommend Battleship. P.S.-Two things took me aback: President Obama on the downtown screen supposedly addressing things in the movie but it was probably previous news footage of something else and the use of Creedance Clearwater Revival's ""Fortunate Son"" during the end credits since that happened to be a song that protested the way offspring of politicians managed to avoid fighting during the Vietnam War.",Battleship
10,michaelRokeefe,Action filled disappointment.,7,3 October 2012,"Peter Berg produces and directs this over ambitious spectacle. An epic action thriller that just doesn't quite live up to the hype. Based on Hasbro's classic naval combat game; several nations gather across the seas in a mutual mock war exercise. The skies become filled with outer space vehicles ready to do war if necessary to claim and use earth as a sister world. Some real decent special effects; but a predictable story line and weak dialog dooms BATTLESHIP. A romantic sub-plot doesn't do much for the film; but one thing you can expect to get is a lot of noise. Sometimes FX make a movie; this time it won't happen. Taylor Kitsch and Alexander Skarsgard play brothers, one a naval Lieutenant and the other a Commander that most of the time don't see eye to eye; and there is the romantic situation with physical therapist Brooklyn Decker. Singer Rhianna is just shy of outstanding as a Petty Officer and weapons specialist on the USS John Paul Jones, while Liam Neeson coasts through the film as the honorable Admiral Shane. Others in this large cast: Tadanobu Asano, Peter MacNicol, John Tui, Hamish Linklater, and Yoji Yoshida. It will be hard not to notice the sequence where a sonar screen resembles the Battleship game that many baby boomers have spent hours playing.",Battleship
11,hitchcockthelegend,It rhymes with ship!,5,4 December 2015,"Actually that's a little unfair, for those after a two hour plus movie of noise and robotic like destruction, then this has a modicum of popcorn frivolity about it. But it's all so vacuous, any semblance of a story is given over for a chance to show some Transformers effects work, the human characters constantly an afterthought as they play second fiddle to another CGI action scene. It feels like an extended toy advertisement, the acting is sub-standard and the editing - appropriately enough for the film's setting - is akin to a bout of sea sickness. The action sequences all carry a familiarity about them, while like their human counterparts, the alien foe here are devoid of any rhyme or reason as to their motive and being.Cash infused metallic porn at its most tiresome. 5/10",Battleship
12,Theo Robertson,Sinks Almost Without Trace,4,6 December 2014,"I thought relax after a hard day at work by putting my feet up and unwinding with a big , loud , dumb , fun blockbuster . To be fair BATTLESHIP is big , loud , dumb but is it fun ? Not really Some people on this page ( Hi Bob ) have mentioned the tone of the film and it's impossible not to notice just how jarring it is . For the first half hour the audience are subjected to much silliness and humour which almost had this audience member switching channels not least because it's presented in an almost lunatic Michael Bay style . Then for some reason the story cuts to amputees from the real life conflicts of Iraq and Afghanistan which comes close to being both poignant and offensive in equal measure I suppose being a Summer blockbuster the audience don't want sombre , character driven drama - they want lots of action and they get it but again much of the work here is substandard . Did someone mention Michael Bay ? Well that's what we get . Lots of action , lots of elliptical editing and lots of explosions . Sorry I mean lots of CGI explosions . Indeed much of the computer generated images aren't much better than the ones you see in the average SyFy mockbuster and is pretty dreadful . To be honest if it wasn't for the fact that Liam Neeson ( Basically a cameo appearance ) and that popular female singer *( Can't be bothered spelling her name ) you'd probably think you were watching something on the SyFy Channel",Battleship
13,preppy-3,VERY stupid and loud but enjoyable,5,27 July 2013,"Alex Hopper (Taylor Kitsch) has no direction in life and his brother Stone (Alexander Skarsgard) brings him into the Navy where he gets in trouble with his temper and arrogance. Then aliens attack and he (quite improbably) is in charge of a huge destroyer and has to protect the crew AND fight the aliens.This was a huge big budget bomb in the summer of 2012. It's easy to see why. The title alone is hardly exciting; Kitsch was an unknown and put in the lead; it LOOKED bad (the trailers were laughed at by audiences) and it was savaged by critics. Now it is stupid--VERY stupid and it's extremely loud with things blowing up left and right, lousy dialogue, the aliens look stupid and there's non-stop warfare. But I sort of enjoyed it. Kitsch is very good. He's handsome, muscular and can actually act. Skarsgard also is excellent as his brother. Singer Rihanna is OK in her role and Brooklyn Decker is good as Sam--Alex's girlfriend. The special effects are superb, there are incredible sound effects and LOUD booming music during almost the entire film. I was able to ignore the stupid plot because it's never dull and always keeps moving. However the opening half hour has some truly dreadful character exposition which is tough to get through. But really--it's no better and no worse than any other ordinary Hollywood summer blockbuster. I give it a marginal recommendation.",Battleship
14,LeonLouisRicci,"Gunboats, Guts, and Geezers",1,22 October 2012,"If this is the best CGI they can do for two hundred million dollars, wait a minute, no it isn't, because there has been better, much better. This is a loud, redundant, mind-less, colorless, and story-less movie that looks gray and has the feeling of, no feeling at all. It is a numbing exercise in clichés and boredom that repeats the clunky alien craft skipping across the water a half dozen times and this clanging, creaky contraption is supposed to be exciting. The aliens themselves are uninteresting and their like have been seen in Comic Books and Pulp Magazines for literally a century and they pass this stuff off as something new. The concepts and designs are not only ancient but an aggravating assault on the senses.The look of the movie is amazingly atrophied and maybe as bad as the non existent story. The script never answers any questions, in fact, it never even bothers to ask any. This one reaches a low level of ludicrous. It really has to be seen to appreciate how bad it really is.

15,CinemaSerf,Old sailors never die....,5,31 May 2020,"Ok, so I had just watched Fritz Lang's magnificent ""Metropolis"" (1927) so I figured that my brain could do with some celluloid equivalent of Ben & Jerry's. I found it - and much to my surprise, I rather enjoyed this CGI-fest. Taylor Kitsch is the cute, irresponsible Navy lieutenant who seems bent on a path of self destruction - despite the fact that his girlfriend (Brooklyn Decker) is the daughter of an Admiral (Liam Neeson) and his brother the captain of another frigate (Alexander Skarsgård). Then, on what is likely to be his last chance, the fleet encounters some beings from outer space who erect an invincible force-field around Hawaii and set about their mischievous purpose.... All the modern battle gizmos prove ineffective against this new foe and as a last resort they have to commandeer a long since retired battleship to save the world from imminent invasion... There is plenty of high-octane action; CGI is king - but it's got a kick-ass performance from Rihanna and once it gets going, Kitsch is actually quite good as the gung-ho brat with attitude. No, this is never, ever going to trouble a jury of writing or acting talent (unless, they have tail feathers and a wattle) and at over 2 hours it really is way too long; but if you are looking for stuff to watch that will dull all but your alien shoot 'em up senses; then you could do much worse than immerse yourself in this nonsense for a while...",Battleship
16,zardoz-13,"Nothing ""Transforming,"" But A Lot of Fun",7,27 May 2012,"You can get away with anything in science fiction. The mega-budget, sci-fi spectacle ""Battleship"" is as implausible as it is predictable. Nevertheless, despite its familiarity and contrivance, this larger-than-life, juvenile actioneer is a lot of fun. The end credits scene is not worth waiting around for but it does make room for a sequel. If you accept the proposition that pugnacious aliens from another galaxy would attack Earth, everything else is tolerable. The real problem is predictability. ""Battleship"" is a contemporary ""War of the Worlds"" clone on the high seas. Not surprisingly, the U.S. Navy defeats these hostile extraterrestrials with a little help from a former Asian adversary. ""Friday Night Lights"" director Peter Berg rehabilitates the Japanese for ""Battleship."" A rugged cast, scenic Hawaiian settings, and the theme of diversity make ""Battleship"" rewarding for those who thrive this brand of cheesy Saturday morning flotsam. Anybody who knows anything about ships knows you couldn't execute the maneuvers that the U.S.S. Missouri pulls off. The fantastic computer generated imagery compensates somewhat for the corny, formulaic plot. The alien warships appear impressive, and one of their weapons—a blazing yo-yo that can eat through metal like a blow torch through butte--makes things look dire. Presumably, you might even say that there is a William Faulkner like tenacity to survive the worst calamity that the universe puts in our path. ""Red"" scribes Jon and Erich Hoeber along with director Peter Berg deserve top marks for their inventive adaptation of a venerable board game. For the record, this iconic Milton Bradley game is about deducing the location of the enemy on the high seas. Berg and the Hoebers open ""Battleship"" in 2005 with the revelation that NASA (keep those funds coming) has found a ""Goldilocks planet"" similar to Earth in a nearby galaxy. We launch a powerful, sophisticated satellite to beam them a radio signal. A geeky scientist isn't so sure that this is an entirely good idea. ""This could be like Columbus and the Indians, except we're the Indians."" Predictably, these dastardly folks dispatch a reconnaissance team to investigate Earth. Unfortunately, for these fellows who all resemble ""Hellboy's"" Ron Pearlman with reptilian eyes, things do not proceed as they had planned. The communication starship crashes into the skyscrapers of Hong Kong and the aliens have no way to call home. The other four starship plunge into the Pacific Ocean about the same time that the U.S. Navy and 13 other countries are about to embark on RIMPAC, the Rim of the Pacific Exercise. These war games constitute the world's largest international maritime exercise. You can see where the Hoebers and Berg drew their inspiration. The problem here is that the aliens won't make you cringe. These guys have nothing on aliens in either ""Alien"" or the predators in ""Predator."" They don't bleed sulfuric acid, and they aren't as aggressive as the arachnids in ""Starship Troopers."" They boast some top-notch equipment but their arsenal looks similar to the Navy. Presumably, since we think alike, there shouldn't too big a gap in our weapons. Mind you, these extraterrestrials are light years ahead of us in space travel and firepower. They arm their massive, bright chrome, shape-shifting, aerodynamic vessels with the equivalent of hedgehopper ordnance to rain down Hell. Their best ordnance is a gigantic Yo-Yo-with a whip tail. These orbs of destruction smash into a ship and burn tunnel throughout it. Meantime, the U.S. Navy responds with their standard weapons and these defeat the enemy because the heroes predict correctly where the aliens are. The chief complication for our heroes is that radar doesn't work so they have to come up with another way of tracking the movements of the aliens at sea. The other flaw afflicting ""Battleship"" is its lackluster humans. Alex Hopper (Taylor Kitsch of ""John Carter"") qualifies as the usual underdog hero. He gets into trouble on his 26th birthday when he encounters a drop-dead gorgeous blonde, Samantha Shane (Brooklyn Decker of ""Just Go with It""), at a bar. Basically, Alex sleeps on his brother's couch and lets him chauffeur him around for jobs. A mean-spirited barkeeper informs Samantha as he shuts the door to a microwave that the kitchen is closed. Alex sidles up to Samantha and promises to deliver a chicken burrito in five minutes. Initially, Alex discovers the convenience store across the street has just closed for the evening. Resourceful fellow that Alex is, he breaks into the store, gets a chicken burrito, nukes it, pays for it, and then makes a less-than-graceful exit. Berg depicts most of this tongue-in-cheek scene from the perspective of the store's surveillance cameras with Henry Mancini's ""Pink Panther"" theme to underscore the humor. The Honolulu Police taser Alex twice for his gallantry. Naturally, Alex's other brother Stone Hopper (Alexander Skarsgard of ""Straw Dogs."") isn't impressed. Stone wants to join the Navy. The revelation that Samantha is the daughter of U.S. Navy Pacific Fleet Commander Admiral Shane (Liam Neeson of ""The Grey"") infuriates Stone. Consequently, Stone coerces Alex to join the Navy, too. Seven years elapse. Stone commands the USS Sampson, while Alex serves as Tactical Action Officer aboard the destroyer USS John Paul Jones. Samantha and Alex are still dating, much to the chagrin of Admiral Shane. During a soccer match between the U.S. Navy and the Japanese, a Japanese player kicks Alex in the face by accident. Long story short, this mischief forges bad blood between the two, and they tangle later and are reprimanded. Admiral Shane tells Alex that his seagoing days may be numbered. Cue the aliens to crash into the Pacific, wipe out a warship, and deploy an impregnable shield that encloses both the Sampson and the John Paul Jones. Worse things ensue, but our hero redeems himself.

17,grantss,One of the worst movies of all time,1,14 November 2015,"Surely one of the worst movies of all time. I watched this with very low expectations, and was still surprised how bad it was. Even more surprising is that it is not directed by Michael Bay, it's that bad. Sort of a cross between Independence Day and Transformers, only worse (and I didn't think that was possible). Plot is your standard humans vs aliens stuff, just more contrived, implausible, nonsensical, trite and gung ho than ever. Plot has so many holes that you suspend disbelief quite quickly.The cast were hired for their big names (Rihanna clearly isn't there for her acting ability). And clearly the cast must have been paid heaps, as nobody would want this on their CV. Just when I thought Alexander Skarsgaard might have a future in acting...",Battleship
18,Boba_Fett1138,Of course it's dumb and big!,6,16 April 2012,"Basically the best way you could describe this movie is that it's being a Michael Bay movie, without having Michael Bay involved with it.It's sort of funny. Not only is the movie big and overblown, it even features the exact same camera handling, buildup and characters like a Michael Bay movie. It's as if the studio told director Peter Berg to make a Michael Bay type movie and Berg took it a bit too literally.But in all honesty, I'm not a Bay hater, so I'm also not hating on this movie for taking such an approach. Having said that, it of course is still far from a great movie but if you want some big, dumb entertainment, this movie is well worth seeing nevertheless.It has all the pros of a Michael Bay in it but also really all of the cons! It's a good looking and often also spectacular movie but it's very thin on its story and the characters never really become likable enough to make you care about anything that is happening in this movie. Of course it also features a far from convincing concept to begin with and the movie never really makes any good attempt to explain certain stuff or make things realistic, in any way or form. The whole idea of the movie was already a bit crazy to begin with. Making a live action movie, based on a board game, that isn't even about maritime battles but about human ships versus aliens instead. No, of course it has very little to do with the board game 'Battleship', though the movie at one point still incorporated the concept of the board game into the movie pretty creatively. I can of course understand the studios wanting to attach the name ""Battleship"" to their project, since it's already a well established name and people all over the world are familiar with the game. And I can of course also understand the game manufacturer, that probably got paid big dollars and thought that the potential popularity of this movie would add to the sale of their own product as well. So this is all something I won't hold against the movie.The movie is maintaining enough as it is. It has some good action and the special effects are all great looking. It's definitely a good movie to watch on the big screen, if you simply want to have a good time and don't want to think about stuff too much.And just as I thought, Liam Neeson is actually hardly in this movie at all. Seems like they only casted him to have a big name attached to the project. His scenes probably got shot within the time span of a week, so please don't go watching this movie expecting to see a lot of Liam Neeson awesomeness or to see him taking on a couple of aliens and their 'battleships'. Not a great movie in any way but it luckily still is entertaining enough.6/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Battleship
19,view_and_review,This Movie Sank,4,8 June 2014,"Peter Berg has directed a couple of movies that I thoroughly enjoyed: Hancock and Friday Night Lights. It's a wonder he accepted this project because it was going to be a difficult task. You're taking a board game and making it into a movie!? Had that ever been done before? The closest thing I can think of is Jumanji, but it was about a board game and not a board game that was made into a movie.Battleship was bad. The story was bad as was the concept. The only halfway decent part of the movie were the effects. There were some good explosions and destruction but nothing else worth watching besides that.The premise is an alien ship (UFO: Unidentified Floating Object) is on Earth and attacks from the water. When all of the newer American and others' ships are destroyed it's time to fire up an out of service battleship to save the day. Really? And they even paid homage to the board game in the most contrived manner. On the antiquated battleship the crew had to use a screen with dots laid out in a grid. The commander called out coordinates for the officers to fire at in order to hit, and ultimately sink, the alien ship. Oh come on. I think Monopoly would have made a better movie.",Battleship
20,neil-476,Preposterous rubbish (but quite enjoyable nonetheless),7,13 April 2012,"If you shoot messages at earth-type planets saying ""Yoo hoo! Here we are!"" then you mustn't be too surprised if the recipients turn up on your doorstep 10 minutes later looking to take the place over. In the case of Battleship, ""on your doorstep"" means ""splashing down in the ocean just off Hawaii."" The good news is that the combined navies of the world are involved in war games just off Hawaii. The bad news is that the aliens put up a force field dome which includes Hawaii but excludes all the navies except for 3 destroyers, two of which are taken out in fairly short order, leaving just the one which is under the command of feckless loser Alex Hopper (Taylor Kitsch). And the clock is ticking, because if the ETs manage to phone home then it will be all over for the human race.I suppose that if you can base movies on theme park rides (Pirates Of The Caribbean) and toys (Transformers) then it's not unreasonable to base one on a board game (in my case, I'm old enough to remember playing it on squared paper). And there is, indeed, a sequence involving taking potshots at an opponent on a location grid. But mostly this film is lots of explosions as navy and aliens take turns at trying to pulverise the other side. If the eye candy of alien tech and destruction does it for you, then you are in for a real treat here.Because, apart from the winsome Brooklyn Decker who puts in an appearance from time to time, there is nothing else here of any substance whatsoever. The film is empty-headed, illogical drivel from start to finish, gung-ho to the extreme (the other navies might as well not be there, apart from one Japanese boat).Taylor Kitsch is really short.The introduction of the Battleship itself, towards the end, raises a smile.The ""anchor manoeuvre"" (aka handbrake turn) is a hoot, albeit typical of the film's disregard for little things like the laws of physics.So I'm puzzled as to why I enjoyed it as much as I did - I didn't love it, but neither did I feel I'd wasted my time.",Battleship
21,evanston_dad,"""The Poseidon Adventure"" Meets ""Transformers""",7,18 November 2012,"If one were wondering how anyone could possibly make a movie from the board game ""Battleship,"" the answer is: make a movie whose sole tie to the board game is that it has a battleship in it.Everything else about this film is ""original"" alien invasion hokum. Like a Michael Bay film, it's a recruitment ad for the armed forces, and it's preposterously long (129 minutes?!!), but if you can deal with those two strikes against it, it's not a terrible film. Going in with low enough expectations, there's a lot of enjoyment to be had. The film is of course fun to make fun of, but it's more than willing to make fun of itself, which makes it better than a lot of other movies in similar genres. There are a whole bunch of snazzy special effects, but they all look like the CGI effects that every movie has now, and none of them are especially memorable. They're more memorable than Taylor Kitsch as the main protagonist, however, who nonetheless manages to hold his own in scenes with Liam Neeson, mostly because Neeson's phone-it-in performance seems to have been filmed completely separately from anything else having to do with the movie and spliced in later.Still, this is what the term ""guilty pleasure"" was invented to describe.Grade: B",Battleship
22,morrison-dylan-fan,".""Take A Bow"" On The Starboard",6,26 April 2012,"Since having found former actor/turned director Peter Berg's 2003 Hawaii-set film Welcome To The Jungle to be a pleasant,easy going action flick,and his 2007 Middle East set Action Thriller The Kingdom,showing that Berg was developing a good eye for tension and action spectacle.I became very interested in seeing how Berg would handle a ""tent-pole"" Summer Blockbuster,that, with the exception of two supporting players, (Liam Neeson,and making her screen debut,Rihanna)would be a film filled with a mostly ""unknown"" cast,which Berg would have to safely steer from entering ""chopy"" waters.The plot:After embarrassing his older brother one to many times Alex Hooper is forced into joining the US Navy,in a last ditch attempt by his brother Stone,for Alex to finally start behaving like an adult.Despite originally showing signs of being a rebel,Alex soon starts to get on with the job,and eventually gets the honour of being a Lieutenant (whilst Stone becomes a commanding officer.)As both brothers seem to be all set on spending the rest of their lives climbing up the Navy ranks,a group of NASA scientist's are left speechless.When, they discover that an alien planet,(which has conditions similar to Earth) has picked up a satellite signal,and seems to be sending a dozens or so ""strange"" large objects from their planetAll the way to Earth. View on the film: Whilst Taylor Kitsch does give a likable performance as the unwilling hero Alex Hooper,Kitsch's presence in the film gets servilely undermined by the much more distinctive supporting cast,who end up completely stealing the film from under his nose.Giving the best performance in the whole film,Tadanobu Asano (who is said to be Japan's answer to Johnny Depp!) helps to give the second half of the movie some terrific tense moments,thanks to his performance of Nagata being one which mixes nerves of steel and wisdom,with a gradually building suspicion that he (and his crew) may be up against something that they have zero chance of at all defeating.Despite her character having more than a passing resemblance to Jenette Goldstein's Pvt. Vasquez from James Cameron's classic Aliens,Rihanna gives a confident performance as Raikes,who unexpectedly is the complete opposite of being mere eye-candy for the film,and is instead a character that allows Rihanna to make Raikes into a tough as nails tomboy,who is more than ready to join all of the men at the front of the battle lines.Showing that the Hawaii location filming for Welcome To The Jungle has left a deep impact on him,director Peter Berg uses the films stunning location to give his terrific action set-pieces a strong ""open"" feel,which allow for the spectacular,Transformers-style action scenes to never feel closed off,but to instead keep the audience on their toes,as the strange alien objects continue to appear from out of nowhere.Looking at the fast paced screenplay by Erich and Jon Hoeber,I feel that whilst Berg disappointingly skips over an aspect of the film which could have been interestingly expanded upon, (The US Navy are,at first shown to be much more Gung-Ho than the undecided aliens seem to have originally expected!)he impressively makes the best moment in this enjoyable film be one that is striped away of all of the CGI flair,and is instead a tense submarine-like thriller,where an edge of the seat full-scale game of Battleship could mean life or death for either the humans or the aliens at any given moment.",Battleship
23,anaconda-40658,It's Sunk!,2,1 June 2015,"Battleship (2012): Dir: Peter Berg / Cast: Taylor Kitsch, Liam Neeson, Brooklyn Decker, Rihanna, Alexander Skarsgard: Here is an action film inspired from a board game, and quite frankly, watching two people sit across from each and engaging in the game seems more entertaining than this special effects laden crap that could drown out a construction crew with its noise. Aliens are attacking earth and the Navy is recruited and set out to do battle against these creatures. Their only real weakness seems to be the sun but only when their helmets are removed. Of course, that's means that they will be seen on camera thus tarnishing their alien reputations. Peter Berg directed an exciting film in Hancock and a dreadful train wreck called Very Bad Things. Battleship falls between the two although outside its budget, it is about as exciting as listening to someone operate a jack hammer outside your bedroom window at two in the morning. The only actor given any depth is Taylor Kitsch whose attempt to impress a woman results in him being arrested. At the demand of his brother he is enlisted in the Navy and will predictably save the day. Brooklyn Decker plays his girlfriend who happens to be the Admiral's daughter. After being in Just Go With It, it seems that her taste in men haven't changed. Liam Neeson appears periodically as her father who is the standard tight ass depiction stereotype. Playing the actual game is much more fun than viewing this tragedy, which sinks to the bottom the moment it begins. It does present equality in different races in their common struggle, but it also leaves me longing for a Trivial Pursuit film. Score: 2 ½ / 10",Battleship

25,phd_travel,Great combination of old and new,10,12 April 2012,"This movie is a well paced combination of old and new, big and small. The old fashioned style sea battle with co-ordinates and missiles is well blended with modern technology, aliens and photography. The action sequences combine big naval battles and destruction scenes in Hong Kong and Hawaii with smaller scale hand to hand confrontations with aliens.The story is aliens invade and the Navy does battle with them in Hawaii. There is some humor and the characters are quite likable and identifiable. No overuse of CGI or confusing Transformers style aliens. The direction and photography are clear and non jerky. Kudos to Peter Berg who has come a long way since Friday Night Lights. The feel good story is inventive and keeps you entertained throughout. The plot is clearly explained so it doesn't feel irritating. Liked the way the joint efforts of the different characters tied in with diplomatic contributions from all races. Few WWII Pearl Harbor tie ins for those who notice. Nice bits of humor and use of Veterans.The cast is good. Taylor Kitch is the everyman reluctant hero. He is alright and this will probably prove more successful a role for him than John Carter. Brooklyn is quite convincing in her action role despite being distractingly well endowed. Alexander Skarsgard plays the older brother of Taylor. Liam Neeson as the Admiral has a small but dignified role and adds some class to the movie. Even Rihanna is convincing.This is one of the better action movies of recent years. Get a lot of good solid action and excitement for your buck.",Battleship
26,trashgang,a must see for the effects,7,18 September 2012,"Everybody has seen the trailers for this special effects flick and so did I but I just didn't know where this flick was going. After seen it I had a few problems with this flick. First of all, the first 30 minutes did take a bit too long, it was more about brothership and a love story. But once the navy goes to see the movie really starts and I enjoyed it a lot. Of course you don't watch it for the acting but for the effects but I must say that Taylor Kitsch (from John Carter fame) did a tremendous job. he was believable a thing we couldn't say from Rihanna. The only thing she did was reacting to situations and clearly waiting for her lines to tell. But it's the story that sucks sometime. It's clearly with a patriotic background written. The Japanese are the bad guys early on, that changes but still but once they go for the old battleship I almost started to vomit. This was with a message, USA are the best. There the movie drops into patriotism. It did remember me to the old WOII flicks were the Americans always were the heroes. Luckily towards the end it picks up what it should do. The effects on the other hand are really a must see in Blu Ray. Some things are really unbelievable like the attack on Hong Kong, still, one shot reminded me of the WTC attack in New York, the view from the ground when one of the planes crashes into the building. It's the effects and the acting that saved this flick. Don't get me wrong, it isn't all that bad but the patriotism for people out of the US of A makes it a bit laughable, we all know better. the end is naturally a happy one you can see coming from miles away.If you are a lover of the Transformers franchise then surely pick this on up.

A lot of people will hate it, some will thinks it's the greatest thing ever, and people like me will just sit down, relax and enjoy the movie. No it's not the best movie ever but if you're up for some action and sci-fi then Battleship will give you satisfaction. And yes it's a big American blockbuster so you know that you will get the cheesy replies and the victory at the end. You just know that will happen and you have to deal with it. That's the only downsize for me. For the rest I thought the action was good and the alien battleships and weapons were awesome. Not the usual weapons that you normally see. The actors are okay and by that I mean you can not expect much more when it's all about ""Look at me, I'm an American and I'm going to fix this alien problem in a second because we're so great"". So don't watch it for the acting skills or the great conversations, just watch it for the action. There's plenty of that and it's all well done.

28,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Battleship,6,11 April 2012,"Peter Berg, known for films like The Kingdom and Hancock, seemed to have picked up some directing tips from Michael Bay in learning how to craft and introduce characters, as well as to blow things up. Take for instance the entire sequence where Hong Kong bore the brunt of a crashing from UFOs, which come complete with the destruction of skyscrapers and obliterating just about everything on its crowded, narrow streets. And that's not all, with the story by Erich and Jon Hoeber taking a leaf out of crafting the requisite female character who's all boobs and legs, and little else. The hero of the day turns out to be a zero at first, with John Carter's Taylor Kitsch having a second go at leading action man status, starring as the troublemaker Alex Hopper who got recruited into the army by brother Stone (Alexnder Skarsgard) so as to teach his wayward sibling about discipline, and holding down a job since the US armed forces is just about ready to recruit and retain just about anybody.So for character development, you get to see how Alex grows from zero to hero, having responsibility and leadership thrust into his face as the most senior officer on board a ship, while on the other hand is all jitters when he has to ask permission from the father of his girlfriend (played by Brooklyn Decker) for her hand in marriage. With Liam Neeson playing Admiral Shane (and a very ceremonial one I may add) and the main man that this rascal has got to approach, it's believable just about everyone will wet their pants as well. But hold on, shelf that aside, because here comes some aliens from outer space that interrupted what would seem like a typical Five Powers Defense Arrangement naval exercise, and conveniently only a handful of ships get to go one on one with the aliens, with the rest of the more powerful armada of aircraft carriers, frigates and destroyers left out of the cold through the introduction of a force field.Some of the rare plus points will point to why Battleship is still an enduring game up until today, because it's a game of strategy and tactics, and only when the humans versus aliens actually sit down and play what would be a spruced up version of this game, do things start to excite. A bit. And it's pretty short lived as well, since the focus is almost always on the special effects, and to paint just about who has the larger and faster weaponry that can tear the other party apart. Rihanna, in her feature film debut, also impressed with her charisma, lighting up the screen each time she comes on, believable as the tough as nails sailor chick and gunner of her ship, and thank goodness there was a deliberate hand at play to keep her musical background at bay since she doesn't break into song, nor contributed any music to the soundtrack of the movie.If Rambo was cathartic to address USA's failure in the Vietnam War, then Battleship is the equivalent of the same for the US Navy in WWII in how they were blind-sided by the Japanese at Pearl Habour. Indeed the film is set near, and around the Harbour and the Hawaiian islands, and the Japanese got set up as friendly foes in the games the military men play, but everything else soon dissolved into admiration and friendship, with Tadanobu Asano playing the Japanese captain Nagata with whom forms a fast bond with Alex Hopper. It's also implicitly implied about the concerns and jitters faced by the US Naval fleet with that of the Chinese, who are obviously not invited to the war games, but get mentioned more than once during the commotion when trying to figure out what they were up against. Nothing like a little real world anxiety being injected, coming from China's modernization of her fleet in recent years.In what would a reflection of real world sentiments, and a spot on one at that, is how the American armed forces tend to want to shoot first, or deals in foreign policy with guns cocked and ready. The aliens here actually came quietly, but got interpreted as approaching Earth's atmosphere in ""formation"", and its accidentally whacking of one of the satellite junks in space brought about the destruction of Hong Kong. All they wanted was to call home by borrowing NASA's telecommunications capability (after all, they were the ones who sent out the signal first) maybe to tell everyone back home they're safe and found lifeform on Earth, and in many, many instances, don't fire first unless a threat is detected, in what would be true self- preservation mode. The film likes to cut to the aliens' POV, and there are frequent occasions they colour code things green instead of red, the latter only when locked and loaded, or fired upon. But military muscle must be flexed, even giving everything a middle finger with the expected deployment of a WWII battleship going up against advanced science fiction weaponry.But I digress. Not since Top Gun was the US Navy put into focus, and even then it was the aircraft in its arsenal. Here, the focus was on the ships available for the war games, though the more advanced ships got effectively neutered as it went to show how one destroyer under able command is able to pin point the weaknesses (there must always be on according to film law) of the alien enemy, and to exploit that during battle to turn the tables around. It's almost like a recruitment ad under Peter Berg's direction, and I would have loved to see more of that old school styled Battleship game moments, rather than what looked very much like a Transformers clone with military mixed with alien technology, in an Earth versus them storyline.",Battleship

The dragon is there as well, of course, the wizard, even Humpty Dumpty. The psychological complexes that need to be addressed are all there as our young hero overcomes hurdle after hurdle. It doesn't really matter the dragon is an alien presence and its evil is technological. It doesn't matter even that the dragon seems to be incredibly stupid. Up there, on the magic mountain, the bravery and feelings of the hero are all that matters in victory. At the end, we feel good about it, as if it were something we did.Rihanna plays an insignificant role just to get some part of the audience to pay the ticket, Liam Neeson is, of course, the mighty admiral king, a guy named Kitsch is the hero (tsk tsk tsk), while Alexander Skarsgård is there for the True Blood crowd. The aliens and CGI effects are for the boys, of course, but most of it is in the trailer.Bottom line: for a film called Battleship, I expected a battleship somewhere and it appeared, at the end, demonstrating manoeuvres that I thought only race cars could do. The aliens were ridiculous. The response of the rest of the world beautifully ignored by not showing it existed as anything else as a simple target. They had Rihanna to fill the role of the black and of the woman in the crew, alleviating the need for useless actors that had to die in the beginning to save money.

31,KineticSeoul,A good popcorn flick but nothing more...,6,6 July 2012,"From the trailer to the negative reviews led me to have almost no expectations for this movie, but it was actually decent. I mean it won't amaze or last for a very long time or even be a classic. But it's still a entertaining popcorn flick. Yeah there are constant stuff blowing up but the direction it goes makes it watchable. After a while it gets tedious but later it gets back to becoming a watchable flick. This one is much better than ""Battle: LA"" for sure although that won't be saying much. But it's simply a entertaining flick although it lacks in a LOT of areas. It really did sort of remind me of the Michael Bay's ""Transformers"" movies. Way way better than the second one and more likable military characters you can actually sorta root for. Probably won't care much about them but when they accomplish a task it's a ""heck yeah"" moment. When I first found out that Liam Neeson is going to play an Admiral I though it was going to be badass. But he is hardly in this movie and most of the screen-time is taken up by Taylor Kitsch. Kitsch isn't awful in this but didn't really stand out either or even seem believable as a leader. Stoner yes, leader no. In this movie few characters constantly mention to him that he has potential, uhm I don't see it and they mention this before the aliens invade so it's more unbelievable. So far he is just another Sam Worthington. It was cool to see Tadanobu Asano in this who is in some good Japanese flicks, he wasn't outstanding in this but it was sorta nice to see him in a mainstream Hollywood movie. There is one guy in this movie that looks like a mix between Matt Damon and Paul Bettany, but acting wise he sort of reminded me of Matt Damon. There is also a nerd scientist on a island in this that sort of reminded me of very cowardly version of Peter Parker from the new ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" 2012 movie. Lastly Rihanna is in this and is portrayed as this cute/hot military chick but she can't act worth crap. She didn't really take away anything from this but didn't really add anything to this movie. They probably added her in there cause makers of this flick wanted to have at least one military chick on board. Anyways although the trailer looked pretty bad and this is based on a children's board game it is a entertaining popcorn flick. Nothing all that great but it's not a awful movie either. If this came out in the late 90's it would have left more of a mark but as of now it's just a mediocre movie.6.5/10",Battleship
32,sddavis63,First Warning: Hasbro Had A Big Part In This,3,27 October 2012,"Hasbro makes toys and games and not movies. Shouldn't that be warning enough? Yet, even after seeing Hasbro's name splashed in the credits at the start of this movie I decided I'd watch it anyway. What can I say? Perhaps not surprisingly, given the connection with a maker of toys and games, this whole movie has something of an aura of silliness to it. After the first 45 minutes in which virtually nothing of significance happens, except for the attempt to force some laughs, and an introduction to Hopper (Taylor Kitsch) - a loser type whose brother forces him to join the Navy to try to fix him up - we then move on to the main action.An earth-like planet (Planet G) has been discovered and we've sent a signal. The aliens have responded, and an all out war ensues. Interestingly enough, Hopper (who has apparently continued to be a bit of a screw-up in the Navy and is on the verge of being discharged) has nevertheless risen to be an officer senior enough to take command of a warship when the captain is killed. Right. Of course, as we all suspected he would from the beginning, he turns out to be the big hero who (in his own words) ""saved the earth"" - but, in spite of ""saving the earth"" (which seems like a pretty big deal to me) he only gets awarded the Navy Silver Star (the Navy's 3rd highest decoration.) The third highest decoration for the guy who ""saved the earth?"" Makes sense.Of course, maybe he didn't deserve anything more. Honestly - these aliens really didn't seem that threatening. I mean, there were only five ships (hardly a massive invasion fleet) and while the ships had some fancy weapons, the aliens ended up being routed by a World War II era battleship. Not to mention the fact that when they were out of the ship they didn't really seem all that tough or even heavily armed. There's also the curious fact that the aliens didn't kill anyone except in self- defence. In fact, they deliberately left humans alone if the humans didn't threaten them. So, although you think of this as an alien invasion movie, I'm left wondering a bit as to whether this was really an alien invasion or whether it was all just a gigantic misunderstanding.I was wondering about the linkage with the game ""Battleship."" I assumed that with Hasbro involved there had to be some linkage. The way the Navy finally discovers to track the alien ship in the ocean is reminiscent of the board game. That's the connection. Wow. Glad that got cleared up. (3/10)",Battleship
33,Hellmant,Peter Berg going the way of Michael Bay!,6,22 May 2012,"'BATTLESHIP': Three Stars (Out of Five)After the immense success of comic, toy, cartoon and video game film adaptations we now have popular board games being turned into ridiculous big budget movies! Hasbro (the toy company also behind the 'TRANSFORMERS' and 'G.I. JOE' feature film productions) produced the film and Peter Berg (the actor turned director/producer also behind such popular hits as 'FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS', 'HANCOCK', 'THE KINGDOM' and 'THE RUNDOWN') directed. Two of Berg's former cast members from the TV show based on his movie 'FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS' (which he also produced, wrote and directed multiple episodes of) Taylor Kitsch and Jesse Plemons co-star in the movie. This is the second big budget would-be blockbuster in 2 months (after 'JOHN CARTER') for Kitsch. The film also stars Alexander Skarsgard, Brooklyn Decker, Rihanna and Liam Neeson. It was written by Erich and Jon Hober (the writing team also behind 'RED' and 'WHITEOUT'). The film basically takes the board game premise and adds aliens for the U.S. Navy to do battle with. The film is a joke but it's not even so bad it's good. It has a few entertaining scenes but for the most part it's a bore. The story focuses on two brothers named Alex (Kitsch) and Stone (Skarsgard) Hopper who are also naval officers. Alex has always been a screw-up while his brother Stone has always tried to keep him out of trouble. Alex has fallen for the Admiral's daughter (Decker) but the Admiral (Neeson) hates him of course. So asking for his daughter's hand in marriage is of course going to be an uphill battle. While on a Naval war game exercise the fleet comes in to contact with an alien armada that crashed into the ocean near Hawaii. The aliens were responding to a NASA signal and now want to take over the world but they need to contact home before they can do so. It's of course up to Alex to overcome his flaws and save the day.I have been a fan of Peter Berg's other work but here he does look like he's going the way of Michael Bay and this doesn't even measure up to most of Bay's work. It's a ridiculous concept that could have been a lot of fun but the writers have no clue how to do that. The movie looks good; I did like the look of the aliens and their robotic suits and the action scenes all look good as well. The movie is just never very thrilling, it has a few laughs here and there but it's not very funny either. The actors all look good and are decent enough for this type of movie but there's definitely nothing to praise from them either (even Neeson seems like he's just going through the motions and he's almost always good). For Kitsch as a leading man this marks his second big budget domestic failure (after 'JOHN CARTER'); the movie cost over $200 million to make and made just $25 million in it's opening weekend. Like 'JOHN CARTER' it has done really well over seas though so it's not a complete failure but this film is nowhere near as classic or entertaining as that other expensive science fiction film. This film deserves to flop but I hope Berg can recover from it and get back to doing films he's actually good at.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKNLyy6lGng",Battleship
34,FeastMode,my notes,7,1 July 2019,"Entertaining fun cheesy popcorn flick. pretty funny with some great action sequences and intense scenes. there were also some creative concepts. but of course it had some bad acting, and some horrible acting by non-actors who were in the movie for some reason. and of course some cheesy dialogue. but you can have some mindless fun with this movie (2 viewings)
SPOILERS
the creative concept was how they used the buoy to see where the ships were, and kind of made it like the battleship game of somewhat guessing and trying to hit the target.the black dude with no legs was a real navy vet, not an actor, and you could tell. his role was pretty big and it was brutal. and they also had a bunch of other navy vets in the movie, like it was some kind of advertisement for the navy. that was pretty dumb",Battleship
35,Robert_duder,Tons of flash but missing the meat and potatoes,6,29 August 2012,"Ignoring the obvious HOST of jokes that inevitably came out of them making a film based on a board game and giving it a 200 plus million dollar budget, this film could have been anything. They could have called Independence Day Retribution and it would have made just as much sense. There was very very little unless you were REALLY looking that connected to the board game. The film is chock full of explosions, lavish special effects (most of them looking like Transformers leftovers which makes sense) and it probably looked neat on the big screen (I saw it on blu-ray for the first time.) But it's missing magic. What I mean is it has the budget, the characters, the star power, the special effects, the story, and even half decent (if not a little predictable) character development but yet it lacks just something that can't be explained that makes it a powerful blockbuster. I don't think it is anything that can be pin pointed, its just lacking heart, creamy center, meat and potatoes...whatever you want to describe it as. It was sort of reminiscent of truly great action/sci fi blockbusters like Armageddon and Independence Day but without the vital organs.Taylor Kitsch should find a new agent. He's now had back to back blockbuster disasters with John Carter and now this. I don't believe it's him. He has decent screen chemistry and plays a good hero although I'm not sure he can hold a movie himself. The rest of the cast basically support him in this movie. His brother for half the film is played by Alexander Skarsgård who sort of outshines Kitsch and I would have rather seen him in the lone hero role. Liam Neeson shows up in a small mostly arbitrary role that doesn't hold a lot of ground unfortunately because Neeson is amazing but doesn't get to show that off at all. Rihanna actually does a pretty decent job in her very background role with just a few lines. I think she deserved more screen time. Brooklyn Decker should really stick to modelling because as beautiful as she is she delivers some pretty schlocky lines and her and Kitsch have minimal chemistry. The rest of the crew are decent but without any really stand out performances.Peter Berg is no amateur in the directing department. He's had some big movies, directed big stars and had some hits and misses in my opinions. But he knows his way around an action flick. Which is probably why you have all this visual splash and very little substance. I think its partly on the shoulders of an unpolished script and a lack of chemistry with the cast. Still it isn't a total disaster and as many jokes as you could make it actually holds its own as a scifi action flick. So check it out but keep expectations low and you'll find something reasonably entertaining but it certainly won't blow you away. And no...no one says ""you sunk my Battleship"" which I personally think as cheesy as that would have been...it would have made the film that much better. 6.5/10",Battleship
36,bowmanblue,Makes Independence Day look high-brow,5,23 February 2015,"Normally I quite enjoy a mindless action romp - I (sadly) managed to enjoy Skyline, Battle L.A. and even bits of Independence Day. Seeing as I'm capable of removing my brain in order to squeeze some mild enjoyment out of Danny Dyer's films, I thought I could employ the same technique with Battleship. Sadly, there wasn't a planet far enough away in the universe that I could ship my mind to in order to enjoy this film.Taylor Kitsch plays a man who, while chatting up a girl in a bar, decides to steal her some food from a local convenience store in order to impress her. He subsequently gets arrested and then his brother informs him that he should join the navy. He does. If that isn't hard enough to believe he makes Lieutenant Commander in the next scene and ends up captaining a Battleship when it's captain gets (conveniently) killed.Enter the aliens: they fly halfway across the universe in spaceships so advanced that they sit in the water and then only move by jumping forward in small leaps (seriously). They also only fire bombs and a few spinny disc-type things that break roads and ignore children playing baseball.Taylor Kitsch then enlists the help of retired naval servicemen and amputees to beat up the alien threat and save the day (along with Rhianna who has a baseball cap that never leaves her head even when she jumps out of a ship and into water).Okay, so, as with most big-budget Hollywood films, the special effects are top notch. The aliens are good, but we've seen cities being destroyed in things like Independence Day and Godzilla, plus (unfortunately) anyone who's seen the 9/11 footage has watched buildings fall down in real life, leaving Hollywood's interpretations a bit redundant. However, it's the acting that's the problem. The dialogue is so cheesy that you'll find yourself laughing at the allegedly serious lines the actors speak. Liam Neeson's part only amounts to an extended cameo.I'm surprised the film is rated a 12 certificate, as anyone over 12 will probably feel that their intelligence has been thoroughly insulted by having this made for them. An eight year old boy may enjoy this has he has probably not seen anything better.I guess this is what comes from making a film out of a board game. I can't wait for 'Game of Life: The Movie' starring Ben Affleck and Jessie J.",Battleship
37,MLDinTN,"some good special effects, lousy story",5,11 February 2013,"Too bad they couldn't come up with a decent script for this film since they spent 200 million on it. I thought the alien ships were cool, and cool gun fire, but the story was too lame.We have the screw-up, Alex Hopper, whom is dating the general's daughter, Sam, and his older top of the class brother, Stone. They are in the Navy, with Stone being a captain. Alex is close to being kicked out after they come back from an exercise. Well, aliens attack during this exercise. Alex is left to save the day, after having to take over as captain. And Sam and some army dude are trapped on the mountain top in which the aliens are using the satellites to communicate back home. The key to saving Earth is destroying the sats before they can use them.So, there's lots of action, cheesy one liners, and typical characters. It has its moments.FINAL VERDICT: The definition of a popcorn flick. Only watch if you don't want to use brain cells.",Battleship
38,g-bodyl,Transformers On Water!,6,25 December 2013,"Battleship would be the film you would get if Michael Bay made his Transformers films in the water. That being said, I prefer Bay's films over this film. This film isn't entirely awful, but it's not great. It's a rather entertaining popcorn film that doesn't take itself too seriously but it's sort of let down by some shabby acting, a weak script, and perhaps just a little too much explosions.Peter Berg's film is essentially about how the Navy is at war against these powerful, invading aliens that came to invade Earth after a signal was sent out to their home planet.There is some good acting here, but there is also some awful acting. Taylor Kitsch has received blame for the failure of this movie financially, but he does a solid job especially with his cocky attitude. I like Liam Neeson here but I feel he was in too few scenes. Brooklyn Decker has the looks, but her acting can get better. Rihanna is just awful, plain awful.Overall, this is a loud, mediocre mess, but I found a good amount of sections to be entertaining. There is plenty of action here and I guess that's good. It seemed like everything got exploded at one point or another in the film though. As summer entertainment, it does what it aimed to do despite many glaring flaws. I think I liked the Transformers movies better though. I rate this film 6/10.",Battleship
39,A_Different_Drummer,"once again, the rating is all wrong",9,28 April 2014,"This film, best considered a younger cousin to the classic Independence Day (which I confess I have seen about a dozen times, NOT MY FAULT, they keep showing it every independence day! Duh!) is one of those all-too-common entries in the IMDb database that simply don't make sense. First of all look at the number of IMDb members who have taken time off their busy schedules to comment. Seriously, go check. I'll wait here until you get back. See the problem? If the film were really that mundane, that forgettable, would there really be so many people willing to comment? (Note to IMDb intelligentsia -- do people review films because they genuinely want to leave a guidepost for viewers of the future, or do they review films because they simply love a good scrap?) In any case, for those readers who are interested, I will point out that while the acting is merely OK, the script, this massively un-appreciated script, is to die for. In other words, the writers completely understood that to connect with the audience, you start small, you build bridges, and then you escalate and escalate and ultimately you provide a payoff. Sound simple? Then why don't more movies have scripts as smooth as this one? (Ditto for Independence Day, the script there is a work of art as well). And in case you wondering, can a good story by itself elevate a film to classic status? Darn right! In any case, I gave a rating which I consider commiserate with the actual entertainment value. Footnote: in a silent homage to the series Battlestar Gallactica, which was unique and ground-breaking in so many ways, the producers cast Rihanna, one of the most striking women of the century, in the uniform of a Chief Petty Officer and then watched with bemusement (I think) as male viewers had their eyes pop out of their heads every time she got screen time.(In BSG the analogue was Kandyse McClure.) A really solid entertaining film deserving a much higher rating.",Battleship
40,Irishchatter,Very good film,8,22 August 2015,"I honestly thought the movie was pretty good. I say the reason why this movie became well known is due to the fact, Rihanna is in it. She seems to have been very good at acting as she never was involved in the movie industry before! She killed it, lemme tell ya!I found out so funny yet inspiring plus rewarding that the World War II Veterans helped out the Navy crew to defeat the big tank of an Alien ship. I found it was really meant to a lot of people whose loved ones were involved during the war! The last ship that the Navy had was like Titanic hitting the iceberg, yet it was a bomb that caused it to sink down! I wonder how James Cameron would feel about it being involved in this movie!",Battleship
41,ironhorse_iv,More like Battlesh*t. This movie sunk.,5,19 April 2015,"I can't stand this film. Very loosely based off, the guessing game, Battleship from Milton Bradley. Battleship, the movie takes the concept of the game, where players smartly against each other in a classic contest that pits mind against mind, requiring logic, intuition and carefully considered strategy and turns into a dumb rip-off of a Michael Bay's explosion style film. Honestly, the movie would have work better, if the movie was just about the RIMPAC event that the writers put into the film. The Rim of the Pacific War-Exercise make sense, because it puts international ships against each other, in war games simulations. Unfortunately, director Peter Berg thinks the best way for him, to get viewers was to make it, into another generic Alien invasion movie. This isn't the way to make a movie based off a board game, at all. The alien concept has nothing to do with the source material. I really had high hopes for this film. After all, previous board games movies like 1985's Clue & 1995's Jumanji weren't so bad. Instead, the movie focus on really bad characters to carry out, this ill-advised plot. The convoluted story revolves around Alex Hopper (Taylor Kitsch), a reckless and irresponsible young man whose wild ways consistently disappoint his brother Stone, (Alexander Skarsgård), a respected commander in the U.S. Navy. To avoid prison, for a burrito-stealing related felony, Alex joins the Navy, in hope to turn his life around, impress a girl, Sam (Brooklyn Decker) and his superior, Admiral Shane (Liam Neeson). If this sounds, very familiar, it's basically a badly written first half- version of 2009's Star Trek, taking place on earth. I have nothing against Taylor Kitsch's acting chops, but his character is just annoying and too unlikeable. The whole burrito stealing scene is just thoughtless. I really didn't get it. Was the movie trying really hard to parody, truTV Presents: World's Dumbest Criminals!? I really doubt, that Alex would became a Lt. in the Navy in four years with a criminal record like his. Everything, that Alex was saying, was just too arrogant. Don't get me wrong, I love cocky characters, but there wasn't anything smart with his character being the hero. He's so utterly imbecilic that his character is more like an insult to all the brave Navy men out there, serving our nation. Another insulting character is Petty Officer, Cora 'Weps' Rikes played by singer, Rihanna. Don't get me wrong, Rihanna is a great singer, but I really couldn't get behind, Rihanna's film debut as a hard-as-nails weapons specialist. The reasons why is because how jarring, it was, for me to see her, portray a strong independent badass woman, when in real-life, she's not even close. Not only would she would allow men to beat her up, senseless in real life, but she end up return back to that abusive person, after this film. Rihanna's character also had some really terrible dialogue. Mahalo, motherf*** was a horrible one-liner. The way, it got censor for the PG-13 rating, makes it, even more ear-bleeding. At the same time, I'm really disappointed, by how lackluster, Liam Neeson's role in the film. He's perfect as a Navy Officer, and somebody that the Navy would be prove to have, represented them. Yet the filmmakers doesn't give his character anything badass to do in this film. He's just there to be the angry father character. His daughter, Sam played by swimsuit model, Brooklyn Decker has more to do in this movie, than him. Still, I couldn't really didn't care much of the sub-story of her and the injury Army serviceman, Lieutenant Colonel Mick Canales played by real-life Army veteran, Gregory D. Gadson, going up on the mountain to take out the alien's communication towers. I didn't find it, inspiring. I love, that the movie use real-life veterans, and active-service people as cast extras, but I just wish, they were given, better roles. Sure, the human characters are paper-thin, but I found the aliens to be the worse off. The aliens have the power to create a force-field that's two nautical miles wide and rises more than 300,000 feet in the air to encircle the Navy, but they can't protect their own ships with it against the Navy, nor could have protect their communication spaceship from a harmless satellite. Wow- these aliens are lame and not combat functionality. Not only that, but their weakness is the sunlight. Oh come on! Are they goths? They come from a planet, very similar to ours. The action is disappointing and surprisingly dull. Lots of over-used CGI effects, fake looking flare shots, and quick cuts, make this film not good. For a movie call 'Battleships', technically, there is only one Battleship, use in this film, and that's the USS Missouri. The others, were, technically, 'Destroyers'. I really didn't mind, the USS Missouri, got used, but I really doubt, it will be combat-action. It went to the bounds of unrealistic, right there. The film is such po-faced stoicism and flag-waving jingoism silly, that it impossible to emotionally connect with this film, beyond, laughing at how dumb, it is. The post-credit scene makes it, seem like a sequel will come out, but I really doubt it, due to how badly this movie, score in the box office. It did so bad that Hasbro, the toy company that fund it, nearly went out of business. Overall: the film feels half-baked and barely developed, making for a frustrating film that fails to ever fully engage, and ultimately lacks the brilliant simplicity of the game on which it was based. It's not good. Don't recommended.",Battleship
42,The-Sarkologist,"Good, if you like this type of movie.",6,14 April 2012,"Well, now I know who Alexander Skarsgard is, though I suspect that he became famous through his role in True Blood than in anything else. However, he is a Swedish actor, and when you look at his filmography you will see that he has starred in a lot of Swedish movies. I suspect that he is one of the new wave of Hollywood hunks that are coming to the cinema screens. These are the guys, as you can probably guess, that bring people into the cinemas simply because they are on the credits, though I must admit that the movie probably has to be good as well.However, I did not see this movie for Skarsgard, but rather because Hong Kong gets trashed, though it wasn't anywhere near as bad as I was led to believe from the trailers. Well, okay, an intergalatic spaceship does crash into the city, but it seems as if the only building it takes out is the Bank of China building (which seems to be a magnet for being taken out). Hey, I've been to Hong Kong, so seeing on the screen now has a different effect on me than it otherwise would, especially since you can quite easily see where they get things wrong. They didn't in this movie because most of the movie takes place at sea.This movie was based on a game called Battleship. I suspect that it is similar to the really old game that I have played numerous times where you position your ships on the board behind a screen, and then shout out co-ordinates hoping that you sink all your opponents ships before they sink yours. However, other than the name, and a couple of times when they were attempting to destroy alien craft without radar, it is only the name that links the movie to the game.The premise is that NASA has developed a communications array that will enable them to communicate with potential inhabitants of other planets. However what happens is that when the aliens receive the signal, it alerts them to the existence of Earth and they send a scouting party to find out more about it. However, one of their ships (the communications ship) strikes a satellite as it comes in to Earth, crashes, and is destroyed. This leaves the rest of the aliens without the ability to contact their homeworld to bring reinforcements, and it also gives humanity an opportunity to fight back.Beyond that this movie is simply another clone of War of the Worlds, and there have been many of them around. Unlike War of the Worlds, it is humanity's persistence and determination that enables them to win through as opposed to Well's idea (which is much better) that the alien environment of Earth ends up destroying the invaders. Granted, they do have a weakness and it is exploited, however in the end, humanity fights back and wins. Unfortunately, in our own history, that really never happened, as was suggested at the beginning when they mentioned Columbus discovering America, and that we are the Indians. Some cases it has worked (Rome and the Parthians as well as more modern examples in the Middle East) but generally, where there is a huge difference in technology, the one with the greater technology is generally the winner.This was an entertaining movie, but that is about it. If you like movies about alien invasions, and humanity rising up to the challenge and winning, then this movie is probably for you. If not, then I would recommend that you look elsewhere. Oh, and I must mentioned, it appears that humanity fired the first shot. There was no indication, until the ships started shooting, that these aliens were hostile. Maybe, just maybe, they should have made it a little more clearer that they were here to invade and not to make first contact. By shooting first we pretty much take away any sympathy that anybody might have for our plight.",Battleship

This movie is whacky has some inaccuracies for sure and laughable moments that you'd think wtf is happening because of those 2 aspects it's a cheesy good time that blatantly knows what it's meant to be.

44,Vartiainen,The action is the only aspect that works,2,23 April 2012,"I wasn't overly impressed. Well okay, perhaps if you take into account the fact that this was based on Battleship of all possible games, then it's not that bad, but as a stand-alone movie it really doesn't hold its own.But let's go over the upsides first, shall we. The action and the accompanying CGI both work really well. When the Navy starts laying down punishment on huge mecha battleships - while actually playing the game Battleship in a real-world scenario on top of all things - it looks cool. It really does and I found myself rooting for these underdog humans. On top of that, some of the actors are rather nice to look at. Rihanna, for example, was in all honesty a rather believable bridge bunny in her BDU's.But action and some eye candy were not enough to save this movie. Those said actors give rather lackluster performances - though I got the feeling that it was weak writing that was holding them back more than any lack of talent or enthusiasm. On top of that, the story itself is impossible weak, the movie is full of clichés and whenever the characters try to have any kind of meaningful conversations or have any kind of personal crises it feels extremely forced and false. Not a great character or drama film.That said, the action DOES work and while the army porn and propaganda is extremely blatant, it's honest about itself. This movie is one big hurrah for the US Navy and it doesn't try to hide it. And I can appreciate that. So if handsome army sailors blowing up aliens is one of your guilty pleasures, you'll like this movie just fine. If it's not, I'd stay away.",Battleship

47,freemantle_uk,Should have been a parody,4,29 April 2012,"Hasbro has had massive success as a toy company, so much so that they were able to expand into other media such as TV and film. Their biggest success is the Michael Bay's lead Transformers series. But know they have faced their biggest challenge, adapting the board game Battleship, something with no story into a film.In 2005 NASA discover an planet that could possibly inhabit intelligence life and send them a message. At the same time Alex Hopper (Taylor Kitsch) is a 26 year old layabout whose brother, Stone (Alexander Skargard) pressuring him to get a job or join the Navy. When trying to impress a woman, Sam (Brooklyn Dekker) he ends up tasered by the police and Stone makes Alex join the US Navy. Fast forward to the present day, Stone is the Commander of a destroyer and Alex is a lieutenant, but is arrogant, reckless and a troublemaker, and he wants to marry Sam, who is Admiral Shane's (Liam Neeson) daughter. During the RIMPAC wargames Alex clashes with Captain Nagata (Tadanobu Asano) of the Japanese Navy and he threaten with being discharged. But all that is put aside when aliens invade Earth, putting a force field around Hawaii and Alex is the only person to lead the world's effort to stop the aliens.Battleship was never going to be an intelligential exercise, but this film was more stupid then you can imagine. If it was made as a parody it could have been the comedy of the year: but it was of semi-serious affair. But it is hard to treat a film seriously that is based on a board game, especially the last 30 minutes which need to be seen to believed. The special effects were not that special: they looked they are from a computer game. Say what you will about the Transformers series but at least the Transformers looked like that interacted with their environment and well looked real. It was just too fake and whilst there is some nice little details it looked more like a cut scene in a game. We expect better from a film costing $200 Million.Battleship follows the usual military and alien cliques we have seen time and again in blockbusters. Alex is the typical archetype we have seen, some one who is reckless and arrogant who in the end learns responsibly, humility and working with someone he was hostile to. We have seen these military maverick tales before. Added to that the alien contact sections were like Independence Day and some of bit when the Navy first come across like the Ronald Emmerich film. It was clear that Hasbro and Peter Berg were trying to copy Michael Bay's style from the way the action scenes were shot, the government meetings being like scenes in The Rock and Armageddon, the destruction of Hong Kong seeming similar to Armageddon and Transformers: Dark of the Moon, the sunlit military scenes and use of zooms towards and away from the Navy. The early destruction of Hawaii was like the destruction of the L.A. freeway in 2012. Even the score sounded like a Michael Bay score, even using horns like in Transformers: Dark of the Moon, but it is Steve Jablonsky who provided the score, the man who scored the Transformers films.The characters were one dimenisonal, there was just nothing to them. They is no back story or anything, they are just there. The most fun we have is in the beginning when Alex tries to impress Sam by breaking into a petrol station to get a chicken burrito, it was actually funny, using security camera footage to show this. He has a rivalry with Nagata for no real reason, they disliked each other. Kitsch was rather bland and actors like Skargard and Neeson took their roles for the paycheque, but Dekker was the worst performer, offering nothing but a blank expression, emotionless delivery and just wanting to shout at the screen ""emote damn it!"" Rihanna was okay in her acting debut, but she really had nothing to work with and she was the best out of the sailors because most of the others were just annoying.The aliens themselves were lifted from Halo, they wore the same armour and helmet and the design of the aliens looked uninventive, a humanoid creature with a starfish like chin. We do not really know the aliens or even their motives. If it was pure conquest wouldn't they just blow up everything or everyone or at least send a large invasion force to take over the planet. But they only send a small force and act almost like predators, they only attack if they are attacked, seeing threats like a computer, turning red if they are about to attack, leaving people who are innocent like children. They are just there to give the filmmakers an easy foe to fight because they are too creatively bankrupt to think to fight or scared of upsetting foreign markets (i.e. China, India and Russia).Berg must have known he was on to a loser when he signed up to Battleship and there are some moment that felt like it was trying to parody Bay and other sci-fi actioneers, such as the use of slow motion, big explosions, using massive weapons, the Skype call to all the government agencies and having to shoe horn references to the game it is based on. But Berg is better then this, he is a much better action director and I hope by making Battleship he can make a film he actually wants to.Battleship is just an example of by the numbers filmmaking, a blockbuster that has no imagination or thought and relies on audiences being easily pleased. This a film that is not worth seeing, even if you are morbidly curious like I was. It really should have been a parody film. Still Battleship is better then Battle: Los Angeles.",Battleship

But from there, it becomes ""Dude, Where's my Car"" which was also about 100 times better than this. I just could not keep watching it, and it is not that Taylor Kitsch was embarrassing, but the character was written so badly I could not tolerate it. Now I totally dug John Carter, Kitsch plays the Competent Man better than he plays The Thin Man, as they try to make him pull off here. This character was NOT funny and I basically did not care about him at all, my only concern for the character he played was getting up and shutting this stuff off.The DVD is still in my player, maybe I'll skip forward half an hour and see if something better happens, but I won't change my rating.It comes down to this: In 15 minutes, no part of this movie persuaded me to continue watching it. It was all bumbling idiocy. If this is the sad sorry state of Movies in 2012, then I'm glad I do not get out to see them often: because if this is standard for the kinds of puerile tripe being concocted for movie viewers, then the movie-going public have become Cyril M. Kornbluth's ""The Marching Morons.""Impending Invasion? Don't populate the movie with Buffoon-like characters. Even for the movie ""2012,"" although John Cusack was an incompetent writer who had lost his family due to bad luck, and although he was slightly clumsy, he was not a Buffoon: If there is a world wide THREAT, then the ""Protagonist"" of the film ought not to be a guy I would not trust with 75 cents to buy me a coke!Even ""I Am Number Four"" - Which had similar buffoonery in the film, the idea was that they moved quickly past it and got to the relevant conundrum. Young people are more intelligent than the makers of this film take them for, they do not want to be pandered to: Which is what the 15 minutes of film I saw was doing, and why I am loathe to even try to watch the remainder.",Battleship
49,MBunge,Our expectations were sunk long ago,3,28 May 2012,"A nausea-inducing mash up of Top Gun, Independence Day and Armageddon, the only positive thing I can say about this film is that there have been so many of these loud, brainless, soulless FX extravaganzas in the last decade and a half that this is merely one more piece of garbage to toss on the ever growing pile. Well, Brooklyn Decker remains hotter than the fiery pokers that should be shoved up the ass of whoever decided a big screen adaptation of freakin' Battleship was a good idea, so I supposed that's two positive things. Director Peter Berg was not content to simply make a dumb, manipulative, big budget spectacle. No, he had to take advantage of the possibilities of CGI to throw in enough camera movement to make The Blair Witch Project look like My Dinner with Andre. I didn't walk out of this tiresomely familiar fiasco with any sense of disappointment or regret. I left the theater with a low grade headache and a sense of impending vomit. Considering that I watched The Avengers, which is just as FX and action intensive as Battleship, without any negative reaction, I'm calling for an addition to the ratings system. Stuff like this should be labeled MS for ""may induce motion sickness"". This is the first time I've ever been made ill by a movie that didn't utilize that faux documentary, hand held, ""shaky cam"" effect. If regular flicks are going to start inflicting that visual style on unsuspecting audiences, people like me need to be warned.Poor, poor Taylor Kitsch. He already starred this year in John Carter, which I thought was much better than its box office performance, and now he's the lead in this, which entirely deserves to bomb and bomb hard. I thought he was okay in JC and his character here is so nakedly clichéd that no actor alive could made it look good, so he doesn't deserve any of the blame. Two epic disasters like this, however, can't look good on anyone's resume.Battleship does confirm a few things. Neither Decker nor Rihanna can act. When audiences tire of seeing Liam Neeson as a middle-aged ass kicker, he'll be able to play the stern, daunting father figure to great success for the rest of his career. PG-13 now not only means you can use one ""F word"" if you want, you can put a limitless amount of destruction on screen and as long as there's no blood or gore. Jesse Plemons does look like Matt Damon's fat third cousin. And Michael Bay has at least one admirer among his fellow directors.Alex Hopper (Taylor Kitsch) is a hot headed naval officers who is forced into command when an alien task force lands on Earth and only Hopper's ship is in position to stop them. Well, Hopper's ship and Hopper's girlfriend (Brooklyn Decker), a wounded veteran (Gregory D. Gadson) and a nerdy science guy (Cal Zapata) who are stuck on the mountain top the aliens are going to use to signal their homeworld. There's a lot of yelling, a lot of explosions, a lot of CGI and a lot of scenes that try to pull on your heart strings in such depressingly obvious ways that they're only uplifting in the way they make you want to life the gun up to your temple.I suppose I must give Berg and company credit for actually coming up with a non-unintentionally hilarious scene where a real life game of Battleship is acted out between Hopper's destroyer and the hopping alien ships. Yeah, that's right. Hopping. The alien craft do not fly. The do not drive on land. They do not sail on the seas. They hop across the surface of the water, like Muddy Mudskipper or something. It is the only unique element in this motion picture, so of course it's also the damned stupidest thing in it.I've noticed some reviews arguing that Battleship really isn't that bad. I don't know if those reviewers were stoned, paid off by the studio or in the midst of some religious reawakening, but they're as wrong as wrong can be. This is a legitimately awful film. If Hollywood wasn't subjecting us all to a steady stream of stuff that's just as terrible every May through September, this movie would become the focus of anger and derision for years on end. As it is, we're all so worn out that we can barely notice.Don't watch Battleship. Don't watch it in the theater. Don't watch it on TV. Don't watch it on DVD or Blu-Ray. Don't watch it online. Just don't.",Battleship
50,estebangonzalez10,And so the mind numbing Summer Blockbuster movies begin,5,15 May 2012,"¨Warning red, weapons tight, I want everything loaded.¨ Battleship has proved that it will be very difficult to compete with the high quality standard that The Avengers left for this year's Summer movies. Battleship really disappoints although honestly I wasn't expecting much from the film. There are some good actors in this movie, but the script is just so cheesy that even Liam Neeson looks bad in this. The story has its numbing entertaining moments thanks to all the special effects, but it is just another Transformers 3 all over again (as the trailer proudly announces). Battleship is directed by Peter Berg, the man who brought us The Rundown and Hancock, and who is responsible for the successful TV series Friday Night Lights. He has made some interesting projects in the past, but this film really doesn't work despite all the great visuals and explosions going on. The greatest problem the film has is the script which was written by Erich and Jon Hoeber who haven't had success in the past with neither Whiteout nor Red. This move also marks the debut of Rihanna as an actress and she does what she can with the little she was given. Overall this is a forgettable movie and I would rather play the game then watch the film again. Saying that Battleship is based on the Hasbro game is like saying Saving Private Ryan was based on RISK.Stone (Alexander Skarsgard) and Alex Hopper (Taylor Kitsch) might be brothers, but they are very different. Stone is a Commander in the NAVY, while Alex hasn't found his calling in life and is sleeping in his brother's couch. After Alex finds himself in trouble once again Stone decides to enlist him in the NAVY in order for him to mature. Alex becomes a Lieutenant, but is always causing trouble despite his potential, and Admiral Shane (Liam Neeson) has already announced that after the Naval war games exercise he will discharge him from the NAVY. Alex also happens to be dating the Admiral's daughter, Sam (Brooklyn Decker), but can't find the way to tell him that he is planning on marrying her. Some of the other officers in Stone's ship are Weps Raikes (Rihanna), The Beast Lynch (John Tui), and Jimmy (Jesse Plemons). During the international war games exercise where fleets from all over the world have come to Hawaii they find themselves threatened by an alien armada invasion. In the line of fire, these men will do what they can to save the world from extinction after the aliens have proved they are here to wipe them out.The main character in this film is played by Taylor Kitsch, who still hasn't found his break out performance after the huge John Carter box office failure. He is still mostly known for his role in Friday Night Lights. Alexander Skarsgard is also known for his role in the TV series Trueblood, so there truly isn't a movie star in this film considering Liam Neeson has a very small role in this. These relatively unknown television actors (unless you're a fan of either TV series) do what they can with the poor material they were given to work with. They aren't to blame as to why the movie doesn't really work. The film takes a while to pick up and there are several unnecessary scenes, like the one where the American NAVY crew is playing soccer against the Japanese; it was just awful. The entire movie felt like a NAVY propaganda telling everyone that if you want to have fun then you should enlist in the NAVY. There isn't much more to this movie than that so don't expect too much. This could rank alongside other films with good visuals but no story like Transformers 3 and Battle Los Angeles.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",Battleship
51,dar0417,Could have been worse,6,11 February 2020,When I first saw the trailer to this I could not believe it was a real movie. I think that is because it was billed a board game turned movie. In reality it was an alien invasion movie that was actually watchable. My review maybe generous since I had very LOW exceptions.,Battleship
52,jimbo-53-186511,"Watchable, but rather hollow and soulless",5,5 June 2021,"A destructive alien race arrives on Earth causing havoc in various locations across the globe. The epicentre of their armada lands off the coast of Hawaii whilst the US navy are carrying out training exercises. Now the Navy find themselves in a real world life or death battle where the survival of the human race is at stake...In some ways Battleship delivered a lot of what I expected; action, explosions, fighting etc and all of this is fine in that it gives the film momentum and prevents it from being dull or uneventful. On the other hand though, there is practically no story and no depth or camaraderie to any of the characters. In its very basic form, Battleship provided me with something to look at but that's all it really does; there's no real reason given to care about anyone or anything that happens which will always result in a film failing in my book even if it undoubtedly has some merit in other areas.The acting is only so-so by all involved and director Peter Berg does his best here; technically the film is quite good, but working from such a thin script the odds were always stacked against Berg.Battleship has enough going for it to make it watchable, but it is never able to rise above this due to the shallow story and bland characters. If you're in a 'switch off your brain' mood then this may just about work, but there's no getting around the fact that, ultimately, Battleship is hollow, soulless and empty.",Battleship
53,arthur_tafero,Unintentionally Hilarious - Battleship,1,30 July 2019,"The one star is for the smoking hot black chick, who is as good-looking as Halle Berry. Everything else in the film is Kaka. There is no script; the characters are thinner than a coat of Chinese paint on a storefront, and the film is an insult to the intelligence of my eight-year-old son. Even the special effects are lame. The only believable thing in the film is that no one in it could survive in their career except Liam Neeson, whom I am very sure was unbelievably embarrassed to be in this turkey wannabe transformers flick. Nothing in the film makes sense, and making a mockery of our US veterans (not to mention current servicemen serving our country) is unforgivable. We are expected to believe that some junior officer is going to save the world while the pentagon and all the military might of the US just waits an hour or so before acting. Yeah, right. Not only that, but if a civilization that was smart enough to get to our planet in the first place would be so technologically advanced to ours that competition would not even be possible. I really cannot stand films with no sense of logic, math or science. Although the film did provide quite a few hilarious moments. For idiots only.",Battleship
54,3xHCCH,Familiar Plot of US Soldiers vs Aliens: Fun But Too Long,6,12 April 2012,"This is one of those movies that we know we have already seen in one way or the other before. Earth is attacked by aliens and the US military (however cocky and dysfunctional the leader) winds up saving the world. When I heard that this movie was based on a Hasbro board game, I did not really expect much anymore, except for a slam-bang action movie, and that is what I got. Director Peter Berg goes for the patriotic card as he imbues the film with various dramatic (and practically cheesy) scenes of heroism against all odds. ""Independence Day"" anyone?In ""Battleship"", the dysfunctional leader facing aliens is played by rising star Taylor Kitsch, who just played another character like that in his last starrer ""John Carter."" He's certainly got that brash jock role down pat. He did look much shorter here surrounded by taller actors around him, particularly Alexander Skarsgard who played his big brother. Brooklyn Decker, the ""actress"" who played his girlfriend Samantha, has got to have some of the most wretched acting recorded on screen in a major film, and she was not as hot as Megan Fox was in ""Transformers."" Rihanna, while expectedly wooden too as a Navy soldier,does a little better. Liam Neeson plays the Admiral who just happened to be Samantha's dad. He wisely just played it for fun, not too seriously as he did as Zeus in ""Clash of the Titans"".If you go watch this film with low expectations, you will have fun with this film with all its fiery action and explosions. There was even an unbelievable mano-a-mano fist fight with aliens here! Do not think too hard about the numerous unbelievable or illogical scenes. My only complaint about this was the running time of more than two hours. You will feel the clock ticking as you watch.",Battleship
55,TdSmth5,So much better than expected,7,15 September 2012,"A good-for-nothing kid named Alex is forced by his successful Navy brother to join the Navy. Even there he pretty much screws everything up. Well, he's succeeded at one thing- getting the hot Sam to be his girlfriend, who's the daughter of an admiral.While the two brothers are one their respective ships doing an international training exercise near Hawaii something crashes into the sea. The 5 somethings are thought to have come from outer space as response to a signal sent by NASA to a distant earth-like planet. One of the objects crashed into Hong Kong.One of these structures suddenly raises from the water and just lurks there. Alex is sent out on a boat to get a closer look. He touches it and electricity throws him back into the water. Suddenly this thing releases an electromagnetic bubble around the area trapping 5 destroyer ships within it and separating them from the world. Now 3 alien craft emerge.The remaining ships inside which include one Japanese ship decide to attack the UFOs only to get a devastating response from the aliens who shoot some destructive cans into the ships that burrow deep within them taking them completely apart. After a couple of these attempts all that left is one ship and the highest ranking officer is now Alex, who has to man up. Of course he takes the wrong decision to launch a suicidal attack with the last ship he's got, but the crew stop him in time and he's made to pick up surviving sailors instead. They also pick up a dead alien. It's inside a metal robotic suit, but looks somewhat human, except that it has four long fingers.As part of the invasion, the aliens also start taking over a satellite base on Oahu for communication purposes. That story involves Sam, a disabled veteran, and a funny scientist.Eventually Alex joined by the Japanese captain devise a strategy to destroy the alien spacecraft. But the'll also have to destroy the satellite base before the aliens beam out their communication. That leaves them no choice but to recommission the mighty battleship USS Missouri.I sure was ready to see a terrible movie, one of the 10 worst of the year according to the ""critics."" But to my surprise, Battleship is a very entertaining summer blockbuster. The consensus of critics and reviewers alike seems to that this movie is ""stupid,"" that it has no story, and so on. I disagree, it actually is far less stupid than most blockbusters that Hollywood cranks out, including those moronic and pointless found footage movies that are released every month by the dozen. Battleships' plot is typical for the genre- there is a crisis that threatens the planet and some folks have to solve it. It has some romance, which fortunately Battleships takes care off in the first couple of minutes and it does so with humor and charm. It has some minor characters that are supposed to provide comic relief- usually not very successfully, although the scientist who finds himself stuck with Sam and the veteran delivers some very funny lines.The casting has some problems no doubt. Kitsch, Skarsgard, and MacNicol do a solid job while Decker and Tui are quite a revelation. Poor Neeson however is miscast. He could play all sorts of roles, but that of a tough admiral isn't one of them, he doesn't look nor sound the part. Then there's some singer who got cast for some reason and she too has no place in this movie.Battleship isn't perfect nor brilliant. But it stands out among summer blockbusters by not treating the audience like retards and by taking itself not all that serious. Our main character isn't your typical invulnerable hero, this guy is human with his faults and he grows through them. The casting of WWII veterans is quite touching. The effects are excellent and the action exhilarating. There's no shortage of stupid huge budget movies-look no further than Michael Bay's yearly pointless CGI carnage-fest or some lame superhero movie-but Battleship isn't among them.",Battleship
56,aharmas,And They Said Words Don't Sink Battleships,9,3 June 2012,"First of all, if we are going to get technical and demand perfection, let's pick on those Jedi robes... how can anyone fight dressed like that? There are holes here, too; however there is plenty to like. To begin, we have a very appealing and engaging cast. People who are easy on the eye, actually look like they could be servicemen or women, and who don't spend a lot of time having philosophical discussion or analyzing incomprehensible quantum mechanics or overlapping universes. We have a lot of action, good special effects, plenty of hardware that looks lethal, and some villains that are scary because they show the worst of us and reptilian eyes. Those always work! Once again, man plays with technology, and before we know it, the world is upside down when a race of aliens is ready to take over the world. There are no wordy threats here, just destructive weaponry that can sink the latest battleship out there total buildings, cities, bridges, etc. These aliens are scary.In one of the best and most imaginative turning points in recent cinema, the writers actually use some ""outdated"" technology to save the day, and it's refreshing to see digital take a backseat to good old fashioned special effects and regular cinematography. Be prepared to cheer a literal ""turn"" in one of the most exciting maneuvers in the naval battles.Not to say the film is perfect, but it's definitely more engaging than a few of the recent entries which try to compensate with some tired humor or unimaginative menagerie. Every film requires careful planning, even action ones, and it will succeed when the right people all converge together.",Battleship
57,peterp-450-298716,"Action packed, top notch CGI, but ultra dumb storyline ....",5,3 March 2014,"Let's drop some lead on those motherf...I really didn't have high expectations when I started watching ""Battleship"", and yet I had a great time with this action packed SF. Ultimately, this movie shows what they initially made it ​​for: awful lot of action and stupid violence, heroism of the highest order and sometimes some humor. Despite the length of the movie , I didn't get bored and it wasn't as usual a battle against sleep. Granted, you should not expect too much of the storyline or look for any depth in the story. The story on its own isn't logical either. But that can't spoil the fun, and you can expect some blasting action scenes.About the performances we can be brief : there weren't any because that was totally unnecessary and there was no need to bring up profound characters . It was a hodgepodge of cliché personalities as we have seen already in multiple movies. First you have the Hopper brothers. Stone is the caring and perfect soldier ( Alexander Skarsgard ) who has a neatly controlled life and knows his responsibilities and tries to explain that to the rebellious profligate brother Alex ( Taylor Kitch ). When they are celebrating Alex his birthday in a dark bar, purely by coincidence the Admiral his daughter Sam ( Brooklyn Decker ) walks in there for a ""Chicken Buritto"". Her well formed shapes make Alex his hormones go totally flabbergasted. The result is a ridiculous intrusion as we have already seen a lot on You Tube . Before you know it , he is also in the navy and promoted at a very short notice to Lieutenant.The Admiral himself is played by Liam Neeson. He's just for a little time in the picture and probably has accepted this role for filling up a hole in his busy schedule. Rihanna played a female macho. To be honest, I didn't recognize her at all, and oddly enough she didn't bother me. A starring role for me was the interpretation by Gregory D. Dadson of the veteran Canales, because it was so spontaneous and eventually was the funniest part. The moment when the alien stared at his two prosthetics was priceless. Most useless (but necessary) contribution was the gang of ""Benidorm Bastards"" that eventually took care of things.About the images I was pretty satisfied. It had a ""Pacific Rim"" feeling. The special effects were sometimes hugely impressive. The alien spacecrafts were realistic and looked ominously threatening. Huge monstrous vehicles which moved with tremendous force on the ocean. The look of the naval fleet was sometimes really amateurish. The naval battles gave me a ""Pearl Harbour"" feeling. Only the latter movie was better in terms of effects. The moment the destroyer started to sink and Alex and the Japanese captain Nagata stood at the stern, the comparison with ""Titanic"" wasn't far off. Sometimes the shots seemed to be made ​​in a bathtub with Dinkey Toys toys. The aliens did their best to act aggressively. But it was nevertheless quite ridiculously when they were confronted with a human and turned into a friendly E.T.The reason why those aliens came to earth is not entirely clear. To me it seemed like it was for them to test whether they could set up a communication line with their home planet. And every time I wonder why humanity always seeks contact with a life form that is light years from here. If they are out there, you can nevertheless assume that if this race can come over here, they have outclassed our technology in all areas. Well it's nice that Cal Zapata reminds us twice that when an alien race reacts to the signal and makes contact, this would be like when Columbus discovered the Indians. Except that we are now the Indians.Oh well, the final result was something like ""Top Gun"". Again a demonstration of the American superiority in the Military field. And then we also get to see some retired sailors who manage to get a museum piece to work again. And luckily there's even ammunition on board to use. These triggerfinger-grandfathers shoot those aliens back into space so there is a peaceful ending and Alex can ask the Admiral for permission to marry his daughter. That this was going to happen was obvious. But it was still enjoyable to watch this entertaining spectacle (with an empty head). Sometimes it's just that plain simple.",Battleship

There is a lot of story going on there that needs some explaining cause it feels like they just skipped right over B and went from A to C with these characters.Weirdly, that annoyed me more than the bad acting of Rihanna, the ridiculously shoehorned subplot with the differently abled veteran, or the complete nonsense that is these aliens. Actually, scratch that, the aliens annoyed me a lot too. We have these alien lifeforms that managed to cross the stars to get here, meaning they have seriously advanced tech and yet all they can do is clumsily move around the ocean and fire off the occasional alien weapon.

The important thing here is I probably would've enjoyed it immensely at 10 years old, much older than that I have no chance. It's almost universally acclaimed by other adults as a no-brainer and I can only add my agreement, there's hardly anything worth salvaging.Impressively warlike looking alien craft and occupants attack Earth and attempt to consolidate their highly technological lines of communication by using tinpot homo sapiens satellites. The aliens look steely and ferocious but continually fold up like penknives in the face of human ingenuity, even a fat guy with false legs gives one of the baffled metal twerps a whupping. The cgi cartoonery is generally eye-popping and relentlessly realistic - however at the aforementioned 10 years old I used to enjoy Buster Crabbe's Flash Gordon for its special effects, where are they now? There's a splendid end though: Creedence's sublime Fortunate Son comes on loud and strong for the credits, those 2 minutes almost made me forgive the previous 2 hours.

Right out the gate, the writing was poor, the actors (the first on scene) seemed wooden and preoccupied with getting through their lines rather than acting and the extras were very caricature. However as soon as the infamous ""burrito hunt"" scene (you'll understand when you see the film) is over with the film actually slowly begins get interesting. Now I'm not a fan (nor was I familiar with) the video game of which the film is based so it was a pleasant surprise to see the impressive special-effects battle scenes and singer Rihanna who makes her acting debut actually hold her own and prove to be a better actress than the other lead actress in the film (Brooklyn Decker, whose acting skills I have to say were an apology in this film). Liam Neeson who names was used to market the film only appears briefly and is/was grossly wasted in his role.

63,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,Battleship (2012),4,19 August 2012,"Battleship is an adaptation of the board game, but they've added aliens for some crappy reason. We follow Taylor Kitsch as the biggest dick in the world. He has no redeemable qualities even though we are constantly told of how talented he is. We never get to see this, so I have no idea what everyone is talking about. He joins the navy and makes it to the rank of Lieutenant within about 5 years. Again I don't know how because they don't show it. He is joined by his older and more responsible brother played horrifically by Alexander Skarsgard. Seriously, this is one of the worst performances I've ever seen in my life and I've seen a lot. He just starts shouting at Kitsch in the most unbelievable fashion. The rest of the cast are made up of blockbuster clichés and incorporates the acting debut of Rihanna who is OK because she doesn't have a lot to do and some real life soldier who lost his legs in Iraq. Now I have nothing but respect for the man but why is he in a film? I'm not going to patronize the guy by saying 'He did well considering this is his first time acting' He didn't do well. He was terrible beyond words. Not one of his lines resonated with anything regarding real emotion. Every time the film got going, he would appear on screen to remind you of how bad it was. Liam Neeson has maybe 4 minutes of screen time and the film just cuts to him to assure you it got at least one decent actor. The special effects are fantastic even if the action scenes they are incorporated into are just messy. The most confusing part was the aliens motives, they seemed like the good guys most of the time as they refused to attack humans unless threatened. If this was an indictment of human nature or something then it picked the wrong film to do it in. It gets 4 stars for making me laugh at it on a regular basis.",Battleship
64,rgkarim,Battleship or Baddleship?,7,18 May 2012,"Honestly Hollywood must be reaching the bottom of the barrel if they are making movies based on board games. Although Battleship may be fun to play, the idea of making it a movie was a little bit of a stretch for me. Regardless I decided to give it a go and I'm here to give you my opinion on this action/sci fi film. Is it worth the eight dollars to see the film, or have the trailers once again fooled you into seeing something a lot less exciting. Read on to find out.The plot of this movie is like any Science Fiction Naval movie a group of aliens have arrived on our planet and are plotting to do something. Standing in the way of their plans is Lieutenant Alex Hopper (Taylor Kitsch) a young navy officer who joined the navy at the insistence of his brother Stone (Alexander Skarsgård) after his lazy attitude annoys Stone to the breaking point. However, Alex's rogue nature still remains to die as he tests the patience of Admiral Shane (Liam Neeson) the father of Alex's love interest Samantha (Brooklyn Decker). Can he get his act together to save the world, or will his insolence cause more harm than good?I know the plot has been seen over and over again, but there is only so much leeway you can get from a board game. However, the story wasn't as bad as many people thought it would be. Although predictable for the most part, Battleship had some entertaining aspects that kept me into the film. For one thing the graphics for the movie were gorgeous. If there is one thing the Transformers studio can do right, it's make robots and aliens come to life. Each ship or shock trooper was incredibly detailed and blended into the movie to make things as real as they could be. The only challenges to this were the fight scenes, which were so jam-packed with explosions and fires you would think Michael Bay was still directing. As for the action, well it was alright, nothing really exciting or fast paced. Instead it was more of a strategic battle that was a good representation of navy action. To my disappointment, the aliens' attacks were actually pretty limited, though effective, which made the battles a little stale at times. Was that all this movie was though? Was it really just a movie about large boats firing at space ships? For the most part yes, but there were a couple of side stories that were there to allow for a break from the shooting. One story involved developing Alex's character, while the other centered on Sam and a retired naval officer named Mick (Gregory D. Gadson). Throughout all the stories though, the acting was okay. Kitsch pretty much plays that sad mopey role he made famous in Friday Night lights, while Rihanna to my surprise took on her role pretty well, though there wasn't much character development on her part. Liam Neeson fans will be a little disappointed to hear that he doesn't show up much in this film. His occasional appearances are usually short, and he still plays his typical role. The rest of the acting is fine as well, but there are no star stealing performances to get excited about. However, there are some other things in this movie that will appeal to a certain audience. This movie is definitely an homage to American veterans and is sure to stimulate some pride. Fans of Brooklyn Decker will enjoy watching her as not only is she beautiful, but also actually plays a new role that is new for her instead of just being a ditsy blonde. I can safely say that she was probably my favorite character, next to the Japanese captain. The soundtrack as well is very fitting for the various scenes, as the orchestra work helps add more edge to the movie, while still stimulating some American pride. There are some weaknesses though which were a little confusing or annoying for me. For one thing there are a few scenes in the movie that seemed either pointless or hinted at something else. Unfortunately, these scenes remained unanswered, which annoys me a little bit. As you probably expected, the dialog is also a little cheesy and shallow, mainly involving the word fire more than anything else. There was also really no comedy relief in the movie, only at the beginning really, which is okay for this kind of movie, but still would have been nice to see. Dare I say it, but the action was also a little stale at points too, and there is only so many times I can see the same cannons fire over and over again.Despite what some critics have been giving this movie, I don't think this movie is horrible. Again the strategic warfare seems accurate and is somewhat exciting, and the graphics are still outstanding. However, the shallow and somewhat confusing story, the stale canon firing, and the predictability of the story really make this movie monotone and mediocre. Military men will again enjoy and have respect for the movie, but the casual audience member may have a hard time being entertained. Though if you were like most of the audience members in the theater today, you'll find entertainment in watching either Kitsch or Decker, as their looks are eye candy for all. My scores for this movie are below.Action/Sci Fi/Thriller: 7.0 Movie Overall: 6.5I recommend you wait for Netflix on this one, but the action scenes are definitely worthy of the cinema magic. If you decide to go though, take a date or a group of friends, this movie is definitely worth a guy's night out.

65,p-stepien,Not bad for a dumb idea,5,12 September 2012,"Off the coast of Hawaii a series of military exercises with Destroyer class warships from around the world are commencing. Leading on the ships is stead-fast commander Stone Hopper (Alexander Skarsgård), who enlisted he younger brother Alex (Taylor Kitsch) into the Navy to avoid him throwing away his life with his reckless behaviour. This coincides with a visit from outside the solar system by a race of humanoids, who responsive to a signal sent years before, decide to visit albeit obviously not with Earth's best interest in mind. After force-fielding the Hawaiian archipelago all but three ships are within the area of alien invasion...Faced by the conundrum of filming a movie based on a classic board game, which envisages outdated methods of targeting hostile warships, scriptwriters decided to add an alien element into the mix, which allows for an outwordly suspension of belief and helps avoid total ridicule. And even manages to supply a pretty tense version of the board game, when a destroyer engages in night battle with alien water-hopping vessels. With a storyline set for pure entertainment and minimised logical fail factors (notwithstanding several moments of submersion into idiocy) all that remains is to go into cruise mode and haplessly venture with our clichéd, cardboard cut heroes into a ""Independence Day""-styled homage to America (with a nod to Japan for some wanton multiculturality).Featuring a crew of battle-worn old-boys marching towards the screen with a classic action slow-motion effect in order to man a Battleship class museum ship and a handicapped ex-Iraq marine standing up to the alien menace, the outcome is explosive, adrenaline fuelled and utterly predictable. Not a ship-wreck many had predicted, but an overblown budget channelled at satisfying a target audience, which evidently couldn't care less, if the movie never was created.",Battleship

Film Critic Anthony Aranda (age 10) shares his review below: video review here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQ6xSgC7sD0This movie is awesome! I loved it because it has a ton of action, lots of funny parts and suspense.The main characters are Alex Hopper, Sam, Cora and Yugi. My favorite character is Alex Hopper because he is really funny and brave. He wants revenge on the aliens who are attacking them because they hurt his brother. This movie revolves around Alex Hopper who joins the Navy because he needs to get his life together. The Captain in the Navy doesn't really like Alex because they think he won't be any help to them. Alex goes out on a destroyer to look for other boats and they come across a large mass in the water. That's where they find the aliens and then start fighting for their lives. My favorite part is when Alex Hopper tries to get a burrito for a girl he likes named Sam. The kitchen is closed so he goes through a lot of trouble to get her this burrito. It's really funny because he falls down a few times and then gets chased by police who tazer him. It is hilarious!I recommend this movie for ages 10 and up because there is violence in the movie and it is rated PG-13. I think kids 10 and up would love this movie though because it has so much action.",Battleship

68,bob-rutzel-1,Exciting. CGI wins this one,7,15 September 2012,"War games in the waters around Hawaii are interrupted by an alien invasion whose intent seems to be destruction of the earth. Lt. Alex Hooper (Taylor Kitsch) has a reputation of not conforming to anything and who acts irresponsibly all the time, comes of age and matures personally in the ensuing battle. This is based upon the video game: Battleship. When watching the movie you do not have to push any buttons. They are pushed for you. The CGI is nothing but super fantastic and worth the price of admission. Possibly some of the best CGI you will ever see. The story line and dialogues are very weak in the beginning. As you follow the dumbness (no other word for it) you almost have a tendency to shut this down. And, this surprises you because you know Peter Berg is the director and he is very good and his work can be verified by watching his directing the successful TV show Friday NIGHT LIGHTS. But, you don't shut it down because you heard how good the photography, cinematography and CGI are and you want to see for yourself. Okay, okay, you really just want to see cities, buildings, ships and planes blown up, crushed and crash to scare the daylights out of everyone. Hey, it works. Notables who do a good job as do everyone: Liam Neeson as the Admiral, Alexander Skarsgard as Alex's brother, Jesse Plemmons as Boatswain Mate Ordy, Rihanna as Petty Office Cora, Tadanobu Asano as the Japanese Naval Captain, and Peter MacNicol as the Secretary of Defense. Oh, and Brooklyn Decker plays Sam as Alex's love interest. Once the battle with the aliens starts the dialogues and actions also come of age and are very good and you forget all about how lame and dumb the beginning of this was. The Battleship Missouri, a dockside museum tourist attraction, plays the key role to thwart the alien attack. The veterans who man the ship for the tourists are thrilled to once again have the opportunity to save their country, maybe the world. Only downside I saw was: there was actually live ammunition on a tourist attraction? And, everything worked? Hard to believe, but hey, this is Hollywood where everything is possible. So forget about logic and just enjoy the photography and CGI. You may have a tendency to cheer from time to time. FYI: Taylor Kitsch and Jesse Plemmons were main characters in Peter Berg's Friday NIGHT LIGHTS. (7/10) Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No, you can hear the characters start to mouth F-bomb words, but the director must have called ""Cut"" and you don't hear the full exclamation.",Battleship
69,moviexclusive,This year's answer to Transformers. Period.,5,10 April 2012,"The last I remember there isn't any aliens involved in the strategy naval boardgame, ""Battleship"". Oops did I just let out a major spoiler? Anyway it doesn't matter much if you have been paying attention to all the trailers and TV spots. In this Peter Berg's directed movie, there are indeed more than mere battleships, submarines and fighter jets and seriously what do you expect from the same company that is responsible for another toy property that generated gazillion amount of dollars at the box office.While director James 'Titanic-Avatar' Cameron has openly criticized ""Battleship"" as an example of bad filmmaking even before it opens, he isn't that far from being wrong. ""Battleship"" apparently has nothing much to do with the boardgame that was so popular back in the days where cable TV and iPad is nonexistent and it doesn't take a genius to scribe a story pitting numerous USS carriers against some unknown entities. Taking a leaf (or two) out of the Michael Bay/Roland Emmerich school of filmmaking, Berg populated ""Battleship"" with plenty of high-octane action sequences, most of them visually arresting and deafening. Unfortunately, you would have seen 90% of them one way or another even before you step into the cinema. The attack on the naval base looks like a cross between ""Pearl Harbor"" and ""Transformers"" and the bombing of buildings, highways awkwardly looks like leftovers from ""Armageddon"" and ""2012"". Bay loves his movies to be filled with army cargo and Berg indeed does him proud by touting every piece of hardware found in the US Navy.The only credit I feel ""Battleship"" deserved is the Halo-looking like aliens. Wonderfully crafted and human-like although you won't get to see much of their true self let alone their true purpose on earth. As with any other aliens-invading movies, the technology and design of their sleek machinery is top-notch and ""Battleship"" won't disappoint viewers in this aspect.Year 2012 is the year for actor Taylor Kitsch who topline the movie as Lt Alex Hopper, a hotheaded naval officer who conveniently has a brother, Stone (True Blood's Alexander Skarsgard) also a naval officer and his prospective father-in-law is also a navy guy but a powerful one, Admiral Shane (Liam Neeson). Kitsch might not have much success playing ""John Carter"" and it looks like his Alex Hopper's one-dimensional character isn't going to give him much leg as well. Again, Michael Bay has the tendency to engage Supermodels for his movies; Berg on the other hand decides to rope in popstar Rihanna for her feature film debut, she for that matter indeed looks good running around deck out in naval outfit and the gorgeous Brooklyn Decker (Just Go With It) as Alex's love interest is splendid (in terms of look and figure) on the big screen. With all the characters underwritten including an extended cameo by Neeson (and you thought he is here to kick some serious alien-asses), you will be sorely disappointed. Skarsgard is also wasted in a role that is probably filmed during his True Blood break. Boasting a Transformers crew that involves Hasbro, composer Steve Jablonsky and visual effects house ILM, ""Battleship"" ends up as a piece of visual heavy pre-summer blockbuster that tries too hard mimicking the success of the morphing robots franchise. At least Berg's ""Hancock"" was a fun piece on anti-hero and ""The Kingdom"", an action-packed political thriller, ""Battleship"" collapses under layers and layers of CG and state-of-the-art sound effects. At a staggering two hours plus, this is pretty exhaustive. Peter Berg can be such a competent director that it just befuddles me why he is aping Michael Bay all the way right here.",Battleship

I mean what does a board game where your goal is to sink your opponents ship with aliens? What in the SEC were they thinking?The film is just pretty much a big budget video game that's what it feels like and I swear this movie is so bad that I wouldn't pay a dollar for it.The plot is just the same one we have seen a million times and it just has nothing to do with what the game is based off.Whatever you do never ever ever ever watch this film is just awful and ruin what Battleship is suppose to be.I give Battleship an 1 out of 10",Battleship

Did peter berg & studio fear it'll be slammed by critics and American audience? I think the answer to all these questions is YES. Fortunately or unfortunately I saw battleship last Friday on Big Screen. Even though I knew it's another alien invasion movie, I still kind of hoped it to be better than its processors in resent few years like Sky fall, Battlefield: Los Angeles, the Darkest Hour, Cowboys VS Aliens & Super 8. Super 8 was slightingly better but these all of these movies don't have the motive behind alien invasion like British surprise hit ""Attack the Block"". Battleship lacks on story department but above all it stole all its action, scenes and CGI from Transformers1/2/3, Armageddon, Pearl Harbor, Star Trek and even Titanic. Honestly initially you enjoy the movie and take it as it's presented but in last 45mintues you just laugh out loud and want these explosions to stop. Taylor Kitch after John Carter gives another High budget Mindless flick, Liam Neeson was wasted in insignificant role, Brooklyn Decker is a stunner as always (no acting required), Alexander Skarsguard is good but doesn't stay longer AND FYI Rihanna was the Black Dude (Character written for Black Actor) of the movie ha ha ha ha Overall, Catch it (If explosions & pretty faces are your type otherwise Trash It).",Battleship

Apparently it's too much to ask to write roles where you care what happens to the people amidst the spectacle...In what now seems like the dim and distant past of blockbuster movies, I remember seeing fun action movies that also had a half-decent script. I don't know why Hollywood and the teenage demographic these days seem to think that the two are mutually exclusive. At a basic level, I can get impressive visuals and an adrenaline rush from a video game, and that's better value, because it's interactive.Movies are designed to be a longform of storytelling with peaks and troughs, but there is no story here; there is only a series of thinly sketched goals. Watching the pawns move from A to B once the action is underway quickly becomes repetitive nonsense; a cut and paste job of previous movies slapped onto a brand, because producers are scared to be original in the face of audiences whose only requirement is flashy effects. Yes, such an outcome might well have been predictable given the title and the source of inspiration, but gosh darn it all if it isn't still depressing to behold, in practise.",Battleship
75,Screen_Blitz,Poorly written adaption to a board game,4,18 October 2015,"Hollywood has gone well past the time when literary works stood as the only source of I inspirations for films not based on screenwriters' original ideas. There have a been television shows, video games, toys, and now we've reached a point where board games have become a new sources of adaptions; though it doesn't mark the first time as we experienced a screen adaption of the game 'Clue' back in 1985. Based on the board game Battleship by Milton Bradley, this military sci-fi thriller directed by Peter Berg follows arrogant and hot-headed Lieutenant Alex Cooper (played by Taylor Kitsch), a naval officer who is assigned to the USS John Paul Jones, while his older and more responsible brother Stone (played by Alexander Skarsgard) is assigned aboard the USS Sampson. When a large army of aliens arrive overseas and launch a massive attack against the naval fleet in attempt in rob Earth of it's resources. In a devastating battle against the alien invasion, the fleet must join together with the Japanese forces to fend off against alien forces and save the future of the human race. This movie teaches filmmaker as well as audience why adapting board games into movies is never a good idea. What is wrong with this film exactly? Well first off, the film suffers from clumsy writing and characters. The characters remain sorely underdeveloped throughout the duration of the film, nor are they comprehensible; and the awkwardly cheesy dialogue, especially from Taylor Kitsch, does nothing to help. During the first ten minutes, we are treated with the main character (Kitsch) trying to win the heart of a girl played by Brooklyn Decker, by robbing a convenience store to steal a chicken burrito for her, only to busted by the cops. Apparently, these opening minutes are supposed to funny, but only ends being rather ridiculous, especially as a chicken burrito is adopted as a running joke for the rest of the flick. Liam Neeson who plays Admiral Terrance Shane is sadly underused And serves nothing more than a fill-in character. For nearly two and a half hours, the audience is treated with tense action sequences with intense naval warfare and countless explosions that play a great homage Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor, only less exciting. These action scenes would be fun if they weren't so repetitive and predictable to the point where they get tiring. The only thing redeeming about these poorly executed action sequences is the flashy visual effects. Other than that, the action as well as the plot falls short on development and in the end, lacks substance. Battleship is pretty disappointing movie. Not only does it suffer from a poorly written screenplay and characters, but the whole idea of the film is just badly executed. This just comes to show that board games are not good source material for film adaptions.",Battleship
76,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,Battleshit.,3,9 October 2012,"This is the most uninspiring movie to come out of Hollywood since Transformers: Dark of the Moon, Jack And Jill and The Twilight Saga. Need I say anymore about the film? Well, there is a plot to it, but it's so predictable that you can write down a list before seeing the movie if you wanted to. If it weren't for the spoilers policy on IMDb, I'd be able to tell you the plot because the movie's a recycled product.The script is one of the worst ever written for a $200 million + film. The dialogue is so dated you'll be wondering whether the scriptwriters wrote mediocre 80s - 90s television scripts and then wrote Battleship as their debut film script. Taylor Kitsch is the ""star"" of the film, the same actor who gave us John Carter, another leading role that couldn't help the movie from bombing.At least with John Carter they tried to put effort into the design of the film. Here, there's absolutely NO effort in anything. The designs were recycled from other movies and the aliens are the most ordinary looking aliens in a bid-budget ""epic"". I said epic sarcastically because there is no massive-scale drama between ANY of the characters, well, no drama that we cared for.This really is your typical Transformers story. A loser with no life is suddenly in the middle of a battle between good and evil, with the bad guys trying to get him. This is where the movie gets hilarious. It takes itself so seriously before the rushed introduction of Taylor Kitsch as the main character. The movie gets some points for making me laugh, but at the absurdity of the character, the actual movie and the situations and actions that the ""Battleships"" make throughout the film.Battleship is Hollywood's first big-budget B-Grade Movie. It has the campiness of Batman and Robin, the dialogue of Michael Bay's Transformers movies, the misused budget of Green Lantern, and the feel of the Transformers movies. It really is a guilty pleasure for me, but it is still an awful film. It's so awful that it's great.

Why? Well for starters, this brain-numbing excuse to see gigantic, and quite frankly awesome, ships in action, against aliens no less, went extremely well with my popcorn. Secondly... umm, no wait, there was no other reason. There's so much about this CGI-laden blockbuster that shouts ""horrible"" – from the one dimensional characters and the occasional bout of dubious acting (not from pop star Rhianna astonishingly enough, but I'm looking at you Brooklyn Decker and Alexander Skarsgard) to the plethora of gaping plot holes and the unintentionally laughable coming-out-of-retirement twist in the final act – yet the highly entertaining set-pieces, great soundtrack and charismatic turn from lead star Taylor Kitsch were enough to ensure this can comfortably be filed under 'guilty pleasure'.",Battleship

When Alex gets arrested, trying to impress the daughter of Admiral Shane, Stone makes him join the United States Navy. Seven years later, Alex is still a slacker but he must step up his game during the RIMPAC naval exercises. During the same time, five alien spaceships crash land in the sea.

In the end the story ends up like a sci-fi action with plenty of decent actors (aside from Rihanna lent to the movies industry for the first time). Director Peter Berg (Hancock, Friday Night Lights) pumps the volume on clashing military stuff.

Except this: Why in the heck did the filmmakers feel they had to throw in the stereotypical blonde actress with the ever bouncing chest-line that doesn't do a darn thing type in this? And the ending alien-human fight was just too ridiculous for words (and you wont be too surprised with the looks of the aliens, let me tell you. Very cheaply done). The filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves. The music isn't all that great either. It sounds like it too has been pieced together from several movies.

Like TRANSFORMERS, it is also based on a Hasbro property, this time a board game, and it is even less related to its source material than those movies were. Peter Berg is a competent director, but its clear here that he did this for the paycheck, as did a lot of the cast. Granted, the cast is pretty decent, but they could only do so much with the script they were given. As far as action goes, it delivers all of the physics-defying stunts and explosions you would expect from something of this ilk, but unlike Michael Bay, Peter Berg can actually direct a fairly competent action scene. This is what I'd call ""Michael Bay-lite,"" which is actually sort of a compliment. Tonally, it resembles what Michael Bay is famous for doing, but Berg dials back on the juvenile humor and exposition. Unfortunately, the flag-waving jingoism remains intact, as this movie is essentially a feature-length advertisement for the Navy and (to a lesser degree) the Air Force. The only reason I'm rating it as high as I have is because the movie somewhat redeems itself with a well-done third act.

The film pretty much suffers from every BSM flaw available, including a childish script, rudimentary characterizations, a risible premise backed with faux-to-no scientific veracity, and at least one brand-name actor squandered in a paycheck role (in this instance, Liam ""I'm often squandered in lead roles, too"" Neeson). Nonetheless, having had no positive expectations whatsoever, I enjoyed this foolish romp, as fine a piece of advertising for the U.S. Navy as I've seen anywhere.

Mess decks throughout the Navy echo with nonstop good humored banter and witty comments whenever this movie hits the flat-screens. As a retired Navy member and one who frequently works on warships (and I do still ride them), I can attest to the enthusiastic responses voiced by energetic sailors. Regretfully, the reactions are rarely positive, yet they never lack gusto. Personally, I thought it was kind of neat seeing one of our old battle wagons up on the screen – even if it was CGI generated. The pyrotechnics in this flick were pretty spectacular. Now movies like this really should never rely on any strong plot – and this movie fully embraces that strategy. And acting, who really needs acting in a flick like this? Descriptive words regarding their thespian skills might be: over-the-top, over acting, ham – well you get the drift. The script was obviously a living, breathing document struggling to walk the viewer through some fantasy world of good verses bad. Now it may seem that I have nothing good to say about this movie – but I do. This movie was put out there to strictly entertain, which it does. Granted, I cannot watch this movie by myself, but I do enjoy witnessing it with an energetic and enlightened group. The home-spun comedy this enterprise generates is priceless.",Battleship

But if it must be compared to Transformers 2, which it can quite easily, then this is a borderline masterpiece. First of all it has a sliver of a plot that can at least be followed without ever wanting to chew your own lips off to distract from the sheer awfulness. Then there's the overblown action that thankfully Michael Bay didn't direct so there is at least some enjoyment to be had from simply knowing what the hell is going on. There's also none of Bay's PG-13 pushing ogling of the female cast like a randy teenager, plus the fact that this may be over-long by about 50 minutes, but the running time is still under three weeks. With all that said though once this is put along-side a good film it's a poor watch, and I'm certain that I'll never watch it again as it's just yet another dull modern-day mutiplex filler with a goal of clawing cash and nothing really more.",Battleship

That says it all.This film is a load of cr*p. The acting is worse than the worst TV B movie trash. The lead actor is a joke; a blond bimbo is just as bad.Rihanna should stick to singing and Liam Neeson is a tw*t who is there to pick up a fat pay check.He is the same character in all his ham movie performances.Talk about getting millions for being dreadful.The only reason I give it one above the minimum is that somehow I was able to get to the end, plus a few half decent special effects.2/10",Battleship
88,jrarichards,Non-complex ... but totally irresistible,9,26 August 2018,"There is something outrageous about the idea that a game we kids used to play on bits of squared paper - but which is also patented as a plastic toy from a well-known company - might transmogrify into a vastly expensive and quite star-studied movie. The idea that that might attract full cooperation from the US Government and US Navy, as well as even navies from other countries (e.g. Japan) is weird, whacky or winsome, depending how you look at it. Obviously, there is more than a hint of ""recruiting drive"" about this 2012 movie from Peter Berg; but the highly pared-down storyline does find time to pay tribute to veterans both old or disabled, and that is a pithy touch that can never be unwelcome. The never-entirely-silenced debate about Navy ships old and new is also raised, as innovative use is made of both the USS Missouri (the titular ""Battleship"") and modern Arleigh Burke Class Destroyers (the ones also featuring in ""The Last Ship""). Though not original, there is visceral power in the idea of 5 or 6 personnel struggling to carry a shell from one end of a giant ship to the other - and a certain satisfaction that, force fields or ray guns notwithstanding, aliens encountering a shell weighing that much and sent sailing through the air at immense speed by simply vast guns are not going to know what has hit them!There is also a successful v failed brother story, a ""getting the girl"" plot (with Brooklyn Decker actually given quite a lot of worthwhile things to do here) and several messages about defence cooperation. But basically this a tale about the dangers of trying to contact alien intelligence, which then comes to visit and hides out in the sea (a la ""Kraken Wakes""). There's something fundamentally, indivisibly creepy about that idea (as John Wyndham understood), but the fact that the aliens here are obviously extremely high-tech (and the film is superbly lavish in this regard) does not change the fact that sailors on our planet know its seas and how to sail on them, and can sometimes turn that ever-treacherous environment into an ally in a fight against all the odds.For me, then, this is a simple sci-fi story told impressively, convincingly and at times touchingly. There are plenty of bangs for all those bucks and the characters do enough to encourage we out here in the audience to cheer them on, maybe even in spite of our cynical or sophisticated selves.Liam Neeson's crusty Admiral character is good enough; though there are more doubts about Taylor Kitsch's ability to portray the (somewhat Captain Kirk-like) ""tearaway kid finally coming good"" role. However, his character's interactions with Japanese Captain Nagata are interesting, and Tadanobu Asano has the necessary class to look convincing in the latter role. So, by the way, does real-life Col. Gregory Gadson more or less playing his own story as amputee Lt. Col. Mick Canales. This acting (yes really) performance is a real plus of the film, as - surprisingly - is the pairing of megastar Rihanna with Jesse Plemons as Raikes and Ord, who really look as if they were put on this earth to wear the USN uniform!There's nothing much unpredictable about ""Battleship"", but - if you at all buy into the idea that the Earth might one day be invaded by aliens - then this is a very competent, impressive and at times even (somewhat) thought-provoking take on that scenario.",Battleship
89,witster18,"Compare to ""Independence Day"". Did you like that?",5,29 September 2012,"It's definitely formulaic. Campy. Ridiculous. Poorly written.

""Battleship"" isn't a touching or brilliant piece, but it is surprisingly-solid entertainment.The writing is deplorable. Occasionally funny, but for the most part, deplorable.The actors aren't asked to do too much, but the casting went well and all the characters fit the story arc nicely.The story is mind-numbingly inconsistent(see Armegeddon), but the visual effects are so well-done that it keeps the audiences attention elsewhere.Think of the idea of ""Arrival""(but not as smart), the campy goodness and strong visuals of ""Independence Day""(with lesser actors), and a dash of NOT making fun of itself the way it should like ""Starship Troopers"".You'll watch this on cable a year or two down the road. Heck, you might even buy it from the 5 dollar bin at Walmart.(Don't do that - you'll be able to get it at a second-hand shop or pawnshop for a buck(well-spent mind you).Battleship is ultimately an enjoyable film that is the definition of ""a popcorn movie"".

92,jdkraus,This year's Transformers,8,8 June 2012,"""Battleship"" certainly poses itself as this year's ""Transformers"": big-ass explosions, blatant CGI, exaggerated slow motion, and hot chicks kicking butt. This movie is not for everyone, especially for the overly critical film critics who use academia as a means to justify what is a good or bad movie. ""Battleship"" is aimed towards the general audience that has both an open mind and a desire to be entertained. This feature excels in this department.The visual effects are so stunning, that they are enough to make James Cameron flush with envy. The action sequences are on epic proportions. They are not overbearing nor do they go on endlessly. In addition, both likable characters and a somewhat comprehensive plot are thrown into the mix to help keep the film going. Taylor Kitsch as the main protagonist Alex Hopper comes off as a cocky, Captain Kirk type of individual. He is humorous and hotheaded. Yet, when battleships are getting destroyed left and right, he is the man to take the fight to the enemy. Alexander Sarsgard may have been a better lead, for he conveys emotion well without going over the top. He particularly gives a subtle performance as Alex's steadfast brother. Nevertheless, Kitsch is solid enough to make the sci-fi adventure flow. Liam Neeson really fades into the background, but when he is on-camera, he maintains the power of being an imposing, authoritative figure. Even Alex Hopper knows to fear him. Rihanna and Brooklyn Decker present themselves as eye-candy for teenage boys, but their tough, no nonsense personalities say otherwise. The real genius in this flick though is Greg Dadson—a real-life amputee who served in the Iraq War. Dadson is a phenomenal example of the pride and energy that war veterans can still deliver outside of the military. No doubt both war veterans and general audience members will smile as he takes on an alien twice his size like Mike Tyson in the ring. In short, Battleship is truly an entertaining movie. Yes, there are quite a few clichés in the plot. Bits in the story could have been explored more and even the suspension of disbelief is pushed to the limit. You know what though, it does not cause too much damage to the film's message of pure action fun. ""Avatar"" did not have the best plot, yet it is one of the most visually, glamorous feats ever created! ""Battleship"" is not meant to be watched on a small TV set. It is meant for its awe in the theater. If you are going to see it, don't rent it. Go to the theater!",Battleship
93,Movie-Misfit,"Funny, Visually Stunning, Mindless Fun!",6,4 December 2014,"Let me lay this out first of all... I hate Hollywood movies that are just dripping of big army white boy testosterone, that smart talk, shout, fist pump and save the day in the most cliché of ways!The worlds mightiest superheroes, or so we are led to believe.I've been holding out on seeing Battleship for a couple of years now, mainly because it looks like a big pile of Michael Bay gunk, packed full of US army lads and Rihanna. Need I say anything else?But alas, as I work from home, I decided to stick it on in the background for some noise.The opening 15 minutes or so is genuinely pretty funny. Taylor Kitsch is kinda cute and cheekily charming, and his mission to get a burrito is one of the funniest things I've seen in a while!From here on in, its all typically Hollywood as we have come to know it. Fast talking, smart arsed, jocks and nerds with so much one liners its like a kid wrote the script. By the half hour mark though, the action has started with alien crafts landing at or hitting most of Hong Kong's most noticeable attractions, just so we know where they are in case the named subtitle didn't say it all...Liam Neeson is typically Neeson in action form, ranging from camp to hard man as the movie rolls on. Rihanna is, well, yeah. The rest of the cast is as expected with nothing special to mention.But this is a Hasbro toy action film. We shouldn't be nit-picking at silly wee things, and enjoying it for what it is. Mindless CGI action fun!And that's what it manages to be. The visuals are stunning, there is no denying that, and I guess in theory this is a sister movie to the Transformers collection... Some scenes take the action out of the water which I did not know, and adds to the madness of it all with more tension and great scenes.The scenes that represent the infamous game are slight, with few adding anything of a nod to it. Mind you, it is the last game I would have expected to see as a movie...Battleship is pure entertainment. Its not supposed to be anything else! Sure there is Hollywood cheese, there is complimentary rock songs, there is plenty of laughs, and there is stunning CGI.Give it a go and switch off the brain for a couple of hours... It's not so bad!",Battleship
94,Likes_Ninjas90,"It's disturbing to think that a major toy company like Hasbro, whose studio produced this film, has invested into what is essentially a propaganda movie",3,16 April 2012,"Based on the board game of the same name, Battleship opens with a washed up loser Alex Hopper (Taylor Kitsch) and his brother Stone (Alexander Skarsgard) sitting in a bar together. Alex spots a girl that he likes in Samantha (Brooklyn Decker) and is determined to impress her. He breaks into a store to steal a snack for her but is taken down by the police. Stone is already in the Navy and after this incident he insists that his brother is going to clean up his act and join him. Meanwhile, NASA is sending out satellite signals to detect whether there is life to be found in outer space. Sometime after Alex's mistake, he is not only in the Navy with his brother but he is also dating Samantha. She is pressuring him to talk to her father Admiral Shane (Liam Neeson) and ask for his permission to marry her. This is interrupted when alien crafts appear out of nowhere and start attacking the Earth. It's left to the Navy to try and stop these alien ships and for Alex to live up to his potential. Battleship is here to recruit you. It's disturbing to think that a major toy company like Hasbro, whose studio produced this film, has invested into what is essentially a propaganda movie. Hasbro's involvement comes as Hollywood looks to increasingly commoditise its industry by adapting toys into films, rather than seeking to develop new ideas. I've done my very best to avoid all of the Transformers movies so far (also backed by Hasbro) but seeing the moronic Battleship, which shares very little in common with its board game counterpart, reveals a willingness to aim pro-military messages shamelessly at 'Little Johnny'. Not unlike Battle: LA from last year, the level of patriotism and flag waving is laughable. The film would like you to believe that if the disabled, the elderly and dim-witted can save the world so can you. It's a mixture of embarrassing clichés and fantasy. Why is it that in movies as dopey as this a character with titanium legs must fight or run again? Isn't it enough that the veterans of combat have served their time and put their bodies on the line? Even more cringing is that after a defeat Alex and his men resort to using an old battleship and out of nowhere a group of old seamen appear to help them man the vessel. Where did they come from? It reminded me of a Monty Python short film called 'The Crimson Permanent Assurance', where a group of old men take over an insurance company designed like a pirate ship. This wasn't meant to be funny but I still laughed. Equally condescending is that despite Alex breaking and entering, damaging property and evading arrest, he is still able to date a model and be promoted in the Navy. I find that even more ludicrous than our extraterrestrial invaders. Everything in this movie is designed to appeal to young boys and its messages are to me cynical and irresponsible. I respect that there are a lot of hardworking people in the Navy and its emotional toll in being separated from their families would be devastating. Yet current and former servicemen would have a hard time keeping a straight face watching this because there is no reality. There's none of the isolation, bullying or intensity that occurs at sea. Instead, the film sights are set low. Ultra low. Alex's story is really just two bookends at the beginning and end of the film. The rest of the film is deliberately comprised of monotonous action and even at that level it's a colossal failure. Some will argue for the quality of the special effects. What does it matter though when all of the sequences are so indistinguishable from one another? Set pieces are fine so long as they progress the story rather than become a substitute for it. The action is bloodless, repetitive and purposeless, leaving huge gaps in the story. The jump between Alex's crime and naval career is so large I wondered whether I was watching the same character. The rest of the characters are dispensable and under-written too. Brooklyn Decker and pop singer Rihanna seem to have been cast by a marketing committee rather than for their acting abilities. While Liam Neeson is under strict guidelines that say he must play nothing else but that angry admiral who barks orders at people and doesn't think anyone is good enough for his daughter. If Decker is twenty-six in real life and her character is an established physiotherapist isn't she a little old to be asking daddy's permission to get married? The cast can do little with slabs of boring exposition and unimaginative lines (""Hit 'em with all we've got!"") that are a substitute for adult conversations and dialogue. Also, if the aliens are intent on blowing up the ships with men on them, why do they bother using their special vision to scan humans and spare some of them? The aliens are mostly unseen but when they are visible they're laughably bad. Their design is straight from the video game Halo, which reiterates the focus of this movie: young boys who I sincerely hope know better. Dismissed!",Battleship
95,Christian_Dimartino,It turns into a chore after a while.,5,9 October 2012,"Since Independence Day's 1995 release, it has been remade in more ways than one. Last year's Battle: LA being the perfect example. Earlier this year, another came out, called Battleship, and though not on any level of awfulness as Battle:LA, not only does it rip off of Independence Day, but it also has chunks of Armageddon, Transformers, and other disaster movies.The humans are the strongest point of the film. Here, we have two Navy brothers(played by Alexander Skarsgaard and Taylor Kitsch), their Navy boss(Liam Neeson), and his daughter and Kitsch's fiancé, played by babe fest Brooklyn Decker. The moments with them are the most enjoyable. Throw Rihanna of all people, mainly showing up as eye candy, into the mix, and honestly, she doesn't get to do much here, which is fine, because she's not an actress.All of these people, and these people only, are now left to save mankind from these aliens that have crashed in Hawaii. Why are they here? Probably to destroy the earth, it's not exactly explained. Did they crash anywhere else? I don't know. Why did they crash in the water? I DON'T KNOW.I enjoyed the first half an hour. Maybe even forty five minutes. But after that, it pretty much all goes out the window. Explosion after explosion after explosion after explosion, the film turns into a chore for at least an hour and ten minutes. But then it's good again in its last five. Though the climax feels hurried and tedious. Also, the good actors, like Skarsgaard and Neeson, don't get to do anything. You can't put Liam Neeson in a movie and not let him do anything.Battleship isn't the worst movie i've seen this year, but it is definitely one of the most uninspired. Kudos to that first forty five minutes and last half five, and it's special effects are decent, but the rest is a snore.C+",Battleship
96,qormi,Are There No Standards Anymore?,1,23 February 2013,"This film broke new ground in mindless, irrational, dumb entertainment. The space aliens fail due to hesitation. A grizzly bear-sized alien in high tech armor is face-to-face with puny humans on several occasions. They throw the humans to the ground (of course, they get up unscathed) and watch the puny humans run away. They are face-to-face with a puny, technologically inferior 70-year-old battleship. They hesitate and wait for the battleship to strike first instead of obliterating it. We have incredible plot holes like: By dropping anchor, a thousand-ton battleship will swerve on a dime (actually, it would take about half an hour). A disabled man who walks with a cane and has artificial legs and a huge stomach can beat up a grizzly bear-size alien in full high tech armor. A geeky guy can hit a grizzly bear-sized alien in high tech armor with a brief case and beat him up. We see giant square blocks with 100 rocket launchers pop up on alien battleships, yet they only fire one or two at a time. The USS Missouri, which is a floating museum, is occupied by a dozen 90-year-old WW2 vets, who quickly spring into action instead of suffering massive heart attacks and strokes. The afore-mentioned 70-year-old battleship was fully equipped with live rounds of ammo. The United States Military was too stupid to attack the alien battleships with aircraft, as they did to the Japanese Navy in WW2. This film was the worst kind of garbage imaginable. It ranks up there with Battle: Los Angeles as the worst alien invasion film of all time.On the plus side, I liked those alien buzz-saw bombs that wrecked the ship, but that's it.

98,Laakbaar,Solid entertainment,8,29 April 2012,"I went into this movie without knowing a thing about it. I had seen a trailer or two, but that was it.And I loved it.First, it was set in Hawaii and these beautiful islands played a major role in the film. I can't get enough of that.Second, the American navy played a major in this film as well. Also a huge plus.Third, I thought the aliens this time around were truly frightening. It's nice to see American military technology, currently the best in the world, look like nothing more than kids with a slingshot. Sure it wasn't original I suppose, but it didn't matter: I just enjoyed the awesomeness of the alien technology. I was worried that its similarity to the Transformers would turn me off. But this movie is not like that.Fourth, I am rapidly becoming a fan of Taylor Kitsch. I enjoyed seeing him in John Carter too. He was perfectly cast as the ""impulsive bad boy navy officer on the edge of getting kicked out and yet proving to be a hero"". Lots of character development here. Young, killer smile, great body. He made the movie for me. I think I've reached the point where I'll go to a film just because he's in it.Fifth, the movie was fast paced and the dialogue well written. I enjoyed the wise-cracking Ordy and nervous Cal characters in particular.OK, I was a little jarred when Hopper decided to join the alien chase on the ship himself, after command had fallen to him. Military commanders don't do this. At this point the movie moved to a less realistic level for me. But hey it's a film about super powerful aliens. How much realism can there be? I rationalised it as necessary when there were so few still alive.And when they brought out the ship at the end (without giving away the details).... Well, the movie was going in a strange direction and a corny ending. I went along for the ride and it worked for me.I apparently don't care whether a movie has a corny ending or a plot hole or two. Nor do I need the science to be solid. What I do want is solid entertainment. And this movie delivered that to me. I'm tempted to give it a 9, but I suppose a high 8 is about right.",Battleship

100,TheSquiss,"This is what a $200m noisy, predictable, badly acted, ill-written turkey looks like.",2,17 June 2012,"Where to begin? Hmmmm. Shall we start at the end? Battleship was, alas, another film that warranted a protest walkout before the credits. This is becoming too much of a habit for my liking. Hopefully it will bomb in a similar way to John Carter and the Hollywood studios will realize that big budgets (approximately $200m in this case) and huge effects don't necessarily equate to quality or big returns and make plot-driven films again instead. To put it into perspective, Battleship needs to take twice the budget just to break even. The studio will be looking at a return of half a billion dollars to make it a worthy investment! The big question has to be 'Why?' Not 'Why did I see it?', (pure curiosity) but 'Why did Hasbro think it was a good idea to turn their game into a film that has little in common with it?' The Battleships in my games cupboard just has red and white pegs with nary a hint of extraterrestrial invaders.Simply, Battleship is a ludicrously bad film. While it starts out trying to be a comedy (an inept, slapstick burglary to the strains of The Pink Panther theme) it becomes unintentionally funny when it attempts to be a sincere adventure/sci-fi/action/thriller but instead evolves into a chaotic mess.There are enough positive aspects to elevate it to two stars, namely the presence of Liam Neeson (who phones in his performance and evidently needs to pay the rent) and some fun effects and CGI.On the flip side, there are sufficient low points to make this a two thousand word rant, but I'll restrain myself. Have some bullet points instead  PLOT SPOILER: It's formulaic and entirely predictable. To wit, super duper intelligent aliens with amazing machines drop in on Earth but somehow the weak humans, American humans, save the day with some Sellotape and a cardboard box. Really?  It's riddled with clichés: Satellite dishes that fire HUGE lasers into the sky instead of invisible information; big brother navy bod who turns unruly brother around; unruly brother who resists authority but saves the day by taking command; unruly brother who falls in love with beautiful girl who just happens to be the daughter of big, bad, navy demigod Admiral; two rivals who join forces (Japanese & American navies in Pearl Harbour, unruly brother and Japanese captain); aliens that are ultimately stupid enough to be beaten by a crashed car and sunlight etc. etc. At Earth's greatest moment of need, where is the President? He, Obama, appears briefly on a screen in Times Square but leaves the fate of America and the world to his Chief of Staff. For that matter, where are the other world leaders? Oh, I forgot; America is the world. How can the couple on the island not notice the bloody great explosions and mayhem that's happening out to see around them?  Why do the aliens need a separate communications ship, why couldn't they go around the satellite (or obliterate it) rather than crashing into it, what exactly do they want, why are they trying to summon more ships when they could have brought more than five in the first place and wiped us out in an hour, why do they allow individual humans to live but wipe out buildings, roads, cars, ships etc. thus killing hundreds at a time, why are they so stupid as to fall for the old 'let's look in the other direction and then kill them' trick?  Why are such sophisticated alien ships and machines so noisy? Surely they'd have discovered oil and eliminated such grinding. Why is the knackered old museum battleship fully fuelled, fully working and fully armed? Why are the crusty old sailors in uniform (no, NOT ceremonial uniform but working uniform)?  Is it really all about getting the girl at the end?  Why, for TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS, is it not possible to find a writer who can write convincing dialogue and actors who can act??? Why, oh why, was it such a loud and dreadful mess? Another film review from The Squiss. For more reviews from The Squiss subscribe to my blog at www.thesquiss.co.uk",Battleship

I like alien invasion movies and I like the classic board game Battleship... so what is not to like... right?Nothing was very spectacular in this film. The fighting/war sequences were OK... nothing really happened that made me think it was amazing or put me on the edge of my seat. The characters were not overly likable. I didn't hate the characters, but it was not like I was cheering for them through the movie.I loved the aliens. I thought the looked really good. They had this armour on which made them look like cyborgs, but underneath they were kind of human looking with weird eyes and hands. They also had these awesome looking beard things that were really strong. I think the aliens in this movie is what carried it along.The cast was alright i suppose... but the acting was really not great. The movie stars Taylor Kitsch. He did OK most of the time, but there were moments where he was not very believable. It also stars Alexander Skarsgard. He did well. I thought he was convincing. Also we have Rihanna, Brooklyn Decker and Liam Neeson. Brooklyn was very good... possibly the best actress among the cast and Liam Neeson was also alright... but it was not his best role by far. Rihanna... oh dear. I think she should stick to singing. I don't like her music very much, but it is far better than her acting. I am sorry for all you Rihanna fans out there, but if you have seen the film, I am sure you know what I mean.The effects were good, and there were some good moments but all in all, pretty disappointing.I will give this film 5 out of 10.It is such a shame... it had all the tools to be good, but just didn't manage it.For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=tn_tnmn",Battleship
102,Al_The_Strange,"""Battleship"" Review",6,23 August 2012,"Understanding that this is based on the Hasbro board game ""Battleship,"" and these are the same people who graced the cinematic landscape with all those ""Transformers"" films, it would take very little intuition to realize that the film ""Battleship"" is not going to be all about serious storytelling or cinematic craftsmanship. At first glance, it looks stupid, and most folks will agree that it is as stupid as it looks. Just another uninspired alien invasion story, based on the standard and hollow formula of spectacle and style over substance for an instant cash grab. And to think so would be correct; you know what you get with ""Battleship,"" and it's like cinematic junk food.But, heck, I enjoy junk food now and then. As anticipated, ""Battleship"" heaps on the cinematic calories with massive, potentially unhealthy doses of incredible special effects, explosive mass destruction, and huge sea battles. The action is quite impressive and well-filmed; combined with some humor, the film succeeds at being an entertaining and eye-catching thrill ride. Above all, this film has a tone and style that never takes itself more seriously than it should. There's no pretension here; the film knows it's junk food, and never strives to be anything more. In spite of that, the film remains a fun, upbeat, and lighthearted adventure.Now, for the negative criticism: the story is marginal at best. It has just enough substance to service the action, and just enough characterization to understand who the heroes are. However, the main hero proves to be a total jerkwad for the first half of the movie; he acts to arrogantly and aggressively that it's impossible to believe that he could be an actual naval officer. The assumption is that the character endures some change by the end, beefing himself up internally to rise as a proper military leader with discipline and teamwork abilities (which would be very befitting of a film with a cast of military characters), but this change is purely contrived. That's pretty much my sole complaint; the problem is that the film is so light and thin that the audience can easily point out the stupidity of the characters, situations, and concepts. If you don't get hung up on such things, then you can sit back and just enjoy the onslaught of explosions and sea battles. Otherwise, you'll be in for a miserable ride.The film looks really nice, with lots of slick photography and quality editing. Acting and writing are marginal at best; Taylor Kitsch plays a rather unlikable hero, while the talents of Liam Neeson, Alexander Skarsgard, and Rihanna are thrown into the pot for added star power, and little more. Many of the film's lines are pretty dumb. However, this production spares no expense on the lavish sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music is nice; Steve Jablonsky formulates a standard, high-impact music score, while lots of rock music is thrown in for the occasional feel-good sensibility.Like I said, you can probably deduce whether you'll like it or not just from the film's title, trailers, posters, etc. It's a fine romp of an alien invasion film, but if you're wanting more to it, then you're setting yourself up for disappointment. If you aren't sure, then you better give it a rent and see for yourself. It comes more highly recommended to those audiences who can turn off their brains for a while and gape in awe at the massive 'splosions and the pretty alien ships.3/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Poor | Film: Marginal)",Battleship
103,blackmamba99971,Can you say Hasbro?,10,2 May 2012,"I thought this was an excellent way to explain how battleship works. For one, I like the fact that an alien aversion was to be the unexpected twist in a war game between many countries who get together to show off their skills at sea. Alex Hopper (Taylor Kitsch), a bumbling idiot who never advances beyond the beer bottle or getting into trouble finally is put to the test by his older brother Stone Hopper (Alexander SKarsgard) when he enlists Alex to duty. Now a few years later during the engagement of the war games, a mysterious alien race replies to a signal sent from earth and lands in the ocean decides it is time to take over the planet. Except they did not count on Alex to completely put a dent into their plans. Using a large array on Honalulu, the aliens try to send a trace signal to their home world for reinforcements. But in the midst of this calamity, Alex and his motley crew of misfits, work together with a Japanese Captain Nagata (Tadanobu Asano) who help in finding a way to defeat their foes. With another crew of the past. Now armed on the USS Missouri (WWII-Battleship) they succeed in foiling the aliens plans for world domination. I like the fact that using Tsunami Bouys to pinpoint the aliens location is a symmetrical strategy like the board game. This was a great movie, lots of good effects, some good laughs, and a few heart wrenches thrown in during a loss of comrades. This is much better than the last summer movie called Battle for L.A. Liam Neeson who stars as an admiral was a bit short lived, but his persona always makes me smile what ever he plays in. And last but not least, Rhianna. Who stars as a weapons specialist makes her big debut, and is already on the rise as being a good movie actor. All in all, a wonderful display of friendships, old and new working together, and how to kick alien ass when ever the occasion arises. Highly recommended.",Battleship

105,LloydBayer,An expensive illustration on how to fire blanks.,5,21 April 2012,"Summer is still a whole month away, so do not be fooled into thinking this movie to be the 2012 summer-movie launch vehicle. In my modest opinion it could have been. As a matter of fact, it could have been a lot of things besides an official summer opener. How about 'first major action movie of 2012'? Or first true alien action epic after ""Independence Day"" (actually, that honor may well rest with ""District 9""). Or perhaps Peter Berg's entry into the top ten list of action movie directors. Sadly, it is none of these. The way I see it, Berg along with toy enterprise Hasbro, have sunk their own ship even before it reaches the open ocean.Based on the children's board game of the same name, American and Japanese naval forces investigate the presence of extraterrestrial ships off the coast of Hawaii. An attempt to establish contact goes awry with American destroyers USS Sampson obliterated and the USS John Paul Jones crippled and almost wrecked. Before Lieutenant Alex Hopper (Taylor Kitsch) can reassemble a retaliatory team, his girlfriend Samantha Shane (Brooklyn Decker) learns that ET has taken over the NASA communications array with intentions of signaling home for reinforcements. In a last ditch attempt, Hopper reactivates the decommissioned USS Missouri – a battleship museum – for an all out confrontation with the last but impenetrable alien warship.By its very nature, a sci-fi movie requires its intended audience to suspend reality. That said, there is a huge difference between convincing the audience and making said audience feel stupid. Using the cliché that ""anything is possible in an action movie"", filmmakers here have stuck by every word of that very phrase and have literally gone overboard. Judging from his previous films, Peter Berg is a tour-de-force action movie director with a proved panache for illustrating intense battle sequences. So what went wrong here? Almost everything, from corny one-liners to over indulgence in pop, boom and bang, again and again and again. I have no complaint when it comes to the visuals and art design. However, my two main problems are the severely underwritten screenplay and the repetitive nature of punctuating almost every action frame with stupendous explosions; it's like Peter Berg telling Michael Bay ""so you think you can do explosions, wait till you see my bottomless can of explosives!"" With heavy emphasis on action, there is evidently no focus given on character development, hence don't even expect anything remotely close to decent portrayals. As Admiral Shane and Samantha's father, Liam Neeson is the only saving grace but gets sidelined with restricted screen time. R&B artist Rihanna debuts in her first film role but fails to impress as a weapons specialist. Given the amount of clichés in this movie, Michelle Rodriguez would have been the perfect choice instead of Rihanna, even if her roles are becoming repetitive. Playing the leads, Kitsch is no better than his uninspiring role in ""John Carter"", while Decker suffices as pure eye-candy. Playing Kitsch's elder brother and disciplined naval officer, Alexander Skarsgård adds some integrity to the whole 'save-the-world-from-annihilation' premise, buts soon learns never to throw stones at ET. If these roles were reversed, there just might have been a decent effort in the acting department.Well, no point crying over split milk and ill-gotten chicken burritos as there were early warning signs of this impending disaster. What can you really expect when a multinational toy and board-game company decides to breathe life into its products and then blow it all up on screen. We have seen this before through the ""Transformers"" trilogy and ""G. I Joe: The Rise of Cobra"". Yet somehow we keep going back for more. Perhaps it's a fragment of a deeply embedded piece of memory, taking us back to a juvenile state of imagination when bashing two die-cast toy cars together awakened a sense of fantasy. Even so, tell-tale signs in this movie keep pointing towards its biggest flaw – severe lack of originality. It's no surprise then, when right from the beginning, we are told to expect something along the lines behind the making of the ""Transformers"" franchise. At face value, this is exactly what you get – US forces trading punches with what seems like marine 'Decepticons'. For all the in-built guns, bombs and artillery barrage, ""Battleship"" is a cross-eyed miss on all its targets. Personally, I don't expect it to be awarded with anything less than the 'Best of the worst action movies of 2012'. Watch it at the risk of wasting your time and money, but carry a pair of ear plugs.",Battleship
106,xamtaro,ShipShape from Stem to Stern,7,30 April 2012,"You know those ""Megashark"" and ""Supergator"" shows that involve some naval vessel against an unstoppable giant threat to mankind? Battleship would have been like that. Even Steve Jablonsky's score sounds closer to his horror movie work in Friday the 13th and less like a blockbuster like Transformers. Seriously? A movie based on a board game? No story exists so the producers decide to rip off a syfy made-for-TV plot. And this is exactly what this could have been without it's financial backing, director Peter Berg's vision and an honest sense of humor about its source material.In past movies, large scale Alien invasions have always fought on land (Battle Los Angeles) or in the air (Skyline). Now ""Battleship"" takes the familiar alien invasion scenario to the sea. The mandatory excuse of a story sees slacker Alex Hopper ""drafted"" into the navy by his brother after a disastrous attempt at wooing some girl. Turns out the girl is the daughter of Vice Admiral Shane! Hopper decides to enroll in the navy along side his brother. Fast forward a few years to 2012 and the annual ""RIMPAC"" joint naval exercise. Alex picks this time to try and ask the Admiral for his daughter's hand in marriage but winds up in a brawl with a Japanese Captain and on the verge of being dishonorably discharged from service. Not to mention earning the eternal hatred of the Admiral. Life could not get any worse, UNTIL ALIENS ATTACK! Four gargantuan ships, drawn by a powerful relay signal, crash into the waters near Oahu and proceed to deploy an impenetrable shield around the area. Only three ships are caught within the shield and thus able to help the trapped island. One of those ships happens to be captained by Stone Hopper with Alex Hopper as tactical officer. There is something on the island that the aliens are after. Standing between them and their goals is the crew of three naval warships. Let the battle commence!Yes this is not a very thinking heavy movie. It is all humor, badass one-liners, eye candy and explosive thrills which manages to bring in some subtle drama. For Stone Hopper, it is a simple tale of a boy becoming a man and accepting great responsibility in the face of great adversity. Now Those expecting something on the scale of ""Independence Day"" would be sorely disappointed. The trailer made it seem as if the entire combined fleet would go up against an alien armada. There is a reason why the title is ""Battleship""(singular) and not ""BattleshipS"" or ""Battle Fleet"". But If it is one thing the movie manages to capture, it is the sense of fun of playing the game.They even managed to have one very clever scene, involving the uselessness of the ship's on board radar, that mimics the strategic guessing that one usually uses in the actual boardgame. Comparisons to Michael Bay's Transformers are entirely unfounded and unfair because Peter Berg does action A LOT BETTER. His camerwork is clear, keeping the typical shaky cam shots to a minimum. The result is a truly thrilling movie with wanton destruction in all its computer generated glory. Berg also has a better grasp of comedic timing.. He does not stoop to the dirty frat boy humor of Michael Bay, choosing instead to have genuinely funny moments that do not feel forced.To crown it off is an underlying moral concerning a soldier's purpose illustrated through the side character of Col Mick, a double amputee grappling with his inadequacy as a soldier. It is also a tribute to the war veterans as seen in a climatic moment of awesome where old Navy men rise to the occasion and do their part against the aliens. Moral of the story: Soldiers may retire, but their will to defend their country will never die.So are we looking at the next extraterrestrial based franchise?. The answer is, highly unlikely. Unlike stuff such as Ridley Scott's Alien, Dan OBannon's Predator or even Independence Day, Battleship's Aliens are just not interesting enough. They are your typical ""Destroy your world"" type of aliens from the 1950s science fiction who look like lizard eyed baboons with porcupine quills for beards. Their suits look like a bad ripoff from the Halo and Bioshock video games and their ships, though powerful, have fatal design flaws (which the protagonists eventually discover and use against them).Detractors can compare this to an Overblown Navy recruitment video. It sure makes working on a naval vessel seem like the most badass thing in the world. Will it not be surprising to find that navy applicants numbers skyrocket in the days surrounding the film's release? Do not, however, expect realistic tactics or even physics as you see an old museum ship make hairpin turns by quickly sinking an anchor or a Destroyer going from full speed ahead, to a dead stop and full reverse within a matter of seconds. Best let the brain just float away and sink yourself into this highly entertaining summer blockbuster.",Battleship
107,kdnor2011,The Unnofficial Transformers 4,6,21 April 2012,"2011 gave us a whole lot of alien movie didn't it, but unfortunately, the only two really good ones I saw were Super 8, and Transformes 3. Apollo 18 was OK, but disappointing, and the rest sucked: Battle LA, Paul, Cowboys and Aliens, and the Darkest Hour. And Green Lantern and the Thing looked so uninteresting that I didn't bother to watch them. Why am I saying this? Because I want you to know that I went into this movie just hoping that this would be a somewhat descent alien movie.Battleship is pretty much Transformers 4 with ships and big UFO's. Now I didn't enjoy this movie as much as Transfomers, or Transformers 3, but there were some parts that I actually enjoyed. The one thing I was afraid of before seeing this film, was that I thought they would try and take it too seriously. This is a film based on a board game, it shouldn't take itself seriously. Thankfully it isn't a completely straight film, there is quite a bit of humor, and you know what, I thought it was kind of funny.However the best thing about the film is the special effects, they are the reason this film was made.Now this movie isn't great, I didn't love it, as you can see by the rating I gave it. Most problems come from the fact that the characters are just so forgettable. I liked Rihanna, mostly just because she was Rihanna, and the comic relief guy was pretty funny, but that was about it. And Hopper's brother was completely pointless. And despite what I said earlier, the film does have moments where it takes itself too seriously. Say what you will about the Transformers movies, but they always knew they were cheesy. Also Liam Neeson is barely in it.Battleship wasn't great, and I guess it may even be a pretty bad film as far as scripting goes. But while watching it, I at least was interested in what was going on. Yes most of the characters were forgettable, but at least I could tell the difference between them, unlike Battle LA. I laughed more than in Paul. It mixed War and sci-fi better than Cowboys and Aliens. And it didn't bore me 70% of the time like Darkest Hour.Let me put it this way. If you hate all three Transformers movies, you are going to hate this movie. If you like at least one of the Transformers movies, you MAY like this film, or like me just think it's OK.It ain't great, but this and John Carter might be bringing back alien movies after Skyline ruined them.",Battleship
108,HelenMary,"Entertaining, not as bad as I expected - exemplary SFX",6,1 September 2013,"A few things drew me to this film; mainly men in uniform and especially Skarsgard in a uniform. I like military films, and a good alien invasion film is usually great entertainment. Correction, if it's done well. This was.Excessive SFX/CGI often leaves me cold, bored and disinterested as its obvious and flawed or too prolific as to be tiresome. However, the SFX in this - the alien technology and ships were believable and realistic, I didn't once think ""Oh goodness, annoying CGI."" It was really impressive. The SFX actually were the best part of the film, except the Naval eye-candy, as the script and storyline were pretty weak. Actually, the script was poor, and even Skarsgard and Neeson couldn't raise the bar or the standard. I think many of the 'actors' didn't seem to be actual actors; the veterans of the Missouri, and the injured Army retiree for example, and Rihanna is a singer and actually did a pretty good turn as a sailor. The funniest lines were from the satellite scientist - it was welcome relief in otherwise flat performances. Taylor Kitsch was good, plucky and physical, in the lead but not particularly memorable - he did and that was it, really. Tadanobu Asano playing Japanese Captain Nagata was very good.Whilst it's never going to win awards for superior overall cinematography it was entertaining, engrossing and I enjoyed watching it. There wasn't much plot but it was good fun and worth the view on DVD. No doubt the SFX were even better on a big screen but DVD was sufficient. I'd like to give it 5 for it's content - the script was shockingly bad in the main (trying to be Independence Day but falling short), but for entertainment value it gets the 6.",Battleship
109,kgprophet,Worse than Michael Bay,4,18 May 2012,"I read in reviews that Peter Berg was using the Michael Bay playbook of quick cuts, corny dialogue, and bombastic themes with bombastic theme music. I entered the theatre with a summer popcorn movie state of mind, I still couldn't believe how uninspiring the material was. The only real way to declare this movie watchable is if you are 13 years old or younger. Worse, the latest Transformers movie by Michael Bay was an improvement (slower cutting pace, less crass sitcom subplots). So Mr. Berg fails even at the Michael Bay playbook since it is now even outdated by Mr. Bay himself. My guess is that so many ideas that only sorta worked were tossed at this idea that never should have been green lit (although it has already recouped it's budget overseas so go figure). It reminds me of the ill conceived aliens in the movie ""Signs"". If the central premise has basic flaws, you either go back to the drawing board or scrap the idea altogether. In this case there are some inconsistencies that happen often enough that you get the idea that the scriptwriters didn't even really care to make things slightly original or human. And if they don't care, why should the audience care? Here are some examples:** Spoilers Ahead **-How about thisthe title of the movie is ""Battleship"", yet no battleships have been in service for decades. Several specific story elements have to be concocted to make the battleship that is now a museum relevant at all. -The big opening shows how the transmitters are sending a communication signal out into space. Last I saw, radio waves are invisible, not a glowing orange death ray. -The scouting party that heads toward the anomaly in the water. Nobody is wearing their life vest. Even after Hopper steps out of the boat into the water! -Liam Neeson looks nice in a naval uniform, but he is barely in this movie. Why is he even featured in the trailers? -Along with the cameo by Mr. Neeson, we are taken into the depths of the Pentagon war room. Tense scenes of deliberations are shown.which have absolutely no weight because they are powerless to do anything. -The initial attack by the destroyers toward the big alien watercraft - they declare they don't have any weapons. They are destroyers armed with guided missiles, plenty of weapons. -The aliens blow up the ships filled with thousands of men, but won't kill any human who they confront, even if they are about to hit the button to destroy them. Why why why? -The big announcement is made with big fanfare (dozens of TV cameras and reporters) about the discovery of Planet G, a place that likely hosts life. Yet, when the aliens invade, a major character contemplates ""Where did they come from?"" with the equally stupefying reply ""Nobody knows"". PLANET G!!! Duh!!! -The line ""I've got a bad feeling about this"" is uttered in this movie. -The stranded couple on the mountain. The police come by to tell them to get off the mountain. Of course, it didn't enter anyone's mind that they could have hitched a ride in the pair of vehicles they were driving. -The stranded couple on the mountain are supposed to get off the mountain, but now go the other way to fight the aliens. But then leave again. Same with the badly drawn nerd who stays, goes, stays, depending what reel it is. -The whole ""E4"" ""Miss"" ""C6"" ""Hit"" part of the game that the movie is based on, is also explained with a bit of nonsense about tsunami wave buoy detectors that I guess are plotted every couple miles or so throughout the thousands of square miles in the Pacific ocean. The alien ships nonetheless aim directly toward the buoys as they move aroundhuh? ***End Spoilers***I won't even go into the ear splitting dialogue that has connect-the-dots exposition that seems more than dumbed down. Hopper is a screw-up, but a damn brilliant screw-up. Did you get that? Yes? How about a few more scenes to make sure you get the point. Did you get that now? The other support players were all too shallow to get attached to. Even Michael Bay could toss together a few lines (usually improvised) that were cute enough to get by. Not here. Same goes for the rivalry between a Japanese naval officer and Hopper. They are rivals, get it? Few more scenes? How about a bunch of scars on their faces for the duration of the movie to make sure you remember? What about the effects? ILM always comes through, they probably handled the big alien waterships. Cool looking they are, but was kind of obvious CGI. I particularly liked these spinning spiked metal balls that acted like a cyborg Tasmanian Devil. I liked that the aliens were not too unlike humans (could be the bouncer at your local bar), which matched the origin story. The technology also was similar to Earth technology. This was one of the few things the script didn't cheat on during the course of the film. I can't recommend this film even on the lizard-brain level that this misguided tentpole feature is built for. One problem is that ""Avengers"" was released a couple weeks before this, and most people seem to agree that it raised the bar on big CGI extravaganzas. Since this is at best a mediocre ""Transformers"" wanna-be, it will only come off as lackluster in the summer movie sweepstakes. One thing that the critics also mention is the very conspicuous presence of the U.S. Navy in this movie. Again this follows the Michael Bay formula, and certainly no one knocks the sacrifices made in real life by the men and women in uniform. I am not sure if a sequel is guaranteed at this point, but at least this battleship pays homage to a bygone era.",Battleship
110,nickmesafilms,Battleship (2012) - This Movie Just Sunk My Battleship...And My Sanity!,4,2 September 2012,"Why does Hollywood keep releasing movies based on almost every Hasbro board game? You do realize I had to sit through Michael Bay's Transformer movies, so do you really think that a Battleship movie was a good idea? What's next? A hospital drama called ""Operation""? A family film called ""Candy Land""? A Terrence Malick film called ""Rubix Cube""? Geez! ""Battleship"" is a ridiculous, mindless, and unwatchable motion picture, but knock yourself out if you're interested in these type of movies. ""Battleship"" stars Taylor Kitsch as a Navy pilot whose team discovers an unidentified object in the ocean, and it turns out to be a sign of an alien invasion. That's it! Afterwards, it's just an alien invasion! But to make some positive remarks, ""Battleship"" is a lot better than ""Transformers"". Director Peter Berg is a better version of Michael Bay, as he makes the audience able to understand what's going on in a simple action scene, and keeps the limit of explosions to a minimum, to try and not have it invade the entire running time. Also, the visual effects were actually pretty impressive, since the effects team were the only people involved in this movie who were actually trying. But, now let's get a little mean. This movie is a mindless and inexplicable hit that's entirely unwatchable. Almost every single character is completely ridiculous, having either little or no brain cells. As for the acting, Taylor Kitsch is one of the biggest unlikeable characters ever seen on screen, Brooklyn Decker was just there to look cute (Not that I'm complaining), Liam Neeson overacts big time, Alexander Skarsgard was annoying, and Rihanna delivers one of the most bland and atrocious performances ever seen on the big screen. As for the script, there's a lot of dialouge that was totally corny, that it even left me cringing at times. The storyline was uninteresting, some moments were laughably bad, and there are plot-holes that got me so upset. But the one plot-hole that got me on my nerves the most: this movie never explains why the aliens are invading Earth. That just defeats the whole point of a sci-fi action film. Honestly, I rather sit through a mediocre romantic comedy, than sit through a mindless action movie. ""Battleship"" actually has some similarities to the board game: it's boring, it's pointless, and it's just plain time- wasting. This is one of the worst movies of the year. ""Battleship"", in my review, ""mindless and tasteless, but improving"".",Battleship
111,jhpstrydom,Good movie if you don't take the plot too seriously.,7,4 August 2013,"BATTLESHIP is really one of those films you can't take too seriously when you watch it. Clearly the acting isn't that great and obviously Liam Neeson was just picking up a paycheck or he probably did this film just for fun but if you want something to kill time with and your a special effects buff then BATTLESHIP would be highly recommended. There's plenty of action and there's also a bit of a bland character story that's not really interesting but luckily it doesn't get boring and there are some unintentionally funny moments and some poor attempts at humor that make the unintentional humor seem more funny.Overall, it's really a good time waster and is pretty entertaining if you don't take it too seriously.

112,TheHonestCritic,"This ""film"" is nothing more than an ""Independence Day"" (1996) wannabe, and such an embarrassing one at that!",2,5 September 2019,"""Battleship"" (2012), what a mess this movie is! However, when I first heard of this movie, it looked interesting. So I watched it, what a big mistake I made! This ""movie"" is nothing short of an ""Independence Day"" (1996) rip-off. Military vs. aliens? They've done that already! ""Battleship"" is based off the classic board game, seriously. But, I would honestly rather play that game than watch this ""film""! This ""movie"" turned Battleship from a board game into a bored game! ""Battleship"" is nothing short of a snore-fest, they somehow made action scenes and explosions look boring. What, was Michael Bay (director of the worthless ""Transformers"" film series) involved in the making of this ""movie""? That's the keyword to describe this ""film"", boring! Not only is this ""movie"" just boring, but it's also cringeworthy and obnoxious beyond belief! The acting is all over the place, not even Liam Neeson could save this pile of trash! However, there is one performance in this ""film"" that I feel needs to be addressed. Gregory D. Gadson, who played Lieutenant Colonel Mick Canales. He is an actual retired Army veteran and double amputee in real life. He had no former acting experience, but the ironic thing is, he gave the best performance out of all the actors and actresses in the ""movie"". This is a similar circumstance of the movie, ""The Room"" (2003). Where in the case with that film, the person with no acting experience gave the best performance. How about that? Gregory D. Gadson, with no training to be an actor, put on the best performance! Isn't that something? Maybe if ""Battleship"" focused more on his character, it would be somewhat salvageable. Gregory D. Gadson, I, along with everyone else, thanks you for your service. Any way, back to my review. The story is boring and cliched, and also the sets/locations are dull. Over two hours of my life that I will never get back. The only positive I can miraculously salvage out of this ""movie"" is the special effects. As for the soundtrack, this ""film"" is another example of a bad film with a good soundtrack. But this ""good"" soundtrack is good for all the wrong reasons. Why am I dismissing the soundtrack? Because while the songs used in the ""film"" are good, it's like they didn't know what songs to include so they were added in at the last minute. Seriously, they added ""The Pink Panther"" theme in one of the scenes. Why? You couldn't get anyone to actually compose a film score for your movie? ""The Pink Panther"" theme is too good for a ""film"" like this. But honestly, I don't blame music composers for not wanting to get involved with this ""movie"". I'd be embarrassed to have a movie like this on my resume! I feel that way for a lot of bad movies, and this one is no exception. It's a decent soundtrack, but it sounds like it was added in haphazardly. That's another reason I'm not awarding the soundtrack star to my rating for this ""movie"". I hate when movie studios do that, when they think that a good soundtrack can distract you from how bad the movie truly is. No, that does not work for me, and neither do good special effects! Good soundtracks and special effects are no excuse for a horrible movie. What a waste of a soundtrack, and what a total waste of a ""movie"" this is. I'm struggling to rate this ""movie"" 1 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 2 out of 10 IMDB stars. Do yourself a favor, stay away from this ""movie"". Trust me, I'm saving you 131 minutes of your time. Consider this battleship sunk!",Battleship
113,Chris_Pandolfi,"Hey! Where's the, ""You Sunk My Battleship!"" Line?",4,18 May 2012,"Peter Berg's ""Battleship"" is better than the ""Transformers"" trilogy in the same way that having a cold is better than having the flu. And yet it's very much cut from the same cloth as ""Transformers,"" not just because both feature outer space robots but also because both are noisy, thoughtlessly inundated with action and special effects, and generally free from any semblance of plot, character development, or theme. I guess one should expect nothing less when the basis of an ad campaign is not, ""From the director of...."" or, ""From the writer of...."" or even, ""From the producer of...."" but rather, ""From Hasboro, the company that brought you 'Transformers.'"" I'd mockingly call this movie ""Transformers 4,"" except that Michael Bay is already at work on it. You have no idea how excited I am right now.Beginning as a two-player pencil-and-paper guessing game in the early twentieth century, Battleship was eventually acquired by Milton Bradley and updated to feature plastic grids and pegs. The object of the game was to deduce where on the grid the enemy ships lie and sink them by firing missiles – which is to say, by calling out a grid location and marking it with either an X or a peg. After several decades and variations, and even after Milton Bradley was taken over by Hasboro in 1984, the one constant was that the game had nothing to do with space aliens. The only conceivable reason the film features aliens invading Earth in big, clunky machines is because ""Transformers"" and its sequels feature the same thing, and they have all been tremendous box office hits. If there's one thing nobody likes, it's a ripoff. If there's one thing I personally can't stand, it's a ripoff of a franchise so unendurably awful that just thinking about it makes my blood boil.""Battleship,"" like most big-budget special effects extravaganzas about invaders from outer space, opens with trite, meaningless scenes establishing character – or, more accurately, caricature. Taking place in Hawaii, we meet brothers Alex and Stone Hopper (Taylor Kitsch and Alexander Skarsgård), the former a reckless and unmotivated slacker, the latter an officer in the United States Navy. Alex tries to impress the girl of his dreams, Samantha Shane (Brooklyn Decker), by breaking into a convenience store for a chicken burrito. This results in him getting tasered and arrested. Although this does adequately get Samantha's attention (the two immediately fall in love), it lands him in hot water with his fed-up brother, who forces him to enlist in the Navy under the command of Samantha's father, Admiral Shane (Liam Neeson). Alex has talent, and yet he continually wastes it with his antiauthoritarian behavior.As this is being established, we learn that NASA has discovered a planet beyond our solar system with a climate virtually identical to Earth's. Believing it could contain intelligent life, a communications array capable of sending a signal up towards an orbiting satellite is set up on one of the Hawaiian islands. One of the scientists, who factors into the story later on, remains pessimistic: ""It'll be just like Columbus and the Indians. And we're the Indians."" Sure enough, five alien ships arrive in response to NASA's signal. One crash lands in Hong Kong, causing glorious destruction. The other four land in the waters just off the coast of Hawaii, where RIMPAC naval exercises are underway. One of the ships, a monstrous robot entity, encapsulates the entire state of Hawaii and several battleships under a dome-like force field. Admiral Shane is trapped outside, whereas Alex and Stone are trapped within.And so begins scene after scene of relentless alien attacks and human resistance. I won't describe the bountiful displays of extraterrestrial technology. The ads have done a pretty good job of that already. For the first time, Alex must be in command. Part of this involves learning to get along with a rival Japanese officer (Tadanobu Asano), who eventually comes up with the idea of tracking the alien vessels' movements with strategically placed tsunami buoys. Meanwhile, on mainland, we learn that Samantha is a physical therapist for wounded soldiers. Her newest patient, an embittered amputee with prosthetic legs (real-life amputee and Army veteran Gregory D. Gadson), are hiking on a hill on Oahu when the invasion begins; they team up with the aforementioned scientist and try to stop the aliens from reaching the communications array. The aliens themselves are tall, bipedal beings with catlike eyes and pale skin.All will eventually depend on the museum ship USS ""Missouri"" and a mighty band of retired Navy veterans who, despite being geriatric, are still patriots through and through. This is depicted in an inappropriately humorous light, as if having served your country was something to be mocked instead of revered. Indeed, the story is a bit too dependent on comedy relief. We have, for example, Rihanna as the badass weapons expert, who contributes nothing apart from military posturing. We also have a subplot involving Alex being afraid to ask Admiral Shane for his daughter's hand in marriage. Oh, and just in case you were wondering, yes, a couple of battleships do in fact founder. No, at no point does anyone shout, ""You sunk my battleship!"" Considering the game ""Battleship"" is based on, that was one detail the filmmakers probably shouldn't have omitted.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",Battleship

Don't. Its trash and it also glorifies war, which is obviously a thing a film never should do: war is hell, as Apocalypse Now and Grave of the Fireflies, the two best war films ever made, show us.

It's got some badly written dialog too, but that never deters from the glee you'll get at seeing actual giant pegs being shot into ships and one on one battles between the alien's weird space-boats and the U.S. Destroyers.

117,doorsscorpywag,stupid but fun!,4,4 August 2012,Opening the way for Hollywood to make movies about board games instead of TV series battleship is rather fun. The film itself is one huge plothole as the laws of physics and logic take a back seat. How can an idiot who wrecks a store and is tasered by police be able to join the Navy and within minutes have a critical role as an officer aboard his brothers ship? Why is it that the weapons specialist keeps leaving her post to appear in important scenes carrying a rifle only to have to rush back to her post to fire weapons as obviously nobody replaces her when she is missing? How can aliens be contacted from trillions of miles away and then send a space fleet all in the space of a few years?How can a bunch of OAPs and the surviving crew of a destroyer turn a naval relic used as a floating museum into a fighting fortress in less than 4 hours. And isn't it odd that said museum has shells and gunpowder propellant still on board. Surely that would be dangerous to the tourists? And the less said about how this motley crew can conjour up such naval accuracy in a 70 year old rust bucket the better. Idiotic does not even cover it.Then the aliens themselves who seem to think it rude to shoot at anyone who is not shooting at them and can cross space in a flying thingy but when they land they depend on frog technology.The actual boardgame was introduced rather cleverly but everything else was rather silly. Lots of Battle LA type whooping and hollering as aliens bite the dust and improbable situations and bad acting abound but having said that the movie is rather fun.

The bad story about the man who wants to impress the daughter of a general and gets arrested for stealing a chicken burrito, the World War II veterans, the USS Missouri actually destroying a high tech alien spaceship. Unbelievably ridiculous, and was a disappointment.When I saw the trailer for this movie, I thought this would be awesome. I was so excited for it to come play in theaters. It looked like a film about a spaceship randomly popping up in the ocean, and destroying cities, and the United States military will come in and save the day. I was wrong.Something unbelievably stupid beyond belief was the World War II veterans randomly showing up on the USS Missouri when the only battleship within range of an alien spaceship decided to try to use that ship after their ship was destroyed. I smiled when they all appeared and got the ship ready. It was cute. But this destroyed the entire plot. How could the USS Missouri destroy a high tech extraterrestrial space ship? This was cute but I just found it a little infuriating.Overall, you should watch this movie if you won't mind the cheesiness. Just beware. The trailer is misleading.",Battleship

120,gregeichelberger,'Battleship': Bloated big-budget bored game bombs and sinks out of sight,1,16 May 2012,"There are a lot worse jobs than being a professional film critic. After viewing ""Battleship,"" however, I cannot think of one.While watching, I even compiled a list of movies this one steals from, including ""Independence Day,"" ""Pearl Harbor,"" ""An Officer and a Gentleman,"" ""Transformers,"" ""Top Gun,"" ""Titanic,"" ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace,"" ""Battle Los Angeles,"" ""Space Cowboys"" and a half dozen other, better films. A story (based loosely on the Hasbro board game) about the U.S. Navy and aliens that has as much of a connection to the game as Chutes & Ladders has to do with the life of Martin Luther. Plus, it takes almost two hours before an actual battleship set sails in this overblown two-hour Naval recruitment commercial and poor excuse for confusing and mind-numbing CGI.And I'm a Navy veteran, to boot. Plus, I still wonder how that branch of the armed services could say no to an involvement with ""The Avengers,"" yet sign on with this garbage scow.After seeing the various trailers, I thought this enterprise might be top-heavy, but with director Peter Berg (""Very Bad Things,"" Friday Night Lights,"" ""The Kingdom""), I thought SOME good might come out of it. Alas, I was sadly mistaken as this endeavor floats listlessly about before foundering in a sea of noisy, predictable flotsam.From Berg's ham-fisted direction to the ridiculous plot and awful dialogue (blame screenwriters Erich Hoebe and Jon Hoeber, ""Whiteout,"" ""Red"") to ludicrous lapses in military bearing and protocol to the abysmal acting (Taylor Kitsch, Rihanna and Brooklyn Decker are especially excruciating), this is a profoundly terrible motion picture of the action/adventure - or of ANY - genre.The story begins with the discovery of an Earth-like planet light years away and American scientists' efforts to make contact. We then abruptly switch attention to long-haired idiot slacker, Alex Hopper (Kitsch, showing the same acting ability he did in that other epic disaster, ""John Carter""), who is arrested in Hawaii for breaking into a quick shop to steal a chicken burrito for Sam Shane (Decker, ""Just Go With It,"" ""What To Expect When You're Expecting"").Sam, who thinks this is a loving, thoughtful and intelligent gesture, just happens to be the daughter of Admiral Shane (Liam Neeson, ""The Grey""), who also happens to be the superior officer of Alex's brother, Commander Stone Hopper (Alexander Skarsgård, ""Straw Dogs"") who is supporting the bum. Alex then gives his sibling the choice of living on the street or joining the Navy.The next thing we know, Alex is a full lieutenant (which is equivalent to a captain in the Army and Marines and would take at least seven to 10 years to achieve; get used to it, however, as there are 30-year old colonels and full commanders walking around in this flick) and a weapons officer stationed aboard the USS John Paul Jones. The movie also hammers home the fact that he is arrogant, cocky, disobedient, violent, disrespectful, stubborn, rude and generally a complete jerk - which, of course, only allows him total redemption in the end.Meanwhile, the American and Japanese fleets have buried the hatchet and are conducting joint maneuvers off of Pearl Harbor when the aliens finally arrive. These are not the ""Close Encounters Of the Third Kind"" spacemen, though, and are soon blowing up ships and people with their vastly superior weaponry and Halo-like armor.With almost everyone dead, several ships sunk and a force field barrier around Hawaii, it seems that Alex is now the senior officer over everyone (despite being in the military for just a few minutes). His first inclination is to ram the John Paul Jones into the huge, hulking alien machine, killing everyone on board, but the director thinks better of it and Hopper plots to destroy the menace in some other way.At the same time, Sam, who is supposed to be a physical therapist, is hiking with Lt. Col. Mike Canales (Gregory D. Gadson, an actual veteran who lost both legs in combat) in the hills when the first attack begins. With the help of nerdy communications scientist, Cal (Hamish Linklater, ""Fantastic Four""), these two plot how to bring down the satellite which links the invaders to their home planet.In the midst of all this, I found myself rooting for the aliens and secretly cheered when Alex was beaten up by them on several occasions. Late in this mess, Alex even attempts to re-commission the floating museum/battleship USS Missouri and a handful of World War II vets (who are living on board, for some reason) in an effort to save the day.Yes, it is nice to recognize members of the greatest generation who battled both the Nazis and the forces of the Empire of Japan, but here they're played as cutesy, often vulgar and irascible senior citizens (you see, it's fun to laugh at old folks, especially when they drop a curse word or two). These men deserved an honor better than their inclusion in this dung heap.Despite the heroic stances and loud, ear-bleeding explosions and gung- ho fervor, ""Battleship"" is a complete waste of talent, time, money and industry. It is easily one of the single worst movie experiences I have suffered in at least six months, and long before it concludes, this big-budget, bloated borefest sinks under the weight of its own vapidity and ridiculousness.",Battleship
121,daniewhite-1,Bottled-it,3,16 September 2021,"Like a ship in a bottle 'Battleship' is trapped in a terrible story that ruins quite an interesting sci-fi idea of an alien invasion of Earth via the it's oceans which has to be fought off by naval power rather than the conventional airpower, land power or fantasy space fleets.This story premise is not completely new but it's much less well travelled than many others and in terms of a wholesale ""hard power"" alien invasion of Earth story its new to me.The premise is where all my stars are earned however; the actual execution of the film is more of a foundered ship than a bottled one and I can't endorse the film except to say that I enjoyed it's playful premise and mash up with the game 'battleships'.The story is cast adrift in shark infested waters and the characters are barely laid down let alone launched or fitted out.Sea trials and tribulations are boringly staged with set piece action at sea and on land settling equally low in the water.The cast fail to gain any headway with their characters and the climax is as predictable as the tides.I rate 3.5/10 because 'Battleship' has a little gleam of newness in its story outline but I can't get anything but salty about the actual film.",Battleship
122,the_wolf_imdb,Pretty enjoyable sci-fi war movie,8,8 July 2012,"I do not understand why so many people hate this movie. If you go to see horror movie you cannot be offended that you have seen horror movie. This movie is very simple action sci-fi flick based on desk game (!) that acts as a promo for US Navy. Quite frankly there was a ton of such movies in the past. They were not terribly intelligent but they have delivered some fun and some propaganda. Decent consumable movies, especially with a pint of beer or two I would say.If you do not expect to see new and revolutionary Hamlet movie, you can enjoy the non stop action. The quality of the effects is very good and combat scenes are really great, maybe even better than in many ""serious"" war movies. The characters are schematic and little bit naive, but it still works. The pace of the movie is fluent and adequate and it is definitely better than in say Pearl Harbor.The Battleship is actually very good and surprisingly intelligent movie. It even explains many of ""mysteries"" that do puzzle some viewers, like why the invaders try to get to some particular place - they lost communication ship that hit Hong Kong, therefore they have decided to use the communication link provided by the unsuspecting Earthlings. The movie does not explain everything for sure, like why the invasion did not continue after the loss of communication.

123,virindra,Not very original.,6,19 April 2012,"I saw this movie yesterday at men's night. The movie had a slow start with the touch of ""Armageddon"". There is this guy who is in love with a beautiful girl. This guy is not the dream of every father in law. In his case, his father in law is Liam Neeson. So I got the feeling this Ben Affleck - Bruce Willis thing was copied.The big name of Neeson was attached to this movie, but we hardly get to see this man. Only in the beginning and the end. In the middle of the movie he is on a boat away from the action.The movie is not flawless. This huge thing came out of space and dropped in the water. The whole time water falls from the top down in the water aside this thing. How can that be? It is not raining. The top of that alien thing hasn't been under water.Rihanna is a very beautiful woman, but we didn't get to see that in this movie. This woman can't act, yet. She is no Michelle Rodriguez, but tries to be. Her one liners are stupid. They don't make any sense and gets you, as a viewer, out of the movie. You realize that this all ain't real. That makes the special effects a massive waste.The aliens were funny, the suits weren't original, merely manga style. The action, the alien crafts were awesome. The cowboy scenes with the old timer boat were typical American, very over the top and not realistic.Background music was annoying.

Ideas are borrowed from countless other films, and I can think of a Tasmanian Devil cartoon, Ghostbusters 2 and a scene on the stern of a ship as in Titanic, to name a few.But the film has heart.

126,RichardSRussell-1,"Bad Science, Cardboard Characters, Really Delivers on the Action",6,19 May 2012,"Battleship (2:11, PG-13) — 6 — SF, biggie, crossoverDo you remember last year's Battle: Los Angeles? No? Good. Then you took my advice to avoid it.Imagine the same thing — alien invaders confronted by intrepid but seemingly overmatched members of the US military — except with bigger sets, snazzier props, better actors, a more literate script, and boatloads (heh) more money with which to buy state-of-the-art special effects, and you've got the best movie you could reasonably expect from the dumbest board-game spin-off of all time.The biggest challenge was always going to be inserting characters into a pure strategy game. So I'm trying to imagine the thot processes of screenwriters Erich Hoeber and Jon Hoeber. I suspect they looked at the aspirations of the Bush family, where son Jeb was the good-looking, hard-working, ambitious, competent one seemingly destined for greatness, but then the goofy, shiftless, screw-up party boy Dubya, inspired by the love of a good woman, cleans up his act just in time to luck into a series of unlikely coincidences and emerge triumphant.Same deal here. Taylor Kitsch as underachieving beach bum Alex Hopper keeps his John Carter-length flowing locks just long enuf to follow the neat, clean footsteps of his straight-arrow elder brother Stone (Alexander Skarsgård) into the US Navy, which apparently co-sponsored this 2-hour infomercial with Hasbro and Coke Zero. The thing keeping Alex's normally wandering eyes fixed on the prize is Samantha Shane (the bodacious Brooklyn Decker), apple of the eye of stern Admiral Shane (Liam Neeson), who thinks he's never seen such a total waste of talent as his dotter's inamorata. Alex, having disgraced himself in a shipboard brawl with a visiting Japanese officer, is probably ruefully ruminating on Schroeder's observation ""There is no greater burden than a great potential."" when the world veers 45° off course.Back in 2006, we are informed by voice-over at the outset, the Beacon Project had blasted a high-powered first-contact signal in the direction of Planet G, in the Gliese system. It had been recently discovered to be about Earth-sized and in the Goldilocks Zone, neither too hot nor too cold, and so a potential home for intelligent life. As the signal goes out, we get a portentous side comment about how poorly things turned out for the Indians after Columbus arrived.And sure enuf, here come the space aliens, in 5 huge ships, headed straight for Oahu, whence the beacon had emanated. But they seem to have applied the brakes a little late and failed to check for cross traffic, as one of them slams into an orbiting satellite and sheers off a chunk that smashes thru half the skyscrapers in Hong Kong before plummeting into the harbor.Eventually the humans infer that the wreckage — which contains no known metal other than the transuranic lawrencium — must have been part of a communications array, and that the expeditionary force is now cut off from contact with their home world. That explains why their fleet is now headed for the telescopic array on Oahu, to commandeer it so they can, like good ETs, phone home. (Yes, this film actually uses that line, thereby acknowledging that there ARE such things as other science-fiction movies.)Now, given the time lag involved over distances of many light-years, it's highly unlikely that the newbies would be waiting for instructions. Any message they might want to send using the laffably visible and ridiculously slow triple radio beams that converge and redirect each other toward Planet G would have to be along the lines of ""Arrived OK, natives suspicious"", so it's hard to see why this would be a top priority for them. It's also hard to see why their naval craft operate using what appears to be the butterfly stroke. Given that, plus their non-decelerated plunge into the Pacific, those crews must be all but immune to inertia and motion sickness.OK, so the science sucks. And the human motivations and interactions strain credulity. The movie's not really about those. What DOES come as a pleasant surprise is that director Peter Berg actually finds a way to build the basic tactics of the board game into the film, as both sides are rendered blind (the humans by electronic jamming, the aliens by the overpoweringly bright sun) and have to use innovative techniques to determine where the enemy ships are.And, of course, the REAL point is massive destruction, which is delivered quite convincingly, without all the annoying jump cuts and blastingly loud sound track of Transformers. Here you can actually figure out what's going on. And the alien weaponry somewhat reassuringly doesn't seem to be THAT much superior to ours, relying as it does on old-fashioned ballistic impacts and high-power chemical reactions to do most of its damage. Only the semi-intelligent boulder-sized flaming buzzsaws seem to be out of reach of Earth technology.I admit to some ethical qualms as the film showed the aliens scanning their surroundings, with ""safe"" objects evaluated as green and ""hostile"" ones showing up as red, thus targeted for immediate elimination. This could conceivably be simple prudence, not overt hostility. After all, how could THEY have known that they'd splash down in the middle of the huge multi-nation RimPac 2012 war-games exercise, where virtually everywhere they looked would be something capable of wreaking serious havoc? As Cool Hand Luke might have noted, perhaps this was all just a simple failure to communicate.What? Ethical concerns? Nah. Bang! Boom! Kablooie! Go Navy. Next.",Battleship

There is some character development, because the lead constantly infuriates people who love him by not coming anywhere close to realising the potential everyone can see. He does have a lovable side, as he gets himself in a lot of trouble just to satisfy the whim of a girl he's smitten by, but it's entirely physical attraction - he doesn't know anything about her at that point!
In contrast, Rihanna spends the entire film in work overalls or an unflattering uniform - revealing a delightful lack of ego - and I think she did a terrific job of developing one of the film's most appealing characters. There was a sureness of touch that belied the fact that she was making her first movie!
There are other good performances, but the strength of the film is the action, as humans face the challenge of far more advanced visitors who do not seem to have good intentions, at least not towards us.

All I will say in that regard is they went to extraordinary lengths to create a tie-in to the Hasbro game.What I can say without spoiling the one or two plot twists, is that this movie is a string of clichés, pretty much from beginning to ending.

132,achyutaghosh,Noisy. Stupid. Entertaining!,7,14 April 2012,"Noisy, violent and brainless- third time, same winning formula- Hasbro does it again. After Transformers and GI Joe, they are back with the movie rendition of their popular board game, Battleship. A $200 Million budget for a grid based, strategy game translates into a monster of a digital action extravaganza, with loads of inspiration from other successful movies such as Independence Day, Pearl Harbour, Top Gun and Armageddon, and a loving salute to American military might- both past and present. At the outset we are introduced to cocky scientists who try to communicate with a planet in another galaxy that matches earth's environmental conditions, and hence has the possibility of life. Cut to the next scene where we are introduced to two brothers central to the story- Stone (played by Alexander Skarsgard) and Alex (played by Taylor Kitsch). Stone is the straight as an arrow type of guy, while Alex is hot headed, wayward and lost- and for these very same redeeming qualities of Alex, Stone deems him to be best suited in the US Navy, along with himself. Why? Go figure. In the interests of glamor we have swimsuit model Brooklyn Decker playing Samantha, the tough-yet- sensitive- girl- with- not- too- many- clothes role. Sam is Alex's love interest, and daughter of Liam Neeson, the scowling US naval fleet commander. Fast forwarding to an unspecified time, the efforts of our scientists to contact the alien planet have borne fruit, and as a precursor to an invasion, ("" We are talking of an extinction level event"", as one bright guy remarks) alien amphibian aircraft splash down near Hawaii and set up a force field which cordons off the area that they have selected to set up communications with their home planet. Humanity's hopes for survival now rest on three missile destroyers that happen to be inside the impenetrable force field. Two of the destroyers are quickly destroyed by the aliens, leaving it all on Alex and his plucky crew to save the world. It is from here where dollars start showing, the special effects start kicking in, and dumb fun takes over.It's good to know that you can still make an effective action spectacle without the need for 3D. Battleship has excellent visual effects, some even better than those in Transformers. The aliens in their armor look mighty effective like in the game Halo, but make curious decisions- about not harming life but going after the machines mostly. Perhaps a recon force has its own priorities, protect and establish communications, rather than taking needless lives- save the last one for later, so they think. There is one tense scene that refers to the titular game replicated as a grid map based on tsunami warning buoys, and a jingoistic one towards the end of the movie, where the 70 year old USS Missouri, serving as a museum, is laughably brought into action by Alex's crew and some grizzled war veterans, and incredibly takes out the biggest and baddest alien ship by firing a broadside shot. Yes, you heard it right- a broadside shot, alike the ones fired in naval battles 300 years ago. I didn't know that museums carry live ammo, and can be war ready in a couple of hours, but hey, no intelligent questions, right? Just go with the flow.Another highlight of the movie was the debut of singer Rihanna- she plays Raikes, a high energy gunner, but unfortunately she doesn't even get dialogues, not even one liners, just one word-ers like ""Boom"", ""Yo"", ""Dang""- so much for her fans. Liam Neeson has 5 minutes of screen time and is classy as usual. Taylor Kitsch is watchable, again like his previous big budget outing John Carter, this role too doesn't require him to act, just run around with a straight face, and that he does well. Rest of the movie is a set of explosions, and those have come out really well.To sum up, Battleship is cheesy, predictable, a big demolition spectacle. It has acting ranging from wooden to serviceable, it has dialogues that range from cringe worthy to unintentionally funny, and it wears its patriotism in a ridiculous manner. It is a movie that wont win awards, but for people who can leave their brains outside, and spare 140 minutes for stupid, mindless action. I have a thing for all things military, and hence had a whale of a time. 7/10 for me",Battleship
133,blacklist-1,"Battleship manages the incredible feat of you just wanting to play the game, such as how this movie consists of nothing but complete boredom and virtually zero talent.",1,17 August 2013,"Battleship or as one reviewer favourably calls it Battles**t, is a typical American patriotism film, which I don't normally mind. I also delight from time to time in mindless fun cliché action movies. Check out my reviews on previous films like The Losers, The A-Team and Olympus Has Fallen and you'll see my point.The plot of this abominable disaster consists of aliens coming to Earth for reasons unknown and a fleet of Amercian ships trying to stop them. Among them is disgraced Lt Alex Hooper (Taylor Kitsch), the other members of the cast consists of Rhianna and Liam Neeson.Unfortunately Battleship manages to drag ""mindless action genre"" to such low new depths, that you would never see the bottom of it to reclassify itself of just ""mind-numbingly boring.""First off the film drips so much in American Patriotism that you feel nauseated. One example is when Hooper who miraculously manages to regain his rank at the end so quickly employs a bunch of old navy guys on an old navy ship to help out, which is done in such a cliché and shoddy way, it makes you want to shoot yourself. The problem with such a long movie is there is even more dialogue/acting scenes than ever in most action films, but it's written so poorly and acted so badly it gives you a headache. Cliché after cliché presents itself so much that it resembles a built tower in a game of Jenga. Even the action itself is nothing special, which has been done with more skill and thought in other action films. There are claims that Battleship is unique in that it tells the story from both the humans and aliens point of view. I must have missed something, because I only got one side of the story. Rhianna and Kitsch are the worst offenders with their ""acting."" It doesn't help the fact that they pander so rigidly to stereotypical characters like Kitsch as Cooper who is the ""redeemer"" and becomes the hero by the end of the film. At a certain point I might have cared, but when it came round to him changing I just didn't. I would have preferred his brother Commander Stone Hooper (Alexander Skarsgård) to be the forefront of the piece as Skarsgard has some acting ability (but unfortunately he is killed early on.) Neeson is the only other to pull in a decent performance, but as he's in it for only the equivalent of about 10 minutes of screen time in an 131 minute movie, there's little he can do to save it (despite the best efforts to market the film tailored towards Neeson being a main character in it as he's such a big Hollywood star, particularly being bankable as the new middle-age action hero in films such as Taken and Unknown recently. If anything when they did this and I saw this thinking Neeson was a main character and finding his screen time was so limited, it annoyed me even more and smacks of how desperate they were to make the film succeed. It makes you feel as though they knew it was going to be a flop).If you want to see a good example of a sci-fi action movie done well, watch Independence day or even Battle: Los Angeles, which was done with more skill and talent than this pile of drivel. Put simply in the end Battleship left me very bored and frustrated with clunky dialogue, too many cliché's to count, poor acting and over-coated too much with American Patriotism, which wasn't even inspiring. As a result it's just 131 minutes of complete crap with little skill, talent or thought involved.",Battleship

135,comps-784-38265,America Saves The World (yet again),7,28 June 2017,"OK i am a little biased on this. I love the alien invasion genre. Battleship is cheesy but I enjoyed it. Hopper is junior U.S. naval officer, on the USS John Paul Jones. The character is clearly and ridiculously unfit to be a naval officer being irresponsible and foolhardy. Somewhat like Independence day the nasty aliens have arrived, but only with 5 ships. Fortunately for mankind, their communications ship crashes into Hong Kong. (bad luck for HK) The aliens need to communicate home to get reinforcements. Why exactly? They came to Earth. The film suggests this was due to welcome signals broadcast from Earth. So presumably alien HQ would come looking if they don't hear from their attack ships. The aliens set up an inpenetrable force-field around Hawei, whilst they adapt the huge satellite dishes on the island to phone home. They only have a window with a satellite every 24 hrs to do so. So the dilemma is to stop them calling home for reinforcements. Hopper finds himself in command of a warship, after it is hit by the aliens, killing senior officers. Two accompanying warships are destroyed. Cleverly our heroes work out how to destroy some of the alien vessels, but their ship (john Paul Jones) is destroyed in doing so . This section of the film was very enjoyable. On the island, hopper's girlfriend and an army vet with artificial limbs, and a wandering scientist help delay the alien attempts to phone home. This part is all good. Hopper wants to get back into the fight because the aliens killed his brother. The film also robs a bit of independence day, where an alien clutches hopper's head and apparently hopper can then see what the nasty aliens have been doing and intend. Although its not well explained and quickly forgotten. So they go to get the WWII battleship which is now a museum. Apparently to get it operational they only have to knock over the confectionery machine. Also for some reason a floating museum has live ammunition. However, we can overlook this . What is a bit stupid, is when Hopper's petty officer explains he has no knowledge of the battleship, its engines and analogue controls, questioning how they will get the 70 year old ship operational. We are shown various retirement age sailors ridiculously draped about the battleship, some with silly white moustaches.What cannot be overlooked, even with this genre, is that the 'old' sailors are clearly too young. They would have to be a minimum of 90 years old each. They get the old battleship going, destroy the alien force-field and Liam Neeson sends in the fighters to win the day. Hurrah. The world is saved ! But surely the aliens know where we are anyway ? There are some good action sequences, I generally liked the film but it was rather spoilt by several obviously stupid aspects. Hoppers character starting out as someone who is clearly unfit to be an officer at all, starts the rot. All in all watchable, if, like me, you like alien invasions 7/10",Battleship
136,troy-manatunga,I am impatiently waiting for the Blu- Ray release and I will place it right beside PEARL HARBOR!,7,7 May 2012,"May Contain SpoilersThis piece is certainly one that is going against the tide and up the river against the most popular and common perception that; BATTLESHIP should stay where she belongs; as scrap metal on the seabed of the North Pacific. Against all odds this movie enthusiast has seen the silver lining.For starters Hasbro does not have the best of track records in making movies that penetrate the stubborn audience when it comes to movies related to toys. On the other hand Hasbro who has been in business as a production company since 1983 and has effectively marketed their action figures (which is their primary business) which for them is a win-win situation. Whilst I agree G.I.JOE: THE RISE OF THE COBRA is clearly its weakest link and I am dreading G.I.JOE: RETALIATION, BATTLESHIP excels and deserve credit and requires a save line.Having owned the game back in the day; BATTLESHIP is most certainly based on the age old board game. The concept of BATTLESHIP is director Peter Berg's brain child himself as media speculates. Mr. Berg who was born to a navy historian has always had the passion for the mean machines in the water and what better way of extending naval warfare to an audience rather than via an age old board game we can all relate to? Especially since Micheal Bay has bagged PEARL HARBOR to his name. Being a game of hit and miss, BATTLESHIP is a definite hit with me. Surprisingly I walked out of the theatre and could not help the female audience mutter that it was deeply emotional (Maybe I was at the movies on the day everyone loved it!). BATTLESHIP to move a female audience is not that easy? How did Peter Berg do this? This made me reflect at my whole experience during the movie. The key is the soul of the story, the story of the two brothers engrossed in a bond beyond understanding unless you do have siblings of your own, and the fact of losing a loved one in front of your eyes and without a doubt knowing that it is your fault that they are not amongst you and finally finding your true self and becoming the person you are destined to be. Taylor Kitsch isn't the ideal underdog that we see in Mickey Rouke in the magical movie THE WRESTLER, but if at all Kitsch does portray something, it is that he is the modern day egoistic underdog who has no faith in himself. The full circle he plays, from stealing burritos, to falling on his face off the roof, to being kicked in his face, to being carelessly getting into brawls in the navy that which gets him discharged from the navy, and to then end up becoming the man who everyone looks for guidance at the neediest hour. If that isn't character development what could be more detailed? If I am to pick a favorite it would certainly be Peter Bergs 2nd man Alexander Skarsgard; our fearsome vampire sheriff aka Eric Northman from TRUE BLOOD. Short-lived on screen but very powerful, his contribution is what kick starts when the Aliens bring down all hell on Commander Stone Hoppers USS Sampson and sinks her. Whilst the legend Liam Neeson is on board the Berg production he is taking a back seat letting the little boys play; after all it is based on a board game! Do not underestimate his awesomeness is all that I will say.Alex Hopper (Taylor Kitsch) who tries to impress Sam (Brooklyn Decker) on his birthday after his umpteenth beer finds himself face first at Sam's feet being tasered by the police in front of his brother; Commander Stone Hopper(Alexander Skarsgard). The obstinate younger brother is set straight and is thrown into the navy to teach him a lesson of discipline and humility. The year 2012 shows us an almost refined Lieutenant Alex Hopper who is now the Tactical Actions Officer onboard the USS John Paul Jones destroyer. Meanwhile education at its optimum has pushed the brains of NASA scientists to send a signal into space based on a doubt of possible life on a planet that has similar characteristics as earth. When humans kill each other and creating WMDs is actually almost an industry of its own why would they think an alien race would be non-hostile? NASA gets a reply on the very day the US Navy is carrying out its RIMPAC (RIM OF PACIFIC) multinational naval exercise. The reply isn't a somber alien like PAUL. Instead it is the ultimate Decepticon look alike. With fire power in it to annihilate the earth, all that stands between it and mankind are the brave sailors at sea.This isn't TRANSFORMERS 4: AQUA ATTACK, whilst the aliens look awfully close to the Decepticons in TRANSFORMERS and the aliens in THE AVENGERS, they are a breed of its own. Whilst BATTLESHIP is not performing on par with major hits as TRANSFORMERS and the massive hit THE AVENGERS at the box office, she is a great production with a soundtrack that will put you right in the driver's seat. I am impatiently waiting for the Blu- Ray release and I will place it right beside PEARL HARBOR!TITLE: BATTLESHIP DIRECTED BY: PETER BERG STARRING: TAYLOR KITSCH, Alexander SKARSGARD,RIHANNA,BROOKLYN DECKER,TADANOBU ASANO & LIAM NEESON RATED: PG 13 RATING:07/10 131 MINUTES",Battleship

138,plargreg,if you watched this and liked it than,1,15 December 2020,You're whats wrong with planet earth. Worst movie ever! Rihanna is also the worst actress ever! She's as cold and flat and emotionless and talentless in this as she is in everything. I seriously wonder how high the execs were in hollywood to greenlite a board game movie starring rihanna as a military expert,Battleship
139,metalrage666,"OK, but could've been much better.",5,29 April 2014,"I must admit that I thought the movie was OK, but it did leave me a little disappointed at yet again how human, or more to the point, American ingenuity, with seemingly very little outside help, manages to save the world.Having said that, there were at least a few things they got right with this one, in so much as if you were an invading alien race with only 5 initial ships, it makes sense to seal yourselves off behind a force- field, cut enemy ground and air support infrastructure and set up a line of communication back to home base, until you were in a better position strategically, but from there the story goes from textbook to comic book, but for a movie like this, it's what you would expect.I don't know much about battleships, but it seems unlikely that the 70 year old Missouri, a museum ship since 99, would still be carrying enough live shells or in the face of overwhelming technological superiority, would still be effective enough to cause as much damage as it did. However having said that, this movie is loosely based on a board game, so accuracy and logistics are not going to be a central theme here. I guess in some kind of weird way, it made sense to use the ageing battleship, (towards the end of the movie), as it was analogue driven and not digital so apparently that makes it impervious to being shut down by alien technology.There are copious amounts of cheesy lines, lame humour and can-do attitude for several action movies, but you need to keep in mind that this is a largely a pop-corn movie and it's unlikely to propel any of the actors to instant stardom. And despite what many people said about Rihanna, I didn't mind her in this. It was, after all, her first foray into the world of acting, so are we expecting an Oscar laden performance? Unlikely.The movie is very formulaic in its approach and build-up, however there is practically no character development. The main character, once a complete loser, suddenly gets thrust into the navy by his older brother so he can straighten up and fly right and before you can blink, he's an officer already!It was a forgone conclusion, another one we all saw coming, that once the Japanese captain and the American Lt Commander, the aforementioned loser, had a punch up in the bathroom of all places, that circumstance would thrust them together and by the end of the film solved all their differences. I guess if you like big production movies where almost everything gets blown up or shot at, aliens that once again insist on taking over the Earth and the overwhelming message that you can solve ""any"" problem with old-fashioned brute force or by firing enough guns at something and a wafer thin plot then Battleship will be your bread and butter. It's enjoyable enough for a late night DVD night where it doesn't matter if you zone out or not. Just think of this as a new Top-Gun, however instead of being about a hot-headed fighter pilot who learns a lesson the hard way, it's more about a hot-headed naval officer who learns a lesson the hard way with aliens thrown in.",Battleship
140,nebk,Escapism At Its Best,7,31 July 2013,"Usually I would run away rather than watch a blockbuster such as Battleships. Most of the time those that are supposedly based on historic events are completely distorted (e.g. Pearl Harbor and King Arthur) and those that are not are just plain bad (Indiana Jones 4 and Transformers amongst others). In my opinion Battleship is somewhat of an exception. I really expected this movie to be full of implausibility and cliché upon cliché. And in a way it was, but it was still enjoyable and entertaining.Whilst most other reviews seem to be very negative concerning the story in this movie, we need to face the fact that this movie is based on a game. So if you don't expect an award winning screenplay you might enjoy this rather clichéd movie. The effects are great and the acting is decent given the formulaic plot (Humans send signal into space; Aliens invade; Aliens seem to be winning; Aliens get beaten by a ragtag group of misfits) Some people seem to have a problem with leap forging alien ships and the fact that they destroy certain targets but not others. As for reviews that state that the movie doesn't make sense because of this, all I can say is if they destroyed everything that they should then we wouldn't have a movie to watch. And it becomes plain in the movie that the aliens destroy what they perceive to be a threat to them. Someone wrote that the aliens destroy a freeway and grounded choppers and that this makes no sense, but wouldn't it make sense to destroy the perceived enemies armaments and lanes of transport? I also have to admit that I liked the fact that the aliens in the movie are portrayed as bipeds that are physiologically very similar to human beings.I agree that there are a lot of problems in the story like poorly armed alien troops, the fact that the alien commander gets sniped, or that the invaders (rather conveniently) forget to blow up the battleship manned by retired veteran troops. But then again if you were a head of the invading alien army would you really bother with an out-dated battleship manned by retired sailors? So, whilst I generally agree that there are problems with the story, I still think that this movie is very entertaining especially if one wants to relax for 2+ hours and not have to ponder all the intricacies of the plot. So I agree with one of the other reviewers who called this movie a guilty pleasure. Normally I would run from this kind of movie but I found myself enjoying it. Maybe I was just in the right frame of mind to watch a movie that I didn't have to think about and analyze. Pure escapism.",Battleship
141,jaxbubba,Surprisingly DELICIOUS!!!!,8,11 June 2012,"First and foremost, I really need to preface this review by making the following statement: ""I was not on or have I ever tried CRACK, nor was I drunk at the time of viewing this film."" That said I really, really, really enjoyed this movie!!!! I know! I know! I said the same thing prior to viewing, what a preposterous idea to make a movie out of a board game. How stupid can Hollywood be???? So I went into this movie already knowing how much I was going to hate this film, and now I am eating my words!!!!Granted, this film is not for everyone!!! It's a Sci-Fi geek's wet dream film a la ""Independence Day"", it's a comedy, it's an action adventure, its got war heroes and veterans, and patriotism. AND I ATE IT ALL UP!!!!!! Without giving too much away, when the USS Missouri veterans make their appearance in the film, my heart pounded, face widen, and I actually almost teared up and it did make me proud to be in the military.The thing I love most about this film is that it's totally predictable, even to the point that it makes joke of the film's plot in the first five minutes of the film, with possibly my most favorite line from the film (and there are many). But here's the set up for the film:Scientist on Earth have found a sister planet to Earth in the Universe that is the same distance from its star (Sun) as Earth is, has the same water content to sustain an atmosphere as Earth does. So they decide to ""beam"" a signal every 24 hours to ""Planet G"" in hopes of a response. So one scientist looks to his buddy and says, ""if there is intelligible life on that planet, and they are able to come here. It will be like Columbus and the Indians. And we'd be the Indians!!!"" LOVE IT!!!! Can you guess what happens next???? Hint: There is intelligible life on that planet, and they do possess the ability to reach Earth.We have an all-star cast with the likes of Liam Neeson (who seems to be in everything nowadays), Alexander Skarsgard (who also seems to be starring in everything), Taylor Kitsch, and even Rihanna in her big screen debut. A nice cast who play off each other really well. An honorable mention to Gregory D. Gadson who really did actually lose both his legs in combat in the war in Iraq in 2007.However, what I really loved in this film, was how it incorporated the actual board game into the film, it was pure genius!!!!! The alien invasion force was using an Electro-Magnetic Pulse (EMP) to jam the Allied Forces equipment and radar, so the Japanese commander suggested using the Tsunami buoys to track ""uniformed"" water displacement, thus establishing the whereabouts to the attacking aliens ships. Then as in the game, the US Destroyer would fire volleys into the grid formed when the Tsunami buoys were transposed to the map. Truly BRILLIANT!!!!Again, I cannot express how surprised I was with this film!!! Is it absolutely ludicrous? YES!! Is the plot outlandish? AB-SO-LUTELY!!!!! I did enjoy myself while watching this film? You better believe I did!!!! I film has a 120 minute running time, and I can usually gauge how well I like I film by the number of time I look at my watch. Which did not happened!!! I was, without a doubt, truly entertained!!!! And you will be too! I highly recommend!!! TWO THUMBS WAY UP!!!!! If you enjoy Alien Invasion films, then this is a ""MUST SEE""!!!! Get out your bucket of popcorn, and strap on your seat belts this is definitely an ""E Ticket"" Ride!!!!!! I actually believe, if this film was not called ""Battleship"", made by ""Hasbro"", and advertised as a ""board game-turned-into-movie"" this could have been another blockbuster hit for the summer. However, the film is doing well overseas with nearly $300 million in the till already.SEE MORE OF MY REVIEWS ON FB @ ""THE FARIS REEL""",Battleship
142,dcobbimdb,Hidiously bad...,1,23 December 2013,"How Liam Neeson and Alexander Skarsgård ever let themselves be dragged down with this waste of film real I'll never know. That said they are little more than extras in this movie, both in it for a meager 15 minutes at most. It's astonishing really. It's not that often that you see a movie with a decent budget blow chunks so high but this one did it. Funny enough I knew ahead of time, I read the pour reviews, stayed away and finally watched it when it was free and I had nothing else better to do (or so I thought), and still I feel cheated...What's really sad is I knew 5 minutes into it, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 40 minutes, heck the whole time I knew I was watching a crappy movie that dare I say I probably could have done a better job directing, and or acting in for that matter. It's really an awful feeling to be watching a movie and usually where there's that slightest bit of hopeful feeling that things will get better, but in this movie I had none of that and merely watched it to it's end as if to watch a ship sink into the ocean.I'm never this negative about movies far as reviews go but I have to say this movie flunked on all levels, boring story, bad directing, bad action, bad acting. The special effects weren't bad but that doesn't score you any points these days unless it's something marvel, which this was not. I mean at one point we're actually playing ""battleship"" like the age old game, as if just because the sun went down we cannot detect the aliens ships and just because they are ""sun challenged"" they despite being able to travel faster than the speed of light across millions of light miles to get here can't seem to pick our ships out of water at night without line of sight? Oh and when the sun comes up it actually blinds them? I mean really??? And we as a semi intelligent audience are actually supposed to buy all this?

143,quinnox-1,Some funny moments pull this movie up from sinking to the depths,6,21 May 2012,"First off, know that Battleship has a terrible plot, and plenty of dialogue where the cheese factor is very high, plus it serves as a pretty obvious long recruiting ad for the US Navy aimed at young men. That said, the special effects are well done and pleasing to the eye, especially for the alien ships and the alien 'tech' and has big battle scenes full of colorful fireworks, and there is plenty of humor to keep things going at a good pace.Taylor Kitsch is the lead, and is just as much a charisma black hole as he was in John Carter, but thankfully in this movie he doesn't get as much screen time and so he can be ignored much of the time and is just an annoying distraction that soon enough will be off screen as the movie shifts to one scene after another with a rapid pace.There are some surprisingly funny moments in this film, with the best one coming when a black Army soldier who is handicapped has a fight scene with an alien, I thought this scene was so hilarious that it made the whole movie worthwhile. I won't spoil it, but its a great scene and had me in stitches. There are other humorous scenes too, and it saves the movie from the depths of mediocrity where it threatens to go a few times. To sum up, this is a loud and dumb movie with good special effects and some unexpected laugh out loud humor, and its certainly not as bad as some of the press that its getting.",Battleship
144,masterjk2,Rub a dub dub,5,14 March 2013,"Boy, what a loser. Did it ever occur to anyone that a believable plot would have been good. Instead of this hackneyed, trite silly one. It tried to play on every heart string it could but failed. The bumbling boy who is so stupid he breaks into a 7-11 to get her a chicken burrito? Could anyone be so stupid? Well our hero could be. And his fair damsel thinks it's cute, instead of incredibly dumb. Then, the war. I realize that Hasbro makes a lot of games for children, which made its segue into this movie easy. But I haven't been 16 or younger in many years. So I found it boring and incredibly anachronistic. The evil aliens fly billions of miles so that their one communication ship can crash into a satellite. How clumsy. And their most advanced weapon is some sort of WWII pipe bomb that is launched by some whirring device? It's amazing they could make it to Earth with no roadside stops for a Dairy Queen. And their force field that rejected all aircraft suddenly stops working for the rest of the movie? And their spacemen only come with hands that turn into Swiss Army knives to kill? Better they should have stayed home, along with me. Whatever made them think that Peter Berg who has done little of importance and nothing on this scale could handle such a project?

147,WatchedAllMovies,Yet another unimaginative alien invasion movie,6,9 September 2012,"This is yet another aliens invasion movie, like independence day.Somewhere there must be a rule that says movie aliens need to be based on human form (head, torso, two arms, and two legs). Other aliens movies usually make some effort to make the aliens look slightly non human. In this movie, they just slap a mask and costume over an actor. So the aliens look pretty much human -- two eyes, a nose, mouth, two arms, walk on two legs, same size as people, and amazingly, breaths the same air as humans.Plot holes are everywhere. If the aliens figured out how to cross light-years of distances, how come their navigation is so poor they get into an accident before even reaching earth? And where are their advance weapons? At the least they should be able to dodge around at nearly the speed of light. Also, who attacks a planet without first scouting out the place or first sending in some drones.The alien space ship gets damaged pretty easily by human's weapon, what good are their exotic material that isn't even in our periodic table?A battle ship that is retired and being used as a display can just up and sail away with a few minutes of prep? And even have ammo for the weapon systems? There is some obligatory romance and a redneck hero to save the day.It was an OK movie; just don't nit pick on the plot holes.",Battleship

The film starts out with a terrific looking girl standing alone at a bar and our main dorkish character breaks into a closed pizza shop to impress her. Next we switch to him joining the navy to fight aliens – now she is impressed.Funny thing is that my experience with girls who look this good is that they don't hang around bars alone - there is generally an ape of a boyfriend watching her every move from the far side of the room.Script was predictable junk and the main players were devoid of any character - yawn.Maybe Hollywood script writers should read some Philip K Dick, Azimov or Pohl and (unlike I robot,)actually stick to the story.",Battleship
149,julian-mumford,"Daft, yes. Fun in parts, equally yes.",5,3 September 2012,"Flushed with the monetary if not critical success of ""Transformers"", Hasbro has been rummaging around in their toy cupboard for another franchise.Deciding that a board game consisting of guessing where your battleships are hidden to the refrain of ""Hit"" or ""Miss"", one imagines would have been low on their wish list.However, investing a production budget of some $200 million, it had better be a ""hit"" otherwise someone will be in trouble.Wisely deciding that filming a board game will not be enough, the creative force behind the film have decided that adding cool Aliens and spaceships to the mix, courtesy of some excellent SFX work by ILM, would enliven the story.The story such as it is, centres around two brothers, one Commander Hopper (Alexander Skarsgard) a straight up and down ""Hoorah"" Navy officer, the other a deadbeat waster Alex (Taylor Kitsch), not averse to breaking into a convenience store to steal a Burrito to impress a girl.The Navy will sort all that out and before we know it, Alex is lieutenant Hopper, in the same mould as his brother but with rougher edges and a penchant for trouble.All is well and we are treated to many, many shots of US Navy ships cleaving through the Pacific ocean, clearly very much with the approval, endorsement and general we are happy to help, from the US Navy in Hawaii. On occasions so much so, that you expect a application form to be distributed with each ticket or DVD.Aliens then arrive to spoil the Naval war games, interestingly a multi-national force headed by Captain Nagata (Tadanobu Asano), presumably as a nod to a worldwide audience base. The Aliens land in the sea and then proceed to attack humans and weapons only if they perceive a threat to them, handily indicated with a red or green HUD.The initial alien force is believed to be a scout force who need to send a message home to call in the troops, via the handy satellite array on Hawaii, ironically the very signal that has been beaming out in a search for intelligent life.Humans obviously want to stop them to 'save the world"" and that's about it story wise. Although the people left on land get some better lines, real life double amputee Mick Canales (Gadsen) and scientist Cal Zapata (Linklater) with some decent banter ""Who talks like that"" Cal asks, he does have a point.Liam Neeson has been co-opted in as Admiral Shane, father to the pretty girl Alex Hopper is chasing (Brooklyn Decker) and lends some gravitas to the proceedings, although even he looks uncomfortable in the role. Rather bizarrely, Rihanna is also on board as a Wep's petty officer, presumably filling another demographic niche.So with no real plot other than that sketched out above, the visuals and effects will have to be top notch to turn this into an event movie to recover the budget outlay.The effects as you might expect from ILM are superb, water cascades from monstrous ships, clever chainsaw type wrecking balls carve through ships, cars and freeways with an awesome destructive force.There is much fun to be had in these sequences, they are ridiculous enough to not resemble real life and much like Transformers, if you like to see stuff blow up, this could be your movie. Later in the film, something is bought to life with the help of ""old salts"", they cannot be serious you might ask, clearly they are.The acting, dialogue and motivations of all characters are all but non existent. Does this detract from the spectacle, not so much but if you are expecting any depth, look elsewhere.One would certainly hope that a military trained officer would react in a more professional manner when faced with adversity. Deciding to ram the aliens with your destroyer killing all on board, is presumably not a sane or proportionate response as indicated by Naval regulations.Director Peter Berg has certainly thrown a lot of stuff on the screen, more quantity rather than quality and as mentioned before, this film makes even Michael Bay's ""Pearl Harbour"", appear unpatriotic by comparison.You have been warned.Interestingly the plan to make the film more international in content clearly worked, US Box office was a miserly $65m, with International markets contributing $237m. Movie execs finally working out that there are people outside of the US that like to watch movies.Summary Daft, yes. Fun in parts, equally yes.

An engaging, heart- wrenching drama about high school football in Texas, Friday Night Lights was a critically acclaimed sports drama that put Berg on the map as a director.After Friday Night Lights, however, Berg took a turn towards the laughable directors of our era. Between The Kingdom and Hancock, Berg was unable to produce anything successful or worthwhile, failing with casts that included Will Smith, Jamie Foxx, and Charlize Theron.And if these two flops weren't enough, Berg has brought one of the least anticipated blockbusters of the 2012 season to the silver screen: Battleship. And this film is highly unanticipated for good reason; in a summer of Avengers, Dark Knight Rises, Amazing Spider- Man, Prometheus, and countless other films, there isn't a lot of excitement for a board game adaptation with a misfit cast of good looking sub-par actors. And facts are facts we really have seen this film many times before.Straight out of the Michael Bay school of filmmaking, Battleship tells the story of a group of Navy officers and sailors that find themselves in a fight to save the world when an alien spacecraft lands in the ocean off the coast of Hawaii, puts a forcefield around themselves and the Navy ships, and engages in battle.This entire story is designed around a cast that is clearly pulling for the teenage horn dog boys and giddy girls to see the film. With a cast like Taylor Kitsch (John Carter), former super model Brooklyn Decker, Alexander Skarsgard (True Blood), and Rihanna, there is clearly a target audience for this film that doesn't include fans of classic drama.But this is nothing to hate the movie for. A film that is an adaptation of a board game about strategically destroying enemy ships was never meant for the Citizen Kane crowd. This was meant for the fans of Transformers and action movies of this variety. And if you fall in this category, you will likely enjoy several parts of Battleship. But it isn't even the best film in the explosion based action genre; not even close. I can't give credit to a film for successfully being a bad movie, let alone being a sub-par movie in a laughable genre.For the full review of Battleship (IMDb form too short) visit: http://custodianfilmcritic.com/battleship/",Battleship
151,jonnyfendi,"MIchael Bay's Typical Mega Action Brainless Movie, But Without Michael Bay!",8,18 May 2012,"Thiz ""Battleship"" is loaded with lots of missiles, it means that thiz movie is full of explosive action scenes. I notice that most of today's movies have shown too much of its elements of surprise on the trailer to attract more audience. Oftentimes, it even happens like I have said before, ""Sometimes what we saw in movie-trailer is what we saw in entire movie"". But don't worry about that, it doesn't apply to thiz movie. Thiz movie saves many super actions to make you stay put in your seat for two hours duration. The story revolves around the encounter of the US Navy's warships and its allies with the mysterious alien mothership on the high seas of the Pacific Ocean. The biggest naval battle in history is about to begin. The sound effects are superb. Every boom and every bang from the ship's cannon is just like dragging us into the middle of battle. Practically, thiz movie doesn't even leave us a single breathing space since the first appearance of the alien. The next thing I know, the suspense is taut and it moves forward at a steady pace. The diversity of the Cast members is fascinating. I can undoubtedly say that Taylor Kitsch is on his way to becoming a massive star. Definitely, there's something attractive behind his charismatic presence. Thiz is his second big-budget movie after ""John Carter"" (2012). Other performers worth mentioning are Brooklyn Decker who can be sexy and tough at the same time, Liam Neeson who delivers a brief but memorable performance, the famous pop singer Rihanna who makes a surprising debut, and not to be forgotten, an outstanding appearance from a real-life veteran Lieutenant Colonel Gregory D. Gadson as the Mike Tyson look-alike legless soldier named Mick Canales. In the middle of the movie, I almost thought that thiz movie was directed by Michael Bay, but plus more freshness. Mr. Bay, I think you've finally got the perfect successor for your mega action brainless movies, the name is Peter Berg. Peter Berg is an Actor-Director who directed other fun action movies like ""The Rundown"" (2003), ""The Kingdom"" (2007) and Will Smith's vigilante superhero ""Hancock"" (2008). The two dominant characters which are Hopper and Nagata quickly remind me of Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock's figures in ""Star Trek"" (1966-1969). Nagata which is played by Tadanobu Asano made a perfect tandem role with Hopper. I have to say, it's very nice to see America and Japan side by side in a battlefield. But something philosophical tickles me. If you have the greatest weapon on earth and you feel obligated to seize other potential lethal weapons from the other sides in the name of peace. That seems like a good idea. Now, what if What if there is a new weapon more powerful than yours. Do you still think that is a good idea?

I think the director was trying to make something that equaled the likes of TRANSFORMERS, even emanate Michael Bay, well, he succeeded! Because this is just as bad! Total rubbish! I feel sorry for Liam Neeson for saying yes to this crap! A waste of 209 million dollars! I really hope that Peter Berg goes in to bankruptcy because of this so he doesn't make anything like this ever again! I saw this on television, so it was free, and I STILL feel robbed!

153,piratecannon,Miss!,2,26 December 2012,"There are all kinds of commonly known phrases connected to the actual Battleship board game, and it's so tempting to employ each and every one in describing the motion picture carrying the same name. In fact, I could probably end this review with two words by simply saying ""Battleship sunk,"" but I suppose I owe an explanation to anyone brave enough to read this assessment.Let's be honest: when you heard that a feature film based on a Hasbro- owned board game where you place pegs on a grid in an attempt to guess where an opposing player has placed his/her pieces of Naval plastic, you probably rolled your eyes. If this describes you, I can confirm that the movie is, in many ways, worse than you ever imagined. If you shrugged your shoulders and thought, ""Hey, Transformers wasn't all that bad,"" then you might find something to like here. In that sense, Battleship is one of those movies that's polarizing even before its release.For the optimistic, there are a few likable things about the movie. It never takes itself seriously, it features tons of eye candy (of all varieties), and it flies its ""American heroism"" flag at full mast. Formulaic though it may be, there are some undeniably enjoyable moments.But these are rarities. More often than not, the movie bumbles from one insanely idiotic plot point to the next. In fact, it's not incorrect to say that the movie is a prolonged contradiction; it's stupid beyond belief, but it's so convoluted that attempting to make sense of the narrative is a fool's errand.It goes like this: an irresponsible twenty-something is forced into Naval service by his domineering brother. Even after he's enlisted the guy continues to make bone-headed decisions. Nothing, it seems, can shake him out of his immaturity. Cue an alien invasion.Said Naval goof-off is aboard a vessel that's thrown into the middle of the unexpected intergalactic battle, and—surprise!—ends up being the savior of planet Earth. There's nothing particularly wrong with the setup (besides the fact that's entirely predictable). What really hurts Battleship is the execution.The movie eventually digresses into an actual game of Battleship—the aliens and the humans are blindly firing shells at one another, and its as dull as you'd imagine. But then things get really out of control; with their fleet destroyed, our unlikely hero enlists the help of a contingency of geriatric sailors who just so happened to be attending the decommissioning ceremony of an ancient battleship. I couldn't shrug the feeling that there's something tasteless about throwing elderly war vets into a situation that sees them ""comically"" defending Pearl Harbor against an armada of E.T.s. The whole thing reeks of a botched tribute; an attempt to honor the men and women who've preserved our freedom becomes a cringe-inducing experience that's borderline painful to watch.I get what Peter Berg and company were going for, but the end result is immediately transparent for anyone who's awake enough to make it through the 131 minute run time; a poorly constructed cash-grab that overextends its welcome.",Battleship

155,ksj870,More Fun Than It Has Any Right To Be,7,1 June 2012,"On a certain level, there's no way I can claim that Battleship is a good movie in any conventional sense. The plot is incredulous and the script couldn't be riddled with more holes if you unloaded a shotgun at it. Even the idea that the movie is based on Hasbro's classic board game of the same name is rather disingenuous: yes, there is a battleship involved in the action, almost all of which takes place at sea, but other than that any resemblance to the game we all grew up playing seems purely coincidental. And I certainly don't remember any aliens in the game I had.But somehow, despite it all, Battleship stays afloat. There's a certain energy and enthusiasm to the film that is infectious, even via the big screen. The story may not make a whole lot of sense, but it is a lot of fun. The extravagant special effects—merely par for the course in any modern would-be blockbuster—are one factor, but spectacular as the many explosions, gunfights, and various displays of pyrotechnics are, there's more to it than that, an overriding sense of fun that makes all the conventional weaknesses of the film meaningless.Certainly, the cast seems to be having a lot of fun on screen. Taylor Kitsch, who stars as Lt. Alex Hopper, is an empathetic hero whose struggle to overcome his personal weaknesses is ultimately played out with the fate of the world at stake when he finds himself and the crew of his Navy destroyer in the wrong place at the wrong time—and smack in the middle of an amphibious alien invasion. Alexander Skarsgard plays Alex's older brother and mentor, a Navy Captain to whom Alex feels he has been a shallow disappointment. The gorgeous Brooklyn Decker does an adequate job as Alex's girlfriend, Samantha, whose father just happens to be the Admiral of the fleet, and played by the great Liam Neeson in a typically authoritative performance. The only real weak spot in the cast is singer Rihanna, making her big screen debut and looking like it. One can only hope that if Rihanna pursues further acting roles, she'll improvea lot.The plot isn't deep, but it does have some positive aspects, incorporating elements of personal redemption, self-empowerment, and self-sacrifice, all concepts that more movies would be well-advised to advance. And while the movie is in a sense very violent—once the aliens arrive, things start to blow up at a rapid clip—there's nothing especially graphic or bloody. The dialog isn't Oscar-worthy, but is sometimes quite witty.In the end, Battleship is a prototypical summer actioner. It's nowhere nearly as good as The Avengers, but as a very different type of film is still worth seeing if big-budget mayhem is your thing. If you're okay with a movie that doesn't stimulate your brain and requires only that you go along for the fast-paced ride and enjoy the show, Battleship is surprisingly entertaining.",Battleship
156,caseymoviemania,CASEY'S MOVIE MANIA: Battleship (2012) review,6,11 April 2012,"When the first trailer of BATTLESHIP debuted last summer, it certainly looks like TRANSFORMERS or you can say INDEPENDENCE DAY at sea.Based on the classic Hasbro board game of the same name created back in 1967, this big-screen sci-fi action adventure stars Taylor Kitsch as Alex Hopper, the reckless brother of decorated Hawaii-based naval officer, Stone (Alexander Skarsgard). Alex loves to get himself into trouble, especially when he tries to court Samantha (Brooklyn Decker) who actually happens to be the daughter of U.S. Admiral Shane (Liam Neeson). Frustrated by his young brother's wayward behavior, Stone enlists him into the U.S. Navy and hopes he can learn a thing or two about self-discipline and responsibility.Assigned as a lieutenant aboard USS John Paul Jones, he accompanies his brother and a fleet of naval officers including Petty Officer Raikes (Rihanna) and fellow crew mate Ordy (Jesse Plemons) for a military exercise. But things unexpectedly get out of the hand when they encounter a mysterious giant vessel floating in the middle of the ocean. Upon close investigation, they discover the vessel is actually an alien ship ready to engage any possible threat while on a mission to build a power source in the ocean.Director Peter Berg who last helmed Will Smith's summer-movie blockbuster HANCOCK (2008), was a Navy enthusiast ever since he was a child (his father happened to be a Marine who used to bring to Naval Museum). Like Michael Bay (who also a huge fan of military force), Berg displays a labor of love for showcasing every piece of military hardware found in the U.S. Navy. He certainly apes a lot of Michael Bay-like filmmaking style, right down the way how the story is told (which is ironically BATTLESHIP follows the similar template of TRANSFORMERS trilogy). Not surprisingly, Erich Hoeber and Jon Hoeber's screenplay is nothing than a series of clichés mashed altogether into a bloated piece of effort. The first half of the movie, which established some of the key characters, are especially juvenile and cringeworthy at best.The dialogues are terrible and the cast are strictly one-dimensional caricatures. Taylor Kitsch, who had earlier headlined the $250 million-mega flop JOHN CARTER, is lackluster. His acting performance remains as wooden as always, and frankly, he's still a mile away to establish himself as a leading action-star status worth to be invested in a big-budget tentpole movie like BATTLESHIP. The rest of the supporting actors are equally underwritten -- Alexander Skarsgard is wasted as the well-disciplined brother Stone whose character is sadly killed off earlier in the movie, while Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model Brooklyn Decker appears nothing more than just looking sexy in skimpy clothes. Popular singer Rihanna, who made her big screen debut, may look appropriately tough in a naval outfit with brash attitude but her lackluster acting leaves little to be desired for. The only worthwhile cast here is Liam Neeson, who commands his role as the no-nonsense Admiral Shane. Too bad he appears more of an extended cameo appearance.Fortunately, on the technical level, BATTLESHIP delivers enough guilty pleasure in this pre-summer movie blockbuster. Courtesy of ILM (Industrial Light & Magic), the special effects here are top-notch and Berg knows well how to make full use of the hefty $200 million budget for loads of effects-heavy action sequences to maximum impact. For an astonishing two-hour plus, viewers who fancies lots of pyrotechnics will indeed have their money's worth here. The ""flying yo-yo"" weapons of the aliens are a must-see, especially during the early destruction of the naval base and the crowded highway overpass in the city. Some of the combat scenes on the sea, especially during the final scene where the obsolete model of U.S.S. Missouri is used to destroy the alien ship, are visually engaging to watch for. If that's not enough, Berg even have time to pay homage to the classic board game where Capt. Nagata (Tadanobu Asano) and Alex Hopper uses grid-like strategy to engage their enemies.By the way, do remember to stay on until the after-credit sequence because there is a short footage which opens up a possible sequel in the future.http://caseymoviemania.blogspot.com/2012/04/battleship-2012.html",Battleship

160,cattjones,Break out the Board Game,5,18 May 2012,"I found Battleship to be pretty entertaining although I thought that it was just too long and some of the scenes were unnecessary. And who fell asleep in the editing room at the beginning of this film? Some of the editing misses were so blatant that I was shocked to see them on screen. I did have a deep appreciation for all the coordinates being given throughout the film, since it was based on the Hasbro game. The alien creatures and their machines were okay, but they did not blow me away. I almost expected to see Stephen King pop up in this film since they did invite the langoliers. Director Peter Berg obviously likes working with Taylor Kitsch (Lt. Alex Hopper) since they worked together in the television drama Friday Night Lights. Taylor was the initial rebel in this film who had to mend his ways and earn his stripes in the navy (why did I just flash to the Village People). Anyway, he was alright in this film but I like him better as Gambit in the X-Men movie. I was pleasantly surprised by Rihanna's performance as the tough Petty Officer Cora ""Weps"" Raikes. I have seen her pop up in films before, but I have to say that I think that this was her most dynamic role. The same holds true for Gregory D. Gadson (Col. Mick Canales) although I do not recall ever seeing him any anything before. If he is not truly a double amputee, he definitely had me convinced. I was glad to see that Tadanobu Asano (Cpt. Yugi Nagata) was actually a nice guy (eventually) in this film. He usually plays some hardened killer. Brooklyn Decker (Samantha Shane) was in her typical bombshell role, just like she was in Just Go With It. I think that she can pull off comedy a lot better than she can pull off drama. Battleship docks somewhere between Skyline and Battle: LA. This film kind of made me feel like if George Lucas and Michael Bay somehow had a child, this film would be it (in its infancy). I did not hate the film and like I said, it was very entertaining and definitely keeps you awake (after the first half hour), but it is not a ""rush out and see"" kind of film. I call A12 and G4 ha ha, you missed my Battleship. I am giving this film an amber light.",Battleship
161,evan_harvey,Not worth the price of admission,4,14 April 2012,"Oh great. Another movie based on a board game or toy range. Rihanna trying to act. Millions of dollars worth of CGI. Was it worth it? In short, no. At least, not from an enjoyment or artistic point of view. I'm sure the unwashed masses and kiddies will love it, so it'll probably make it's money back. Oh dear Lord! That'll probably mean a sequel.The plot is so horrifically dull it almost defies belief. Unfortunately, for the price of the $19 ticket, I was forced to believe it. All two-odd hours of it. Aliens land on earth, and then their sole mission here is to send a communication back to their own world (presumably). Supposedly they're trying to communicate with the other aliens as part of an invasion, but they're completely uninterested in actually invading. They only attack people who pose a threat, and ignore everyone else. What gives? That's stupid even for Hollywood. I find it hard to believe that whoever wrote this crud got paid for it, but apparently so. Where do I sign up for a no-brainer job like that? I know, I know, it's not supposed to be some great work of art, but that's no excuse. It sucked, pure and simple.The CGI was okay, nothing extraordinary by today's standards. Lots of explosions, lots of battleships and some Halo-inspired aliens.So, how was Rihanna in her debut role? Insipid is the word that comes to mind. Insipid means ""without distinctive, interesting, or stimulating qualities"". That sums up this pop singer turned wannabe actor's first foray into film perfectly. Maybe one day she'll be in a film where she actually acts, but til then it's just a vanity role rather than actual acting.That's not to say that anyone else does a decent job either. They're all a bit crap. Certainly this film was never meant to be anything other than gimmicky, but the actors are really just riding the money on this one.Way too many super-loud metallic sounds from the aliens, as if that makes up for lack of substance. And the super-hyped up emotional strings at the final scenes are just too cheesy and demeaning (to the audience, that is).The direction is okay, nothing special, as all these vapid novelty films are these days. the 6.6 rating (at time of review) is being overly generous. Peter Berg developed the excellent Friday Night Lights series, but there's far too little of that deft touch on display here.One review said that there was humour and it was a ""guilty pleasure"". Well, the humour is unoriginal and generic (and poorly delivered), and any ""pleasure"" is minimal. Unfortunately, most audiences will be sufficiently mentally dull that they'll enjoy the pig-swill on display here, and thus the making of films like this will continue unabated.Maybe some aliens really will come along one day and wipe out Hollywood. We can only hope.",Battleship

Do you panic? Do you surrender? Do you pay more than ten dollars to see it?In 2005, NASA has discovered a planet outside our solar system with conditions similar to those on Earth. Hoping that it contains intelligent life, they construct a powerful array of satellite dishes in Hawaii to transmit a signal to that planet. Simultaneously, unambitious Hawaiian native Alex Hopper (played by John Carter from John Carter Taylor Kitsch) meets a beautiful woman in a bar he wants to impress. The woman (played by Brooklyn Decker) wants a burrito but the bartender won't accommodate her. Hopper (Kitsch) hears this, introduces himself, and goes so far out of his way to impress her that he breaks into a minimart and is tasered by the police just as he's approaching the beautiful woman, burrito in hand. Alex's older brother Stone (played by Alexander Skarsgard) has had it with his brother's antics and makes him join the Navy. Seven years later, Alex is a lieutenant and tactical officer on a destroyer and the beautiful woman, Samantha, (Decker) has accepted his marriage proposal, pending her father's approval. Her father (played by Liam Neeson), an admiral whose character isn't given a first name, is Alex's superior who has disciplined him on several occasions and has grown just as frustrated with him as Hopper's brother has. Then, during an international exercise with the Japanese Navy, the world and the island come under attack by the very same aliens they hoped to contact.Now, this isn't the first movie ever to be based on a board game. Clue came out in 1985 and had a much better cast. Also, Clue is a game with characters in it. Battleship, on the other hand has none. It also doesn't have aliens. While there is an actual battleship late in the film, the alien munitions resemble pegs, and the crew is forced to fire blind once they've lost radar, this movie has nothing to do with the game. Other detractors seem determined to lay the movies failures at Rihanna's feet, this being her first acting role, but she really doesn't have that many lines and the failures in Battleship are so much bigger than this one minor character. Whether Transformers turned out the way Michael Bay and Spielberg wanted it to, it was a box office smash. Battleship is an inferior imitation, and I say that as someone who doesn't even like Transformers. Given how it's performing at the box office, I probably don't have to say this, but skip it.",Battleship
163,garethvk,"Tons of Issues Sink ""Battleship""",4,18 May 2012,"Hollywood turned its eyes on children's toys for inspiration. With the successful Transformers series, Hasbro has been targeted for their very popular line of board games as source material for future movies.First out of the box is ""Battleship"", director Peter Berg's big-budget adaptation of the timeless naval strategy game that has been enjoyed for decades by players young and old. Since this is the era of video games, the simplistic style of the board game needed to be tweaked in order to make it appealing for the summer movie masses.Gone is the classic strategy of the game and in its place, a loud and brash cast of 20-somethings, over-the-top special effects, and a plot riddled with more holes than the classic grids in the game that spawned the film.Taylor Kitsch follows up his role in John Carter by playing Alex Hopper, a ne'er-do-well who despite the mentoring of his successful naval officer brother (Alexander Skarsgard), never seems to run out of ways to get himself in trouble. His latest efforts to impress a girl he met in a bar, land him in hot water with the authorities and his brother lays down the law and insists that Alex join the Navy and make something of his life.The film jumps into the future where Alex is now dating the very attractive girl from the bar, Samantha (Brooklyn Decker), and trying to get enough courage together to ask her father for permission to marry his daughter. The fact that her father is Admiral Shane (Liam Neeson), only complicates the matter.Despite holding the rank of an officer, Alex is still extremely headstrong and prone to getting himself in trouble. What what was supposed to be a friendly soccer match during allied naval exercises escalates, and Alex finds himself facing an ignominious exit from the Navy. He's given a temporary reprieve as the ships in his fleet are suddenly faced with the threat of extraterrestrial origins.Approximately around the same time Alex entered the Navy, scientists developed a way to amplify radio signals and directed them toward planets they believed could possibly support life. The signals were answered in the form of a hostile force that arrives on Earth only to cut a swath of destruction across the world as well as the naval fleet it encounters. Cut off from the rest of the fleet and reinforcements by an energy field, Alex is forced into command and must confront the deadly enemy at all cost to save the world.What follows is a series of elaborate special effects that, while visually appealing, fail to pack much punch as the plot and characters are so underwhelming.I understand that for films this type, especially given the source material, one must give a certain amount of leeway and accept, even grudgingly, the inconsistencies and impracticalities. That being said, not only are the characters about as thin and one-dimensional as they possibly could be, they are for the most part utterly devoid of any interesting qualities nor are they given much in the way of back story that makes us care for their outcomes. R&B star Rihanna spends a good chunk of her time looking tough and menacing, but isn't given much more to do than occasionally fire a gun.Kitsch is so utterly bland and unsympathetic that there's just really no redeeming value to his character. Battleship is supposed to be a story of redemption but instead it's a story of inconsistencies. Many times throughout the film common sense much less standard military procedures seems to go out the window.For example, standard rules of engagement tactics were not used early in the film, but yet were readily deployed during the so-called big finale to the film with success. One has to wonder how more seasoned officers with far more resources at their disposal failed to utilize such tactics or have success with the methods that they employed. Yet ironically, this young lieutenant on his first command is able to out-maneuver these aliens when he decides to take to the offensive and lull the enemy into a fairly passive mode where they don't do much more than watch.The aliens, while interesting, are given precious little to do other than occasionally destroy or blow something up. We have no idea why they are on earth and to be honest, why they arrived in such small force. If the idea was to conquer Earth, it was poorly planned. Yet if proper procedures were followed, their incursion could have been dealt with very early and easily with the resources at hand. But that would've made for a short movie.What I found puzzling was how surprisingly light on action the movie was. Yes there were firefights but they were spread sparingly throughout the film. You do not have one grand epic battle against overwhelming odds, you do not have legions of enemy troops for the Navy to wade through. It was pretty much a here-it-is-take-it-or-leave it, ho-hum finale.The film does have some good points with Hawaii as its main backdrop. I did like the fact that there were a lot of active and retired soldiers and sailors used in the filming of the picture. It is clear that the filmmakers wanted to honor the soldiers who have so gallantly served our nation. I just wish they could've given them a much better showcase, because truthfully you'll find far more thrills and enjoyment busting out the actual Battleship game than sitting through the film.There is a scene post-credits that does hint at possible future installments, but I kept asking myself one question, ""Why?"" 2 stars out of 5",Battleship

This includes Alien with a bad guy alien, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, with a good guy alien encounter(also E.T.). Hopefully you get my point.Firstly, Humans send out a signal to see if there are any aliens, then when they arrive, the stupid Navy has a temper tantrum and starts blowing them away. Typical Neanderthal way of thinking. I wouldn't expect anything actually new from this film since it's based on a Hasbro game.(I just don't see how there is any story here except to sell more toys, and sell more Rhianna songs on itunes)Second, this film was introduced in the theatrical trailers as ""FROM THE PRODUCERS OF TRANSFORMERS!""

We watch in this film the ""American Navy"" being beaten on Hawaii ground by the Japanese, during a friendly soccer game. Pearl Harbor anyone? Anyone?This steals from the Transformers films of recent, but is lacking in juicy stuff to sink your teeth into. Not that there was ever anything to sink your teeth into in those films, Transformers strays away from the original cartoon concept as far as you could throw a golf ball in space. But this comment is neither here nor there. The only reason I mention these horrible ""Bay"" films, is that this film seems to be just like it, pretending to be all ""EPIC"" and all the while copying the exact style of the film. The only difference between the two, is that there are no Decepticons, and no Autobots. The rest seems the same. I still can't believe that a great actor like Peter Burg would succumb to Hollywood greed and be bought out by this ignorant bloodsucking failing conglomerate of corporations. Well, it's also sad to see the great actor Liam Neeson in this film, he's way too good for this Micheal ""Bayesque EPIC Garbage"" style of film.Now let's move onto the stupid rise of the ""Ocean Aliens"", being all robotic just like in Transformers. Why is it that every time they make a film about aliens it's got to be so destructive? Also why do all the alien style films have to do with killing, and about what the caveman like thinking of the military does not understand? This story line is so stupid it makes me want to throw up all over the place.Now, to keep us interested in this film, it includes all the garbage action alien stories we watched prior, we are filled with shaky cam, shaky CGI fake cam, close-ups, zoom ins and so forth. Also included is ""Transformers"" style robotic sound plug-ins. The producers couldn't even afford to come up with their own original sound effects! They just stole from the ""Bay"" Transformer films. I'd say, recycling? Don't you think?Come on Hollywood! Give us something we haven't seen before. Oh wait your just all about the money! Dumb down all the people on the planet and show them that this is the only way to make an alien invasion film. I'm going to wash this horrible film(if you want to call it a film) from my mind and go watch Alien by Ridley Scott",Battleship

167,s_campanale,Proof a board game can make a good film!,8,12 April 2012,"Saw the film at a preview yesterday. One of those films that has been built up for months beforehand, which can lead to unfeasibly high (false) expectations. However the film itself was a pleasant surprise. It did not thrust you immediately into the action but slowly built up to it, creating a slow but sure sense of impending catastrophe in the best ""disaster movie"" traditions. Indeed, it is pleasantly daring to start a major tent pole summer blockbuster with a 13 minute comedy sequence featuring someone trying to impress a hot girl by getting her an elusive chicken burrito! The tooing and froing between plot strands is also done well and one is never confused. Clear reasons are given for everything and there are none of the massive plot holes one usually gets in this type of film, and despite the length is well paced and never dull. The Aliens themselves are good, and like those in ""Battle Los Angeles"" are not some indestructible super power but an advanced but still very vulnerable enemy who make for a credible ""current global enemy substitute"" in realistic military tactics/heroics movie like this. Their ships have no ""shields"" and bizarrely they have no guns of any kind, just missiles and stabbing weapons. (If they had guns then the 2 main face offs would have ended in a couple of seconds!) And their ships have no radar either! Their tactics, destroy infrastructure and military forces, is also ""real world"" credible, and the fact that they only target ""hostile"" threats is interesting. Are we sure they are bent on world invasion? We only have the head scientist's word for it after all? They also found a clever way of sneaking in the ""city is destroyed"" scene (as usual it's either Hong Kong or Paris!) despite the invaders limited operations by having one of the ships crash into a satellite on entry and break up over the atmosphere. It was almost a riposte to ""ID4""s famous ending goof where a shower of universal destruction upon the Earth becomes just a big firework display! Also the Alien's ""Whale"" ships are very cool – advanced looking but still a fair match for our own ships. I wonder if they were modelled on Earth whales or whether there's some similar creature on their world? (A good movie raises interesting questions like those in the viewer) The old handy ""psychic transfer on touch"" cliché fills us in on motive - They've destroyed their world with Nuclear war now they need ours – Very 70's Toho! Taylor Kitsch does another great job after ""John Carter"" and I can see him becoming the new Harrison Ford. He is likable yet can find the heroic nobility when needed too. Rhianna is OK in the old ""pop star put into a film to increase its Box Office appeal"" role, though she does not do very much. Liam Neeson is also good though he has little more than a glorified cameo here, probably shot in between ""Titans"" duty. Brooklyn Decker was OK, being a credible heroine in her own right alongside the crippled soldier (another ""real world"" echo).Tadanobu Asano was good as Kitsch's Japanese counterpart, again creating a very 60s-70s Tohoesque double act. Indeed the film sets out to be internationalist, having American, Japanese and Australian heroes (the F-18s at the end) to create an idealised United Nations ideal sadly far removed from the real world. The question everyone has been asking – ""How can you make a blockbuster out of the game ""Battleships"" is answered in the way I imagined it would have been – The middle act uses the ""radar blindness"" of both navies to create a ""spot the enemy"" game based on grid references created by wave buoys. It's silly and a little slow, but it shows they didn't just take the name but the spirit too. The ending with the USS Missouri is a bit far-fetched, with the vet's turning act 3 into a sort of seaborne ""Space Cowboys"", resolving world threat by showing the hi-tech youngsters how to use the old analogue stuff. (Moral – Newer and younger doesn't always mean better!). But it works, and again relies on tactics and strategy rather than just massive firepower! It's reminiscent of original ""Star Trek"" which also used naval tactics in a sci-fi context (Best example of course ""Wrath of Khan"") The direction by Peter Berg is also very good. The film is clearly from the ""Transformers"" mould, but Berg has shown how such a Micheal Bay-esque venture can be done without a lot of the pitfalls of shaky moving cameras, juvenile sexual fixation, ultra cheesy nationalism, and incomprehensible fight scenes (my brain almost exploded in act 3 of ""Dark of the Moon!). It's as if he is saying ""Look BayTHIS is how it CAN be done right!"" All in all another excellent blockbuster after ""John Carter"" and ""The Hunger Games"", proof that Hollywood has been shaken by low sales and illegal downloads into making films with care, love and attention again after years of bottom draw dreck, Let's hope they can keep it up!",Battleship
168,GTeixeira,The sad aftermath of the Transformers box-office craze,3,5 August 2012,"If you ever saw a SyFy Channel movie, you already know how this movie is. The only thing Battleship has that distinguishes it from a SyFy movie is Liam Neeson and great special effects. Think SyFy meets Michael Bay.The script is really bad, full of the typical 'aliens invade the Earth' movie clichés. Characters aren't well developed, with weak, clichéd situations and dialogue. The main character is terribly unlikable for the most part, and no one else really makes you feel connected either. The acting is bad, though in some situations they manage to do well enough with what they have(I still can't tell if Rihanna is a horrible actress or if it was just her character).The aliens are as badly developed, but more likable than the humans. The technology they are shown to possess is seemingly capable of crossing entire solar systems, but when they are shown they are so horribly limited, suspension of disbelief can only help you so far. They are never given a reason to invasion either: we get a short, 'Independence Day'-style flashback implying they are bad, but they actually act nobly most of the time.They basically overlook a lot of plot to focus on the Michael Bay explosions.There are a few good and/or mildly fun scenes, mostly the big naval fights, but none are innovative or original: if you ever saw a special effect-packed science-fiction movie, you already saw everything Battleship has to offer.",Battleship

173,mergatroid-1,People have no imaginations anymore,8,15 September 2012,"No, I'm not talking about the writers, I'm talking about the reviewers on this site.This movie was fun to watch, has an exciting run all the way through, and great effects. The plot is fairly simple (it's an alien invasion movie, what do you expect?) but the production values are first rate and the script is fine.No one would expect a movie based on a board game, especially not ""Battle Ship"", but here we have it. If it was a movie about WWII it may have been good as well, but they decided to make it a scifi. That's fine with me as I'm a big scifi fan.So, the aliens land in the ocean, but their communications ship hits a satellite and crashes. Four other ships survive but have no way to ""call home"". They try to take over a communications facility that was used to contact them at the beginning of the movie.Three guided missile cruisers get stuck behind a barrier created by the aliens, and it's up to them to fix things. Eventually they are all destroyed, but one crew survives and since the movie is called Battleship, they need to find one to take the aliens out.Sure, this movie is not feasible, but it IS a good movie. 90% of science fiction movies have holes in their plots and stories, but you ignore them because you're into the movie. This is no different. Anyone who liked movies such as Independence Day should also enjoy this movie.I bought it on blu-ray and I've watched it twice already. I know several people who saw this in the theater (including one fellow's grandmother) and to a person they all said they liked it.Pay no attention to the movie snobs.

174,Theraxorterminate,Meh.,1,15 February 2014,"The word ""Meh"" was exactly the word I've been thinking throughout the whole movie. I was expecting to see a corny big action movie and would also hope that it also could have been at least entertaining, but alas it wasn't entertaining at all.I found the movie to be incredibly stupid and (if not) also predictable. This kind of Blockbuster movie is too stupid to enjoy with, I want to see a Blockbuster movie that can have some interesting and good values of true entertainment and this is what this movie does not have. The presentations of the protagonists are dull, uninteresting and also awkward. And not even the main villains are interesting but they are also unexplored and it feels like they come to Earth only to take over our universe just like that without any clue or reasons.The action sequences are not only illogical and bad but I found them to be boring to look at after half an hour when they started to care too much of the destruction's and the illogicality of the action made feel a bit frustrated especially more on the end. They were using an older battleship to defeat the aliens and I thought: What the heck? That certainly can't even be at least possible to defeat the aliens!And I seriously hope there's not going to be a sequel, because I think one movie that is based on the board game would be enough to prove me how sometimes stupid Hollywood could be.Is it recommended? If your'e looking for an entertaining movie I would not recommend this stupidly, boring action movie. I would dare to say that I would rather recommend you watch the Transformers trilogy instead of this boring trash. Yes I know the Transformers trilogy are bad movies too, but at least their action sequences weren't so boring as this movie.",Battleship

176,RolloTomasi,This can be enjoyable if you don't take it seriously...at all. Not even a little.,6,3 June 2012,"I saw this film even after it bombed on its opening weekend, and received the near universal scorn of critics and the general public. See, they showed a trailer for it before Wrath of the Titans (another one that landed with a thud) and I said, now come on that's a really great trailer. How bad can it be? There's got to be some value. I was curious to see how they tied it to the board game. And Peter Berg directed it. He typically does well with this kind of thing. So I dropped $5.50 for a matinée (not too bad) and saw it, having had nothing better to do at the time. I went into it though with an advantage that almost no one else had: Low Expectations. Yes, I believe those helped these proceedings out a lot. Sometimes when greatness is not expected, goodness can be found. I thought there were some good ideas in this, like the destroyer hiding in the cove and waiting for sunrise, then shooting the aliens' glass out to blind them. the following scene where the super cannonball takes the destroyer apart was nice. I liked the idea of the veterans getting one last call to ""kick ass"" on the old school battleship. Now, the ship was in the process of being decommissioned, right, so in theory there would still be weapons about. Uhhnnnn...all right well the whole thing is pure fantasy anyway. Cut it some slack. It's kind of a tribute to the old sci-fi movies, the ones that would have been bad even WITH great special effects. In marketing the film, they made the mistake of cutting these really great TV spots and theatrical trailers together that made you think you were about to see something great. But they also figured you'd still be thinking, how seriously should I take something that's based on a board game. They went to NO EFFORT to hide the fact that they'd built this film around a BOARD GAME. That should really have been your first clue. (Hey, they made a movie out of ""Clue,"" too--and it flopped. I guess they'll never learn)",Battleship
177,aaronjbong,Interplanetary War Set at the Seas,8,14 April 2012,"Alien invasion is one of the most popular subjects in the world of Hollywood films, and the board-game-based ""Battleship"" is the latest in line to incorporate this theme. Produced at an estimated $200 million and just like any other alien-invasion movie, the film offers plenty of spectacular and explosive action scenes, accompanied with outstanding visual effects. With all this going on, ""Battleship"" looks just like an ordinary alien-invasion movie. Perhaps what distinguishes ""Battleship"" from other movies of its kind, is that ""Battleship"" sets the interplanetary battles at the seas.The main protagonist of the film is Alex Hopper, played by possibly rising star Taylor Kitsch, who recently played the titular character of another big-budgeted sci-fi film ""John Carter"". He's unserious around the first minutes of the film but starts becoming serious later on. During his training, the naval fleet encounters extraterrestrial battleships that reside on the Pacific Ocean. The battleships came as a response to a transmission sent by the scientists to another Earth-like planet located in another galaxy called Planet G. The extraterrestrial battleships then wage war against Earth and it's up to Alex Hopper's efforts to save the world and mankind.The alien ships are massive in size and are equipped with some foreign weapons. Some of the weapons are not-so-advanced and those include bombs that can dig an extra meter into whatever they land into, to cause extra damage. The more advanced ones include gigantic spike-covered wheels that are pretty deadly and can cause serious damage to anything solid that they come across.The extraterrestrial beings themselves are ugly in appearance (man, humans are damn pretty). All of them have rough, bushy beards and little hair. We only get to observe their facial details for a short time because most of the time, they're covered in high-tech looking powered exoskeletons/armor with helmets that make them resemble the characters of several sci-fi video games (particularly ""Halo, ""Crysis"", ""StarCraft""). However, we never see the full potential of their powered exoskeletons.Like most films that incorporate heavy battle scenes, ""Battleship"" has some flaws. The most notable of this is the plot. It has a plot, the naval fleet encounters the extraterrestrial ships and a series of explosive battles ignite. But some of the main questions that pop up to our minds are never answered. Why did the aliens invade us? Was it because they wanted something? Was it because they are seeking refuge? Was it because they were running out of resources? If so, what were they running out of? These are some of the questions that never got to be answered.The visual effects of the film is undoubtedly amazing. The explosions, the battleships, and the details were perfect and one of the best. Its outstanding special effects compliment its heart-racing action scenes and make it even more powerful and exciting. The suspense never diminishes and the movie always keeps you hooked from start to end. Anyone who is looking for intense action scenes will find more than enough in this big-budgeted sci-fi film. Taylor Kitsch, who recently appeared in the fantasy ""John Carter"" is the main protagonist here. Here, he receives far more dialogue and is able to showcase more of his skills than he could in ""John Carter"". He gets to play an unserious guy in the first minutes and gets to play a serious and determined man later on. Alexander Skarsgård plays the role of Stone Hopper excellently. He really knows how to play a big brother and even though a minor role, he deserves attention. Pop singer Rihanna makes her film debut as a bad-ass girl named Cora Raikes. The bad-ass attribute is perfect for the pop singer and thus, she makes a terrific performance for a debut. The others were also fine although I felt that the comedy given out by the guy in the middle of the story was redundant.""Battleship"", as some of you know, is based on a board game created by Hasbro, the creator of the ""Transformers"". So, there's a connection between the two, and many people are either calling ""Battleship"" 2012's ""Transformers"" or whatsoever. ""Battleship"" is different from ""Transformers"". ""Battleship"" is a battle against humanoid aliens at the sea while ""Transformers"" is robot vs. robot with humans serving no purpose except causing trouble. Please don't compare this with ""Transformers"" because ""Battleship"" is in a lot of ways, way better than Michael Bay's ""Transformers"". While ""Battleship"" may have some plot issues, there's a balance of story and action so the action does not go on forever, which is not the case with ""Transformers"". ""Transformers"" bring out action almost every single moment in an attempt to amaze audiences with its special effects without paying attention to its weak plot and wooden acting. ""Battleship"" is terrific entertainment. It has outstanding action sequences and amazing visual effects to further add a layer of suspense to the action. The acting was not too shabby to burden the overall experience and there was enough storyline to keep audiences interested. Please do not confuse this with ""Transformers"" which is all about action and action and action. ""Battleship"" is in a lot of ways better than ""Transformers"" and is sure to keep you people entertained. Rating: 8/10Final Verdict: ""Battleship"" is an impressive alien-invasion movie set at the seas that offers more-than-enough sequences of intense action, jaw-dropping visual effects, satisfying performances, and enough storyline to keep audiences interested.",Battleship
178,Schuriken,I believe I can touch the sky....,4,9 October 2012,"Well the cgi is really cool if you are a 6 year old boy and the acting is ...emm less than nothing. Only the old navy guys are cool.Snipers shooting the screen off the alien ship for the sunlight to blind the aliens so the human ship could continue destroying the alien ship eh ? OK....maybe them bullets could find their way to the core of the alien ship and blow it up.Liam Neeson shows up on screen a total of 35 seconds (maybe a bit more) in the entire movie and that Rihanna girl looks like a smackhead shemale with a cap glued to her head. She could have jumped to outter space without a space suit and that cap would still stay on her head.Don't get me wrong I kinda enjoyed this movie but some characters and scenes are horrible. The aliens had really cool suits but without them they looked funny and fake.This movie tries to be epic and emotional at the same time but these two I think were not mixed in well together along with the computer explotions. The old battleship at the end could save this movie even if it was 4 hours long. Great choice, clever writing right there.Last but could be best, we should have seen at least one human battlefield crash into the huge alien ship that would be cool but the scene was cut. I would love to see that !! Rihanna survives this scenario with her hat on too.Futures Battleship 2 & 3 are expected the same way and maybe they will do a movie mush up Philadelphia experiment, Event Horizon and Jaws.",Battleship

So if you're from the states, you might not care about the two things that ruined it for me.The premise of making a board-game into a movie itself is already stupid. Still stupidity can create great movies (i look at you, ""Hangover""...). Alas, they chose to create an half-serious action movie with a heavy military background. Given the movie is called ""Battleship"" that sure was to be expected, but the amount of sweet, sweet Navy-heroism was several layers too thick for me.Also i didn't get any serious idea of the motivation of the aliens, which makes the whole thing feel like a propaganda-movie: Bad guys, especially aliens, are just bad and have to be killed. That might be satisfying for the typical right-wing-voter, but i prefer my movies at least a little bit deeper. Even action movies work better when the bad guy has reason for being bad. Hence i found it also rather tasteless to have the rather social-critical ""fortunate son"" from CCR as the ending song.Beside that it's exactly what it promised: Good action/catastrophe cinema US-style providing the necessary visuals and sparing you of any story, good acting or logic.

181,Legendary_Badass,"Well, It Doesn't Sink",7,19 May 2012,"In Battleship, the film based on the classic naval guessing game, Taylor Kitsch plays Lieutenant Alex Hopper, an unpolished navy prospect hurdled into a leadership role when aliens attack Hawaii during an international navel exercise.These aliens as somewhat humanoid and crustaceanesque. Surprise, surprise there isn't a great deal of thought put into them as characters. OK, there's isn't any effort whatsoever. It's a Battle Los Angeles scenario, but even less so as they're not even here for our resources. They do have toys. I say toys because they play with the human warships and are surely designed to end up in plastic form as Walmart. There's a ship that hops across the sea for no apparent engineering purpose. They also deploy spheres that can bifurcate anything.I'm taken back by the amazing amount of attention to detail found in the setup for human characters. Hopper is made out to be such a goof that it's initially a stretch to believe he's the protagonist. He brakes into a convenience store in a scene that quite comically mimics infamous security camera footage. There's even a soccer sequence that looks better than most sports films. Credit that to director Peter Berg of Friday Night Lights, the TV series spin- off of which produced star Kitsch. The trailer doesn't hint at esteemed performances, but Kitsch gets it together. Hopper has a drastic arc that most films of late forget to include. His main buddy Raikes (pop superstar Rihanna) does no harm in her debut. Same goes for budding talent, supermodel Brooklyn Decker. These aren't the most robust roles, but established actresses wouldn't have improved upon the final product.As par for the course the humans are hopelessly outgunned. The situation sounds more like the attack on Pearl Harbor than it appears, and the coming together of American and Japanese forces is reminiscent of the unification films that preached the North and South as Americans. This is further bolstered once the vets come on board, helping to man the USS Missouri, giving the film its titular battleship. Good luck finding a summer blockbuster with an audience this old in mind.It's shocking that Battleship is watchable, but even more surprising that the board game gets worked into the plot without causing eyes to roll. Calling it a popcorn movie sounds like an exception, as though it's allowed to be stupid or shallow so long as it's entertaining. I'm not overlooking the plot holes, and if you expect a giant production to have more refinement then Battleship isn't going to float your boat. It does some things better than The Avengers . With comparatively lower expectations, Battleship arguably has an easier course to make good on delivering.Check out video review of Battleship as well as all my reviews as my website VaughnOnMovies.com",Battleship
182,clarkj-565-161336,Rihanna Rocks!,8,2 June 2012,"If I was being attacked by Pleidians, I would want Rihanna & Brooklyn on my team!! I think Science Fiction is Nature's way of preparing us for events that will happen in our future. Consider for example the works of H.G.Wells in the early 1900s. Many of his themes such as atomic weapons and moon travel became a reality shortly after his works were published. If you want to know the future, then artists and writers often seem to have a better vision of what faces us than our scientific community. In Battleship, we get to see former enemies, the US & Japan, cooperating in a large naval exercise. The shots of the ships are really impressive and when the Missouri gets going, seeing such a huge ship manoeuvring is truly awesome. I thought all the characters were well portrayed, especially Rihanna as Petty Officer Raikes and Gregory Gadson as Lt.Col Mick Canales. I thought it was an interesting that the aliens used a sort of ""hedge-hog "" like anti submarine weapon against the fleet ships! I loved the quips about Sun Tzu, the dialogue was very to the point.

Okay, the character development wasn't great but it was a fun movie to watch; you wanted to know what happens next and enjoyed it. I wouldn't at all call it predictable and the special effects were awesome! The design for the aliens weren't the best but they explain why and the alien suits remind me a bit of an Iron Man/Transformer armour; and talking of Transformers, lots of people say it looks like Transformers, its a spin-off, a spoof and it didn't at all feel like a Transformers movie, maybe they borrowed a few sound effects but apart from that I can't relate anything to them.There IS a post-credit scene that supposed to set up a sequel but it doesn't look promising.",Battleship

I won't take up much time dissecting this film it's purely forgettable.However it was interesting as an alien invasion film. It had a different take, where it shows it from the point of view of a naval fleet coming across a spaceship in the ocean.The visual effects were at times impressive as they managed to get the size and scope. They were also kinetic showing the alien tech as constantly moving. At times it looked downright like a CGI shot and you're still wondering how Jurassic Park is more photorealistic.Now the truly god awful acting. I don't know if the script writers wanted to get this over with so they can pursue their dream project or the casting crew wanted to save money, or maybe both. None of the actors (I'm using the term lightly) were convincing as people in the navy, with the exception of the Samoan guy. There's an abundance of looks but not talent. The lines had such an awful delivery and was so rushed. The main guy was supposed to be this screw up who leads his crew through adversity but I really didn't get that vibe. All I got was a model pretending to be a sailor. Then there's the sports illustrated chick, seriously? I was only staring at her... you get the idea. The Matt Damon look alike, well not much.What really epitomized the awful acting was Rihanna. Oh sweet lord. Who's idea was it to get a West Indian pop singer to play a badass American navy chick? All the time I kept hearing these tough guy lines that shouldn't be coming out of her soft voice. And what accent was she supposed to be doing?

185,benjaminweber,Laughable B Movie,2,4 August 2018,"Probably the best place to start with this film is by noting it is a sci-fi action film based on a board game that can be played with two bits of paper. Sounds really exciting, right? But it gets better, with the actual gameplay mechanic being used in during one of the naval battles! This film has the level of quality you'd expect from a film based on a game that originated in the 1930s. The characters are one dimensional and the plot is stupid. The cast can all act, but the writers deprived them of anything to work with. The cinematographer overuses lens flares to the point they become distracting. The villains are never properly developed, they just attack, but only sometimes, and have seemingly no motivation other than being hostile invaders.The whole thing comes across as something that was written as a joke, but was somehow made. Definitely watch if you like bad films! 2/10",Battleship
186,changmoh,"Attack of the Alien Yo-yos, Actually",7,10 April 2012,"""BATTLESHIP"" opens with an introduction to Alex Hopper (Taylor Kitsch aka 'John Carter'), a brash young man who pulls all sorts of stunts without thinking first. This is especially so when he wants to impress a pretty lass named Samantha (Brooklyn Decker) who happens to be the daughter of US Admiral Shane (Liam Neeson). To get him out of trouble, his brother Stone (Alexander Skarsgard) enlists him into the US Navy - where his reckless behaviour gets him into even more trouble.In real life, Alex would be deemed a regular jackass but to Hollywood script-writers, he has all the qualifications of the 'reluctant hero' in their action fantasies. This 'heroic turnaround' happens during a huge naval exercise in Hawaii when critters from a distant planet attack Earth with much superior weapons. Teaming up with other unlikely heroes like Petty Officer Cora Raikes (Rihanna), Capt Nagata (Tadanobu Asano) and crew mate Ordy (Jesse Plemons), Lt Hopper puts all his skills to the test to save the world! The action set pieces here are not as awesome as last year's ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" but the early scenes of crashing buildings and exploding battleships are convincing enough to put the point across that the world is being invaded. Director Peter Berg heightens the excitement by showing the point-of-view of the aliens as they prepare to shoot - and the 'flying yo-yo' weapons of the aliens produce extensive destruction for maximum visual impact.Berg rightly anchors the story on its characters, providing humorous glimpses of how some people react to the alien threat. Of course, we get the feeling that we are missing the 'big picture' because the action is concentrated only on a handful of individuals. We don't get to see how others are affected by the massive destruction elsewhere. These are just mentioned on the TV news.It is interesting that Kitsch is starring in two of this year's most expensive movies: John Carter (at US$250 million) and Battleship ($200 million). However, unlike John Carter, Kitsch has a better and more developed role here. His Alex is a bit of a caricature - and Kitsch plays him with the requisite touch of humor. Neeson provides the 'veteran thespian' stature to the proceedings as the no-nonsense Admiral while Decker has the eye-candy role even if she is not as sexily decked out as Rosie Huntington-Whiteley in ""Transformers: Dark Of The Moon"".Singer Rihanna is unimpressive as Raikes - a role similar to Michele Rodriguez's Trudy in ""Avatar"". Maybe she does not have good lines - but then most of the dialogue here are sloppy. Also, in order to enjoy the action, we have to overlook the numerous plot holes and suspend disbelief a great deal, especially near the end where we are to accept that a famous 70-year-old battleship can be recommissioned to do heavy battle in just a matter of hours.THE VERDICT: Hey, everything up on the screen is silly, but ""Battleship"" is guilty fun and the effects are awesome!

187,jcallows,just like the board game!,6,14 August 2016,"Spaceships, aliens, worldwide destruction! What does that remind you of? Exactly. Your favorite childhood board game, Battleship. Now finally you can see all that on the big screen.Actually, this film might as well have been called Monopoly, Scrabble, Chutes and Ladders, Hungry Hungry Hippos, etc. because it had just as much in common with any of those games as it did with Battleship. But whatever.Poor decision to base this film on a board game and to use a story we've seen too many times aside, it's got some really cool special effects. Change the title, reduce the running time from 2 hours to around 90 minutes and cut down the ""character development"" since it just dragged and didn't add anything depth anyway, you have a pretty good movie.",Battleship
188,alexandermangoldt,Comedy of the year,4,15 April 2012,"I went to see this movie at a late night screening on Saturday with a buddy. Unfortunately, the movie was being shown in a theater with comfortable lounge seats, so we had to pay extra. We both more or less knew what we were in for: A Transformers spin-off with great looking but mediocre actors, plot holes in abundance and the usual cheesy and temporarily corny American patriotism. But we thought: What the heck, if the action is spectacular, we might be able to forget about all that. Ten minutes into the movie, we realized that we wouldn't. Taylor Kitsch playing Alex Hopper is so over the top the protagonist that has character flaws at the beginning and turns out to be the good, noble soldier at the end, that it hurts. The whole movie smells of NAVY propaganda from the start, with the proud but honestly strange looking veterans, the blatant display of battleships, clean white uniforms and blonde babes that fall for all that. When the Taylor Kitsch character turns from former felon to highly respected naval officer, we knew we had to do something. In tacit agreement, we changed our perspective and started to think of this movie as a comedy and not an action movie. And, quite frankly, that did the trick for us. We laughed, chuckled, giggled and kept rolling our eyes for the rest of the film. We laughed at the fact that technologically developed aliens could be annihilated by simply dazzling them with sunlight (if only they had worn better shades, strange that RAY BAN missed out on such a great product placement opportunity). We laughed when we saw Peter MacNicol (as Secretary of Defense) asking stupid questions about the nature of the attack so that the dumb viewers get what 's going on. We chuckled when we learned that the USS Missouri, a museum battleship, is still equipped with all its explosive weaponry. We giggled when the veterans came out of nowhere to go on their last mission (as if they had been living and waiting on the USS Missouri for 50 years) and we had to roll our eyes when Liam Neeson, whom I admired in Schindler's List and found great in Taken, lowered himself by acting out some dreadful scenes in a horribly flaccid film. We left the movie theater laughing and waited to see if the movie goers who had obviously liked the film went to the cloakroom to pick up not only their jackets but their brains, too. Bottom line: If you want to enjoy this movie, think of it as a comedy.",Battleship
189,gazzalodi,Easily surpassed my very low expectations,7,11 November 2012,"After all the negative reviews I had avoided Battleship until this weekend. I have to say it turned out to be much better than I expected. Yes, the script is simple, the entire outcome can be surmised by the time the opening credits are finished. Deep philosophical discussion is not what I was expecting. It's a movie where stuff gets blown up. And it delivers on that.The movie never takes itself too seriously, the burrito incident makes this point early on. The actors all give a solid effort within the limited range of character development. There are some minor issues with reality, such as how the younger Hopper could ever get a commission in the Navy with his background. But since we are talking about an alien invasion movie, things like that shouldn't be looked at too critically. It was also pretty impressive how they shoehorned in the board game as well. If you didn't know the game existed you can still watch those scenes and not be left scratching your head.The 'old guys rule' theme brought out at the climax was way over the top, but it was done in a way that actually had me grinning and tapping my foot to the music as they delivered on the whole premise of the film. Stuff gets blown up.If you want a film that delves into the complexities of the human condition in the post industrial world, skip this movie. If you want to see big things go BOOM! this is a great fun flick to kick back and turn your brain off to.",Battleship
190,TroyeEvans,Battleship: Heated Action Coupled with Disappointing Story,3,28 May 2012,"Another of Hollywood's great investment down the drain. A brief review is sufficient to sum up the entire movie.There is no way one can deny the intense action and visuals going on, though the diversity of landscapes remains lacking, as most of the run-time displays a vast oceanic war between, well, battleships. Aliens' high-tech shape-shifting energy-emitting battleships versus the navy, to be precise. This is easily compared to recent The Avengers, which is definitely more story-driven and well-written, more commercially successful, and brings a higher degree and greater variety of action. Battleship falls flat in every single aspect in the match.In other words, it is a Transformers-style effortless writing of a script that disappoints. Unoriginal and cheesy and a cookie-cutter action sci-fi, if you want to put it that away. If you are going to the cinema to watch this for the pure action, it may still be worth your money. However, if what you seek is something beyond, if what desire is a refreshing and creative plot-line, don't bother.",Battleship
191,tgooderson,Transformers on water + Rihanna = Pants,4,12 April 2012,"Battleship is loosely based on the board game Battlships and stars Taylor Kitsch as an unlikely hero in a battle between the US Navy and alien invaders. We see Kitsch at the beginning of the film in a bar being told he has to think about his future. He is 26 and without a job, living on the sofa of his Naval Officer brother's house. He is reckless and seemingly lacks direction. Then suddenly he is a Lieutenant in the US Navy and in charge of the weapons or something on the USS John Paul Jones (which isn't named after the Led Zeppelin bassist unfortunately). While out on manoeuvres with an international fleet off the coast of Hawaii, Kitsch (and Rihannasigh) are sent to investigate a crashed UFO somewhere in the Ocean. It transpires that five alien ships have been dispatched to Earth after a transmission to their home planet. After travelling though millions of miles of space, one ship inexplicably hits a satellite in Earth's orbit, while the other four plunge into the Pacific Ocean. Admiral Shane (Liam Neeson) orders a warning shot which starts a battle. A battle with ships.I was sceptical going in about how a film could be made based on a game I used to play with my dad using two pens and a maths exercise book. For about five minutes, two thirds in, the film succeeds in making a film like the game. This sequence is also exciting and interesting. For the rest of the film, bar the odd overhead shot of ships in formation, it might as well have been any old Naval action movie.There is so much wrong with this movie that I could go on for pages but I'll try and keep it brief. Firstly, the dialogue is atrocious. It's like it was written by a teenager who has seen two action movies. It is so cheesy that it is actually funny. Secondly, the acting is really bad. Good actors such as Neeson and Alexander Skarsgard have no more than fifteen minutes of screen time between them and instead we are left with Rihanna who mainly sits by a computer and says ""Yes Sir!"" I'm pleased that she didn't take the Britney Spears Crossroads route into acting but she hardly sets the world alight and her casting is an obvious attempt to draw in people who wouldn't see the movie without her in it. Brooklyn Decker spends most of the film standing on a mountain with a legless man, looking confused but pretty. This is apart from one scene in which she is somehow channels Colin McRae and becomes a rally driver. She is nothing more than eye candy here. After the critical and commercial failure of John Carter, Taylor Kitsch again fails to impress and lacks the charisma to carry the film. I personally think that Skarsgard would have been a better choice for the role. He completely outclasses Kitsch in their scenes together and has bags of charisma. The whole film is played far too straight. It is always so serious. Blockbusters used to be fun and this definitely isn't.Much of the film is stupid and makes no sense. After an alien craft destroys a 7,000 tonne Cruiser, a mile away, it then fails to blow up a rubber dinghy carrying Kitsch and Rihanna which is ten feet from its hull. Also, after a ship has been destroyed with tremendous loss of life, someone asks Kitsch if everyone is OK to which he replies ""Yes!"" What he meant to say is ""Well I'm fine, Rihanna's fine and the Japanese guys alright too"". The entire plot is as full of holes as the destroyed Cruiser while the obvious product placement will have you stopping by Subway on your way home to pick up a Coke Zero. One thing that really annoyed me was the constant robotic/electronic noises which permeate the whole film. They are present in most sci-fi action films but just sound ridiculous. The film's ending is ridiculous too.The next paragraph contains spoilers.After aliens have destroyed all of the modern ships, Kitsch et al find the 70 year old museum ship the USS Missouri and along with about five shells and a crew of pensioners manage to defeat the aliens when 21st Century technology has failed! Its admirable that the film makers used real WWII Veterans but their inclusion helps to pile on the cheesiness.Spoilers over.On the plus side, some of the GCI is good. The design of the alien ships and particularly the aliens themselves were excellent. A lot of though had gone into what they looked like and why and they were very believable. Another aspect I liked was that the aliens are never the aggressors. This also felt realistic and believable. If we went to a new world, we wouldn't go in all guns blazing Independence Day style but would identify targets and differentiate between friend and foe. At the beginning of the film I thought that maybe this would be a rare Blockbuster in which the USA doesn't go it alone but apart from a token Japanese guy, the excellent Tadanobu Asano (Zatoichi) this turned out to be the case.The message the film delivers is commendable but is unfortunately lost in the explosions. The film is trying to tell us that sometimes the old ways are better and that we shouldn't rely too heavily on technology but the way it tells you is ridiculous and laughable. On the whole the film is a massive disappointment. It is too long, it takes itself far too seriously, is no fun and features terrible acting and dialogue. The relationships feel false and while you'd expect a side of cheese, here it is served as the main course. If you want to watch Transformers on water then this is for you but if you want something more you need look elsewhere.www.attheback.blogspot.com",Battleship
192,slayerjmk95,Finally...,8,8 April 2012,"As you all know, there have been MANY alien invasion-type movies being and have been released in the past year and this year, but among them stands a box office giant, and that movie is Battleship. The story is set around a naval fleet that accidentally makes contact with aliens known as ""The Regent."" Soon, the world is thrown into chaos as these creatures have a hidden agenda of which did not involve human presence, which is now to be dealt with in the most severe way; annihilation.Masterfully directed by Peter Berg, this action-packed blockbuster is a great film to kick-start the coming summer, filled with a dozen other blockbusters. At first sight, it just seems like another brainless Transformers movie, but when you're given the creative and complex story of Battleship and the battles that do take place, you are watching something new. Taylor Kitsch was fantastic as Lt. Alex Hopper, an officer assigned to the USS John Paul Jones, who also wants to marry Samantha Shane (played by beautiful Brooklyn Decker), the daughter of Vice Admiral Shane, played by the powerful Liam Neeson. Rihanna was just a supporting actress who wasn't the greatest, but had her alright moments, where you didn't want to see her blow up in a fiery ball of death. My favorite thing about this film, what makes it original, is it shows you the film through the aliens' eyes as well, not just focusing on the actors; this lets you in on the big secret. The visual effects were astounding, definitely making this an epic sci-fi actioner; plus, the score by Steve Jablonsky was intense and haunting, perfectly in unison with the scenes of when the tracks are played. All-in-all, Battleship is a great addition into the sub-genre of alien invasion films and should be made into a new franchise because if it is, Transformers will and can be surpassed. The differences: Transformers is all action, very little plot, and undeveloped script. Battleship is a complex, yet simple plot with epic and intense action sequences, but a good script with some clichés.8/10 Stars***",Battleship

Let me help you..1. The movie is called 'Battleship'. (First hint: It might not be Oscar material) 2. It is inspired by the game. (Warning: It will definitely NOT be Oscar material) 3. Taylor Kitsch and Rihanna are cast members. That's a business/marketing decision, guys, and has probably little to do with their acting. They're young and hot and will work for less than, say, Michelle Rodriguez and Chris Evans. (Taylor, if you're reading this: Please forgive my rudeness. I promise to go watch John Carter to make up for it. No wait, I can't promise that! Sorry) 4. Come on, did you watch the trailer with your eyes and ears closed? So why don't you follow my example: I wanna see it, because I enjoy pointless entertainment to a certain extent. A movie called Battleship? Hell yeah!

Taylor Kitsch is a stubborn screw up first lieutenant aboard one of the ships cut off from the rest of the fleet. He and his group of inspiring die hard crew and cast mates made up of pop star Rihanna and the beautiful Brooklyn Decker face off against the aliens and their superior technology. This movie has the feel of a "" not in my house"" kind of attitude with big time special effects to go with a huge budget (which is the reason why it's considered a bust).

I actually felt like I was watching a Nazi propaganda film from World War II.It is scary that Hollywood plays such an important role in brainwashing the youth of the world for financial gain.

202,lekgolah,A 130 minute effects demo,4,3 May 2012,"Based on the board game of the same name, I guess you can say that Battleship delivers on what it promises but with aliens for enemies. There is a lot of action, but unlike the board game that features a lot of hits and misses, the film tends to miss most of the time.After a tedious introduction, the aliens are eventually introduced and ILM take over delivering visually impressive effects again and again but unfortunately there is no sense of danger or emotion. With three ships caught in a force field as they are shot upon to pieces, there should be a sense of danger but there isn't any. Instead the film plays its biggest hand first with a lengthy mind-numbing action scene, taking away any sense of escalation for the film. While the CGI is great, it lacks any sense of immersion, choosing wide (shaky) shots of the action, rather than getting in close to the characters who are in danger and could soon die. Yet the film will zoom in up close to a sphere-like robot as it mindlessly destroys a freeway. It is ironic then that the best scene is almost devoid of effects, as the characters use a computer, similar to the layout of the board game, to fight the aliens at night. There is a slight sense of suspense and allows for a break from the rest of the mindless action. CGI effects aside, the script and direction is all sub-par, giving uninteresting scenes so that we, the audience might relate to the characters. The actors are all poorly used including Liam Neeson who can usually help a film like this. However, Japanese actor Tadanobu Asano helps to keep the film's head above the water whenever he is on screen, providing military tactics to Taylor Kitsch. By the end, the film is an unsatisfying mess, taking a couple of minutes towards the end for everyone to have their photo taken together using a product placement phone...

Liam Neeson and a young ensemble give life to this cliche'd story.The retired battleship USS Missouri---which was denied use in 1992's ""Under Siege"" due to security concerns (as she was still active when that film was shot)---is featured here as herself. (In 2001's ""Pearl Harbor"" she played other ships.) She was a nice touch.The film was pretty silly, but not to the point of retching. A lot of fun to it despite the serious tone of alien invaders.

208,JamesMitchell451,Beyond stupid... but...,6,21 September 2013,"You know for a movie based on a board game Battleship is actually a hell of a lot of fun. It's plot is basically a bunch of alien ships touchdown in the pacific, activate a dome that traps several ships of the United States Pacific Fleet inside, and begin tearing it up. Now, from a critical standpoint Battleship has a lot of problems. The acting isn't very good, the dialouge is wooden, and the plot doesn't really make a whole lot of sense. However, I was never bored for a single moment during Battleship's run time of 131 minutes, mostly due to the films many action scenes. All of which kick so much ass. And plus the special effects look AMAZING. Battleship is the clear-cut case of a guilty pleasure for me, its' like a roller coaster, it's dumb, loud, and unnecessary but yet it is so much fun that when it is over you walk out saying ""I don't know why this was made or why I paid for it but yet I'm glad I did"". This is the type of film where you check your brain at the door and just lay back and relax and prepare for a fun 2 hours of aliens and the navy shooting at each other. Battleship is a very enthusiastic rental.",Battleship
209,antoinebachmann,"relatively fun, basic ""guys flick"" - nothing more, nothing less",6,4 May 2015,"""Battleship"" is a ""guys flick"" that contains a ton of clichés of the genre, and a fair number of inconsistent or at least illogical elements. But, the pace is pretty good, the special effects are generally good, and Rihanna is even not that bad an actress! ;-) So all in all you've got something worth watching with (guy) friends, ideally on a day when your brain is a bit tired and you've had a couple beers already, and you'll enjoy it. On the other hand, anyone looking for something intellectual, original, etc. should definitely look elsewhere!WARNING: some SPOILERS (not on the plot though): - you send a message out at the speed of light. Yet within a couple of MONTHS, not only has that signal reached a planet about 20 light years away, but its inhabitants have arrived! - classical good disciplined brother vs. loser but more fun brother. In the end the loser ends up as the best ever man on earth - classical ""government people"" don't understand the situation at all but still insist that the military go out and crash more planes against a forcefield - classical bad guy in love with the best girl who is also the daughter of the most important older guy. And then said bad guy proves so so good that he gets the girl, and is accepted by the father - aliens with advanced technology prefer to use Earth's dated technology to transmit to their home planet - aliens with advanced technology have a non-tainted glass window to protect the bridge of their super-duper spaceship. So all it takes is to get the sun to shine in their eyes, and a couple sniper shots at them, and bingo! - aliens who possess powerful weapons, including flying cogwheels that can eat through a battleship in a matter of seconds, or destroy a whole airbase in less than a minute, still leave an older docked ship so that it can take a shot at them later... The same older ship is left alone by the aliens because it has pointed its canons away for a second. So advanced aliens consider a weapon a threat only when pointed at them? Hmmm. - an older docked battleship can be restarted and be readied for combat in a matter of minutes by a team of a half-dozen older crewmen plus a couple youngsters - aliens who have established a force-field of several miles radius, are apparently unable to establish small force fields around their ships to protect them from simple ammunition from Earth. Makes for a more balanced fight - but still illogical. - if you prevent four alien scout ships from communicating back home, then their mother planet will never send other ships to check what happened to them? Hmmm.",Battleship

The aliens behavior is unexplainable, but I presume that they only kill in defense. They try to establish a communication with they homeworld, but to what purpose? To tell them where they are? They probably didn't tell anyone on they planet where they are going and before the trip they have destroyed all data received from Earth. On the trip toward Earth the navigator was probably drunk and they managed to crash land after zillion miles. Their technology is not much advanced and they are still using multiple launch rocket systems and fists and American battleship form WW2 was able to defeat them. We also have overlong and superb unfunny beginning of the movie, big breasted blonde, commercial for USN prosthetics department and blatantly using of WW2 veterans. The aliens have managed to destroy couple of buildings and bridges, two American and one Japanese warship, one police patrol and minds of poor viewers. Ah...if only all alien invasions were so unbloody.But I give this movie grade 2 because it immunizes the viewer and makes him more prepared for other Blockbuster-no-brainers yet to come to terrorize the surviving poor souls.",Battleship

Pacific Rim is going to suck, that is the next upcoming Transformers copy.But anyway, onto the review for this. Battleship has a below decent story (trust me, it is a crap story) but great action and effects. While this isn't exactly a great idea, they did manage to impress me. But seriously, basing a movie off a toy franchise is okay, but basing it off a board-game and making it a Hollywood blockbuster, nope not a good idea.The trailer made this movie look so awesome and when I saw ""BATTLESHIP"" come onto the screen, my face was in my palm and stuck there. Seriously this is a decent movie, but it was a HUGE disappointment to be fair. I was expecting an awesome story and everything, but instead all we got was a Transformers copy that had the worst possible storyline for ANY Sci-Fi film. And most definitely the worst thing to base it off.Imagine this, imagine if ""Barbie"" became a movie and then they added aliens and the girls had guns and they killed everything. THAT! Is what the idea for this movie is like. Although it has many flaws, I still enjoyed it, the action was great, effects were, acting wasn't too shabby.

214,markdroulston,Bored game,2,11 April 2012,"Sitting in the theatre last night, a line from an old Tool song was  rattling around in my brain. ""One great big, festering, neon  distraction"" was used by the band to describe the state of California,  but the description couldn't be more apt for Peter Berg's BATTLESHIP. A  deafening, blue and orange military recruitment tool, the film can't  even sustain its laughably simple premise, and attempts to promote a  message so unappealing to its target audience I was left questioning  why it even exists.  Story is the least important element here, so lets just say that in  between all the sweeping helicopter shots and blinding lens flare, an  international Naval war games exercise is interrupted by alien  invaders, and it's up to reckless officer Alex Hopper (Taylor Kitsch)  to save the day. Kitsch delivers solid character work early on, but  soon gets lost in the cacophony of bangs and seizure-inducing editing  which leaves little room for the human story. Inexplicably added to the  mix are pop star Rihanna, seemingly here for no other reason than,  well, she's Rihanna, and Liam Neeson collecting his paycheck for around  10 minutes of screen time. But, as I said, we're not here for the  story, rather the spectacular action and special effects right? The bad  news is that when the aliens finally show up, BATTLESHIP's pace  strangely slows to a crawl (no doubt due to the limited options offered  by the source material), and all potential excitement and interest  evaporates. Director Berg forces the idea of teamwork down the  audience's throats (Japan and the US fighting together in Hawaii?  Wonders never cease), and doesn't even try to disguise his recruitment  agenda. Indeed, the film is little more than a hyperkinetic music video  (oh, that's why Rihanna is here) designed to lure impressionable youth  into signing up so they too can fight the 'alien invaders'.  Herein lies the problem however: young people today almost definitely  don't play Battleship. Basing a tentpole film on a board game seemed  like a daft idea from the outset, but recent cinema history has seen a  theme park ride turned into a critically and financially successful  franchise, so precedent is there in a way. Unfortunately for Universal,  even those of us who grew up in a pre-internet/Xbox Live world remember  Battleship as a desperately boring endeavour, so how can it be expected  to compete in today's short attention-span culture? The strange  metaphor that Berg attempts to craft in the film's third act,  suggesting that we need to remember and re-appraise the past, just  won't fly with 21st century teens bred in our disposable, constantly  updating world of technological wonder. BATTLESHIP's strange  juxtaposition of bombastic special effects framing ancient board game  mechanics simply doesn't sit right, and it's hard to imagine the teen  audience, so crucial for success at the summer box-office, tearing  themselves away from the latest CALL OF DUTY to embrace the turn-based  'excitement' of this ridiculous film. No amount of explosions can  salvage a limp and underwritten movie, and BATTLESHIP, not entirely  unexpectedly, is torpedoed by its own outdated inspiration.",Battleship
215,dreamdemon-1,A brave candidate for the most idiotic film in history,1,15 August 2012,"This is one of those few movies that is not only idiotic but displays the greatest collection of unlikable characters that you automatically root for the aliens so that they rid the planet of them.The plot is obvious from the trailer: alien invasion, aliens are bad, the good & brave Navy is all that stands between humanity and extinction ... and they must prevail!So here are my thoughts:1. For once the Americans are not alone against aliens: there are also Japanese people there. 2. The Japanese are the only people in the movie with enough wit to outsmart the technologically superior aliens 3. The most idiotic scene: the main character, a Lieutenant, throws a tantrum wishing to kill everybody on his ship but instead ends up getting most of the Japanese killed and then refuses to save them. Instead of the normal way of putting a bullet in the overgrown teenager's head and giving the command to just about anyone else (as everyone around the poor sod shows various degrees of common sense, which should qualify them for command by default), the crew actually begs the retard to return and lead them! 4. I couldn't look at Rihanna getting all sorts of wet without thinking: so where's your umbrella now? 5. Alexander Skarsgard is the only actor worth watching and he dies near the beginning! 6. Liam Neeson gets the prize for the most useless character in movie history 7. The movie displays outrageous amounts of cheesiness. 8. So you have 40 minutes to destroy the aliens' means of calling for reinforcements and instead they challenge the mother ship to a fight. The only reason they have one round left after that seems like pure luck. How retarded is that??",Battleship

How can you spend 200 million bucks on a movie and nobody notices the screenplay is total rubbish. The first half hour or so is meaningless and has little to do with the main plot. Tha last 15 minutes is just as bad. The action and CGI is brilliant, the plot was written by a five year old. The guy running around robbing stores and shagging the admiral's daughter is a Commander in the navy. The USS Missouri, a museum ship knee deep in families and kids, carries live munitions. You can light the boilers, raise steam and sail in about 5 minutes. The Missouri only needs a crew of ten geriatrics.

Fun blockbuster escapist fun! Story - I won't give away any details. Just know it's a creative way to take the board game Battleship and make a movie out of it. Yes it is very far fetched. But movies with a sci-fi twist sort of have to be. I found it both derivative and creative. If you liked Independence Day and Transformers you will like this movie. Cast - excellent. Even Rhianna was good! No clue why she got trashed. Small role. Well done. Taylor is great as always. And adding in real life soldiers was the best. A big shout out to Gregory Gadson - no CGI for him. Thank you for your service. Effects - Amazing. They really did a jaw dropping job. The navy boats look real and I am sure they are often CGI. Overall the effects were seamless and realistic. This was a big budget movie and it shows. Music - I have to give a shout out to Steve Jablonsky. The music was riveting and contributed greatly to the movie experience. Overall - I rate it equal to Independence Day, Pacific Rim, and the first Transformers. Creative. Imaginative. Entertaining. Escapist fun. Oh, and it holds up great under repeat viewings. Sure there are plot holes. But to me the creative aspect outweighs it.

224,gstepup,Peter Berg direct BATTLESHIP with slightly cramped style and cheesy clichés,5,16 May 2012,"BATTLESHIP is another alien-attacks-Earth movie, and Peter Berg (who also acts) nimbly directs the whole shebang -- but scores badly. Taylor Kitsch (who was perfect in JOHN CARTER, a supposed flop) topbills as a 27-year-old drifter who is pushed by his more competent brother (Alexander Skarsgård) to join the Navy. His opening scene: burgling a closed convenience store to get food (a burrito) for a girl (Brooklyn Decker) he wants to impress. His closing scene: receiving citations for his bravery and a promotion as Ship Captain. Middle scenes: being thrust from Lt. Commander to leader of his squadron as they battle bizarre aliens and gigantic UFOs crashing into the Pacific Ocean. Little else can be expected from a story based on a popular (?) video game, with Berg piling one ludicrous premise upon another (aliens colliding with an orbiting satellite, Americans and Japanese fighters united together in Hawaii to fight the invaders, Kitsch and his team make use of a 70-year-old museum ship, the USS Missouri, after the aliens have bombed all the modern ships, etc.) and throwing every conceivable cliché but the kitchen sink. Kitsch is helpless in the quagmire of CGI effects and any impression he made with JOHN CARTER (which impressed me) is totally wasted here with his underacting. Alexander Skarsgård is classy and Liam Neeson throws in his ten cents' worth (literally, ten minutes screen time), along with the geriatric extras who play war veterans (who used to man the USS Missouri). Rihanna's film debut is no great shakes but obviously done with relish. Decker is mere eye-candy, with little dramatic scenes provided for her -- notwithstanding her adventures with a paraplegic soldier as they combat aliens up close and personal. Perhaps the saving grace of this cheesy film are the fight scenes and the CGI effects, tensely directed and moodily photographed with the ubiquitous lens flare (debatable whether fake or not). For many others, the closing scenes end up as preachy propaganda. Berg has directed several films before BATTLESHIP, with much more subtance, grit and humor: THE RUNDOWN (2003), Friday NIGHT LIGHTS (2004) THE KINGDOM (2007) and Will Smith's HANCOCK (2008), which had generous doses of human drama. Hopefully HANCOCK 2 gains Berg back what BATTLESHIP squanders away.",Battleship

I wonder if these people even saw the movie, because there was no hint of racism, sexism. Someone claimed there was a Japanese hate thing going on, but what??? Some of these arm chair critic must live on anti-depressants, because their glass is always three quarters empty. It was a simple story of a guy meandering through life with no purpose. His brother gives him a purpose, and he force fits that role until tragedy strikes. Now, he's called to step up and grow a set. It's arguable that he ever does. Like Harry Potter, things just seem to go his way, but isn't that how it is in life? For sci-fi fans who LIKE ""TRANSFORMERS"" you've got to suspend disbelief and go a long for the ride. Iaylor Kitsch has a Chris Pine like quality to him. You just like him. What's not to like about Brooklyn Decker, but she played more of a role than I expected and quite frankly was pretty good, not showing a full range of emotions, but enough to satisfy the acting skills critics. I thought Rihanna did more than a ""yeoman's"" job, and she was on the screen a lot more than I expected. She has a natural screen presence, but I think we already knew that before she actually got on the big screen. Okay, it was corny, contrived and just a lot of fun.

Gathered at Pearl Harbor are the global navy elite for some international war games, lucky this is when aliens attack. NASA has constructed some communication beacons in the hills of Hawaii and out of the blue, some very bad ET's are phoning in. There is lots of very funny moments amongst the carnage with Taylor Kitsch redeeming himself after the debacle of John Carter plays Hopper, a misfit officer in love with the admirals daughter . Co-star Brooklyn Decker is actually significant as Hopper's love interest caught on land hiking (don't ask) while the movie debut of R&B star Rihanna looks great in navy fatigues, isn't given much to say and may have found her niche running around holding a weapon. Battleship is a good non thinking adventure, Peter (Very Bad Things, Hancock) keeps things moving and obviously loves his cast giving them free reign to have fun, that translates to the audience.

Its lead character is introduced in one of the stupidest scenes of 2012. At this point, it actually can't get any worse. But boy does it try. It goes on to bring us Rihanna spouting some really weird lines and Hollywood's favorite Scifi trope of featuring a semi advanced alien threat. True, the CGI scenes are a spectacle: the enemy ships look awesome bounding on the water and those saw-like machines (which you see in the trailer) make for the best parts of the film.

It's about this guy who joins the navy and finds himself in charge of a battle against aliens from the Gliese system.In all my life, I never thought I would see a movie where the aliens come from Gliese, a solar system containing a couple planets that may be habitable for humans. But out of all alien invasion movies, it was one based on a board game that did it first ... at least I think so.Battleship is a fun movie. It's got some good characters, great sci-fi aspects and some awesome action scenes. The movie takes a giant breather after a couple big battles, but even then the sci-fi and mystery elements of it keeps the viewer entertained ... even though it still has nothing to do with the board game, besides a battle scene containing a few references.The movie has some extremely funny moments. The comedy in the movie is great. It's not just a generic action flick. It's actually pretty damn good in many aspects.Battleship is not a perfect movie. Even though it's not terrible, the breather from the epic action is noticeable and a bit disappointing. It makes the movie a bit boring. Another little thing is that having Rihanna in the film feels kind of out of place and is a little distracting. Like, what is Rihanna doing there? It's not like she's an important character to the story or anything, she's just there as a commercial tool.

It's so bad that even writing a review is somewhat mentally traumatic. I usually have a set way of measuring how good a movie is: if I skip trough most of it, it's bad.

This movie is probably to watch for a kid, a lot of ""kabooms"", ridiculous battles, alien doohickeys, a lot of ""very serious"" storyline that a child's mind won't mind. If you can imagine the U-shaped curve, on it's rightmost side you have ""this movie is so good that it's amazing"" and on the other side ""this movie is so horrible it's actually good"", then Battleship falls right smack down the middle at the lowest point of the curve that should be called ""this is so bad it's a violation of UN Decloration of Human Rights"".

The answer is ""In Battleship, I didn't know how they were going to get out of the next situation, and I kind of cared, and I wanted to find out."" It's that simple. Yes, the dialog is insanely clichéd and the acting is pretty wooden and there isn't much character development. But there's just enough to keep it compelling, which can't be said for anything from the unholy alliance between Michael Bay and Hasbro. And ""Battleship"" even has a few clever and funny one-liners amidst all the mayhem. If it really bothers you that this movie portrays U.S. Navy (and Japanese navy!) sailors as heroes able to adapt and prevail against overwhelming odds, then there's really nothing more to be said to you - except maybe ""Don't watch it on FX then, because they are actually airing commercials for the U.S. Navy during the presentation"". Oh and, um, it's a science fiction movie based on a board game called ""Battleship"", did you expect the good guys to be from Amnesty International?I don't really want to list any spoilers but I also don't want to be blacklisted over ""Battleship"" so I checked the box anyway. I'll just list a few of the funnier/stranger plot items and then we'll move on to the career-damage check.I loved the scene where the U.S. Navy losing a pick-up soccer game to the Japanese navy was played out with all the drama of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Classic. And yeah, I know it was for the RIMPAC Cup, but still.I hope everybody noticed that the alien projectiles are shaped similarly to the pegs in the classic game of ""Battleship"". Unfortunately, the aliens never learned to take turns - they fire at B4, C7 and D5 at the same time. On the other hand, it is quite noteworthy (and has been noted by others) that the aliens go to great pains to distinguish threats (conveniently highlighted red) from non-threats (conveniently highlighted green). That's also kind of their undoing - could that be the message of this movie, that it's better to shoot first and ask questions later?!? OK, I can see how that might bother some people. Then again, the aliens did shoot first unless you count Taylor Kitsch touching their spaceship as an attack... Kudos to the scriptwriters for the intricate layers of moral ambiguity! I'm still wondering why, when all of the alien technology was directed at the military, transportation, and urban infrastructure of Hawaii, a bunch of policemen in Jeeps were so focused on getting a couple of hikers off of an isolated mountain. At least they were kind enough to abandon 1/3 of their off-road vehicles at a time when all roads to the mountain had been destroyed.(Minor spoiler alert 1) The only thing that really disappointed me in this movie was the post-credits bonus scene. I was hoping it would be a teaser for an upcoming movie based on Gnip Gnop.Career Damage Check: 1. Rihanna - She's still a mega-talented, mega-successful recording artist, and she's been friends with the monster and Eminem since this movie was released, so she'll be fine.2. Liam Neeson - He spent most of the movie on the outside of an alien force dome, which shielded not only his character but also his career. And during the viewing on FX I saw a commercial for his new, Taken-like, ass-kicking movie, so he'll be fine. 3. Jesse Plemons - Although forced to team up again with his Dillon High School buddy (and box-office albatross) Taylor Kitsch, he will be remembered much more for his role as ""Meth Damon"" on Breaking Bad, proving that the man has talent and range. So, he'll be fine.4. Brooklyn Decker - She's fine.5. Taylor Kitsch - Although this dude will forever be associated with two of the biggest box-office bombs in cinema history, he's quite handsome and ripped, so I imagine he does alright with the ladies, so I'm sure he'll be fine. Besides, since I liked ""Battleship"" much more than I expected to, I really can't hold this one against him. And since I could never make it more than 20 minutes into ""John Carter"", despite multiple attempts, I'd say I wasted less time on his duds than on lots of other actors'.6. Peter MacNicol - I don't remember the last time I saw anyone from ""Ally McBeal"" on my TV screen, so relatively speaking I guess he's doing better than expected. Finally, (minor spoiler alert 2), if you did not get at least a little teary-eyed during the scene where all the old-timers stepped up to save the day, then you might be un-American. And yes, there's nothing wrong with being un-American, unless you happen to be a U.S. citizen.",Battleship
235,merdiolu,Annual US Armed Forces Recruitment Film - 2012 version,1,12 April 2012,"What is a fact is a fact. There is no denying. Peter Berg and Universal execs probably envious of big box office profits of latest trend of Michael Bay Aliens vs US Army , decided to adapt another of Hasbro titles , old ""Battleship"" game into a movie. That's right. Video games , comic books , action figures all run out. Now boardgames are latest target of stupid , empty headed but CGI overloaded studio production.Actually whole movie is a huge excuse for cramming as much CGI explosion , special effects s possible. Characters are paper thin boring clichés. To increase appeal photogenic super model like actors who can not act are in the movie ( neither Brooklyn Decker nor Rhianna can act worth a damn. There are in movie for eye candy. Liam Neeson has just 10 minutes of screen time. Taylor Kitsch was not too bad in John Carter but in Battleship his character is worst kind of stereotype , suffering from Captain Kirk syndrome) but like in GI Joe it does not help. Actions of aliens make no sense and are not defined. Producers probably decided that Air Force , Marine Corps had enough fun repelling freaking alien invasions so it is Navy's turn. Story is weak. So they added every possible cliché from sci-fi genre : instant battlefield promotion , male hero taking responsibility in crisis , his hot girlfriend involving a pointless secondary story ( a trick in script writing that dates back to disaster flicks of 1970'ies ) US military kicking ass of faceless aliens ( when these freaky fictional aliens will learn that in Hollywood fairy land they have no chance against humans with cocky attitude ? ) etc....What else ? Ruined cities check , geeky scientists check , trashed military hardware check , no blood or casaulties in ruins check , middle aged government officials making emergency conferences shouting computer screens to hammer gravity of crisis check , evil genocidal aliens with energy shields , powerful weapons , interstellar travel and other overdone technological advances check , same aliens having a weaknesses in their tech to be exploited in CGI battles check , cringe worthy exposional dialog check....List goes like that.Make no mistake. Battleship will make money probably a decent profit due to its marketing campaign for targeted audience ( teenage , uneducated young adult populace who do not know how to distinguish between quality and cr..p. They are majority audience ) Box Office performance usually determined by shape of your marketing and selling your movie to your audience. But a year from now I doubt anyone who watched Battleship , basically Independence Day made for 2012 season ( come to think of it Roland Emmerich could also direct this ) , will remember that they paid cash to see it without embarrassing themselves.Universal just expanded 200+ million dollars for a bad militaristic seasonal product. Can you point out how different it is from Battle LA ? Even old World War 2 propaganda movie ""Why We Fight ?"" has more substance than this one",Battleship

237,richy1024,Plastic board game gone boom... with the addition of a few aliens.,6,27 September 2012,"As soon as the trailers for this film were released it wasn't too long before audiences began to recollect the days of coordinates and plastic ships. Placing a white tag for a miss and a red for a direct hit on your battleship. The producers of the Transformers trilogy have rewarded board game lovers with a visually stunning version, and I doubt the toy house package never comprised of combat alien spacecrafts capable of pulling its weight on the water better than your battleships themselves? Communication and world dominance seem to be the recurring drive behind alien invasion and we rely heavily on the lethargic combatant to serve his country proud and save the world, whilst charming the ladies or attempting to impress the majority, including his dedicated brother and his girlfriend's father who ironically so happens to be chief commander of this operation. The story certainly places us in a world of sophistication and glamour. These aliens are big, bold and meaningful, but one cannot ignore the suffering it undergoes due to Hollywood's incapacity to tell a first-rate tale whilst being accompanied by the impressive images. Study the latest Transformers film (Dark of the Moon) and you'll understand this problematic concept. Liam Neeson is always convincing and it was always going to be appealing to see how pop sensation Rihanna would adapt to movie life. To her credit she performs rather emphatically considering the disappointment of most singers on the big screen.Although the film reminds us of the basic but dazzling board game and it temptingly worth the watch, regrettably it fails to live up to the intensity of eyeing up your adversary on the other side of the board, anticipating their every move without the advancement of radar innovation and pretty faced marines.",Battleship

Rihanna was great for her first motion picture and Brooklyn Decker was more than just eye candy. Taylor Kitsch did a good job as well however he portrayed a rehashed character. The reluctant hero. The delinquent who after a tragedy becomes responsible. It's Independence day, meets Pearl Harbor. What's funny is how after the harsh criticism that Michael Bay has endured over the years, now everyone is using his very techniques that brought him that very criticism. Incessant slow motion shots. The constant over head shots. The loud noise. His obsession with blowing up everything in almost every scene. This movie uses every Micheal Bay trick known.I liked that none of the characters are stereotypical. The special effects are great, however the action, isn't new. Aliens attack and a small make shift crew saves to day.It's a fun two hours with the family.",Battleship
239,MC1-Bjornson,Man Your Battlestations,6,30 May 2012,"""Battleship"", Rated ""PG-13"" for Adult Situations, Adult Language, Mild Sexual Innuendo, Violence, Mild Gore. Running Time: 2hr&11mns.My Take: **1/2 (Out of ****)It never ceases to amaze me how Hollywood studios attempt to turn anything into a movie. This includes theme park attractions, toys, video games and board games. In the case of ""Battleship,"" it is the latter. Can a board game be successfully adapted into a full-length feature? A better question: when it comes to Hollywood taking your hard-earned dollar, does it really matter if the movie is good or not? I ask this rhetorically.""Battleship,"" budgeted over $200 million, has all the elements of a summer blockbuster movie. Many films like this can also tank and sink film studios with them. The recent box-office bomb ""John Carter"" fiscally hurt its studio, Disney, and resulted in the resignation of their studio head. I only bring this up to show you what ""Battleship"" is up against and I'm not talking about aliens with missiles. The characters of ""Battleship,"" like the film's premise, are also set up like pieces on a board game grid. The movie opens with the gifted slacker Alex Hopper (Taylor Kitsch, ""John Carter"") trying to impress the attractive Samantha Shane (Brooklyn Decker, ""What to Expect When You're Expecting""). She is the daughter of Admiral Shane (Liam Neeson, ""The Dark Knight Rises""), the commander of the U.S. Navy Pacific Fleet and the boss of Alex's brother Stone (Alexander Skarsgard, ""True Blood""). In a last ditch effort to become productive, Alex is persuaded by his brother to join the U.S. Navy. Fast forward a few years and Alex (referred to as ""Hopper"") is the tactical officer onboard the destroyer USS John Paul Jones. He is still something of an embarrassment to Stone, who is now the commanding officer of the USS Sampson. While in the preparation for the international joint fleet exercise RIMPAC (Rim of the Pacific), Hopper finds himself in hot water with Admiral Shane and Hopper's future in the Navy is in doubt. Lo and behold, alien spacecrafts crash land in the Pacific Ocean, smack dab in the middle of the RIMPAC exercise! They are belligerent, with the intention of conquering Earth. The alien spacecraft generates a dome-like force field keeping outside interference away. Trapped inside the force field are a handful of ships from the RIMPAC exercise. They take action against the alien threat. Hopper's group decides to use weather buoys to track the underwater movements of the aliens with a grid. Hmmm, this tactic reminds me of a particular board game. There are things in ""Battleship"" that do not make sense. I fail to understand why a raft with about three Navy personnel, under the protection of the gun-toating Gunner's Mate 2nd Class Raikes (Rhianna), would speed over to an alien craft the size of 20 aircraft carriers to ""assess"" things. That's like a mosquito visiting a heavily armed rhinoceros. Why anyone would leave the ship to do this and what they thought they could achieve is beyond me. What did I miss here? Also confusing me was why would the alien ships land in the Pacific Ocean during RIMPAC? Why didn't they land in Washington D.C. or at the Kremlin or somewhere like that? It must have something to do with the satellite dishes in Hawaii that can broadcast into deep space. Oh. Well then, never mind""Battleship"" also has a few nice sub-plots. The best one involves Samantha and the Army amputee Lt. Col. Canales (Gregory D. Gadson). He has mechanical legs and he is reluctant to learn how to use them. Samantha coerces him into a nature hike in rural Oahu when the alien invasion takes place. How rises to the challenge of doing some reconnaissance against the alien and overcome the adversity of his new handicap is nice to watch. Granted, this film is a fantasy, but having the characters proactively engaged shows positivity that helps drive the movie. The original ""Battleship"" board game did not have aliens floating around the Pacific. It was a watered-down naval strategy game. My hunch is for the film version, aliens became the bad guys for two reasons. Reason #1: Aliens sell movie tickets. In the wake of the financial successes of the ""Transformers"" movies, making the baddies resemble and mimic the ones from ""Transformers"" guarantees teenage filmgoers will have a built in interest in ""Battleship."" Reason #2: It might not be politically correct to portray a given nation or other groups engaging in an all-out battle with the Pacific Fleet with the goal of world conquest. I should point out that ""Battleship"" could have been a period piece set during World War II, which would have been more naval and true to the board game. Oh wait, that might not generate the kind of ticket sales from the teens unless there are aliens on the screen. I guess I can rule out a career in movie marketing. Though there is a nifty tie-in to WWII during the last third of the movie which is definitely a crowd pleaser. Director Peter Berg (""Friday Night Lights"") deserves credit for taking this material and making it as fun for a screen adaptation as possible. Still, the movie is nothing more than bubblegum. It is also funny to note the leading man in this film is named Taylor Kitsch. The word ""Kitsch"" is a derogatory German word meaning tawdry, vulgarized, or pretentious art, literature, etc, usually with popular or sentimental appeal. I think it's ironic that Mr. Kitsch is the lead in both ""Battleship"" and ""John Carter"". I'll just leave it at that. ""Battleship"" is only somewhat satisfying. I think the script and the editing needed one more polish. Though it is a light and breezy film, the clichés and formulas in it have been done better in other films. That and there are better ""kitsches"" out there.",Battleship

While it is pretty clear, that this was Mr. Kitsch last appearance on big screen for a while, why is Liam Neeson in that?This movie is not only as innovative and fresh as a 60 year old battleship, it will sink like it too. The plot, the CGI, everything is a complete rip-off. The alien design is again from the ""wouldn't-it-be-cool-department"", nothing makes any sense except of looking ""cool"". Again the technological abilities of the aliens are blatantly contrasting the intelligence of their behavior, and their vulnerability. Again, knightliness, patriotism and bravery compensate any technological advantage of the blasphemous aliens. Unfortunately the CGI doesn't compensate for the boredom and insulting stupidity of that flick.

244,HollywoodJunket,A Sinking Ship Saved by Special Effects!,5,16 May 2012,"Hasbro has joined forces with Universal Pictures to bring the term ""you sunk my battleship"" to a tangible reality in the film ""Battleship"", directed by Peter Berg (""Hancock"", ""Friday Night Lights""), about Naval officers steering clear of invading Alien vessels threatening to take over planet Earth.At the center of this battle are two brothers- Alex (Taylor Kitsch) and Stone Hopper (Alexander Skarsgard). Alex starts out in the movie as an intelligent slacker whom needs to apply himself and get motivated to move off of his brother's couch, get a job and become a productive member of society. Alex's older brother Stone is a commanding officer of USS Sampson. After Alex pulls his last stunt inspired by a beautiful young woman Sam Shane (Brooklyn Decker) and the daughter of Admiral Shane (Liam Neeson), who quickly becomes his girlfriend, that results in him getting tazed. Stone insists he join the Navy. Also starring singer Rihanna in her film debut as Petty Officer 2nd Class Cora Raikes. She's the one that gets to fire the missiles! This new venture for Alex at first is literally fun-and-games as he participates in the ""Rimpac"", the largest international war games. Upon sailing back out to sea is when the planet comes under attack by huge alien sea robots as well as hitting terrestrially in targeted cities: Scotland, France, Iowa, Hong Kong and Hawaii where the movie takes place. What could be the root of all this? Military officers in the movie stated that in 2005, scientists discovered a planet with a climate similar to Earth. And, this project is called the ""Beacon Project"". When the United States sent out a signal, it got back an alien response. The invading group of aliens picked Hawaii as the main target because it happens to be the only place in which they are able to send a direct message to their planet to send more alien troops to Earth.Within a closed-off proximately, brothers Alex and Stone must dictate orders for the crews on each of their ships - Alex's is destroyer ship John Paul Jones and Stone's is called Sampson. With five alien vessels to ward off and eliminate, the fight doesn't go down without the sinking of a ship or two. This results in the John Paul Jones going down in traditional Titanic style. A similar scene is used here as well as in ""Pirates: Band of Misfits"" where the propellers are spinning as the people must escape the ship. Alex is left with full crew, but without a ship and without a brother. Eating his own words of comparing a ""battleship"" with a ""destroyer"" in that the battleship is like a dinosaur and the destroyer is like the terminator that will not go down, Alex takes charge of a new ship, the ""Missouri"" - a battleship that is 70 years old, operating in all analog -that means manually with mathematics figuring out coordinates. The Missouri also comes with most of its original Pearl Harbor Vets, now in there 60s and 70s. This becomes a very patriotic scene- watching heroes of past working against an invasion with current heroes in the making.Though receiving first-billing in the post film credits, Rhianna took a back seat and was utilized as a less impactful version of characters typically played by actress Michelle Rodriguez. Main actor Taylor Kitsch, previous work includes: ""X-Men Orgins: Wolverine"", and ""John Carter"", took-on a Josh Duhamel type performance and look. The best and most memorable performances came from Liam Neeson, Gregory D. Gadson who plays a double leg amputee retired Colonel Mick, Hamish Linklater as Scientist Cal Zapata, Tadanobu Asano as Nagata, and Jesse Plemons as Ordy.""Battleship"" resonated a typical ""Independence Day"" style/propaganda film. The most appreciative part of ""Battleship"" was the CGI which was demonstrated in top-notch. Many times during action scenes, the film feels like it's taking you on an amusement park ride, and when it's not doing that, it feels like you're inside a very high quality video game.The underlying theme for all male characters in ""Battleship"" was each of them displaying their own war-fighting, survivalist skills in proving their masculinity to others and validating it to themselves. The final war scene in ""Battleship"" makes-up for any and all other short-comings the movie may have. MOVIEGOERS- There is a bonus scene after the end credits. ""Battleship"" opens in theaters Friday, May 18, 2012.www.HollywoodJunket.com",Battleship
245,faisal_khatib,I fell for the tweets that were hailing it as a good movie. I should have stayed away.,3,15 June 2012,"From the people who brought us the extremely stupid Transformers, Battleship was already dead in the water (pun intended) in my books. Then I fell for the tweets that were hailing it as a good movie. I should have stayed away.FYI, a battleship is a heavy warship with extensive armour protection and large-calibre guns. This film is based on a board game called Battleship.*long pause*I know movies have been made based on video games before, but I don't see enough material in a board game to produce a film inspired by it. Next thing we know they'll be releasing a Farmville movie *shudders*So some idiots at NASA thought it was a brilliant idea to send out a random signal of invitation into space. To their complete obliviousness, the signal is answered by technologically advanced small fleet of alien ships. In true Hollywood style, these aliens can not only travel through space, create impenetrable force fields, have telekinetic powers and superior weaponry, but are conveniently handicapped by the 'oh-so- bright' sun, with a complete lack of common sense. So they get their butt kicked by a bunch of veterans, bad actors and a decommissioned battleship while leapfrogging over water with the US flag flying high.Lieutenant Alex Hopper (Taylor Kitsch) as the movies protagonist is a mix of depressingly bad acting and utter annoyance. Alexander Skarsgård as his brother Commander Stone Hopper seemed a lot more convincing and should have lived instead. Brooklyn Decker as Alex Hopper's love interest Samantha Shane had the ""daunting task"" of looking confused and distressed most of the time while being the eye candy. The love/hate triangle created between her, Alex and Admiral Shane (Liam Neeson) was off-putting. Liam Neeson seemed to be there just for the pay check and snooze walks through his tiny role.Rihanna as Petty Officer Cora 'Weps' Raikes was just there to add a headliner name to the poster. John Tui as Chief Petty Officer Walter 'The Beast' Lynch was the one-liner sidekick with not much else to do. Gregory D. Gadson as amputee Lieutenant Colonel Mick Canales was believable until he goes hulk on some clueless aliens. Hamish Linklater as Cal Zapata was the squeamish nerd while Tadanobu Asano as Captain Yugi Nagata was the Japanese flavor in the film.I think it's obvious by now how much I did not like this film. The characters are badly written, the screenplay is utterly pointless, the dialogues are terrible, the story makes no sense and there is nothing in the way of intelligence. But all is not lost. The CGI is brilliant and the action scenes are well choreographed. I especially like the usage of the bird's eye view to show the standoff. The design team behind the look of the aliens and their ships did a commendable job. Also, the way the aliens differentiated between a hostile and a non-threatening situation was an interesting take on an alien invasion. Even with their plans of a full-fledged attack, they were never the aggressors in the one-on-one combat.After getting away with the rubbish that was the Transformers trilogy, maybe it was assumed that Battleship would face the same fate. Fortunately it did not and hopefully it'll put an end to the idea of trying to sell a senseless paper-thin story with CGI awesomeness. *long pause* I know that's not going to happen but a man can hope...",Battleship

Films like this usually have bad storyline and unlikable characters. And Battleship proved me right.Battleship starts with telling us about the characters. They spent 40 minutes telling that. I don't mind a little bit of human story but this is just too much.The acting and writing is so cringy. Especially Rihanna. Her character is so annoying and her acting is bad. And Liam Neeson, whom I am a fan of, only has about 6 minutes of screen time. More like a cameo than 'starring'.In the middle of the film, the alien saw a little boy and decided not to kill because he is innocent and has a heart. They really could have changed the ending to a more special one except 'the hero beats the villain'.Also there is an after-credit scene possibly saying there's a sequel.

250,darkraven_109,Nice to look at and nothing more,4,19 April 2012,"No one was expecting Hollywood would so be s*** out of ideas and turn a board game into a movie but in the end we have BATTLESHIP, a movie based on the classic board game involving taking down your enemy's entire fleet through luck and grid reference. But this one has aliens which were strangely absent in the original source material.Ridiculous as it sounds on paper, BATTLESHIP was made and here we have a passable summer time killer.The special effects in the movie are impressive; I watched a regular screening so I can't say much for the 3D. The combat between Earth's naval ships and the alien machines was done well though it wasn't as tense as one could hope for. They're just nice to LOOK at; there's no sense of urgency or dread when the guns are loaded or when the enemy ships arm their missiles. The editing in the action scenes was a bit choppy but thankfully this does little to hinder the fact that they're nice to look at.The movie wasn't advertised as having a thought provoking story or anything serious; the crew behind the movie knew that they made it to be nothing more than a popcorn movie that doesn't take itself seriously which is why unlike CLASH OF THE TITANS the special effects don't seem to be a hindrance to the simple story. Though I just wish someone took the time to improve the alien design which looked like it was cheaply ripped off from a video game.But the story itself isn't even worth mentioning; sure, it's a simple alien invasion but that's about all it is, there's nothing more to it. There's no character development, it's extremely predictable and it seems amateurish. There were some good laughs here and there and bits of what could've been character development but never are they expanded. Even for a simple alien invasion movie the dialogue the characters said seemed forced; never do they connect to the audience in some way so when someone goes down or when someone's in danger, you don't feel anything. The writers tried to make things sound more intelligent than they have to and look at the end result; you have a bunch of flat characters spouting unnecessary profound crap. The script is just bad; it looks like it was written by a kid who thought that the ""cool stuff"" (video game looking aliens, cheesy dialogue meant to sound deep, witty one-liners, etc.) should be added into the movie and that's why those were there. Cheap and cheesy dialogue makes the already flat cast of characters even more uninteresting; try not to groan while watching any of the ""romantic"" scenes or the obligatory patriotic scenes as seen in any movie made involving the military. I'll admit, I was expecting BATTLESHIP to be total crap but I'm slightly thankful it didn't turn out to be the complete waste of money and time I was expecting but that isn't saying much. All the movie turned out to be was a popcorn movie that couldn't even entertain me all through out its run time. In the end, BATTLESHIP is a corny and clichéd movie (to describe it this way is being lenient) that relies on action sequences to draw in an audience. This movie didn't really feel like an alien invasion summer flick, it felt more like a 90 minute ad for a board game.",Battleship

And these are some weird aliens, they look like they come from planet who-ville with their little beards underneath their helmets. Kitsch makes for a great action hero when the moment comes for him to step up to the plate. Liam Neeson has a good walk on role as the father of his girlfriend he's trying to get him to let him marry. Rhianna, is OK, and so is some of the side characters, some of it can be accepted due to some of them not being actual actors for instance the legless soldier who was an actual soldier. Now, is it better than anything in the Transformers series, well, if you liked the Transformers series despite their flaws, you'd probably like this one just as well. The people who hate this will probably associate it with Transformers and Michael Bay. Because you know always,to some people Michael Bay is the source of evil in cinema and is the antichrist or the devil. Trust me they've had it out for the man since Armageddon. But that's a moot point because Bay has nothing to do with this movie, he didn't even produce it, neither did Steven Spielberg. Now, Steve Jablonsky who did the score does a somewhat similar score here. Though, I admit I like the AC/DC better than the Linkin Park. And yes, some people balked at the usage of Fortunate Son at the end of the movie, since it's technically a anti-war song. But nitpickers will be nitpickers. I enjoyed it, was it better than the Avengers, no. But, don't understand why it couldn't have made more than 65 million at the box office. I liked it despite knowing how much yes, it rips-off a lot, predator, Independence Day, Transformers.",Battleship
253,starcraftbw88,Battleship? Battleshi*,2,23 September 2012,"Incoherent, full of plot holes, boring, bad acting. So some dude joins the Navy, then quickly becomes a Lt Commander. A bunch of aliens invade Hawaii, the Navy tries to fight them while the other branches of the military are on vacation, then they lose all their ships so have to reactivate the Missouri, then all the old WW2 vets walk out of nowhere to become the new crew. All while this is a happening there's some useless side story with a disabled colored dude who delivers all his lines like he's the Terminator. Ugh... there was simply no story behind the idea for this movie and even less-so any competent writers. How this gets a 6 on IMDb is just embarrassing.

255,paperback_wizard,Battleship: Unsinkable,6,21 May 2012,"Okay, so the box office numbers haven't generally been that  explosive, shall we say. That's more due to The Avengers totally dominating theaters, though. This movie, based very loosely on the Hasbro game of the same name, is actually a really enjoyable film; once the alien invasion starts, that is.Battleship is actually one of the best alien invasion movies I've seen; and you know how critical I can be of alien invasion movies. It exploits a weakness, of course, but not an unreasonable one like a sensitivity to water (which is good, because most of the action takes place in the Pacific Ocean). It requires a diverse group of humans to band together, which is arranged by staging an international war games exercise on the day the invasion begins (bit of a coincidence, but the sailors from different countries do make a great team). And it has Liam Neeson; not very much of him, but hey, it's Liam Neeson.On the other hand, it also has Taylor Kitsch (John Carter). Kitsch's character is Lieutenant Hopper, whose attitude problem has grown so large that he's facing a discharge from the Navy once the war games have ended. His older brother, played by Alexander Skarsgård (True Blood), is commander of one of the other ships. He's been looking out for him all his life, but can't make him grow up. And one of the Japanese captains, played by Tadanobu Asano (Thor) goes from fistfighting Hopper to fighting alongside him. Oh, and supersinger Rihanna is also in the film.The characters are all pretty cookie-cutter, but like I said, once the invasion starts, it gets really good. They don't bother trying to impress people by spending a lot of time on the aliens' biology or weapons technology, focusing instead on strategy. They don't give the aliens a massive advantage (not too much of one, anyway), showing from the beginning that even aliens can have a crash landing. The communications ship is disabled, which means they have to take over human communications satellites to reach the rest of their species. So, the humans have a simple, if not particularly easy, task: knock out their own satellites as well as the remaining alien ships.The aliens still have the advantage, though. Their weapons are still superior to ours (some of their artillery actually resembles the pegs from the old Hasbro game), and they quickly demolish any warships that engage them. Hopper and company, though, manage to limp their way to Hawai'i, where the last battleship in the Navy awaits them. The ""Mighty Mo"", the USS Missouri, where Japan surrendered as the final act of World War II, which fought in the battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa, which has been essentially a floating museum for decades, finds itself brought out of retirement for one last fight. It sounds cheesy, maybe even a little jingoistic, but you rarely see an alien invasion movie that doesn't have some ultra-patriotic scene. In Battle: Los Angeles, it's the U.S. Marines going straight into battle. Independence Day, of course, has the big battle on the Fourth of July. Battleship, however, doesn't feel cheesy at all when you see veterans returning to their posts and the Mighty Mo taking to the sea. Perhaps foreign audiences won't feel the same swell of pride that Americans do, but purely as an action sequence, watching it sail into battle is still thrilling.Do the aliens sink their battleship? You don't expect me to give away the ending, do you? Go see the film. The ""human interest"" parts may not be Shakespeare, exactly, but the ""human versus alien"" parts will blow you out of the water.(original review posted at http://fourthdayuniverse.com/reports/2012/05/battleship-unsinkable/ )",Battleship

It's what I classify as chewing gum for the eyes - pleasant viewing and not requiring too much brain activity. That doesn't mean it's not a good movie, just that it's light entertainment rather than brain-straining. This chewing gum does have a little Chili in it, though.The story-line isn't taxing, but it's amusing and hangs together well enough. The characters are quite well defined - well, except for the aliens who are predictably badass with no redeeming qualities. Difficult to establish an emotional attachment to these ugly guys (girls?).If you're looking for deep involvement ... this isn't it.

259,khfan250,Transformers 4...not directed by Michael Bay?,2,19 May 2012,"There's really no point in hiding it from whomever is reading this review: This movie is crap. You can have a good time making all of the ""Oh, what's next? A *insert board game title here* movie?"" jokes or poke fun at how this plays out like a bad Michael Bay action movie (in which case, it does), but to actually see the movie would be quite unnecessary, for I'm about to thoroughly explain to you why you don't need to watch this movie.First, let's go into why this movie was actually conceived...good question! The movie serves as an example that Hollywood is willing to dish out lazy, junk-food-like movies to young audiences around the world. Much like Bay's Transformers trilogy, there's no redeemable quality to this pig slop.Taylor Kitsch plays a US Navy Tactical Action Officer who, to his credit, is a better character than Shia LaBeouf's Sam Witwicky. In the first ten minutes of the movie, he goes so out of his way to win a girl's heart by breaking into a store and stealing a burrito for her. Yes, a burrito! This convoluted sequence is the most entertaining part of the movie, so I'll give it that much. But, ironically enough, the movie goes downhill immediately as soon as our characters set foot on the Battleship.From this point, the movie becomes a mess. Aliens come down to destroy the Earth because NASA transmitted a signal from a communications array in Hawaii to search for intelligent life on the alien planet. How does this warrant an invasion? Are the aliens that sensitive to their privacy that they'll go out of their way to destroy the planet?And what follows is just a blur of awful, loud action sequences. Literally, for the next seventy minutes is all action. And even though I can tell the good guys apart from the bad guys unlike in the Transformers movies, I'm just not invested in what's going on. The bad guys lack motivation for their actions, and therefore, just don't come across as threatening. And the good guys have no defining character that I could really care less if the human race was subjugated by the alien race.After out seventy-minute-extravaganza-of-stupidity, the movie has a five minute long scene that rewards our heroes. And, just like in the Transformers movies (are you sensing a pattern here), the movie just kind of ends. It's as if the filmmakers themselves thought to themselves ""Well, the action is over now. These dialog scenes are quite dull..."" and they just decided to stop filming.So yeah, I've bashed on this movie so much that you might be wondering why this movie isn't getting a one star review like it probably deserves? Well...Liam Neeson. Seriously, like every movie he's in, Liam Neeson gives a stellar performance. This isn't his finest performance and the material he was given to work with was just awful, but somehow, Neeson still does great work.Besides that, the positive elements in the movie are due to what isn't included in the movie. For example, there's no racist caricatures, no overly-complicated storyline, and no shots of John Turturro's jiggly, hairy crack. It would have been easy for the filmmakers to incorporate these Michael Bay clichés into their movie, but thankfully they didn't.Final verdict: I don't think there's much left to put here. In terms of those who'll enjoy it, if you're a fan of Michael Bay action movies (be they good or bad), there's a lot of those clichés found here. Anyone else probably won't like it. It's too long, too stuffed with plot holes, and too overindulgent.",Battleship
260,skinhead-5,Fun for all the family,9,13 April 2012,"This is a typical ""Ye-Ha""/Blow 'em up"" type of film clearly based on toys and a computer game but it is entertaining in a E.T and Independence Day sort of way. Adults and kids alike will like this unlikely romp around the sea even though the whole film relies heavily on CGI. Action scenes are fun, the plot flimsy but who cares as Planet Earth wins in the end with a bit of help from history, in this case an old warship. Neeson is at his usual gritty self and easily gives the other actors a run for their money despite been on screen for a few minutes. The ladies (and lads) will love all the bulging muscles and tight combats and stunts. The aliens are not too ""alien"" and obviously based on humans to cut down on he budget and scare factor for children watching.

Identikit characters clipped from countless other blockbusters are thrown into a contrived sea battle resembling 'Battleship' against alien opponents who have ships that fire 'missiles' resembling the game's marker pegs. It contains all the genre clichés, which isn't necessarily bad if done with style and slick direction. Sadly 'Battleship' lacks panache and the direction is heavy handed. Too many characters, with their own sub plots are needlessly introduced (also a major fault with the 'Transformers' franchise), confusing the audience and dragging out play length. Acting is done to stereotype so won't have been challenging to the cast. Remember, just because a movie stars Liam Neeson doesn't mean it's good. He was in 'The Phantom Menace' after all Performer of mediocre yet irritatingly catchy pop tunes Rihanna makes her acting debut here. Her acting is better than her music, which is damning with faint praise! The alien invaders in the film are as uninspired and generic as those in 'Battle: LA'. Has Hollywood forgotten how do make decent aliens? On the basis of this offering I'd say so.

267,TomTomH,"An overlong, lazily directed and poorly written extravaganza that lacks the goodness of summer blockbusters",4,16 December 2012,"Peter Berg's Battleship is a disappointing experience on every level that I and a few others think that it makes it seem like it's unfamiliar with many other films of alien invasion. It's strangely based on a battleship board game. Why the heck would someone make a film based on that? If it's based on it then why is the whole thing different? There's one possibility: Hancock main man Peter Berg, who's directed and produced this film, has brought science fiction down to his level, his way, his rules. It's nearly the same as when M. Night Shyamalan kicked off his slated live-action version (The Last Airbender) of the cartoon show 'Avatar: The Last Airbender'. This is probably the first film I've seen that Peter Berg's done and I'm sure his other films are much better than this. I also have to say, like what most people said about Shyamalan (I kinda disagree on that), Berg has really overdone himself this time. But there's plenty more people I can stick to on that.John Carter's Taylor Kitsch plays a cocky random person who does a pathetic and humorous attempt to impress a girl (Brooklyn Decker) then everything goes all berserk when his hot-headed older brother Stone (Alexander Skarsgard), a Commander Officer of the USS Sampson, gets the hump with him and decides to put him in the Navy to teach him a lesson. He's joined on USS John Paul Jones ship joined with unexpectedly star singer Rihanna super gunner, Jimmy 'Ordi' Ord (Jesse Plemons), crew mate and Chief Petty Officer Walter 'The Beast' Lynch (John Tui). The last half-an-hour involves a fleet of different mother ships battling each other in order to save the universe. The human characters are rather witless most of the time. In one point during the film Jesse Plemons' character has an idea how to defeat the aliens from an incident of when he took his pet lizard to the seaside. What? The funny and unexpected news about the casting is that Rihanna joined the cast. The bad news is that she doesn't try very hard. She spends a lot of her time screaming, shouting, being cocky and shooting (although that's sick). Anyone or should I say everyone, who's worked for this film 'very hard' (sigh) could and should have worked for their jobs much harder (and better).The battle scenes are tiring. The last half-an-hour involves a fleet of different mother ships battling each other in order to save the universe. And so it does. It doesn't really reflect with toys even though it seems like it. At one point during the battle between humans and sea, the ships fire clumsy Beyblade-like alien metal balls (and explosive gas tanks that take aim at the ships) which land and cause destruction across Hawaii. Whenever a human sees an alien something of its kind, it often shoots or hits them with whatever's around to be used for violence. I'm not sure whether I'm right or if I'm wrong here but if someone shoots at an alien it doesn't create any damage and harm to it. Well during metal ball battle sequence you often see Air Force pilots/soldiers firing mini guns at the metal balls for like 15 seconds of the scene. Like I said, how's that going to cause much damage? The armour's too thick and they'll something a lot more heavier to destroy. They could take out a skyscraper. I'm beginning to think that Battleship really lacks Transformers. Now those films are a lot better than this. Ugh. It could be a lot more duller if this was in 3D. 3D is beginning to become a wasteland of dizziness and headaches. So thank goodness Berg declined the idea. Now that's good.What were the writers thinking? On what time, day, second, month and year did someone came up a implausible idea for such a project as 'Battleship'? Who think's making an board game into a film is a good idea? It lacks an original story. So there's no need for asking how incomprehensible it probably is. It begins with NASA and a scientist named Dr Nogrady that discover these unbelievable planets known as 'Planet G'. They fire a signal beam into space to get any unusual response but the aliens end up coming down to invade Earth, marking first to knock down a skyscraper with a flaming satellite. They hit sea, interrupting the Naval war exercise and creating a giant shield across Hawaii. Now that's when it all goes wrong. I mean, why would the alien ships float on water? Otherwise the ships would hover in the air and go causing destruction across Earth instead of getting involved in a board game.This film is probably the worst science fiction/alien invasion film ever made. If the writers and actors worked a lot harder at their jobs, it could've been a lot more exciting and action-packed. Instead you get this: a boring and dumb pile of disappointment. It also runs on a loud, long and paced scale of 'overly long' running time. I'm not meaning that it's 3 hours long. I'm just saying that it's 126 (2 hrs, 6) minutes long that doesn't very long. But because of all the silliness and lame action, it makes it look like it's longer than it's supposed to be.

Cat and mouse soon turned into macho patriotic overdose and left you wondering was the tag line transformers on water ever justified. The film lacked pace direction and one loses interest many times. Metaphors could even save this sinking ship and that's exactly what it turned out to be. Liam Neeson couldn't even rescue this disaster with all his strength he was left frozen out and I guess he didn't want to turn down a pay day.

271,CompuLOL,Worst blockbuster wannabe ever made; so far...,1,18 September 2013,"I was willing to cut them some slack because converting a board game into a movie is not easy. But after the success of similar mediocre shallow offerings such as Transformers, and GI Joe in particular, I changed my mind. Specially after seeing how hyped and overrated this is being treated everywhere. So now, better stated; the unoriginal suckiness of the movie itself made me change my mind. This appalling movie makes said others look like they're masterpieces. In a nutshell; this is an awful and dumb big budget B movie, basically. B movie characters, acting, writing, directing, and plot. It has B movie actors; with the notable exception of Liam Neeson (that I'm guessing needed the cash desperately) Also casting Rihanna and Taylor Kitsch was a def mistake; but then again, so does everybody else. As a matter of fact the only things not B like are the special effects and the excruciating duration of it; over 2h! And it's obv an hour longer that needs be. A boringly painful experience since you'd keep wondering; when finally it's all going to end?! The first half hour is wasted in introducing the unlikable cliché lead role asshole and unrealistic sexmantic interest. Also stupid pseudo scientific babble that even the more unsavvy tech wise will find preposterous. But then again the whole premise is ridiculous, battleships are simply not exciting; no matter how much alien fx sci-fi mumbo jumbo and standard Top Gun movie formulations you keep trowing at it. The rest of the movie is the actual battle with the aliens; but the battles are only slightly less lame, boring and retarded than the first part; unsurprisingly. You'd figure that intelligent hi-tech intergalactic conquering aliens capable of contact telepathy, creating force fields, and faster than light speed travel would have better weapons that inertia driven insertion grenade like bombs and ships that shattered at the tip of a fast moving exploding rock :rolleyes: I must admit that the alien water strider ships, yoyo reapers, body armor suit, and actual inside look are the only things kind of cool; but obv not enough to salvage the whole mess. Also the water displacement detection scheme is almost a neat way to introduce the board game struct into the movie. That should have been the premise of the whole movie; instead of fending off a small alien advance and recon force in a neverending fashion, which was obv unnecessary overkill. The final battle was merely adding insult to injury as it breaks all left suspension of disbelief in the most audience insulting way I have seen in a while. This still manages somehow to be a borderline success as an US forces propaganda; despite gathering a small international coalition resistance force. Should have been properly renamed to Battleshit in order to avoid any misunderstandings from the start, IMHO.

And did not include the standard sleaziness of most movies.There are many nitpickers here who go out of their way to find flaws in movies they expect to be bad. But most of their criticisms don't hold up. For instance, my friend in the Navy liked how accurate Rhianna's character was, and yes, inactive Battleships are armed.Don't listen to critics, they make you dislike the movies you see, and miss good movies like this.Enjoy this movie.",Battleship

If you are a thirteen-year-old girl with the attention span of a gnat, you might just be able to sit through this so-called 'movie'. (For which read extended advertisement for a children's board game, laced with sledgehammer product placement for a bunch of other stuff teenage kids like.) If you can stop yourself laughing at the bare-faced effrontery of it long enough, I suggest you read the 10 star reviews of Battleship before shelling out your hard-earned green for it. I would guess that approximately eighty percent have been written by studio plants. The other 20% by the aforesaid teenage girls with gnat-like attention spans.The corporate infantilism of Hollywood continues pell-mell. Well done Peter Berg. Well done George Lucas.",Battleship

Finally I would get a ""good Transformers movie"".But already after 20 minutes I realized that I was tricked.. This movie really sucks. I even couldn't stand watching the whole thing, and shut it off when it was 20 minutes left. So what's my problems with ""Battleship""? First of all, there isn't really a story, just 130 minutes of mindless explosions and special effects. Another thing is the acting. It's really bad, especially Rihanna who should never have been allowed to act in a movie in the first place. But my main problem is that it's really confusing, I mean the way it's shot and directed. It almost made me sick..Stay away from this. It makes the third Transformers movie look like a masterpiece.",Battleship

278,limoncella-641-42235,Battlesh*t,1,12 April 2012,"Battleship is bar none the worst movie I have seen in recent years. It is a noisy, clichéd and unbearable piece of trash that exploits the work of CG artists and paying customers who just want to be entertained.A simple way to describe Battleship, is that it's basically a $200 million naval recruitment video that was made by a schizophrenic 8 year old who likes video games and things going Ka-Boom.The main heroes in this movie are indeed American navy sailors, but the one thing the film-makers really failed at is making these people likable and realistic. Taylor Kitsch plays the lead character, he's basically some drop out loser who robs convenience stores to get girlfriends and joins the navy at his brothers behest, and in what seems like no time at all he becomes a lieutenant with big responsibilities on a naval vessel with some few hundred men beneath him. The special effects are the only thing to keep you invested, however they're all completely CG so it just likes a cut-scene from a video game . Something that should be impressive (like a ship sinking) is made pointless because it's something clearly rendered on a computer.The soundtrack to the movie is okay composition wise, but it's often loud and draws attention to itself and it sounds exactly like the Inception soundtrack on numerous occasions.This movie has the shadow of Transformers looming over it, both in its marketing and tone. Battleship however is far, far, far worse than any of those three films and it could probably be used as a symbol for the decline of western civilisation.",Battleship
279,Nixonbrian42,The following is words of warning,1,24 October 2012,"I took a two week vacation from my job and in that time I visited the local Redbox and rented six films. The first five were in this order:1.No Tell Motel 2.Dark Shadows 3.The Hunger Games 4.Elevator 5.The Haunting Of Whaley HouseI watched every one all the way through with the best being The Hunger Games. Second best would be Dark Shadows, three would be Elevator then Whaley House then No Tell Motel.None of these films have anything to do with Battleship. Although my experience while watching Battleship demanded me to reexamine my thoughts and views of the previous five films. No Tell Motel was a low budget cheap horror flick that was a mess from start to finish.....it was BETTER than Battleship. The Haunting Of Whaley House was along the scale of The Innkeepers; silly, cheesy, unintentionally funny with a few o.k. moments.....it was BETTER than Battleship. Elevator had no real pay off at all.....it was BETTER than Battleship. The other two, Dark Shadows and The Hunger Games, goes without saying.This movie, Battleship, WOW! GOD ALMIGHTY! Half way through I got up off my couch, paused the DVD and walked out of the room to give my ears, my eyes, my brain and my stomach a break from the Earth shattering hell that I just put them through. I honestly was considering ejecting the disc and taking it back to Redbox without watching the rest. This review is truly a warning to anyone who is thinking of seeing it...proceed with extreme caution!This one is gonna hurt. If Hollywood continues to make films this bad then they're gonna make audiences everywhere turn against films completely. They're gonna start losing a lot of money. It's the ticket sales by movie fans that keep their wallets fat. This is a perfect example of bad business practice.Again, to the curious moviegoer, this is a word of warning, it wasn't that it was just bad and it's not that I'm a negative person because I'm not. The film actually made me angry.I gave it one star, it doesn't deserve any.",Battleship

I really expected a very bad movie, which has action scenes which tend to bore you and make you go to sleep. something like Abduction. I know thats the wrong genre. Coming closer to home, Battle For LA, SKYLINE. both have alien invasion plots and both were very boring to me. the action in them did not seem the least bit exciting.Peter berg has done the impossible, he has turned a board game in a decent movie. its not as good as independence day or Armageddon or even star trek (a movie it shares a lot of similarity to including the you are the captain scene). With a premise of a battleship board game there was nothing better they could do with the material. this is the absolute best that was possible. The movie is a bit ham fisted, the patriotism is over the top and the alien's motivation is suspect. But coming down to it, its a good movie and worth a watch!",Battleship
281,steel_indigo,"Board Game, Aliens, Action and humor",9,23 December 2013,"I absolutely loved this movie. I saw someone write they went to see it because of Liam Neeson. I am so happy he had a small part. He is too over exposed and I'm tired of seeing him in action movies where he is too old for the part. This movie was meant to be campy. It wasn't anything like Transformers. The alien ships move the way they do because they are emulating a board game. There is more water on Earth than land mass.I loved the campy lines. Taylor Kitsch is very appealing in his part and trust me I have met young men just like this that had to be forced to make big changes. Courts use to make them sign up for the military. Since a movie is generally an hour and a half to two hours you have to cover a lot in a short time. Taylor's character was still sort of deuffy when the aliens arrived. His brother is killed and he is left with no recourse but to lead, in the past not his strong suit. When push comes to shove his personality is just right to do the innovative moves. I loved all the characters and they all did a good job. If you want a fun movie which this was and not a movie about real war, which is refreshing for a change then quit trying to make it more than it was meant for; not realistic, not necessarily an award winner, but just campy fun. Some of the lines are hilarious and meant to be that way. It is based on a game.",Battleship

All-in-all, this was a good action movie with some laughs thrown in to lighten the mood. There wasn't anything overly graphic, so it's a decent family flick. There were elements of '24'(along with several actors from the hit show) and since this was in part a Hasbro movie, it had a Transformers feel. I give it a 7/10 rating.",Battleship

I think that if he would've been inside, the movie in General would've been different. Alexander Skarsgård was only in it for a short period of time but during that time he do exceptionally well. This movie was about aliens and how they invaded the planet and then tried to make contact with their world. Basically ET phoning home. Like I said, it's not something that I would normally watch but considering the characters, I thought, hey, what the heck. All in all this movie gave people insight on how Navy ships actually operate on the inside.

Alien Space Ships Oops, Bang, Change of Plan Bouncy Bouncy Battleships Ridiculous Special Effects and Plots More Bangs A Museum Piece to the Rescue Implausible and Against the Odds Victory Flag Waving - actually that's pretty much throughout as an alternative to putting effort in to making it halfway decent.There no denying Battleship is one of the worst,most superficial, ridiculous, over-acted,under-scripted 'recruitment videos' (I hesitate to call it a movie) that I have seen for a good long while.If you are a fan of clichéd lines and scenes being drowned out by blaring noise and blinding flashes then this may well suit you. If you prefer a minimal amount of bearable story and dialogue that even a mediocre actor can deal with then avoid like its Ebola's nasty brother (and even Rhianna fails to reach such low heights - they could have cast a Plastic Barbie Doll and saved the money).It does prove one thing though, CG artists are more talented than many actors/directors/producers nowadays...tho to be fair it was a low bar and at times it proves a very polished affair - as in shiny, not well executed, plus it lacks realistic detail and accuracy. (Much like the whole caboodle then!)I don't mind the occasional flag waving uber (or over)-rated Hollywood blockbuster but this fails even as a $200 million Naval recruitment video. It falls at every hurdle. I don't care about the characters, and the film cares even less about the sub plots. Is it a modern child of Independence Day or Top Gun where its happy to revel in its own stupidity as long as the action and acting hold up - well the originals were borderline in some scenes but this in nowhere near throughout. Maybe it a flawed telling of a decent story...like Pearl Harbour or U571? I'm afraid not as these were ruined by romantic subplots and historical inaccuracies - Battleship is just flawed throughout.If the US Navy put any real time or money into this film and still allowed American Sailors to appear so inept, implausible, unruly, and incapable of following even the simplest chain of command then I would ask for a refund - or maybe Taylor Kitsch's lead character was based on real Officers in which case...help!...anyone with first hand military knowledge was probably crying the moment he showed up in uniform even before he so implausibly managed to gain command and save the day. The guys a delinquent with gets a ship within minutes of joining up - even the famed James Tiberiusus Kirk want that quick to jump in the captains chair and bark orders like a 20yr veteran.As noted earlier there probably only the special effects that are likely to keep you involved enough to avoid the remote control off button - hence it gains 1 whole star! However they are almost CG for the sake of CG so it ends up just likes a cut-scene from a video game, except it not even half as immersive. Rather its a 2 dimensional version more worthy of the original board game where even the major battles with huge loss of life and the sinking of serious hardware simply makes you shrug and go 'next...'Is there anything else to be said...probably, except I cant be bothered.I've seen it twice, regretted it twice, avoided it twice...don't plan to do it again.AVOID!",Battleship

294,aalleekk1989,A movie that navy guys will appreciate more,7,5 January 2019,"First of all, I get it. The whole plot is as cheesy as it gets and in reality aliens will probably not lose to a Burke class destroyer on a one-on-one battle. There is no way to get Missouri into combat with a couple dozen people in one day. We can go on all day, but that is not really the point. In my view the purpose of the movie is pure entertainment, and for that purpose it did a great job.Now, I will admit that I am biased as a former crew member of a destroyer. I absolutely love the actions in particular because I am not aware of any other movie featuring intense naval combat scenes that showcase the firepower of a modern missile destroyer. I am not saying it is realistic to see 50 cal machine guns, Mk 45 gun, SM-2, Tomahawk and torpedos engaging the same target at the same time, but if I tell you it was not satisfying I'd be lying.I also love the fact that it was not just the US Navy involved, which was a defies the usual Hollywood cliche of the US single handedly saving the world. Captain Nagata played a crucial role as the brain in the surviving crew, and has significant screen time and plot importance. It was also worth noting that in the opening battle scene, JS Myoko did not hesitate to attacked after USS John Paul Jones charges forward, and in a way took the hit for the USS John Paul Jones. 70 years ago Japanese Navy fought bitterly with the US Navy on Pacific Ocean, but now we have a movie with Japanese Navy fighting alongside US Navy against a common enemy, including scenes of Japanese captain effectively commanding a US destroyer, and Japanese crew fighting shoulder by shoulder with WW2 vets on USS Missouri. Japanese Navy became the most important ally for US Navy in the pacific theatre, and the movie certainly gave a nod to the JMSDF.All in all, I find the acting convincing, and the CGI was great as well. There are the usual Hollywood cliches, but not overly cheesy; and there are definitely points which are not typical in the genre of alein invasion movies. Overall a recommendable and entertaining film for those who can, from time to time, let go of rules of physics and common sense and enjoy the fireworks.",Battleship

Yes, the battleship is cool, the aliens are neat, the warships are awesome, but seriously. For aliens trying to take over the planet, they're pretty stupid. They must have left their smart people out of the expedition force. The acting from all actors is just horrific. To this day, it impresses me so much that they managed to gather up all the cheesiest lines of the movie, and make an excellent looking trailer out of them. But when you see the whole movie, it's just laughable.If they had focused more on the fight scenes, making them more realistic, and less on the acting and attempting to have subplots, the movie would have gone over so much better. That's why Hunt for Red October, U571, and those types of movies were such mangasms. They had 1 thing to do, give every man a mangasm, and they went for it.

So NASA built a satellite that sends transmission signal to Planet G and hoping for is to get some answers back. Meanwhile, Alex Hopper (Taylor Kitsch) is a disgrace naval lieutenant. He likes Samantha Shane (Brooklyn Decker), but there's one problem, she's the daughter of Admiral Shane (Liam Neeson), who is unimpressed with Hopper behavior and wants him to be dishonorably discharge. Things change when the aliens from Planet G lands in the Pacific Ocean. Three destroyers, one of them carries Hopper and his crew, are trap inside some sort of a force field. No one can't get in or get out. It's up to Hopper and his crew to save the day.When I first heard that Battleship was going to turn into a feature length film, I scratch my head and said this, ""What in the world are they thinking?"" After viewing the film, Battleship is a bad film, which is not surprising, considering the fact that it's based on a board game. Yes I know this is a ""popcorn"" flick, sometimes things don't go according to plan.If you're looking for logical plot, you might as well just skip this movie. In fact the plot is so boring; it nearly put me to sleep. Sure I know it's not meant to be serious, but at the same time, the filmmakers were trying to make it serious. In order to keep the audience entertain, the screenwriters need to have a decent plot hole to make the film interesting and well pace. Battleship doesn't have that. Even worse, there was couple of scenes that made no sense. In one scene, Cal Zapata (Hamish Linklater), one of the scientists working for the government, reference Columbus killing ""Indians."" Saying Indians is politically incorrect, it's Native Americans. There was another scene when alien touches Alex Hopper (Taylor Kitsch) face and he start having visions of them invading and destroy all mankind, but in some scenes the alien(s) don't harm some human. What? I thought these guys are supposed to destroy all living things! Another part that did not make sense is that in the beginning of the film, they describe how the sun in Planet G in the solar system is the same distance as our sun, meaning that it's habitable for humans to live. The aliens wear protected armor against enemy gunfire and bacterial infections, which makes sense. What doesn't make sense is that their helmet protects them from the sun because they hate it. I'm confuse, isn't their sun is the same distance as our sun and yet it bothers them? What's going on here? Did anyone recheck the script? I guess not. Perhaps I'm getting a head of myself with the plot, but still if you want to entertain your audience, you better have a decent plot hole and making sure that make sense for the most part. The last thirty-minutes is a complete joke. In fact the whole audiences laugh. When asking some audience why they laugh, I get the same answers, because it was stupidly bad. The plot in Battleship is nothing but a big pile of trash. As far as acting goes, it's not terrible, but it is bad for the most part. This is Rihanna first acting role. Although she's a talented singer, she quite doesn't have the acting skills yet. She has her moments, but overall her performance is mediocre. She delivers some of the worst dialog, like this one, ""My daddy told me they'd come"" Liam Neeson is the only actor that had a good part, but sadly he only has five minutes of screen time. Say what?What did surprise me is that some of the extras are actual naval personals. They did a fantastic job for using their militarize terminology and knowledge.If the plot and the acting don't work, what suppose to save the film from disaster? Action. That comes too little to late. There are two ways action films work: one, start the action right away and have a decent plot hole to keep the audience interested while the action awaits or have a bold plot and deliver action later. Battleship neither has those two. It has it moments, I'll give it that, but it isn't enough to save the film.The special effects are great, no question ask. Battleship has one of the best special effects that I seen in a while. There were several shots that wowed me. However the alien designs are cartoonish looking, which makes them unbelievably bad. I see better alien design than this. Battleship is a good example of how a film that is based on a board game is a bad idea. It has moments here and there, but the overall the film is has no brain. The only way people can enjoy this film is to make fun of it. I rather play the board game than watching the movie. f I didn't convince you to skip this movie and you still want to see it, stay for the end credits and see the extra ending. Hint, there's a sequel. D-",Battleship
305,in_shahieras_prince,Heart-pumping Aliens War,10,11 April 2012,"Battleship - This is not a Transformers or John Carter movie. But it's far better than them both for its awesomeness. Not a musical type of movie also, though Rihanna was there playing a quite promising role. This movie certainly an epic! Two hours more or less with full of great actions and amazing plot. Begins with someone who did nothing but craps, Alex Hopper (played by John Carter's hero, Taylor Kitsch) troubled everyone including his beloved brother, Stone Hopper (True Blood's star of Alexander Skarsgård) by being immature and jackass. Forced by the 'incident', Alex was enlisted to the US Navy leaded by his brother. As time passed, the unchanged, Alex was then become one of the Lieutenant for his ship, trained in an international naval fleet (RIPCOMP-something, not sure) at Pearl Harbor together with Japanese Navy, leaded by Capt. Nagata (Tadanobu Asano aka Hogun in Thor) whom he didn't really like so much. (p.s: Do note yourself with Capt. Leu from Malaysia's Navy Force!). The story started to pump up your heart when they were out for training and discovered an armada of unknown origins, and forced to battle with them in order to thwart their destructive goals. The very important reason to mark this movie in a very great color, is how every part of its plot was filled with extremely thrilled actions and most importantly, you'll stunned by unstoppable brilliant tactics used by the Navy. You might not be able to breath accordingly. I'm warning you! I would also admire its visual effects and sound which is unbelievably realistic. Well, I might say, almost of it. There's still quite funny watching the very small boat didn't sway at all, when the very huge whale-like armada swam in and out of the ocean towards it. And they were so close to each other. But, honestly, it was a very good movie! There's a few scenes might remind you of some scenes from the other movie like Transformer and Titanic. Seriously, it was worth for every penny! And not to mention how it made you feel like 2 hours wasn't really 120minutes! If you think Darkest Hour was a good movie, this one is twelve times better! Oh ya, remember that everyone can be a hero, and what is the most important thing? Kerjasama! (Teamwork!) A definite must-seen movie! Serious 5 for 5..! p.s: It was released in Malaysia on April 10. Second after Japan. Not even UK or US could watch it before us! So, go get your tickets now!!",Battleship
306,mnorthco-1,Bad but good bad,7,28 June 2017,"Yes, this movie is bad and represents a lot of what is bad in Hollywood movies (I'm looking at you Michael Bay) but somehow it manages to be watchable and a bit of fun.Your suspension of disbelief will be in overdrive for this movie,I'm not talking about the aliens or their method of attack, but all those moments seem to make you groan with a smile on your face followed by a laugh.

I remember halfway through it felt like it was reaching a climax but nope.I loved the sci fi clichés, the over-the-top action hero tropes. Everything was so predictable yet so enjoyable.

The storyline was great, the special effects were amazing..kept me wondering what is going to happen next..the acting was also great but if only they reduced ""The American pride"" thing.

310,whiteshadow1606,I kinda love it but also kinda confusing.,6,13 April 2012,"Okay. I just watched the movie! And here I am giving a review.The reason I give it a 6 because of the plot/storyline. It's kinda weak and confusing. Let me tell you why? Here are some of my questions or you can say confusions of the movie:i-I didn't learned that they both were brothers until the brother died and he said that the alien killed his brother. ii-It's unclear what's the motive of the alien came to Earth. And what is the connection between the message NASA had been sending with them coming to Earth? iii-When one of the alien was found and then regain consciousness, why would the alien give him the vision about destroying the Earth? iv-Did the girlfriend also trapped in the barrier? If yes, then why is she having difficulties to contact the people on the ship? The others outside was having the problem because of the barrier. But, I think she's in the barrier.Well, all of this confusion must be because of the time constrain. The director had to cut several/many scenes which makes the movie a little bit confusing and all.For the effect, I give it a 10! I love it! I think that's what you get when you got someone from Transformer, huh? :)Also, I love the comedy. I laughed almost throughout the movie. I think, if all of my questions above were answered, I'll consider giving it a 9/10. As conclusion, it is worth watching (mostly because the effects were super awesome!)",Battleship
311,americanentertainmentrep,Battleship: Pick your bad movie cliché from the list below,2,20 May 2012,"Rating: One out of Fordyce (poor)I was trying to avoid the clichés: Battleship sinks--Battleship capsizes, Battleship springs a leak, throw Battleship a life preserver--but I won't stoop to that level (yeah, right). The only good thing I can say about the movie is it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. This film, based on the board game by the same name, is a retread of every ""aliens invade the earth"" film ever made, and in this case they added elements that are so unbelievably stupid and silly that people were laughing in the theater, and not at the lines and situations that were supposed to be funny. The film spends the first 30 minutes or so introducing us to characters we really don't care much about, including an undisciplined slacker and his big brother, a naval commander who insists little brother stops sleeping on his couch and join the navy. We witness the bad boy committing multiple late night felonies and I am still trying to figure out how he was released by the cops in time for breakfast.When the aliens attack, little brother becomes a hero and so does the cast of stereotypical characters right out of central casting. That is also where the aliens come from. I guess there were costumes left over from Alien, Battlefield: Los Angeles, Transformers and the Borg closet on the Star Trek set, so they were all merged into one, along with the weapons that look familiar as well. The film has dime store special effects, and I suspect they got 5 cents change at the cash register when they checked out.When you wrap all this manure up into a tedious 131 minutes, you have a movie that talented actors like Liam Neeson, Alexander Skarsgard, Rihanna and Brooklyn Decker can't save from drowning. This one gets a few points for some good one liners, which boosts this faulty flick to a meager 1 out of Fordyce. And by the way ... this movie says it is loosely based on the Hasbro board game. If you look really close, you can try and spot the scene that sort of does that. Credit Check: There is something at the end of this movie, if you sit through the entire credits. Since I suspect that most of you will want to run from the theater and not do this, I will tell you it just sets this film up for a sequel. Let's hope this turkey's bad showing at the box office prevents that from happening. The world will be a better place without a sequel to this one.",Battleship
312,darthmatthew-442-606491,Why? Because explosions,3,30 August 2012,"What happens when you take a beloved board game and give it the Hollywood treatment? Apparently you get aliens. With a concept seemingly coming from George Lucas's recent mentality, Battleship combines the aforementioned aliens with a slew of boring characters and comes up with one of the most stupid and unoriginal pieces of cinema compost created within recent memory. Avatar: the Last Airbender has met its match for stupidity, and at times I felt like they really didn't care.The story was completely unapologetic in its butchering of common-sense. I would like to say that I don't mind a little truth stretching when it is used to accommodate story or characterization; however, I do have qualms about sacrificing story and continuity for the sake of explosions or extra random action scenes. There was no sense of priority in the making of this film as the writers put the CGI over the story, quickly resulting in the movie losing all continuity or point. Why did the aliens launch their rolling wrecking-ball robots into Hawaii? Because they could. And because explosions of course! Though the concept itself was slightly original with the aliens taking to the sea instead of the air, the execution of this concept was not. It was merely a new place setting for explosions.Once again we are force fed the rushed redemption story. The protagonist is kinda an arrogant jerk who has made a mess of his life, but through the call of duty he learns humility and gets the girl of his dreams. In the course of one scene the protagonist makes a complete 180 and becomes a responsible leader. Funny, seeing as Liam Neeson minutes ago stated that the protagonist had absolutely no leadership skills. Obviously this miraculous change is completely out of character and lazy, but nobody seems to care because hey, that means more aliens getting blown to kingdom come.Speaking of the aliens, they have to be the some of the worst aliens ever made. While their armor and ships looks super-stylish and overall pretty awesome, they remove their helmets to reveal bald, alien versions of the David Crowder Band, fit with spiky goatees made out of what looks like keratin (what fingernails are comprised of). As cool as the David Crowder Band is, their alien counterparts are completely underwhelming.The acting was B movie, or should I say F movie. It didn't help that the characters were completely bland an unlikable, but at least the actors could have put some effort into their performances, with the one exception being Liam Neeson. Liam Neeson is...well, he's Liam Neeson. But unfortunately, Liam Neeson was not able to save this movie from the onslaught of actors who slogged along with their pointless and downright annoying characters, while thinking, ""I'll get a better role next movie, just keep thinking about the pay check. It'll all be over soon"" And then it finally does end and we are left thinking, ""What on earth was that?"" and all we can say is, ""Explosions I guess...""Don't get me wrong. I can enjoy a good flick; however, this was frustratingly lazy. The only reason I derived humor or entertainment from this movie was because it was hilariously bad. Battleship was beyond mindless, with the only thought provoking element was Rihanna's mind-boggling decision to attempt acting. Some people would argue that Battleship is good as long as you view it as a mindless action flick. That would be like me saying that my dog isn't vicious as long as you view it as a bear trap. There is no excuse for an absence of effort. It is clear that in the production of this movie, no thought or patience was taken and it was visible in the performances and in the story. They just didn't care.",Battleship
313,utkarshonly,It isn't as bad as people say it is!,5,21 April 2013,"Not all of us are interested in stripping down the film piece by piece and admire the acting, the story, the graphic separately and rate them. Most of us watch a movie to enjoy and lose some stress not to develop philosophy or doubt reality. Keeping this in mind, this movie is fine!The CGI was really nice and the concept kinda realistic not even far fetched. The acting maybe not be amazing, the story may be a little bland but all in all the movie is pretty enjoyable. No, there is nothing extraordinary or worth remembering but not every movie has to be a revolver or needs to have hugely popular comic character to be entertaining.

314,foxx_1,"Dumb, simply dumb",1,30 April 2012,"I was mostly interested in the movie because I saw the trailer with Liam Neeson and he looked quite convincing - too bad I did not pay enough attention to notice that Rihanna (!?!) also ""plays"" in it... That fact alone would have made me think twice but it is too late now.So what do we get here? Astronomers discover yet another exoplanet and send a message. The aliens get it and manage to decipher it of course. Right on. It does not take very long and they show up on the radar, obviously capable of flying interstellar flights at the speed of light. So far so good. It is beyond me still how they managed to fly few light-years without any accidents but once they approach the Earth, one of their ships rams a satellite and breaks apart. Logic and plausibility are hard to find and in short supply right from the start. The other storyline: a Barbie-style tall blonde enters a bar all by herself around midnight and wants to eat something. Meaningful dialogues ensue: ""What's your name?"" ""I am hungry"" ""Hey that's not a name"" This romantic encounter makes the main protagonist rob a convenience store and destroy about half of it. Instead of waking up in the police station and spending some time in prison, he bitches about the taser scars on his back and decides to join the navy. Shortly after we see him act as a selfish pr*ck at a soccer game which makes him even less likable. Conveniently, Barbie turns out to be the daughter of his chief commander - talk about small world, heh? As if this mess was not bad enough, we get to see Rihanna in uniform and shooting with a machine gun. I was really hoping she and the above pr*ck would get killed by the retarded aliens but no such luck... as for the aliens: as I said, they seem to have technology way superior to ours but are rather dumb and clumsy. One example: a veteran with two prosthetic legs manages to kick the sh*t out of one alien who somehow willingly engages in a fight instead of pulling a laser gun or another gimmick aliens tend to use... Speaking of gimmicks: the aliens wear suits and helmets that remind of the one that the ""Predator"" wore. I guess they share their technology achievements at some evil aliens convention...What follows is hard to swallow, even with a maximum suspension of disbelief. The aliens shoot at the navy with some conventional projectiles which can be even neutralized if intercepted on time. The other weapon is a bit more spectacular but still lacking any logic - big ball-shaped robots with something like circular saws in the middle which destroy highways, helicopters and anything that might be of somewhat military importance. It remains unclear why the aliens consider our inferior technology a threat since they set up a protective shield (deja vu, ""Independance day"") which can not be penetrated at all...The nonsense hits a high mark near the end when a museum ship engages in a showdown battle. Of course, a decommissioned ship always has a rich supply of ammunition and former staff readily available, the latter striking poses on the deck, waiting for their D-day - apparently, for lack of better pass-time...Unfortunately, Liam Neeson did not get enough screen presence. To be fair, the little time he got was enjoyable e.g. when telling the above egomaniac what a selfish pr*ck he is. Needless to say, these 30 sec could not save the film. Lessons learned: always look at the cast before watching a movie, this might save you some extra pain.",Battleship

I remember the trailer for Battleship being in the cinemas way back in July 2011 and like other people no doubt thought wow! But after months and months of waiting and watching the other trailers being released i've been totally let down.Don't get me wrong, i wasn't entering the cinema expecting a beautiful storyline with deep insights into the human psyche! But i was expecting a movie - instead i was treated to a pile of crap - thats the only way i can describe it! I'm a big movie fan - my favourite film in regard to entertainment value is Independence Day. I think i was expecting a modern version of this but i in fact insult Independence Day by mentioning Battleship in the same breath.The film begins with promise - good pace, some interesting scientific scenes and slight comedy. But after 15 minutes it went from an 8/10 movie to a 1/10 movie and stayed there. I actually only stayed in the cinema until the end due to paying £20 to watch the film.I'd like to go into the story but there isn't one so i'll just make some bullet points as to why its so terrible: *****SPOILER ALERTS***** * Liam Neilson only being in it for a total of about 5 minutes screen time * Rhianna getting hit by the alien and while only weighing 6 stone wet through getting straight up again...oh yes and of course having a cap glued to her head the whole film, even though being thrown in the water.You know what...i'm not going to waste my time PLEASE DON'T GO AND WATCH THIS!

Hmm what to say, I went into the movie with lowish expectations, I was expecting a transformers redux, Michael Bay style movie. And that is exactly what I got, but better. I often find these big budget special effect movies very over the top, full of cheesy lines, unbelievable and I know it is suppose to be fun, but often the mix just irks me, but this movie is a lot of fun, yes, there is a large amount of coincidence that moves the story along, and I would have liked to know more about the motives of the Aliens, but it was a fairly intelligent film, well acted, excellent explosions and action and when the remaining crew board the ""battleship"" at the end of the movie I genuinely felt like I wanted them to succeed. The film was lacking the ""Go USA"" that many of these films have and I iced the fact that it was teamwork with the Japanese that made the film work. The scene after the credits is worth sticking around for too. All in all, very good, excellent fun, nothing too serious and it won't win a lot of Oscars, but excellent entertainment and I give it an 8/10",Battleship

If you are a ""Transformers"" fan, you are not going to be too disappointed with the movie. Let me start by admitting that I am a BIG fan of ""The Transformers"" series. Hopefully this review will not be favoring the movie because of that (that is, if this review does favor it).Watching battleship felt like watching an amalgamation of two of my favorite movies, ""The Independence day"" and ""The Transformers"", and turning them into a spinning metal-ball of Junk. As always the very realistic animation and sound effects of the movie are eye-catching, but what we didn't find convincing were the acting and the story. Watching the men act in movie will not convince you enough that there are aliens attacking earth for it's extinction. Well they couldn't even convince the audience if Baboons were attacking earth. The acting lacked a level of conviction from the actors and went too emotional at times that was sufficient to turn you off. Somethings were left unclear in the movie, like the aliens only destroyed machines and didn't attack humans. There were times when it didn't attack battleships and left them, probably because the Hero was in that ship :) . It was like watching a bollywood movie (minus the awesome animation).My suggestion: If you are really bored and have nothing else to do this weekend, try to buy a ticket or two of this movie.

It isn't going to win any Oscars anytime soon but it had a crapload of explosions worthy of making Michael Bay proud!! The film had loads of potential and loads of visual effects in it. It is just a shame that the story didn't offer something more. The basic story is that Hopper(Kitsch) is a screw up who finally joins the navy on the recommendation of his brother Stone (Skarsgaard). This eventually leads to both characters battling ""aliens"" which have landed into the sea...pretty basic. Other characters to note are Liam Neeson's character and Rihannas character (names which i have forgotten!) but they weren't very engaging and i was pretty surprised that Rihanna got more screen time than Neeson. However she wasn't that bad in the movie but the writers should have at least tried to make the characters not so...2D.

324,galvanekps,"The Not So Good, the Really Bad and the Shockingly Ugly Or ...",2,21 October 2012,"How much cheese do what on your corn? Let me start with the one moderately positive thing I'll say about this film; if flashy CGI, big fiery explosions and action for the sake of said is all you need to make a movie, there's about and hour and 20 minutes of it here... and absolutely nothing else.From the outset it's awful. The first 30 minutes of the film is character ""development"" that is so thin and poor that it actually becomes offensive to members of the United States Navy. *knock* *knock* Hollywood it's 2012, not height of war 1942, the US military does not accept unemployed, alcoholic losers facing felony charges let alone fast track them into line officer positions. If you have the constitution to make it beyond the first half hour of this disaster then you no doubt have what it takes to become a wise cracking naval officer and sociopath who can single handedly defeat aliens invasions as well. Which leads us to ...Taylor Kitsch/Lieutenant Alex Hopper. On any list of pretty boys with little or no talent who still manage to land roles Taylor Kitsch is a contender to the top spot. Granted the dialog he's working with is truly atrocious to begin with and it's unlikely anyone could have made it work, but the combination of it and his lack of talent result in what starts out as a train-wreck the moment he opens his mouth that morphs into a 28 vehicle pile up with multiple fatalities on a fog blanketed road by the time he shuts up. If any member of the US military were ever to conduct themselves in the manner LT Alex Hooper is portrayed and presented he would face charges before making it out of basic training. Awful, truly, horrifically, unbelievably awful from start to finish. I feel at this moment like I wish to keep typing to try and convey just how bad he is but I know there simply aren't enough of the right kinds of words in the English language that would allow me to, so let's just move on to the next disaster.Rihanna/Petty Officer Cora Raikes. Wow! Whoever is responsible for this casting decision should immediately be fired and never again be allowed to work in any facet of the entertainment industry again. Not only is she lacking in acting ability nearly to the degree of Kitsch, but the this fat-bottomed hip-hop skank with a history being abused by her boyfriends makes her so utterly inappropriate for this role that it should have brought every member of NOW out picketing the studio the moment she was announced. Strong female characters being portrayed by weak, profane punching bags... sad to say the least. Whether trying to convince the viewer that she's a tough enough to play soccer with and against men in an international tournament or incoherently blabbering technoishly terminology in the operation center of a naval ship or going toe to toe with an alien warrior that just knocked down a steel bulkhead, she is so utterly unbelievable doing any of it that it runs from painful to nauseating to watch.Which leads us to the first completely nonsensical aspect of the script. Apparently the defense budget of the US Navy is in worse shape than any of us has been led to believe. Not only ""destroyers"" have been brought back into service and are manned with five person crews who do everything from command and control duties in the operations center, to reconnoitering potential threats in assault craft to carrying out search and destroy missions as part of a TAC team and last but not least flawless fire control operations with weapon systems that haven't been in use since before any of the characters were presumably born...... and then to the next bit of foolishness that is the foundation of this story. Is it even conceivable to anyone that a ship that has been decommissioned and turned into a floating museum has a compliment of functioning weapons, ammo and fuel and can be put into service by the same five crew members and half a dozen senior citizens in just minutes. That the writers, producers and director actually thought that this could be sold as a valid premise just cuts to the heart of how stupid they think the average movie goer is. Patently absurd is the only way to describe it and unfortunately it not the only thing that's absurd and maybe not even the most absurd premise of this film.I love good science fiction and action films and I get the need to suspend disbelief in order to make certain types of films, really I do. Fantasy technologies, bending of the laws of physics, impossible time lines etc when used properly can make a movie. There is however, or at least should be a limit, but not here. This movies doesn't merely bend the laws of physics and strain believability it shatters them then sweeps the shards up off the floor runs them through an industrial shredder collects the by product melts it down cast them again and then smashes the result with a sledge hammer.Not a single solitary aspect of the sciencey part of science fiction is even remotely possible or plausible. The action scenes from first to last are so far beyond the limits of believable it almost unfathomable.This film is so bad on so many levels that if I see the names Peter Berg, Taylor Kitsch or Rhianna associated with any future projects I will do my utmost to avoid it.",Battleship

326,reysia,Not impressed at all. Good effect but not a very good movie.,6,26 April 2012,"I'm not really impressed with this movie. I thought the ship combat would be more attractive but it's not. Most of the combat action is genuinely looked so unrealistic. I almost fall asleep in cinema because the story is too slow in the beginning. Good movies flows naturally and has a good movement from down to climax till ending but this movie just doesn't have it.Simple story, nothing really particularly interesting about the story. This movie rely on the using of technology shown in the combat and disappointingly used the sexy woman to make an attraction in the beginning. I mean, if you pay attention to the camera and the scene taken, you will notice that it expose Sam's body a lot. So desperate, I think. Other thing is I think it's too noisy.

332,carry-92,A lesson I learned before: don't judge a film by its trailer! Way better than I expected.,7,10 August 2012,"I first saw the trailer to this movie at the end of 2011, while being at the cinema watching Mission Impossible 4. It started of in the most interesting way which awakened my interest (talking about the ocean being huge, gigantic to hide). As soon as the UFO came out of the water that interest dropped down rapidly as I thought this was just going to be another of these Action alien attack movies. I was pretty sure to never watch this until I watched it anyway, as I remembered to be open to every movie, which I had learned from another great movie that I thought was total waste but watched it one day and saw the following ones at the movies. Now to the actual film. It is a really interesting thought on how we would handle it if we knew there might be life on a different planet. Would we take a risk to contact? Would we, warned from all these movies, rather not? I know alien attacks are a movie thing but no one can ever tell what would really happen. What I didn't like in this movie was that it seemed like the aliens were just attacking machines and war ships for no obvious reason. On the other hand this film surprised me. As I said my interest was very low after the complete trailer. There were many little stories in this too. The guy who can't do anything right who becomes important and has to take control. The underdog who is wounded from fight, can't get back on his feet but in the end is all in it again. With a will. The retired who are willing to risk their lives again. Just a few examples here. I also loved the music. Didn't expect some of these great big songs and hits. I've seen that the critics are very different and I'm glad I watched it because it was a solid movie with a few things I didn't like but when do we ever watch a perfect movie? This showed me that sometimes you shouldn't judge too early about films you've only seen a trailer of.",Battleship

Rihanna in uniform. A fantasy finally come true. OK jokes apart, it was actually a really good film. Apart from the cheesy one liners and the fact that the highly intelligent beings managed to forget the most basic of items, it got me rooting for the marines and was a good Saturday night movie.Taylor Kitsch once again did the film industry justice by playing the rebel who gets a cause and finds a way to tame the tiger within(You see!

It's so profoundly atrocious, so spectacularly deplorable, so intensely horrendous that saying it's bad is like giving Oscar to everyone involved in its creation.The script is written by a cliché fetishist. First 20 minutes filled with pointless melodrama that makes you constantly look at your wrist watch wondering when aliens arrive, and when they actually arrive you become even more depressed.They clearly hired some mentally-disabled person to come up with the key element of this sci-fi debacle, which is this: Aliens, while having somewhat questionable, yet quite capable war machinery, have one ""interesting"" weakness: they constantly scan our ships and soldiers and attack only if guns are aimed directly at them with the intent to shoot. If guns are off by 10 degrees they become absolutely disinterested and let you live till the next time you decide to attack. That exercise in idiocy can be repeated as many times as needed. I am not kidding.Of course, brave humans manage to figure out that they deal with dumbest space morons in all the galaxy, and beat them to a pulp using inferior technology.Add to that a staggering amount of patriotic drool and you will get the ugliest kind of spectacle that represents the worst Hollywood can offer.Any 8 year old child could come up with more logical and less loopy idea while riding a bicycle, eating a lollipop and listening to Death metal.I am not sure if somewhere out there there are aliens that have nothing better to do than attack Earth, but if they get their testicles (cuz i wouldn't use tentacles to touch it) on this movie you can bet your panties the attack is coming, even the most tranquil alien will loose his cool after watching Battleship. They spent $200 million on this fiasco. District 9 costs $30 million.Instead of counting boobs and f-words MPAA should investigate movies like this, because nothing that idiotic can go into production with that kind of budget without some kind of conspiracy to waste money while simultaneously insulting movie audiences, on Earth and elsewhere.",Battleship

341,TooDrunkToWalk,"A Mindless action movie, nothing more nothing less - Extremely Poor Editing Though",5,15 April 2012,"If one wanted, one could really rip this movie apart into shreds, but that would be a very misguided review, because the movie never really claims to be anything more than a mindless action movie, where you are supposed to enjoy the explosion and forget about the movie once you leave the movie hall. So there is really no sense in walking into this movie, expecting it to anything other than that. If you are looking for gut wrenching scenes and great story development, then you walked into the wrong movie.So to judge the movie on what it is not, and trust me there is plenty that it is not, would be wrong and rather unfair. So there is only one question to ask, and that is whether it delivers enough action, and the answer is Yes. There are lots of booms and things exploding every few seconds and some of the characters are even given a semblance of a storyline. So there are lots of guys trying to do heroic things and kicking some alien butt.I would have rated this movie higher had the editing been better. The editing is just horrible. For starters the movie kills too much time at the start before anything happens. I mean we see what appears to be an entire football game, before the aliens arrive. I mean we know they are coming, so it is rather a waste of time to spend so long in the movie watching actors basically eat dinner and, well, play football till the aliens get here......y couldn't we just fast forward to the part that aliens arrive, because the rest of the stuff they show is just not interesting enough.Another example of poor editing and also poor direction, is we get a scene where an alien is just shown lying captured by the navy and one of the characters just recounts how it was captured, and we don't get a scene of him being captured. I mean we spent 5 - 7 mins of the movie watching a football game, wouldn't that time have been better served by having the scene where the alien was captured instead.Once the aliens arrive however, the explosions start, and if you like action movies, then you won't find too many issues with the movies as there are enough explosions to satisfy even the most hard to please action movie fans, along with plenty of other over the top ""hero"" moments from various actors.If you give it a miss then you won't exactly be missing out on movie history.

344,filmcritic3,Summer popcorn movie at its best,10,17 May 2012,"BATTLESHIP I have high anxiety with movies based on games; not only video games, mind you, but board games, too. Remember the fiasco, CLUE? This is why, at the screening for BATTLESHIP, I turned to my guest and said: ""If someone says, 'you sank my battleship' in this movie, I'm going to steal your popcorn."" I didn't steal the popcorn. Director Peter Berg was not that corny.Back in the day (which Dane Cook tells us was a Wednesday), BATTLESHIP was dubbed a strategy game. In actuality, it was more a hit and miss peg game, but the more perplexing problem in translation to film is how to make a plastic barrier screen into a viable movie plot point. The answer: Aliens (Steven Spielberg knew it all along). From this point, BATTLESHIP borrows from a plethora of other movies to weave the best ""let's kick their butts"" military propaganda since BATTLE: LOS ANGELES.Alex Hopper, played by Taylor Kitsch, is a social misfit. No matter what he tries, he manages to screw up. Think Bill Murray on steroids. His brother Stone, played by Alexander Skarsgard, is a successful naval officer, who cares deeply for his younger sibling and is taking the role of surrogate father. Alex falls madly in love with Samantha Shane, eye-candy in the guise of Brooklyn Decker. Sam however, is the daughter of Admiral Shane, played by Liam Neeson, who is general lord and commander of the navy. Also appearing, in complete battle fatigues is pop diva Rihanna as Cora 'Weps' Raikes. Through the entire film she is wrapped head to toe in military garb, drenched in combat sweat, yet she still manages to look hot. It's an abnormality; she has no bust line, her derrière is too large, she's covered with inane tattoos making her look like a AAA triptik, yet somehow there is something alluring about her. Go figure.Fed up with his incompetence, Stone drags Alex into the navy with him; a type of brotherly drafting. Here is the first of many script continuity errors. Alex comes into the navy as a second lieutenant. How? There's no mention of a college ROTC program, nor a passage of time as Alex rises through the ranks. Apparently, you can just go down to the local naval office, sign up as an officer, and be placed in charge of the weapons department on a destroyer. Sweet. Screenwriters Erich and Jon Hoeber leave important elements, such as this, completely out of the story in favor of skimming over the minimal plot to bring the viewer to the battle scenes. For this type of movie, it's a very good move. The love story was beginning to reek of Nicholas Sparks's fumes.From this point, a hodgepodge of scene stealing encompasses the rest of the movie. Geek scientists send a message into space to other potentially life-bearing planets and receive a response, just like JOHN CARPENTER'S SPACEMAN. The response, however, is not one of peace and love. The aliens send a strategic scouting party for invasion, ala INDEPENDENCE DAY. Instead of Jeff Goldblum saying ""Checkmate"", we have David Jensen saying: ""We're looking at a class four extinction level."" Personally, I didn't know extinction came in levels. I always thought it was an either-or proposition.Conveniently, the assembled navies of 14 different countries happen to be on maneuvers in the exact spot where the aliens decide to land. Once in the Pacific Ocean, the aliens establish a protective bubble, taken directly from the original and far superior, WAR OF THE WORLDS. Borrowed from the same film is a key scene regarding the alien eye piece; the difference is one of insect and reptilian lenses. Some ships are trapped inside the bubble, while the rest of the military is outside, with no communications possible. The few ships trapped inside must find a way to hold off the alien hordes and lower the force field, just like Han and the gang in RETURN OF THE JEDI.The SFX crew takes over, led by Production Designer Neil Spisak, and the roller coaster ride begins. Ship vs. ship, man vs. alien, man vs. man, man vs. ship and myriad David and Goliath encounters fill the screen in break-neck pace, thanks to Editors Colby Parker, Jr., Billy Rich and Paul Robell. Steve Jablonsky adds a rousing score that is liberally purloined from TRANSFORMERS and INCEPTION. The aliens are the most humanoid seen on film in recent years. Hands like ET, helmets like PREDATOR, and body armor like BATTLE: LOS ANGELES, several of Hollywood's top make-up artists appear as alien invaders in cameo roles.BATTLESHIP follows the same formula as 80 percent of John Wayne's war movies. It's a tried and true pattern, just as successful now as it was during the 1940's. To beef up the tale, Berg tosses in a SPACE COWBOYS element for the final climatic conflict. The ship, screeching to an impossible port maneuver, and the references to Sun Tzu's THE ART OF WAR, are hysterical.There are neither deeply evolving characters nor substantial story telling. BATTLESHIP sets up the fight, and then lets the festivities begin. This is a summer movie at its finest. Bring out the popcorn and enjoy.",Battleship

Several sub-plots are tacked on and have no bearing on the whole thing - but rather just seem added for the ""feelgood factor"". It's almost as if in the boardroom they said: ""okay....we've got alien invasion. what we need to ad to flesh it out is ""love interest"" (add 15 minutes), ""Marine with prosthetic legs and anger management problem"" (add 15 minutes) and ""inner conflicted brat boy"" (add gratuitous close-ups of hunky protagonist). Even as a pure action flick it's too predictable. I kept waiting for something to make some sense, but it didn't come. To paraphrase Billy Bob: Space-ship Fu, Aluminum Leg Fu.

348,Knighthawk701,Most stupid aliens since ALF,1,5 August 2012,"The reason I give this movie one star is because of the nice alien vessels. They deserve (with the CGI) like 4-5 stars, but the plot, plot holes and inaccuracy are so overwhelmingly, they drag the number of stars down. Yes, the script was written by a bunch of kids who were promised a copy of Halo if they wrote a script about 'aliens come to earth to destroy' movie.I watched this movie and I was asking myself a lot of questions during the 2 hour watch. Like: why have 3 stations send a signal to the relay satellite, and what is up with the visual beams and such? One would do really. Why all the fancy lights on the relay-satellite? Was some one bored at the CGI company? Are these aliens blind? They travel to Earth with super-duper technology yet crash into a satellite. Why do they build vehicles that hop on the water? Were are the death-rays? Their arsenal is rather limited compared to their 90 mile high shield. These aliens (who's CGI heads are laughably bad animated) are plain stupid. Even ALF would do better trying to take over the planet. They attack a naval base. Okay, good one. Then they attack a traffic-jam and the roads. All the time you see that these cars and concrete blocks are marked red, so need to be taken out. Yet they don't think 2-3 armed-to- the-teeth warships are a hazard to them (they are green if they turn away). Yeah, just imagine the awesome firepower of 1000 cars in a traffic-jam... During the day the aliens let the destroyer get away (while being able to destroy it a 1000 times over but rather defending the shield-generator) but at night they are looking around for the ship? And why these aliens don't have something like radar to see the destroyer from a huge distance is weird. It's like a lot of things in this movie happen because it's a good thing for the humans. Like the computer-nerd breaking in the building and getting caught. Of course, he turns green for the alien. I mean, come one! They kill people for just being in a traffic jam yet breaking into the compound were their most important asset (the uplinkdish) is, is noting to worry about?Then the plot holes. Why is Earth saved if we stop them from transmitting a signal to their planet? Are these the kind of aliens that only send a scouting-party and if they don't hear from them again they won't check us out again? If NASA/Pentagon know they will be using this satellite, why not try to control it and disable it or steer it away? The Pentagon want's the admiral to send in attacks thru the shield, the admiral does not want to sacrifice any planes. Why is he admiral forgetting he has hundreds Tomahawk missiles at his disposal? Are there no submarines present at the largest naval exercise in 100 years? Maybe a sub can get under the shield, worth a try.Then the inaccuracy. They claim the Missouri has the old fire mechanisms still. This is not the case. These controls were modernized in the Reagan era. Then a 45.000 ton battleship does not turn like a car throwing the anchor out. Either the anchor-chain will snap or it will destroy the front of the ship. At a certain point the Japanese captain asks for the radar (Aegis) system to be taken offline. There is a protest, yet the enemy is totally invisible by radar. So there is no reason to protest turning off the radar since it won't be of use anyway. Why they send a high ranking officer and the weapons controller from the destroyer to inspect the aliens ship? The script is totally laughable and there is no way some one with a functioning brain looked at it before hitting the screen. Or maybe it were the writers that did write the scripts for episodes of ALF also wrote this hogwash called a blockbuster...",Battleship

Also think of all the alien movies we have had so far and what else can be done? You go to the movies to be entertained but I guess some people just can't let themselves go for 2 hours and enjoy whats on the screen because it wasn't written like they would of written it. I liked the aliens HALO type armor they wore and the wrecking ball/drilling metal munching destroying things were the sickness. That was one hell of a way to chew up a ship and spit it out, thought that was great. My kids loved it and my father got choked up over the veterans part. (His father is from that era and fought in Guam) I was just happy to get away from the busy/nasty daily grind we all sometimes endure and let myself go.

350,Esswasim,Sigh! Can cause severe damage to your heart.,1,9 September 2012,"Awful! That is the start it deserves, if you are thoughtful person just don't watch this crap. There are some good reviews I saw but actually I feel it must be reviews from those people who made the movie for supporting their stupid actions, the movie doesn't deserve more than a single star. My heart feels very bad after watching an alien ship getting destroyed by a satellite, the same alien ship traveled at speed of light without getting damaged by the friction developed by the atmospheric pressure. I am not good at science but I must tell you I could figure out how crappy this movie is. Destroyers get destroyed but a battleship won't be destroyed which is technically older technology and has no right to fight against a spaceship in first place... Why not use a nuclear submarine instead ? Aliens are so weak that a person with no legs would kick them and choke them to death. Their armor is definitely bullet proof but how poorly equipped they are? I mean it is weird the setup was as if Aliens are very intelligent and it turned out they are worse than idiots.. Don't get me started with the acting of the damn crew, there are many among us who can do a better job in front of camera and i am damn sure about that. Can someone explain that round chainsaw like weapon that could destroy everything that gets in its way ? Awesome weapon and understands when it reaches near a kid and scans the kid and goes around him to destroy rest of the stuff... I mean that is superior technology then how the hell that the battleship that old win against such technology and with a stupid captain on board with lame old men in it ? The old men and their battleship to destroy one of the highly sophisticated technologies that man has never met before and they do succeed to do so almost without a fight... Conclusion, if you are got no brain , if you are drunk and numb, go ahead and watch this piece of nasty crap, noisy action, I would recommend to save your money for a better thing that would satisfy you, this movie would leave you in the lurch and it will take your peace from you, your idea about aliens can change, you will start finding them stupid and weak, and maybe you would understand how pathetic a Hollywood movie can be.

He is in the movie and great as usual, but his character is nothing but introspective. History is written, and rewritten here. A thought provoking yarn, this movie is not.

360,Bored78,"Good Entertainment, Bad Reality",8,7 July 2015,"I watched this movie twice and read some reviews here. Most of the complaints I am seeing are based on that its "" not realistic""... which i find mind boggling. You have an alien invasion movie and its not realistic is the biggest complaint? really? Some common ""unrealistic"" problems people seem to have with this movie:Problem: Aliens that are capable of long distance space flight are incapable of defeating ""inferior"" humans. Solution: In this regard Americans and Russians are superior to other humans because they went to the moon. That would be an incorrect conclusion. Just like assuming that because a species is capable of long distance space flight that they are vastly superior to another species that isn't. Technological advancement often follows the path of necessity. Perhaps the aliens had a reason to focus on space flight. Maybe their planet or sun was dying, maybe pollution on their planet was causing an irreversible slow death of the planet. Maybe their people were greatly interested in exploring the universe. Their are many factors in which they could of focused on space flight. Problem: The Alien ships which can fly through space, just hop on water and just seem to be able to hop in one direction. Solution: Just because a ship can fly in the vacuum of space doesn't mean it can float/ go under water/ or fly on a planet. This is like assuming that a fighter jet can fly to space since it can fly. We have engines( ion engines actually) that would not operate in atmosphere. They would burn up. However they use very little fuel which makes them good for space flight. Since these are space ships Transportation on ground is likely not a high priority, as the conditions on planets vary widely. Using wheels or tracks or propellers would greatly limit the ability of the ship to move on various planet surfaces. Having atmosphere flight engines also would be limited as the composition of planets atmospheres varies greatly. And engine designed for atmospheric flight on their planet may not work on very many other planets. So using your imagination you could conclude they use their main engines to do little hops but using them for sustained flight would probably damage them. Problem: The alien weapons seem equal or inferior to ours except the robots which do not bother with a ""decommissioned"" battleship. that is unrealistic. Solution: The first logical answer for this is that one makes the assumption that because we are an aggressive and violent species that all intelligent species will be the same. While the aliens are attempting( assuming) to establish a beachhead they may not have the violent past we do and thus weapon development was not a priority to them. Also if you notice all of their weapons are defensive in nature. The forcefield ship which gives them a protected area, the ""hedgehog"" type canister launcher which seems to be short range. And the fact their computer screens seem to paint either threats or objectives as red and everything else as green. When no longer a threat, they ignore it. One can conclude that their objective is not to take on the world but to establish a beachhead, assess the situation, then contact the home planet. Which is basically the plot of the movie from the alien side. the group was more or less a scouting party. And scouts really aren't equipped to fight wars. Their main goal was survivability and information gathering and relay. Not taking on planet earth. You can further imagine that they have a fleet of actual warships that are designed for offense waiting for intel on this new planet, so they can create a battle plan. Intel that never comes because we stop it. This is a good movie if you don't try to pick it apart and use your imagination and do not assume that aliens are going to:1)Be vastly superior to us 2)Be as advanced in weapons and armor as we are just because they have space flight capability. 3)Have fancy weapons 4)Have space ships that can operate in any conditions on a planet, 5)Not misjudge the threat of the dominant species of the planet they are attacking. You have to use your imagination of what is implied rather than have it spoon fed to you. If you have a good imagination and pay attention to details in the movie you will enjoy it. If you expect it to be "" realistic"" and assume aliens are going to be like humans if humans were capable of interstellar travel then your going to be greatly disappointed.",Battleship
361,Afflock,Like the game it was 2 dimensional,5,19 May 2012,"It is popcorn summer movie fodder. Big on FX (though 2 brief scenes were not up to par), sound, explosions, and action. It fell short on story, character development, acting, obeying the laws of physics, the Turing Test, and continuity with the military theme.I say the Turing Test as there was one character that just did not fit and had no idea why they were there. Think Jar Jar Binks. They were annoying and useless.Liam Neesen did the most ""acting"". It did feel a little like a Michael Bay movie. Transformer(ish) on the alien ships. Though they were dumbed down to fit the story. There were flaws. Unanswered story mechanics. Continuity with the military was very flawed. As a former Navy guy they really bothered me.

It's a 132 minutes thriller which keeps you smile, thrilled and Proud too with some clapping moments. Thou the script of the movie did require proper polishing which felt missing at times. Also its commendable that director didn't mixed up Transformers with Battleship; as the former just talked about Machines and later despite focusing on huge powerful machines talked about love, Pride, Courage and Aliens of course.Despite the many ups the disappointing part was the individual performances of the main leads especially Rihanna . Taylor was decent and Brooklyn Decker looks hot. The movie has few but noticeable characters especially Gregory D. Gadson as Lieutenant Colonel Mick Canales. Cinematography by Tobias A. Schliessler is superb and background music by Steve Jablonsky keeps you Haunting.There are several moments like the strategy of putting down the anchor and hits the bull eye, or the crashing of a building in Hong kong, appearing of the alien Ship out of the sea or the creation of the massive force field in the sea, the newly funny but deadly weapons, breaking of huge ships(esp.

372,doomas10,It sinks like Titanic...although it takes longer!,4,11 April 2012,"Is this the latest creation from Peter Berg? The person responsible for ""Friday night lights"", ""the rundown"", ""the kingdom"" and ... ""Hancock"" managed to outdo Michael Bay and unfortunately in a bad way. I love Michael Bay for what he does. I love the way he shoots chaotic action with as many practical effects as possible. When it comes to car chases and nicely integrated in the GCI fest explosions, Bay is the best. However, there is a limit at how much uninspired and now "" i have seen this before"" action my brain can process. Especially if it is based entirely on CGI. ""Battleship"" is not a terrible film but it is truly a bad one. I was expecting it to be at least mindless fun but frankly after a ridiculously funny intro (on purpose) where our douchebag hero tries desperately to get a chicken burrito to his future girlfriend, the film relies heavily on computer game-ish special effects and unlikable characters with really questionable motivations. Speaking of the effects, while most of them are impressive, the not so friendly ETs reminded me the mess of ""Green lantern"". They are forgettable, cheesy and a cheap combination of ""Halo"" and ""Crysis"" armour suits. For a movie that takes mostly place in the sea (or above it), the sea battles by far remain the weakest visual element since the water is computer generated. On the other hand some of the destruction sequences (such as a falling skyscraper) look incredibly polished but most of the set pieces feel directly lifted and copied from ""Transformers: Dark of the moon"".As for the characters, i didn't like any of them really. Not that the actors have much material to work with. Taylor Kitsch's hero is a reckless man (and you enroll yourself to the navy?) who sacrifices Japanese soldiers for his personal conflicts and even though he starts as likable personality. Other individuals serve as satellites and provide nothing more than filler context for a long duration of 2 and a half hours! What's the point of having, the hero, the hero's future father in law, girlfriend, brother, 4-5 American navy officers, 2-3 war veterans, 2 Japanese navy officers (one in a major role), a scientist and a disabled guy with whom the hero's girlfriend happens to be his therapist? There is so much filler that easily this could have been one hour and a half and could have been a blast! Rihanna's much discussed acting debut will definitely not get her a career in Hollywood - much like 50 Cent's- since she is practically ... invisible. Her lines are garbage and so generic along with her body language and actions in the film. Good thing for a navy officer to wear make up and earings. Liam Neeson always walks away with his dignity intact as at least brings some gravitas to his (limited) role. Everyone else gets a screen time of 5 minutes and they should be happy.Peter Berg's camera work tries desperately to inject as much spectacle as possible with multiple explosions, gun fights and space rockets but at the end it is an empty film in autopilot. We know nothing about the aliens or their motivations and they lack the epicness ""Independence day"" had. Instead we get to see numerous times terminator like screenshots that suggest a predator alike intelligence. Point is? Something that does not help the matters is the decision if this is serious or not. While it starts like a straight out romantic comedy, it escalates to such cheesy levels that you feel like you are trapped in a swiss cheeze maze although you are the rat forced to eat your way through the walls and at some point you burst. Taylor Kitsch has leading man charisma and he is better in the funny scenes rather in those that matchoism is required and i would like to see him more into films. There is some impressive camera-work at some places (such as the sinking of the ship in one shot) and some tongue in cheek humour that will bring a smile upon your face. But overall this is at the end an overplayed borefest maybe because we have seen too many (and better) alien invasion movies lately with state of the art effects, similar action sequences and more emphasis to dynamic action rather than American patriotism at its finest.

The imagination of the creators was fantastic. The alien craft were truly amazing to behold, and equally so was the emergence of the USS Missouri from retirement *Spoiler*...

The green light / red light thing to select targets and the initial attempt at contact just using a loud horn (which the US Navy misinterprets as aggression) seems to point to this, as does the aliens' destruction of just military targets, or routes to their area which could be used by aggressors...But then you realize the aliens' main form of offence (the little barrels they fire from their ships) aren't mining charges as suggested by some more thoughtful reviewers, they're just like the little pegs you use to sink battleships in the kid's Battlehips game. And then you remember this film was 'inspired' by the very same kid's game, and all the fine motives disappear - the two sides must just be 'taking turns'...Which ultimately takes the film back into the 'really dumb' territory!With a little more care, better acting and less cgi this could have been a decent, thought-provoking film about the wisdom of contacting aliens, and how to interpret their responses. Or with a less ambiguous (and better written) plot this could have been a decent- enough bog-standard blockbuster, which didn't leave you feeling like you've just wasted 2 hours of your time.

I consider this movie objectively bad. I wasn't expecting any ""realism"" from a movie about battleships and aliens but I thought they might try and give it a veneer of reality at least. No such luck. Soundtrack had some good rock hits in it I guess.I don't think I would recommend this movie to anyone but if you are an armed services veteran, I definitely suggest you avoid this movie. The idea that the main character (I finished this movie 10 minutes ago and already forgot his name) could be an officer in the Navy is insulting. There are a few brief scenes with real WWII era veterans doing real things on what I assume is a real WWII era battleship which are pretty cool, but otherwise the representation of the military in this movie is childish and rude. In a desperate attempt to manufacture ""character development"" you end up with war ships apparently being crewed by about 5 people.If you really like PG-13 action/blockbuster movies like The Transformers and G. I. Joe and the various Fast & The Furious sequels (the original is a classic of the genre but the sequels are garbage in my opinion) then you might like Battleship. Otherwise, stay away.If you're considering this movie for your teenage son, I think you could find something much better. They might be entertained by it (aliens, guns, explosions, hot girls, etc.) but I think it glorifies the idea of being a screw up who doesn't apply themselves.

From the disabled army vet to the WWII vets near the end, this movie reminded me of my friends who recently served our country, to my father inlaw who served in veitnam and my grandfather who served in WWII. Special thanks to the writers and director who finally decided to honor our service men and women instead of demonizing or scape goating them.

389,Karaokephile,Non-stop thrill ride of utter crap.,3,6 August 2012,"The stars are exclusively for the special effects, which are spectacular.In years gone by, movies about war were based on actual wars. Now that our military has gone several decades as private thugs for Halliburton and its ilk, Hollywood has had to make up wars where A-#1, mom and apple pie, ""Go USA!"" flag-wavers can feel good about our military budget being approximately equal to the rest of the world's combined.This movie is for you drooling rednecks. It's got everything you want: explosions, a lot of AC/DC songs, ""good ol' days"" military equipment run by your granddaddy besting the technologically-advanced and intellectually-superior (city boy) aliens, quick camera cuts so your ADHD brains don't get bored, and tons of scientific mistakes.I hadn't seen trailers for this movie, so I had no idea it was based (really?) on the famous board game by the same name. What's next? Freeze Tag, the Broadway musical? Basically, if you enjoy this movie and you're over 10, you're retarded and please step away from the food stamp line and stop reproducing.You will enjoy the God references.

The plot was predictable though how it unfolded wasn't. And the humor was good, well placed and not too cheesy. The story line wasn't strong but had nice predictable and yet still some surprise sci-fi feel to it. Not a huge fan of the leap-frogging alien ""boats"", it was my least favorite part, but I guess they were trying to stay true to the game. And didn't really like the wheelie, destructive projectiles much but...whatever. The acting wasn't great (5-6/10) but wan't horrible either. The cinematography I liked because I like this modern age of CGI and FX! Sure you can have too much but this isn't Casablanca so throw plenty of CGI in there!I wasn't expecting a Shawshank Redemptive drama, a Sixth Sense revelation or a Fifty Shades of emotional roller coaster. I was expecting action, and I got it. I was hoping for good music to accompany the action, and I got it! And finally...I love battleships (not the movie but the ship). You want a tear-jerker you're in the wrong genre. You want an emotionally-filled feel good movie, wrong genre. You want a meaning-of-life, soul-searching movie...move on. You want an action movie with good CGI, great music, buttkicker-of-a-movie..you're in the right place. That's why I gave it a 6/10. P.S.

391,thedarksteps,Why do aliens always lose?,3,19 May 2012,"They've mastered technology that by comparison makes us look like we're still in the stone age yet for some reason we always seem to win. It's like tribal warriors in some part of the world taking out our military war machines with bows and arrows; similar to how Avatar played out.Independence Day, War of the Worlds, Cowboys & Aliens(really applicable reference), Battlefield: LA, and so many others, where the aliens with technology light years ahead of ours with forces outnumbering ours 10 fold or more... and yet the humans always win.Sure there are casualties and fatalities by the masses of unimportant undeveloped background characters that you really don't care about, but humanity as a whole survives after pushing back the alien onslaught.This movie is comparable to all the above mentioned movies, but doesn't compare to any of the good sci-fi movies with just a tad bit of realistic outcomes. This is a money spender movie, meaning you drop $10+ on the ticket, $20-$40 on concessions, and $100+ paying a psychiatrist to help you come to terms that you wasted nearly $100 on a movie you should have waited to see on NetFlix or Redbox.Fortunately for me, I work at a movie theater and saw it for free, but that's 2+ hours that I could have been doing something constructive like playing video games, sleeping, or paying tribute at the porcelain temple that resides in everyone's homes.Suspension of disbelief has to come in to play in order to watch and enjoy this movie. Don't go in expecting to see a great movie with great special effects; go in expecting to see great special effects with adequate acting by some.I usually love movies like this, but when it is the same rehashed storyline that has been told since moving pictures first hit the big screen, it has gotten too old to enjoy. Hopefully MIB 3 will cleanse my palette of this rotten tomato of a movie, if not, I can only hope that Prometheus can redeem the genre of alien movies. Maybe I should start writing action movies; it's not like you really need a plot, you just need a production company willing to drop a couple hundred million dollars to make it.A polished turd is still a turd.",Battleship

Or they probably used all the ideas Michael Bay dropped. There's even a lovely scene right out of Titanic. I thought they were going to kiss and all...damn!I sort of enjoyed Taylor Kitsch's performance, much like Shia in the first Transformers. And the special effects are really top notch.

393,juliefrein,This ex-Navy spouse loves this movie,8,5 June 2021,"How would the Navy of today respond to the alien attack scenario presented in this movie? With this in mind, I thought the actors did a good job maintaining Navy protocols.The movie score can be over the top in places, but generally lets you know when the action is stepping up.What I really love about the movie is the interaction of the younger Hopper with his subordinates. His reluctance to accept he is the officer in charge once his CO is killed and the way the enlisted people urge him into command is believable. I like the integration of his girlfriend Sam into the storyline as well as the retirees on the Missouri when they are called into the battle. The movie does a great job with suspending belief as well.The concept and execution of the aliens themselves is some of the best special effects I have seen. Giving them a vulnerability to bright light and the helmets they wear help the sailors understand they are not superbeings. The attacks on the island's military resources as well as the infrastructures of the island yet sparing the boy on the baseball field show they are not interested at that point in killing unarmed civilians directly, though some are casualties when the highway is destroyed.While there is confusion for a while, the cast show that it is possible to defeat the seemingly undefeatable when you work in tandem and have the same goals.Personally, this is, for me, a fun movie to put on when I don't find anything else interesting to watch.",Battleship
394,master-bot,Garbage.,2,12 August 2012,"WOW! Money well spent! Instead of producing this garbage, the producers should've sent the money to Africa. I would've been much more impressed by that.This brainless crap hardly deserves a full-fledged review. So, I'll just give a few highlights to summarize the nonsense that takes place.1. Super geniuses at NASA decide, for no apparent reason other than stupidity, to send a greeting signal to another Earth-like planet, without any prior knowledge of it, any preparation, or worse-case scenario plan. ""Fu** all, let's just see what happens"" kind of thinking. No half-functioning government would ever allow such bs. And what do you know - the worst case scenario happens.2. A super advanced alien race that can travel between galaxies comes to Earth. But wait, they've sent only five Lego-looking spaceships, along with a big-ass antenna to call home. Oh yea, and these advanced aliens discover that if they crash their ONLY antenna into buildings and stuff, it actually breaks. NOoo! If only they had brought that spare antenna... damn it. I guess they couldn't dial home from space, before crash-landing on the planet, and breaking the antenna. Apparently the aliens are worse at contingency planning than the NASA 'geniuses' mentioned previously. So once they brake their antenna they have to use human satellites to call home. Sure. It all makes sense. But they've mastered intergalactic space flight, so they're cool... Moving on.3. After landing in the ocean, the super advanced alien ships suddenly lose their ability to fly. Instead, they just hop over the surface of the water like grasshoppers. I guess it would've been too easy to just fly OVER the human ships and wipe them out. Oh but then the movie would be over too soon, so that's not an option. OK, we go with the water-hopping.4. On one hand, we realize that the aliens have come to Earth with the single purpose to annihilate the whole neighborhood. On the other hand, occasionally they act all non-hostile and pacifist when they're not being targeted by human ships. Maybe they want to have some fun with the prey? Maybe they feel a misplaced sense of nobility before wiping out the planet? These aliens are a true enigma! 5. The alien super-killer ships seem to be very bad at aiming. The fast-moving human ships must be difficult targets. I guess the aliens must've been really flabbergasted when they lost the ability to fly. Yep, that must be it.6. The entire movie consists of two major plot developments: 1. A single human ship takes on the entire alien fleet while all other military forces are either counting sheep or nowhere to be found. 2. A disabled veteran with a cane, along with his sexy trainer, climb a mountain to kick some alien ass and save the world, while the rest of the world is too busy to worry about an alien invasion. Maybe they're all busy tweeting and updating their facebook status. Oh wait, we don't know that, because WE NEVER SAW WHAT THE REST OF THE WORLD WAS DOING DURING THE ALIEN INVASION! I guess the writers didn't find that very important, so they skipped it.The lack of a logical script in this movies together with the bad acting feels like someone took a bunch of broken components and assembled them into a block of illogically connected mess. It's garbage.",Battleship

The CGI is excellent, big explosions, and a good rock and roll music soundtrack make this movie a nice way to spent a weekday night. I dint care about the characters, and it's entirely fiction because it doesn't have any science. Liam Neeson is great like always but he plays a small part, so if you are a fan of him don't go wasting your time, Rhihana was actually good, I'll even go as far and say she was the best actress in the movie, the aliens were no where near realistic or scary or smarter than us except for the technology, but like I say it's just another block buster so fasten your seat belt and enjoy.",Battleship

When will Hollywood learn that having a big budget doesn't automatically imply that audiences will jump at the first sight of a preview? Sure, we get it by now Hollywood has big money but the stories have all been done before, it's high time they looked outside their border (South Africa) for kiss-ass scripts ie. Distric 9.We've been waiting patiently for that sequel but instead we get a flopquel in Battleship the concept of an old Navy ship taking on sophisticated alien ships doesn't make sense. How they expected it to work beats me? The aliens look too human to scare anyone plus they were tame if nobody provoked them.

399,Sebastianostlund,Battleship *SPOILER*,1,23 August 2012,"This is one of the worst movies iv'e ever seen! Yeah, i know what some of you are thinking now ""Well, it can't be that bad...can it?"". And to answer that question yes...it's that bad. I didn't go in with any expectations on the acting, the characters or the story all i was hoping for was a good action loaded movie with cool effects that you just could just turn of your brain to and enjoy. Well, it is cool effects and some cool action scenes but that's all. The only thing i didn't like about the CGI was that it looked to much like transformers which shouldn't be a let down since those movies have great CGI, but i didn't want it to look like another transformers movie i wanted it to have an own stile with new CGI that we haven't seen before but no it didn't. And the story was as expected very thin and very boring, but the thing that disturbed me the most was that you never got to know why the aliens attacked earth! They had a whole planet with the same conditions as earth so why would they attack us? I don't know, so my conclusion (becuse the movie is based on a board game...) is that they just went to earth to play a real match in battleship...and then we have the characters. If anyone of those people would have been in the real navy...we would all be dead by now. Everybody is either jerks or idiots or both. It felt like non of them knew what the hell they where doing on the ships. But the worst part is that in some scenes threw out the movie some of the characters seemed to have received super powers! They where climbing up on 90 degrees angles, super sight, telerportation (those old dude's most have done that when they all showed up on that battleship all of a sudden) and unbreakable legs. The only thing i liked with this movie was the look on the aliens...they actually looked like they where intelligent enough to get to earth and take over it. Conclusion, this movie is only a good time when you are drunk with your friends so you just can laugh at all the bad things that's going on in it and the fact that it cost 200 million dollars to do and it flopped.",Battleship

401,Tom-464,A lot more fun for people who know Navy culture,8,27 May 2012,"This movie has gotten a lot of ... let's say, less than favorable reviews - mostly from people to whom the Navy is a ""black box,"" who don't know things that are taken for granted by the Navy characters in it. However, if you know the lingo and the traditions and just generally the way things work in the Navy, you'll like it a lot more, because you'll understand it a lot more.One example (and to stay spoiler-free, I'm not going to tie it to anything specific in the movie) is the meaning and uses of the title ""Captain"" aboard a Navy ship. Another is the difference between the meanings of ""boat"" and ""ship"" - a gaffe in the script.OK; all that stuff out of the way, I really liked the movie. It was fun, exciting, and (as the best SF does) says some meaningful things about the human condition.

402,WydeOpen,For a Frankenstein monster of a movie it's not as bad as one would expect,6,18 May 2012,"Battleship Rating:PG-13 Runtime: 2 hours 11 minutes Staring: Alexander Skarsgard, Taylor Kitsch, Brooklyn Decker, Liam Neeson Review: 2.5/5 stars I admit that I had no desire to screen what I thought was sure to be another Hollywood executives PG-13 bad idea. It's no secret that over the past few years Hollywood has seemed to run out of original ideas and have turned to rehashing, remaking, rebooting, reimaginig and generally rewarming ideas. But when we're young we're taught to ""never judge a book by it's cover"" and that prejudice is wrong in any and every situation. Apparently the new film ""Battleship"" was made specifically to remind me of these lessons. Still, as many fun nights as I've had playing Monopoly at the family table,  I've never had the thought ""Hey, why doesn't Hollywood spend $200 million making a live- action, CGI saturated movie based off a less fun game?"" But, believe it or not, I'm writing and you're reading a review of that very movie. Surprisingly, it's not as bad as one would expect. Especially considering Hasbro based movies have been (like Battleship game play)  ""hit"" or miss. (Transformers I and III were huge hits while Transformers II and G.I. Joe was considered by most as complete failures.) The plot, like the game it was ""based on"" is simple. Taylor Kitsch (Friday Night Lights) plays Alex Hopper, a bad boy who's attempting to straighten up his act and win the approval of his girlfriend's US Navy admiral dad by following in his big brother, Stone's Alexander Skarsgard (True Blood) footsteps and joining the Navy. Luckily for Alex, he gets the chance to prove himself when aliens from an earth like planet begin an invasion.  Predictably, these aliens seriously out gun us and upon arrival immediately follow the playbook of all alien invaders who have visited (and destroyed) us in theaters during past summers à la Independence Day but via Transformers-like CGI weaponry.Also, as with Transformers, one of the highlights of ""Battleship"" is the humor that paces the film from one fairly predictable scene to the next. But when the story requires  intensity, emotion is manufactured by using slow motion panoramic close ups (straight out of the Micheal Bay's summer school of cinematography) to alert the audience to the gravity of the situation. Confused? Think back to any climatic scenes in the Bad Boys or Transformers franchises and picture Will Smith and Martin Lawrence or Shia LeBeouf with the sunset heroically framing their stoic looks. By invoking the ""We're gonna go in there and kick-ass despite the odds"" attitude of films complimentary to the American military (literally The Right Stuff), director Peter Berg (Collateral) gets us to pick a dog in the fight. Instead of just waiting for the predictable resolution of the film, we actually cheer on the heroes moxie and feel patriotic pride while the aliens learn how serious we are about Pearl Harbor, where (not- so) coincidentally, most of the film's action takes place.The cast, overall does an adequate job even when handicapped with the script's sometime hokey dialog. No one actor's performance is mentionable other than to say that Rhianna's big screen debut wasn't horrible. Liam Neeson is seriously overqualified in a role overtly reminiscent and maybe an unintentional parody of Bruce Willis' character in Armageddon.Battleship borrows so many elements and clichés from hit films of the past 30 years (like Top Gun, Independence Day, Alien, Transformers, Super 8, Iron Man, Armageddon and to a lesser extent Pearl Harbor) that it edges close to spoofing the respective genres. But it never crosses that line and works (please know I'm using this word generously)  as it's own story because it takes so much from those other, better movies from the same (more or less)  genres. It's a Frankenstein monster of a movie which sum total is stronger than it's parts. Although rated PG-13 for violence, Battleship actually can be an entertaining family outing, (for those without young  kids.)",Battleship

404,movieexpert2001,a perfectly great space alien vs US navy sci fi action flick that strongly feels directed by Michael bay,9,28 March 2020,"I saw this movie back in 2012 and it was awesome ever since then i even owned it on on demand and watched it on tv often even though it had its flaws. and what i later realized is that many people i meet say Michael bay directed it. and it can actually be true in disguise. and i will have to agree with the people and especially my friends on this one cause it looks like something only he directed. it could very well be a Michael bay movie. The movie starts out showing the aliens in large comets on their way to the planet earth and you saw the similar thing in other of bay's movies armageddon and transformers. the astronomers discover the distant Gliese planetary system which is also learned to have a habitable planet where those aliens could be coming from the conditions were similar to earth itself and then the communications Aray is established by the nasa in Hawaii which then is being designed to send transmissions so it can contact with the Inteligent life outside of earth by using a lazer that goes through a satellite and it sends the aliens to earth. meanwhile a man named Alex hooper played by Taylor kitsch who is then assigned to work for the naval forces who own a big Millitary company that owns many battleships from across the planet is trying to impress his future girlfriend Sam Shane who is the daughter of the commander of the navy admiral Terrence Shane played by Liam Neeson but then gets caught and is arrested. he later wakes up in a tub full of ice and his brother naval officer stone tells Alex to join the US navy to improve his life that is what really got him to become a member of the navy. Alex becomes the tactical action officer as the lieutenant of the USS john Paul jones, while stone is assigned to be the commander of the USS Sampson. hopper then plays in a volley ball game of USA vs japan and japan wins the game, later then hopper spends time with Shane's daughter and then practices saying to the admiral may i please marry your daughter, later she meets with retired lieutenant colonel Mick Canales who she goes on a mountain hike with. then the alien spacecrafts arrive as they are being tracked by the astronomers some of them hit hong kong and some of them hit the sea of Hawaii . admiral Shane then orders all the ships including john Paul jones, Samson and Japanese ship ids Moyoko to investigate, they later on their way see a floating structure the ship sends Alex hopper and officer Cora Haikkes played by Rihanna to check it out then hopper accidentally turns it on and it activates a force field shield generator it then summons alien ships on the surface the battleships then make a sound for a warning the aliens then start out their attack by causing a supersonic power wave that breaks glass and causes a loud sound the aliens then fire bombs and when it hits one of the battleships it explodes resulting in damage and causing the death of stone and the command crew of john Paul jones. the aliens then launch their flying drones and they go to attack Hawaii they use scanning devices which aliens also use to scan their target and what they see is the main parts it starts out green and before they attack it turns red , one of them goes to hit a helicopter base, one of them goes to a baseball game but then goes and destroys the things that stand the highways and another one goes on top of the highways resulting damage to cars and the Hawaiian bases. then aliens create an electrical base that is meant to use its radars to re-establish the military communications with their home planet. Meanwhile later the battleship john Paul jones goes and tries to find the aliens by using a signal that tracks down where the alien ships are located when they locate them they miss at first but later are succesful at destroying most of the ships but one of them launches droids and destroys the whole ship the crew later floating on rafts finds the Missouri ship and sets it ready to fight they destroy the force field and mothership which sends droids out but are destroyed by the Boeing fighter jets from the USS Ronald Reagen carrier. they also eliminate the alien threat by sending a separate Missle to destroy the communication Aray. and later with the crew having saved the day they get honored at the ceremony where hopper is presented with a silver star and he then asks admiral Shane if he can marry his daughter, he refuses but then makes a promise to discuss the matter at lunch. this is yet another one of those action movies that show bravery and how to save the day, and another great thing about this masterpiece is it has two AC/DC songs hard as a rock and thunderstruck both are some of my favorite hard rock songs. and like i said it looks just like a Michael bay movie so much that you would actually congratulate Michael bay himself for the existence of this movie because it was made from the influence in bay's hand. thanks Alot you've done it again Michael bay, final grade score B+",Battleship

407,Joshua_Barry,"It is a mindless, popcorn super spectacle - but like so many these days, it works on that level.",5,24 April 2012,"Battleship is yet another blockbuster movie adapted from a board game. This time from Hasbro. The FX are mammoth, the action fierce, the soundtrack booming macho Rock. So if the audience is composed of young males, or gun toting rednecks they will swoon with delight. Of course there is risible dialogue, so-so performances and more plot holes than a block of Swiss cheese – so it is purely an outing for action junkies and CGI effects lovers.Taylor Kitsch, fresh from his encounters with aliens on Mars in John Carter takes the lead again. He is the younger brother of Alexander Skarsgard, a high ranking Navy Officer and after yet another brush with the law, he is forced by his brother to enlist in the Navy to straighten him out. His love interest is played by Brooklyn Decker ( the swimsuit model and wife of Andy Roddick) who to her credit does a reasonable job of her role. She is the daughter of the Naval Commander ( Liam Neeson, who seems to be having occasional trouble taking the whole thing seriously.) Rihanna has her screen debut as a cool and tough navy girl.Well Taylor soon gets his share of responsibility, action and heroism as aliens that have landed four spacecraft in the Pacific off Hawaii begin to demolish aircraft carriers, destroyers, cities and humans at a swift rate.The finale throws everything into the maelstrom including the massive battleship U.S.S. Missouri crewed by a mix of W.W.2 old timers and the remnants of Taylor's surviving crew. ( The Missouri – Big Mo – was the last battleship built by the United States and it was on its decks that Japan surrendered which formally closed World War Two. Sadly, since 99% of the audience at my session were young males between 15 – 25, I daresay this historical fact slipped by unnoticed. But perhaps they recall Cher sprawled over the Missouri's big guns in her ' Turn Back Time' video back in 1989. )No doubt owing to its video game genesis, this movie has undeveloped characters and poor narrative, but, does it work ? Yes, very much so- for the target audience in question at least. Outside of that, it will no doubt be blasted and levelled by serious critics to the same degree that the aliens managed to blast and level much of Hong Kong. But I speak purely to that target audience now, and have to admit that the finale where the Missouri roars into action after 70 years as a museum is well choreographed and directed. It smacks of the Michael Bay / 'Transformers' directorial school of epic action – adventure visuals. filmnotion.com",Battleship

410,joshuawood2012,An awful movie worth watching only to laugh at.,3,16 January 2013,"This film rendition of the classic WWII board game of the same title was a step in the wrong direction to begin with. The game ""Battleship"" is a great turn-based, simple, and incredibly entertaining game that doesn't make sense as a film. A few references to the game, like the sailor calling out ""B5!"" or something like that when fighting the alien ship, and the alliance between the Japanese and American sailors, who were at odds in the game, provides some interesting laughs or smiles.Beyond that, this movie is terrible. A horrible beginning introduces our lazy and irresponsible drunkard of a protagonist that lives with his brother the Naval Officer. Suddenly, our protagonist, not worthy of a memorable name, is in the Navy. He is also dating the daughter of an Admiral, shockingly played by Liam Neeson of all people, and he is trying to work up the courage to ask the Admiral for his daughter's hand in marriage. Aliens attack, absurd situations that allow our protagonists to live occur, and lame subplots ensue. Oh! I can't believe I forgot to mention Rihanna plays a forgettable role as some person in the navy that serves no purpose but to get teenage girls to watch the movie.",Battleship
411,professorharoldlloydhill,"Ridiculous on every level, excruciatingly awful",4,27 November 2012,"On principle, a film based on a board game shouldn't be good anyway (it's flimsy source material), and ""Battleship"" is not a good movie at all. It has possibly some of the dumbest lines ever uttered on screen and while visually, it has some cool moments, overall it is a film that is ridiculous on every level. From the opening sequence when our under developed (and don't worry they all are underdeveloped) protagonist, played by Taylor Kitsch, crashes through the ceiling of a convenience store to retrieve a chicken burrito for a pretty blonde love interest he met in a bar, my expectation for the film dropped completely. I turned to my dad and said ""This is bad"". The plot line is so thin and the lines are even thinner. The film seems to concentrate so much on the action and the story falls by the wayside, and while the action is good, it doesn't make up for a lousy story. As it goes on, It gets more and more ridiculous, and the funny thing is, it is a film that doesn't even seem to know it's being excruciatingly awful. It takes itself completely seriously. It is an expensive movie, but with all the money put into the action sequences, you think they'd have been able to afford a better script! The acting in the film is okay, but considering the script they all come off looking fairly stupid. The story elements all too quickly fall into cliché, including a scene where our chicken burrito girl gets stuck in a jeep as her paraplegic therapy charge, with artificial legs fights one of the aliens. At this point I turned to my dad and said ""That's so hokey!"". And oh yeah, Rihanna is in this movie, and she gets the only clever moment in the film, where she, Kitsch, and another character are in a boat going towards the Alien mass in the water and Rihanna is humming ""Sentimental Journey"". That was the only real laugh in the 2 hr time spent watching the film, during which, in the middle half I went upstairs to use the bathroom and when I came back down, I didn't feel like I had missed anything! I told my dad to just let the film keeping playing, I wasn't going to be that beat up about missing anything. Thank goodness we got it as a free Redbox rental.",Battleship
412,devilsadvocatered6,Bland,4,4 June 2014,"IMDb, one of these days you and I are going to have some serious words about what you recommend to me.What can I say about this that hasn't already been said? The production values are fair, but the movie utterly fails to make me care about the people involved in the 'plot'. In fact, was there any particular reason the aliens came to Earth to begin with? You're in deep trouble when Plan 9 From Outer Space addresses this better than your movie. Is this meant to be a comedy? The opening sequence with the plot being kicked off by the theft of a chicken burrito from a gas station. How convenient that the generic romantic interest, the target of such misplaced affection, is the daughter of Liam Neeson's character. That just happens to be the protagonists' commanding officer in the US Navy later on in the movie. Contrived conflict that ultimately goes nowhere is the best kind of conflict, IMDb.Eventually aliens show up or something. I'll be honest, by this point in the movie I was extremely drunk. I remember having 3 double shots of the 4 Horsemen (Jack Daniels, Johnnie Walker, Jameson and Jim Beam) and not much else. Somehow I woke up in my car in my underwear 10 miles away from my place after that...then I went back inside and found out I still had an hour left of the movie to watch.

414,Comic_Central,"A good, fun movie!",7,19 January 2018,"As this game is based of the world wide popular board game Battleship when I first watched this movie I was expecting it to be more strategy based. While I may not have gotten what I expected from the movie I was pleased with what I watched.The plot is decent. Nothing for the writers to brag about or for anyone to rave about but it sure was decent. There were times when the writing seemed a little predictable and cliched but this moments come and gone quite quickly. All the scenes together connected well and progressed the story in some way. The introduction of the main character played by Taylor Kitsch seemed a bit rushed and didn't fit perfectly into how the rest of the movie played out. How it connected the land and sea and Alex Hopper (Taylor Kitsch) and his fiancé Samantha Shane (Brooklyn Decker) seemed fleshed out and well developed. Some characters had short un-needed story that the run time could have been used for other characters but the development for the characters was fairly good not great for most to all of the characters.The special effects and CGI in the movie are some of the best visuals from a movie that is not from one or two years ago. The CGI holds up today and I believe that it will for many years to come. If you want to see good CGI and CGI used well defiantly see this movie!The acting ability from the cast was well done with good portrayals from Taylor Kitsch and Alexander Skarsgard (Stone Hopper). The acting from the supporting characters was off sometimes which mostly came from the crew on board the ship. Good acting from supporting characters came from Liam Neeson (Admiral Shane) and suprisenly from Rihanna (Cora ""Weps"" Raikes). I was very surprised at Rihanna's acting and assumed it was going to be terrible but it was actually quiet good which made the movie that but more believable. Because of the acting from the cast it seemed that this scenario was believable real how humans would re-act.The only part in the movie that had anything to do with the game which depicted two sides of humans fighting against each other compared to the movies aliens was the scene I like to call ""Board Game Battleship"". This scene had the crew guessing where the aliens were and launching missiles and torpedoes at them. This seen has you on the edge of your seat everytime you watch it and the lightning and music just add to the dramatic feel of the scene.In conclusion this movie was decent. It did have a fair few flaws in it to do with the writing but the otherall movie was fun to watch and enjoyable. A sequel for this movie seems unlikely though and it will work better as a solo movie and not a franchise of sorts. Other all O rate it 7/10.",Battleship

At no point did I believe that our Navy technology and pure bravado would be capable of outperforming superior alien technology, without major plot adjustments of course.If you are 12 years old this might appeal, but otherwise leave it on the shelf.The concept was bad and execution even worse.

Transformers 3 hat 195 mil budget and this had 209. What did those people do with the money?Coming back to the plot you will see huge holes and as the movie advances you'll start thinking that this is a comedy show. Let's not forget that aliens came to Earth with an incredible machine, traveling hundreds, probably thousands of light ears and in the end we beat them with plain all gun powder. It's like the polish fighting German tanks with cavalry in the WWII. Acting? What is that? Nobody knows cause you don't get that in this movie. How do you become a Lt. Cdr. in such a short time? Even in Mongolia it's not possible and believe me not many people know where that country is. I'll end saying that it a complete waste of your time seeing this movie but still, if you want to get angry and don't know how it's a good therapy. The worst thing is that the hole concept, you know: scientist searching for a planet in the ""Goldilocks zone""( or habitable zone ), finding it, establish some kind of contact, preparing for a visit, preparing for a journey, finally answering the big question, we are not alone, ends up in a complete failure.",Battleship

Its usually a disappointment on those rare instances when I do. However, this movie has a couple tings going for it. One is that I saw it for free.The other is that I went in expecting to walk out feeling I had wasted my time. I mean, the vast majority of movies with a music star's debut have sucked. Probably because adding a hot music star gives you cover for a bad movie? I don't know. Add in a movie based on a very old board game? Well, then you have me going into it expecting total suckitude. Well, its certainly not a great movie by any suspension of expectations, however its not pure suck. Truth is my surprise that it didn't suck is probably driving the score I gave it, but I enjoyed this film.No, there was nothing we haven't seen before, and many times. No, the acting wasn't a stand out in any way, though a script with mostly yelling doesn't give much room for quality acting. No the effects weren't outstanding. There was no real story in this movie, it really is a kind of expanded story of the board game.If that sounds like suckitude, well, it should. However, this movie was a fun ride for me. The battle scenes and effects, while not outstanding were good in that generic way. The cheese factor was high, but it didn't have me running for the exit. I don't know what happened, but I do believe that walking in with extremely low expectations can make this film an enjoyable mindless experience. Anyway, it did for me what can I say?",Battleship

I watched all kinds of alien movie, from K-PAX to War of the worlds. K-PAX it's a drama movie, with intelligent story no battle and really well done. How ever as the name says BattleShip isn't a intelligent movie with a well written drama, it's movie with action and battles.I enjoyed of how the aliens were not over powered with ultimate lasers and indestructible ships. I don't get why people want aliens to be always over power, this were the spies, they aren't strong, they are there just to watch the world and send the signal, as the guy from the movie says ""If 4 can do this bad, imagine 500 000"" of course they were only there to send a signal not to kill or destroy everyone. In this movie we don't see their army we see a bunch of workers doing their job and that's it.There are a few things I didn't like in the movie for example the fact they can't handle sunlight. They were in a planet similar to our and they can't see the light? They are vampire aliens lol.

Any sci-fi fan would like this movie. The movie may not be the best movie in existence but it gets a solid grade and holds your attention if you can get past a few of the ""unrealistic"" parts. One must remember this is a movie and not real-life. Those expecting real-life should go outside and live it. Not bash on a movie because of a few scenes being a bit over-the-top which every movie in existence has. The few scenes that have flaws are not noticeable unless paying close attention. Unfortunately this will be one of those great movies that passes by without much notice in the U.S. because of it's untimely release date during two other big-ticket movies and a nice labor day weekend that everyone spent at the lake instead of indoors.

The storytelling is quite solid, there is a decent introduction to the characters and you feel sympathy towards them immediately. The star-studded cast at first threw me, seeing names like Rihanna, Brooklyn Decker and Taylor Kitsch. But seeing Liam Neeson is already half a victory as he makes any movie worth watching. And I have to mention that Rihanna, despite her lack of acting experience manages to give a solid performance. Her bad-ass attitude makes her character highly likable. Taylor Kitsch pulls of his Maverick-like character with not much depth, but all-in-all he fits into the military setting. As it was directed by Peter Berg I was hoping a little less clichés, but I guess when one is attached to a 200 million dollar budget, he has the obligation to make the movie appealable to as wide a demographic as possible. For that big of a budget you really get your moneys worth. The movie delivers on many aspects. The visuals are great (Hasbro has done it again). The sets and sceneries are great. I really liked the length of the movie. As I was getting ready for a quite regular ending, I was blown away by a great motivational scene which led to a cool ending. Yes, the movie has quite a few plot holes and unrealistic scenes, but you manage to look past them as there are several high-octane action sequences. The soundtrack worked really great.

Enough to annoy anyone. So off you set with 5 space craft armed only with mortar rounds, soldiers armed with tin openers and a special kind of glass covering the bridge of your ship that can remain structurally intact during deep space flight and atmospheric entry but is useless against the power of the bullets of a barrett 50 cal sniper rifle fired from the front end of a ship.Anyway, en-route to said planet your only form of communication, a communications ship (who would have thought of putting some form of ET phone home mobile phone system on each one?!) is taken out, ironically by a satellite. Now, at this point you would have thought that seeing as you have gone to hassle of developing deep space flight and some form of advanced analytical radar system to work out where this mystical laser beam has come from and that it is in fact a deep space communications array...you would wack on the space brakes, about face and fly on over to it and send a signal to send in the rest of the fleet to destroy and plunder.

There are of course serious scenes but also a good amount of comic relief to allow a break now and then. John Carter stars (uh, Taylor Kitsch of J.C, Gambit from Wolverine) along with Eric Northman of True Blood fame (Alexander Skarsgård) also Rihanna (yes, she can act, although the hick tough accent was a lil put on) and Liam Neeson.OK, so we all most likely guessed by now. Aliens appear in the water, during naval exercises.. and a little game of Battleship then ensues (who'd have guessed) There is also a side story occurring meanwhile on the Hawaiian island of Oahu (it was great to see the rolling green hills of Jurassic Park once again!) The aliens look a lot like Spartans from the HALO game series (perhaps left overs from the movie itself, which was axed... and became District 9) You will also find a little Acca Dacca (AC-DC) music pumping away in the feel good moments, along with a good glimpse of the Aussie flag approaching the end of the film!

Similarly, pouring marinara sauce on it is tasty, but mindless. Sometimes I even throw on a meatball or two for a little extra pizazz, but still spaghetti is spaghetti.And so it goes for this movie. The plot is as standard as any aliens- invading-earth movie plot. Aliens so intelligent they travel with gigantic ships through light years and light years of space, but the earthlings through sheer will put up a fight to make the foreigners think twice about continuing to pursue this planet. Yeah. That along with many other aspects of this film fall apart under any real scrutiny. The action happens as anticipated with gigantic CGI ships, tsunami sized explosions and unbelievable narrow escapes.If the plot is the spaghetti, the performances are the sauce (or the gravy, as my Long Island friends call it) and this is Prego plopped out of the jar. The characters shoot their guns, shout their orders, and convey the appropriate emotion for the scenes, just as Prego coats the spaghetti and gives a satisfying, but not stunning flavor to the mix. Liam Neeson plays the hard nosed Navy man with a soft spot for his daughter. Taylor Kitsch is the good looking lead so marvelous that the Navy will bend the rules for him. Rihanna portrays the tough petty officer out to prove a woman can do it. too, and so on and so on. The meatballs to this spaghetti is Brooklyn Decker. While I expected more of a stale model-turned-actress performance, here she is not Oscar worthy, but does prove herself as more than just another side dish. She is added to the mix to look good; what she delivers is a surprisingly pleasing combination of beauty and conviction, although the looks might still be the better of the two.So, there you go.

First of all, they seemed to be not attacking until fired upon first, but also they provoked the military. Than, why on Earth would they want to 'call home' ? That just sounded plain stupid. If you are a so advances civilization that you have FTL interstellar travel technology... wouldn't you have the tech to 'call home' before landing and not crushing your ship into the planet?

I can't think of many.The aliens looked cool and their weapons were extraordinary but something I can actually see humans developing eventually.I was wondering if 'Battleship' could even incorporate anything from the board game of the same name and to my surprise, the director pulled it off. It was probably my favorite scene in the picture.Simply put, if you want to have fun for 2 hours, go see Battleship. If you want to be bored for 2 hours, go watch Oscar nominated films where all they do is talk and curse (and sometimes stutter).",Battleship
437,gonzoville,"What ""Battle LA"" could have been.",7,1 June 2012,"OK, first of all, yes, this movie has more holes than the surface of the moon. Some of the plot points, tactics, technical gaffes, etc. etc. etc. are so bad and stupid as the be insulting. Seriously, if you are up on your military technology at all it's best to go to this movie seriously drunk so that you won't care about the dumbness.That said, it's actually a pretty fun movie. And, yes, I think it's better than Battle Los Angeles or even the latest Transformers. Why? Because this movie didn't make the same critical mistakes of trying to have Acting in the damn film. Nothing slows down a good action flick like a damn love story in the background, or the hero dealing with his feelings or, worse still, putting brats in the line of fire. Battleship had none of that - just a bunch of thick-headed do- gooders doing what they do best and not really learning a whole lot about anything, including themselves, in the process. Another thing I like is that there is an appreciation for the warships and the people who serve on them. The timing of the ACDC music for the going-into-battle scene is perfectly done. You can't help but smile.The alien technology is actually pretty imaginative and the animation is good. It's not as over- the-top as Battle LA - where there was so much going on you get overwhelmed. But when the aliens want something blowed up, they do so with conviction. Mind you, some of the technical deficiencies of the alien technology will leave you wondering how these creatures managed to cross a galaxy. But try not to worry about that - the writers sure didn't.The cast is OK. Neeson is decent as the admiral or whatever, and even Rihanna does an acceptable job. We're not talking about ""Apocalypse Now"" kinds of performances, but it wasn't horrible either. It was at least semi-believable.Look, this ain't no ""Bedford Incident"". But it's a pretty decent way to kill a couple hours and snarf down some popcorn. All the folks griping about the technical problems - well, it's all true - but who cares? This movie doesn't pretend to be realistic. Hell, in the credits it's ""Based on the game by Hasbro,"" so go in prepared and enjoy.",Battleship

I saw this movie for free and enjoyed it. I seen the movie a number of times on cable and still enjoyed it. Sure, Taylor Kitsch is an annoying character in this movie and his unlikeableness from other movies such as John Carter seemed to have carried over to this movie but as set up by the screenplay, Taylor's character was suppose to be unlikeable at first so that as the confrontation with the aliens continued, he was supposed to have grown into a better ""Navy Commander"" character.Sure, the aliens were poorly set up . They have to be the most polite alien invaders in movie history, in that, they only react to actual military threats against them before responding in kind. The initial first contact between the aliens and the Naval task force is bizarre with the most of the Naval Commanders reacting without common sense when the first attack begins. Taylor Ktitsch's character being warned twice not to touch the Alien ship which he disregards and touches the ship. Taylor's Naval Commanders actually stepping outslde the ship's commander center during the first attack and then being killed thus making Taylor's character in command of the ship when he gets back to it. I could go on and on about the negative aspects of the movie but there are still enjoyable aspects to the movie as well. First is the Navy ships themselves; the destroyers and , of course, the Battlship Missouri. Gregory Gadson is a wounded warrior who plays a bitter double amputee veteran.He may not have a lot of acting skills but he brings gravitas to his role and I give Director Peter Berg much props for including him in the movie.For the most part, I even enjoyed Brooklyn Decker and Rihanna's roles in the movie as well.",Battleship

If you are the kind of person who watches a western movie and gripes because the hero fired 50 shots out of his 6 shooter...what can I say. Go rent a National Geographic movie or something.

It's nothing but a dumb down action movie which only main focus is to arouse the public with it's battle scenes and graphical contents. Does the directors this day take us public viewers as fools who will be arouse by just some graphical battle scenes? From the looks of this show, this director seems to be mocking us viewers this way. It's damn insulting how this director think he could gain public viewers support with such cheap entertainment.

Just don't think too much and go with it and you'll have a blast.I like naval movies and usually they are slow paced and very tense. Don't expect that here.

449,wolfybiscuts,Great effects typical alien invasion glory-boy navy film.,7,20 April 2012,"Let me start off by saying, I never served in the navy and have no idea how weapon systems or ballistics on modern warships work so I can't tell if the movie is aiming for realism or just eye candy special effects.This movie does have great special effects and the battle scenes were exciting to watch, especially towards the end.The movie takes the typical invasion film and puts a twist on it that left me scratching my head. I really couldn't tell if the aliens were hostile or friendly since the film shows them sparing civilians on one hand and on the other hand they blow up a highway full of traffic so no one can access towers on a mountain. They also murder some local country cops. Then again they spare a nerd scientist collecting his suitcase at their makeshift base. Huh??? There is a subplot that involves a amputee ex-soldier and the heroes girlfriend that is chucked in there. it's your typical Hollywood flare, with some lame comedy thrown in that stop this movie from becoming a possible classic. I mean really punch an aliens teeth out in SLO - MO? silly at best. This movie is somewhat similar to Battle LA as the aliens start the fight on water, but BATTLE LA is a lot better in my opinion.The homage they paid to the battleship missourri was a nice twist and the old vets was nice. Not a movie to take too seriously even if you are an action special effect junkie. Leave your brain at the door and you will enjoy the movie like I did.Oh yeah Rhianna was not bad in her first movie role. The tough military chick role doesn't require an Oscar winning performance. She did quite well.",Battleship

Rihanna Really is a mid level character who Really takes over the screen when she is on it. The plot has a few small holes but nothing you can't overlook. This is a cheesy over the top hero movie.

Many good ones and they all have cowboys and baddies in common, same with horror movies, action movies, romantic movies, musicals, the list goes on.Battleship had exactly what I want to see in an action movie to warrant me spending the money to see it at the flicker show.

The special effects were very good, the storyline was enjoyable and did I mention, IT HAD A BATTLESHIP !

If I was to make one critical comment about this movie its that I would have loved to see more of Liam Neeson on the screen, I enjoy his acting and his movies and I feel it should have been used more in this flick.In summary if you like action, want to get your moneys worth at the flicker show , and if you want to see in action A BATTLESHIP !

The film hearkens to a modern day Top Gun with a hint of irony considering it's the navy instead of the air force.But before you know it the movie takes a wild turn, for the better, and aliens attack.

The alien creatures look so C-G, even computers games are doing a better job and these aliens have no character to them.The alien transformer-crafts are cool and these ball shredders sequences are well doneActing and punchlines are terrible and cheesy throughout the movie. The lead actor was portrayed a complete loser who breaks into a gas station to impress a girl and was about to be terminated from the navy but somehow turns out to be the hero who saves the world.They hired Liam Neeson for the trailer I guess because that's his total part.Rihanna was fine.Its that volatile kind of movie, you watch..you forget.Don't expect anything like transformers because its not.As I said earlier naval warfare is the only enjoyable part because that has never been shown before on such large scale.

How did he go from sitting on a couch, to be a commanding officer in like 10 sec.2. How did radio transmissions go from being invisible radio waves to visible beams of light, that's not how it works in the real world.3. If you're a civilization advanced enough to travel 100.000 light years, or more. Wouldn't it be logical to assume that their weapon advancements would have gone beyond grenade launchers ? Not counting the spinning thingies which it seemed they did not have a large supply of. If you noticed their generators, looked like they produced huge amounts of energy. Not a lot of adjustments and they've had rail guns.4. Sniping thought the glass windows, well the idea is not bad, but. That ship went through the atmosphere, pretty fast as well, any regular glass windows would've melted in the temperatures. The windows would have had to be a lot stronger when you go headfirst into our atmosphere.Well, the movie was entertaining, i thought so, but i also think it's not cinema worthy, it's more of a rental. It's not like that i don't love sci-fi, i do, but it's like they dumbed it down, because if their ships weren't designed as they were, conveniently with massive flaws, the navy wouldn't have stood a chance.

460,zarg78,A Good Watch,7,16 April 2012,"Battleship is a pleasing watch and was definitely worth the trip to the cinema. The use of the ocean as the primary setting for the movie is delightfully refreshing in amongst the more traditional sci-fi settings of alien planets, remote parts of the globe, alternate dimensions/timelines, dystopic/utopic futures, and over-run laboratories. The story itself is reasonably straightforward and predicable; however, not having to think through a convoluted plot with numerous twists and turns gives one an excellent chance to simply sit back and enjoy some excellent visuals effects. In some respects, this movie could be likened to Transformers -- machines attempting to beat each other up (in this case, alien spacecraft vs earth battleships) -- and Independence Day -- technologically inferior humans battle technologically superior aliens; however, the movie isn't aiming to be anything new or original and similarities with elements of other movies are to be expected. The movie is a decent running time and well-paced -- you never get bored or find yourself wondering when the movie will end. The love story is kept to a pleasing minimum and the character development, or maybe lack of, isn't an issue either -- this movie is about the visuals, not the characters. All in all, the movie is good for its simplicity, excellent visuals, and the chance to just kick back and enjoy something that doesn't require any thought but still entertains.",Battleship

The films script is the beginning of the flaws. It is riddled with tacky one liners which seem to aspire to be in the vein of Predator or another Schwarzenegger film. The script contains many clichés as well, the ending in particular is very predictable. The characters are very 2 dimensional as well and the film contains next to no character development or obvious character traits. The actors are all pretty wooden in their performances, however this may be due to the weak characters which they are portraying. Even the usually good Neeson is average in his supporting role. Kirtsch's character is the stereotypical ""trouble maker turned serious"" man which we see in so many modern movies. Rihanna and the rest of the supporting cast are not believable at all. Berg, who has been at the helm of other films including Hancock and The Kingdom, should know what he is doing, but in scenes other than the over done actions scenes, he finds it hard to reach a compromise between overdoing the filming and basic cuts. The film is a stereotypical blockbuster and for those who enjoy this brand of trashy actions with flamboyant special effects, it will not disappoint.

We never got a really good look at them except in one scene. But that's just personal preference for me. I prefer to see them. Being a Navy brat, I loved the idea of the Naval ships and watching them in action and in saying this, a bit more action would have been great.

It's a character put in a position where he is in charge and doesn't want to be, but still rises to the task. Regardless of what people think representations of ""intelligent life"" from other planets may be, this movie represents one take on it.The acting was decent/good, there were characters I liked and cared about, and it paid somewhat of an homage to those who served in the military in years past.

This movie IS Transformers, in fact you could rename it to Transformers 4 and no one would notice the difference. But at the same time it's at least ten times worse than Transformers. When the first Transformers movie came out, as ridiculous as it was, it was something new and fresh and fun. But if like me you hated Transformers 2 and 3, Battleship will scar you for life.

I can think of only one excuse for this movie and it's that if it's made for 5 year old kids, and here's why:CHARACTERS: Five minutes in and you're told that the main character is in fact an idiot. The next moment he's the captain of a battleship. (Every kid's fantasy.) His entire crew is apparently no brighter than him, because they follow every idiotic order he gives. Not much to say here really, none of the characters have any depth and pretty much all of them are walking stereotype definitions. The biggest miscast in this film is, of course, Rihanna. Every time she popped up on the screen I couldn't help but think ""What the f*** is this tiny girl doing on a battleship? And why is she the only female member of the crew?"".DIALOG: Calling it childish would be a compliment. I usually laugh at bad dialog, but here after a few laughs I wanted to cry. That's how bad it was.ACTING: Average to below average - fits the movie really.MUSIC: The soundtrack is one of the main aspects of this movie that I had a big problem with. After the battle starts the music becomes intense and it stays that way up until the very end, which is like the entire second half of the movie. I don't know about the others, but that exhausted the crap out of me. Not appreciated.SPECIAL EFFECTS: You've seen it all in Transformers, except here they are 10 more in volume and that much more exhausting. After a few battle scenes the effects become old really fast.PLOT: Laughable. 5 year old children or younger might like it, but not me. As open minded as I am, I have to say that never before while watching a science fiction action movie have I asked myself ""What the f*** is happening?"" or ""How is that even possible?"". Like I said the second half of the movie is non-stop action with close-ups and over the top fast motion VFX sequences.Summary: Horrible. Do not waste your time and money on this. Don't even go see it for free. Not even if they pay you. It's not mindless fun like some say. Mindless sure, but fun... if you're a masochist then maybe. The current rating of 6.4 stars that this movie has here on IMDb is beyond me. Don't believe the good reviews, you can not check your brain at the door and enjoy it, it's impossible.",Battleship
473,darkbloo,Surprisingly...I really enjoyed this,6,25 August 2012,"First, this film is absolutely ridiculous: 1. How does Taylor's character even get into Navy officer training, let alone graduate!!? 2. Why is a museum battleship serviceable, carrying live ammunition, and able to perform hand-brake turns!!? 3. How are aliens this dumb able to develop such advanced technology and weaponry!!? 4. How come no one noticed the alien craft 'sneaking' up on earth!!? 5. How are the film makers able to fit all those clichés and corn into one movie!!?However...it delivered everything I want from a brainless, entertaining, pop-corn movie. Yeah it's stupid, but stop thinking about it and enjoy!!",Battleship
474,rogueleader_93,Cool ships!,8,6 October 2012,"So, here is the story. Taylor Kitsch is a down-on-his luck guy who lives with his brother, Alexander Skarsgard. After his brother gets him a job on the US Navy, Taylor falls in love with Brooklyn Decker, the daughter of his superior officer, Liam Neeson. Oh, and Rihanna is also part of the Navy. Yes, that Rihanna.Seems easy enough, right? Nope. An alien force descends upon Earth and begins attacking humanity's major cities from the ocean. Now, our heroes must use their naval firepower to defeat the aliens and save Earth.The premise seems a bit cliché, but sometimes cliché is good. This is not some typical action movie with lots of explosions. In this case, there is characterization for the characters and the challenges they must beat. It's filled with slight comedy, of course, but that doesn't stop the action.Taylor was good, and so was Alexander. Brooklyn was a reasonably good point for the movie. And believe it or not, Rihanna was a strong point, an excellent start for her acting career. The girls are here for more than just gratuitous fan-service, you know. And I admit that while Liam Neeson is a big star and one of my favorite actors, he didn't wasn't a major presence of the movie. Then again, the other actors need their chance to shine, so that's understandable.My only complain is that while the humor is good, sometimes it's awkward and it can give you a surprised expression of ""Hey, what was the point of all that?""But in any case, this movie is great. I definitely recommend it.",Battleship
475,tareknabulsi,People need to learn to appreciate cinema,10,21 May 2012,"I think a lot of people expected another District 9 type of alien movie when watching this film. The story line was very simple but worked very well. Humans send a transmission to a planet similar to earth, and soon after, the creatures of that planet trace the signal and attack. This has been done before, most memorably a year ago in Battle LA. So if you are looking for a film with deep meaning and philosophy that will immerse you into a new world of aliens and human heroes, then you are going to be disappointed.Despite these weaknesses, the movie is still fantastic. The movie starts and ends with good comedy and builds its way up. The entire middle portion of this film is saturated with very nice action and amazing cinematic effects. The alien bodies and ships are designed quite interestingly as they are similar to humans. This movie was made to simply watch and have a good time. Don't expect to take it too seriously as there are some cheesy lines and gestures. From my point of view, I am pretty sure the director intended these things for the sake of humor. A horrible film that also fits this description however is Transformers 2. But believe me, Transformers 2 was a different kind of cheesiness. Overall this movie does a very good job of displaying America's naval war-machine while avoiding politics completely as the fight is simply between humans and aliens. This is why I thought the movie was good. Although the plot line is cliché and does not immerse you in the characters, its battle scenes and special effects are definitely top in cinematic history and can keep you smiling all the way through. The movie's score is very misleading and I actually went in the theater expecting something bad. So despite any attitude you may have, I can promise you will have a good time while watching this movie!",Battleship
476,christophermurray52,Not that great,4,15 June 2012,"I gave this a 4 out of 10 because looking at Brooklyn Decker is a plus..Other than that, the movie is pretty stupid.Okay, Aliens that can't handle the sun, yup makes a lot of sense.. These Aliens have the most incredible technology man has ever seen, but they can't handle the sun and the Human use that against them. So stupid.Being able to drop an anchor off a Navy Battle ship and have it stop on a dime, and turn like a skateboard is quite realistic.. Using Liam Neeson for a grand total of about 15 minutes of screen time in a 2.5 hour movie, brilliant..Lots of stuff gets blown up, Brooklyn Decker is smoking hot, other than that, bad.. Acting is atrocious and they use the usual cliché lines all Alien movies do.. ""Lets see if we can give earth another day"".. ""I got this"".. The jokes they attempt to use, well, no one laughed, I laughed more at the movie than the humor they tried to inject.Bad..",Battleship
477,csmottram,Battleship..something,3,20 April 2012,"I went watching this film with the hope it would be similar to the first Transformers Film (big budget/ same company). However, halfway through the film I was looking at my watch with boredom. Anyway, I'll start from what I remember... EXTREME SPOILERS ""Guy steals food for girl, gets arrested, coerced into joining the navy by brother (who is in the navy too), continues to fail as an officer but shows potential?, Girlfriends Dad is the senior officer for the international fleet, Guy is warned that he has no future in the navy but allowed to remain in the fleet, Fleet gets separated by force field, Guy becomes most senior officer after the first attack by Aliens, Chaos ensues"". I didn't have a problem with the premise for the story about bad Aliens. However I did take an exception with the fact that an (assumingly) intelligent space-faring race should have better ways of defending themselves. Also, from a scene involving a telepathic flashback, the alien shows Taylor Kitsch a scene of destruction from the aliens past. This scene has obviously been included to insinuate that the aliens are aggressive and violent. However, I found the aliens to be incredibly tame and lame throughout this film. Firstly, the ships they used made absolutely no sense. It was like the film crew had a brain-storming session and someone said ""wouldn't it be cool if they swam like dolphins...you know, in and out of the water"" Really? I can just imagine the aliens overdosing on travel motion medicine to stop them filling their helmets up with puke. Can you imagine being on their ships when they surface and dive? Also the fact that the Aliens themselves used Ballistic weapons i.e. Mortar Grenades only, with a very limited firing arch was pretty weak. How effective are these against airborne targets? It was like the Aliens only had a single means to protect themselves (I'll talk about the gyro-cycles later). I'd also expect a ship that can hover to have some way of shooting targets that get under the guns (the dingy scene in the film is daft). The alien's priority on arriving at Earth was to transmit a message back home, but their communications ship was destroyed on re-entry. The most important piece of their equipment, the communication ship, the thing they needed to start the invasion of Earth was also unbelievably fragile (its hits an earth satellite and has a catastrophic failure). It makes no sense; one would assume that on their journey to Earth the Aliens would have had to navigate through Asteroid Belts, Comets, Planets, Stars, and Radiation etc. So to be undone by a piece of primitive Earth tech is lazy writing. As I said before, their mission seems to have been to scout ahead and signal their Alien friends at home to start the invasion. At every opportunity whilst walking around though, the Aliens seemed reluctant to kill their aggressors. I felt like I was watching a weak version of the Borg (not the Swedish singer, the Star Trek Baddie). Like the Borg the Aliens seemed to be oblivious to all the humans' attempts to stop them. Surely, having travelled through space/galaxies/the universe they would have thought it worthwhile to destroy any and all opposition in the force field dome they created. At least the aliens in Independence Day were suitably menacing, with their tentacles and large cranial heads. What we end up with here are humanoids with goaty beards, I kid you not (who won't kill you even though you're probably going to interfere with their mission). As commented by other people, they do look similar to the Master Chief character from Halo. I didn't mind the design of their armour but without the helmet they looked crap and too human like. The Aliens also used Gyro-cycles as weapons to basically slice through things - Including important strategic targets such as a kid's baseball pitch and a highway bridge with civilians on, before finally finding the military base. I can understand destroying the lines of communication includes transport links but the whole highway scene was rather pointless....unless to showcase some more pointless CGI. (Footnote: Should we ever get invaded by Aliens, I really hope it's these guys). They also let the irritating nerdy scientist weakling guy get away with some tech that could stop them... at least the aliens were consistently stupid throughout the film. Red Target Bad (slap, push around) - Green Good (ignore)... OK, enough about the Aliens, now the humans. Taylor Kitschs character was a bit of a jerk and should never have been allowed to remain in the navy. Even after all the training he was still unable to behave and was made an officer for some reason. I couldn't really root for him. I was actually happy to see that tall bloke from True Blood get a part (Alexander Skarsgård) he's the best thing in this film but was underused. Rihanna was the stereotypical cool ghetto girl, who says interesting lines like ""Yes Sir"", and ""Tonight I'ma let you be the captain"". There were other people in the film including Liam Neeson but these were pretty forgettable and cheesy. Taylor Kitschs's girlfriend in the film was nothing more than eye candy with a daft subplot about him proposing to her. I kind of drifted off in the middle of the film...until A group of Octarian Sailors decided to steal the Missouri!!! I really hate it when they do this in American films. I have nothing against commemorating old people who served their country, but not like this. There is a scene in the film were ""they"" just appear, spread out (or wheeled on and propped up) all over the bow/the deck/on the radar (I kid you not), then they are whizzing around the ship doing sailor stuff even though they have a combined age of 900 years or something.I'm done with this review; Prometheus (Ridley Scott) can't get here soon enough!!!",Battleship
478,MantisTobagan,6.1 They made that many IMDb accounts?,1,7 August 2012,"Oh oh oh. I don't know where to start, well i guess i could start with saying that after watching this movie i had to make an IMDb account to contribute in warning people, of not seeing this film.Before it, i had low expectations. Somewhat i had good special effects, cheesy and common story as what i expected. But to be honest the special effects aren't even that good in modern time measure and the story wasn't even Cheesy, just plain horrible.I could probably write a review about what i thought was bad, longer then the script itself. Liam Neeson is loved by many (i like him myself) and understand that he got a lot of money for a minor role, i mean who wouldn't do it? His acting is as always good. When i watched John Carter i thought Kitsch did a good job but in this movie, he is really bad, simply cause his character is retarded. Except from that, pretty much every actor was plain horrible.Every Cliché you can think of is in this movie, Rihanna saying ""boom"" every time she fires a weapon gets abit annoying.A few things that really disturbed me (BIG SPOILER ALERT), its gonna be a lot but i think its funny when you read them: An Alien throws Rihanna into a ""wall"" hard, the little girl gets up almost immediately with her hat on 100% perfectly. Stuff like that really annoys me.When the Aliens are about to arrive, for some reason the secretary of defense and the man in charge of contacting the Aliens are both talking through webcam with an employee of the man in charge of contacting the Aliens, why are they talking to him? is he some kind of expert and they seek advice from this man? No they don't, the people in charge of USA's security just talks to him in a critical time for no apparent reason.There are 2 very badly animated Horses high up on a mountain on Hawaii. Now i haven't been to Hawaii but when they need to animate 2 horses (and very poorly done) it clearly aren't horses around in reality.The Blonde Girlfriend (cant be bothered to learn her name, awful actress) gets a hold on a radio from a police car up on the mountain and only manages to contact her Boyfriends (Kitsch) boat out on the water, i mean WTF!? At the start of the movie, the leading scientist at NASA present the founding of the ALien planet they later contacts, describing it as ""Its not to close to the sun (to hot) or to far away from the sun (to cold) it is in perfect range (like earth) to sustain life"" and then it turns out that the Aliens gets REALLY REALLY disoriented by direct sunlight, i mean how could they even evolve as a species if they cant see when the sun is shining? At one point the Aliens shoots their bombs and destroys 2 big military boats, they do this easily and feel very superior. Then they don't do that for the rest of the movie, there are a few things the humans do but they can fire about 100 of those bombs, but fire only 3. Also for no apparent reason.This list could go on forever but you can find more in other reviews. Talking of other reviews, i see some (probably fake ones) claiming the movie to be funny. If you find ANY scene funny in this movie, i will lose some hope for humanity. There's is a scene at the start where they take the famous youtube video of the guy robbing a liquor store (falling through the roof etc) and pretty much copying it, but yet its not funny.1/10 And I'm considering emailing IMDb and ask to be able to rate 0 in the future, cause they still earned money on this movie and this is deffently where future movies are heading, sadly.",Battleship

The story is not new, but the execution and the movie means this story is conveying on the big screen is in Grand fashion. Lavish special effects, well balanced sound effects, AC/DC beat - right on target when needed. Brooklyn Decker pleases every man's eye, Taylor Kitsh is way more believable as a NAVY officer than ""John Carter"" on Mars, and Liam Neeson can do any role Hollywood gives him and be truthful to the character he plays.

480,cloach,Missing plot shots and silly science but not too bad,7,4 May 2015,This disaster movie has pulpy romance side plot but less than other movies of its genre. Its has ridiculous science. The worst is really that a directed signals from Earth would take probably decades to get to aliens as they'd have to be ten of light years away- further than Alpha Centuri. Also satellite probably can't redirect signals as precise beams and neither can land-based radio telescopes but can they send signals- that part is easy- honestly the aliens should have noticed our TV signals a long time before we deliberate tried to contact them. Intense radiation is usually indirectly viewable when passing through matter depending on the matter that it pass through. The missing part of this movie is the aliens. I think not showing the aliens as making a complete mess of coming to Earth- they smashed into several satellites. They had to do resource conservation and that they came to water- to save energy and as its spacecraft they are terrible in the atmosphere and worse on water so they are clumsy and bad at fighting the humans- they do a makeshift weapons and try not destroy everything. Also they actually here as science mission with a massive military complement which leads to big conflicts between those group- such that the scientists want to study the humans and the military have decided the humans are a threat to be stopped. That's why viewers had such different pictures of the aliens- they are not a coherent group. There are many hints such this is true such as the many scans of the humans and their equipment. The alien military does not have a coherent strategy- they don't how to fight humans. Good special effect and hinted plot elements makes this a good disaster movie.,Battleship

I can't even say its a Sci-Fi movie since it has too many logical dead ends. well. what positive thing can I say? allot! and I'll start with ""its just a fun action movie"".* this movie gets you engaged with the characters who go life changing events - like they should. I especially liked that there wasn't just one hero or unique character but a few of them shown and time fluidly. * this movie has tension ups and down with a few un-expected twist (sometimes a bit unlogical but try not to think about it too much) which make it a dynamic ride. * this movie has an old angle which isn't common in late films: naval warfare. since lately wars are fought with plans and booms its nice to have classic naval references.It will take me a day to write all the plot holes and un-logical issues. maybe the biggest issue people have is regarding the aliens - they are a simple a re-presentation of a ""life as we know it"" ending enemy that is unrelated to any man or nation that we know of - they are merely a concept with out any pretentious often done by sci-fi writers and producers. we don't know how aliens will look like and we don't know what they would do - so why bother thinking about it? they are not from this world, they are better then us & they have an agenda.Did I hope it was better though out? maybe just smarter? yes of course! that said, if you are not a sci-fi stuck-up who starts to question every aspect of the movie he sees, you will enjoy it. instead of fishing for the wrong try to enjoy the good - and there is plenty of it!if you feel like you ""wana watch this"" - go for it. 8/10",Battleship

I would walk out, if not because I love Sci-Fi in general. I was sitting there and think this is a de-service and an insult to American intelligence.The leading actor is good though. He is a serious actor. The aliens cannot be more stupid. BTW, why the heck are the blond woman and Rhianna there?

The most memorable part of the whole movie was a chicken burrito skit, and considering the alien invasion plot, that's pathetic. It also doesn't help that the whole time, the film seems to want to be ID4 with water, and it's defining point of badness is the most WTF solution to it's problem: use a 70-year old tourist trap ship to fight aliens who are clearly more advanced than us humans.

I would say that it's a mix of Transformers, ID4, Pearl Harbour and Star Trek (2009). This movie is a big cliché. It takes 20 minutes to make us understand that the main character is a James T. Kirk like rebel, in his quest to flirt with the hottest women in the bar makes a stupid move. He then enrol in the navy like Kirk did in Starfleet.

The level of pathetic exceeds all previous benchmarks, set by terrible screen writers. It is really that bad. There is no depth, there is no thrill, there is nothing remotely worth of watching in this movie. Rihanna's acting wasn't even the worst point of this failure, and she is really bad. Rihanna stick to the singing or what ever you do, stay away from acting, don't take the spot away from the actually talented people (which are somehow not present in this cast)... Liam Neeson, the only potential in this movie, got literally 5 minutes of time. There was some story potential to be explored but I guess drama is not attractive to the average American viewer. Popcorn don't go well if your brain has to do some actual processing. Ergo, you end up with trivialities, pathetic trivialities like Battleship.... So we send signals to Space, ""Hello Space, here we are, wanna some milk and cookies?"". And these aliens hear us and decide to crash the party. They are capable to cross vast interstellar distances, create force-fields and such, but still they get beaten by a soon to be decommissioned ship with geriatric ward.

495,AyeLewisTheReverified,Preposterous Rubbish! Utterly Annoying!,3,25 June 2012,"Took the daughter to see Avengers, but as she went shopping with her Mum for Mother's Day until well into the evening, we were running behind schedule and so turned up 15 minutes late to the planned session. We saw this instead.My 11 yr old loved it, but even she said it was ridiculous how the old veterans were there, on the Missouri, waiting for the ragtag bunch of retards to return to Pearl. I didn't argue, because I too almost vomited from the syrupy cheese being poured down my gullet.The aliens were retarded. Their technology was incredibly fragile and inadequate. They were like the keystone cops of alien invaders. Their design lacked imagination. The aliens were incredibly annoying. The plot was ludicrous and annoying. The Japanese/US alliance was clichéd and PC-annoying. The black guy with the cyborg legs was hackneyed and cheesy and annoying. The bimbo was annoying. The coward geek was annoying. The battle tactics were annoying. The homage to the board game on which this terrible film was based was immeasurably annoying. The protagonist was annoying. Hell, even Liam Neeson was annoying.The film, at no single stage, held my attention or conjured up any positive emotion in me whatsoever. I was entirely numb the entire time, except for a growing and all encompassing feeling of annoyance.I am befuddled and bemused how this stuff gets greenlit. In fact, I am entirely bewildered.I hope this fails and fails hard. Films that are bloated with CGI and stuffed with cardboard characters and brimming with corny clichés deserve to sink without a trace.NOT recommended3/10",Battleship
496,alex_i-0,2 funny scenes and that's it,2,12 August 2012,"It had 2 funny scenes. The chicken burrito at the beginning. And the nerdy scientist who thinks that the retired G.I is a cyborg :)I expected so much more from this movie, something nerve wrecking like ""Alien"" meets ""Das Boot"". But all I got was a bizarre mish-mash of ""V"", ""The War of The Worlds"", ""Transformers"" and ""Independence Day"". Not to mention Alexander Skarsgard who is an awful actor that tries too hard and takes himself all too seriously. The whole movie feels like a big commercial add for the US Navy that always saves the world. Always. Aliens included.It is a movie full of wholes and logical mistakes and goofs. Two examples: the aliens blast all the glass windows on all ships. In the panoramic view of one ship, the glass windows are intact. And how could a loser become a lieutenant over-night? Did his brother bribe someone within the Navy or what?! Only in America...I give this movie 2/10. Only because I rated ""The Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" 1/10. This one is slightly better. But slightly - it has SOME entartaining value. I feel sorry for those who actually payed to see this bad parody at the theaters.",Battleship
497,robert-w-andrews,Battleship sinks to new depths.,2,11 November 2012,"With the potential to be a production piece of spectacular Sci-Fi, this unexpected disappointment in light of the high anticipation it set within its trailer debut is emphasized by a quite frankly boring and PG dominant plot and a cast that offers little within their restrictive and unexciting characters. With an extensive $200,000,000 budget that is only reflected within the impressive visuals, ""Battleship"" offers few positive elements and takes a similar foreboding course as the Titanic by sinking to new unwelcoming depths.In terms of the events that occur in relation to the plot, the origin of the narrative is certainly spontaneous and fairly uninteresting. As attempts to contact the newly found Planet G are regrettably successful, a large US naval force is forced into deadly combat with a heavily armed alien invading fleet. The marketing of ""Battleship"" seemed to relay the impression that the production would lay waste to a modern war blitz of an epic naval battle against unknown invaders, however the battles are as disappointing as the production as a whole. The encounters are simply not on a wide scale and are consistently one sided adding to the films unwelcoming sense of predictability throughout. Despite a 12A rating Battleship often reduces itself to the unwelcoming inclusion of PG smothered events and moral messages that the production team attempt to convey, which is simply irritating for the more mature viewers, as it forces a sense of disengagement upon them. If ""Battleship"" was more loyal to the preliminary expectations rather than focusing on an attempt to desperately emphasize how the underdog can succeed under the gravest of circumstances then the plot could have been considerably more enjoyable.Never the less the visuals that ""Battleship"" employs are very impressive. The destruction of ships and firing of both human and alien weaponry is of a high standard that is also seen within the costume designs of the aliens and their associated props. Without a doubt the visuals certainly account for the extensive $200,000,000 budget, as without this the film would suffer heavily as the visuals stand as the the only major positive feature. Despite an impressive costume design the aliens themselves are extremely inconsistent and at times rarely threatening. They are simply inconsistent in terms of their superiority over their naval enemies and rarely take advantage in order to achieve victory. Yet the true frustration is that we strangely obtain no insight into their incentive to spontaneously invade Planet Earth, as the gaps in the narrative cannot be ignored.Little is done to amend the films failures in terms of the ambition lacking cast that has been assembled with little consideration. No cast members are likable enough to offer anything unique to the production, something essential in any successful production piece. Taylor Kitsch takes them lead role as Lieutenant Alex Hopper the irrational younger brother of Commander Stone Hopper who is a central character throughout, as he only serves to portray an arrogant and failing member of the American Navy who throughout the majority of the film is beyond irritable. With his major role in the production as the unexpected hero, many of his lines contribute heavily to the frustrating PG elements that rarely fall absent. Despite a direct opposition in morals and values as the sensible sibling, Alexander Skarsgard's portrayal of Commander Alex Hopper does nothing to offer any likability that is absent within the protagonist. Although he doesn't follow his on screen partner in being extensively irritable, he is an unexciting character and extremely bland. Rihanna's appearance in this production was certainly unexpected and clearly emphasized how the majority of music stars simply lack the desirable skills to jump the band waggon in terms of industries. Rihanna's portrayal of Petty Officer Weps could have been played by almost any other young female in the film industry and at that any other replacement most likely would have done a much better job due to Rihanna's frequently poor delivery of dialogue. Although past music stars such as Alicia Keys had achieved success (Hers being in the crime thriller ""Smokin Aces"" in 2008)Rihanna doesn't achieve this and instead is thoughtlessly thrown into a production in which her performance is below par. And yet at the height of the casting failures stands the unexpected minor role of Liam Neeson in the production. Someone as highly credited and talented as Neeson was just what was needed to salvage the films total failure,yet Neeson's appearances as Admiral Shane are extremely rare and insignificant, as being tied down to such a minor role results in a no show of Neeson's tremendous acting talent.With originally high expectations set for ""Battleship"", the frequent failures within both the narrative and the cast result in an diabolical and anti-climax end product. Regardless of the impressive visuals, ""Battleship"" offers nothing to excite or engage viewers and with the direct result of this thoughtlessness is a film that will leave viewers relieved at the thankful finish of such an all-round disappointment.",Battleship
498,taranakicomputers,Alien Invasion movie satisfies like Independence Day,8,22 April 2012,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and thought it was a great 2 hours spent. In assessing this movie I compared it to comparative films in this genre; alien invasion of Earth, (usual) U.S military response, collaborative efforts between historical enemies, and loser makes good. Independence Day, Transformers, War of the Worlds, Battle Los Angeles were movies which I used to assess and measure this movie against and frankly I believe this movie deserves top spot against those.I thought this movie had the least cheesy moments, less than Transformers and Independence Day certainly, and that's why I've rated this movie at the top of Alien Invasion movies. It wasn't as apocalyptic as War of the World's and that suited me as well. This is an Alien Invasion movie and for what it is it delivers in satisfying measure enough for this reviewer at least to rate it better than Independence Day.",Battleship

If they weren't on medication, then maybe they should have been.Some of the CGI is OK, but it doesn't make up for this tortuous, cliché- ridden mess.

I weep for the people who can't just enjoy a movie for what it is - pure entertainment. When my wife & I saw this, we weren't looking for a physics class or a logic seminar. We were just looking for tons of action and things that went boom.We have a saying that we use when something clearly impossible is being done. When one of us starts saying ""What!? That's bull****, the other says ""Relax, it's just a movie"". And the other relaxes, able to enjoy the rest of the movie, because In Movies Everything Is Possible.Who cares about great acting? If you're after that, go look at a ""film"", which drives normal people into a deep slumber. For the people who disliked this movie because of flaws in science and/or logic and/or acting, go to wikipedia.org, and use this search term: ""List_of_films_considered_the_best"". As a public service, I recommend that you have the list tattooed on your arms for easy reference.Here's a quote from that Wikipedia article: ""Every decade, the British film monthly Sight & Sound asks an international group of film professionals to vote for their greatest film of all time. The Sight & Sound accolade has come to be regarded as one of the most important of the ""greatest ever film"" lists. Roger Ebert described it as ""by far the most respected of the countless polls of great movies—the only one most serious movie people take seriously.""[1]"".There you go - Serious Movies for Serious Movie People. Kinda like the Knights Who Say Ni.The only criteria that folks like me (""Sweat-hogs"" perhaps?) look for is, ""Is it fun?"". Battleship delivered fun in spades. Not, of course, for Serious Movie People who watch Serious Movies.Run time of 131 minutes never bothered us - we rented the Blu-ray from Netflix, and paused as desired to refresh drinks, snacks and bathroom breaks. Admittedly, the first hour was kind of talky (dull boring ""character development""), but after that, Battleship was an action movie junkie's dream. Big Iron duking it out.And putting in the old vets - totally awesome! (On a tour of the Intrepid in NYC, there were some WW2 vets on board to answer questions. They were great guys!)

Yes, yes, it looked like a Transformers rip-off, but nonetheless, they were excellent.The rest of the movie was total utter crap.Storyline - unnecessarily complicated, inconsistent, full of flaws. Half of it should have been edited out as it was just filler. It was like the guy that made it just got out of film school and tried to accomplish every genre in the one film. Fail.Dialogue - cheesy. Very cheesy. The whole thing read like the worst lines from Independence Day, Pearl Harbor, and every other total crap film. Fail.Acting - where to begin?????

I don't see anything wrong with it even though it may be unrealistic ( but isn't every movie!). What makes a movie great is action and a good storyline which this movie has! Why I gave this movie a 8/10 is it was a little confusing. The movie is about NASA discovering a new planet next to earth.

It boasts Pacific Islander representation, Japanese representation, veteran representation (both retired and disabled), hell they even had alien representation lol. And Rihanna.

Now going into the movie, I was expecting something closer to the beautifully crafted Transformers trilogy (exception to Transformers Revenge of the Fallen), but I was sadly mistaken. Thinking of Brooklyn Decker and Rhianna as action heroes seemed a bit too much to grasp, along with a stupid script and mediocre special effects. Now I'll admit, there were some funny lines, but I was still disappointed. There is one really exciting sequence in which these robotic ""wheels"" destroy an entire battleship, but that's pretty much it. Even the video game trailer looked better then the film.

506,martin85-1,Worst movie I have seen this year,1,19 September 2012,"I vote this one and only because there is no zero. This is by far, the worst movie I have seen this year, and I watch a lot of movies.Poor acting, poor story line, unbelievable all the way. Yes, it is a sci-fi movie but it lacks anything we have come to expect in sci-fi.1. An alien race that can travel light years to invade us comes with only five ships, one of which crashes into a satellite. One would think that if they have a ship of that caliber it would be like a cruise ship hitting a dinghy. But instead, it is totally destroyed and crashes on earth.2. One would think that the aliens who can travel light years would have shields for their ships and ray weapons. Nope, instead, they have weapons that fire line-of-site and and only fire explosive containers, which, by the way easily penetrate 12 inches of armor on the ships.3. One would think that the alien ship bridge would not be protected by glass that is easily penetrated by a sniper rifle, which, by the way, after penetration kills the alien commander.4. Alien ships that hop across the water? They flew from another planet but now have to hop.5. Oh yes, and they arrive here with no communications and have to use ours.6. The attack on earth made no sense. Why take out a baseball field and concrete highway supports? I could go on and on and put many other things. Without a doubt, this is the worst excuse for a movie. I have wasted money on the DVD rental for sure. I would expect the well-known actors to be in higher quality films.Save your money for something better; this one for sure is not worth it.",Battleship

509,georgedunc,I am compelled to write a minimum of 10 lines so you avoid this movie.,1,27 April 2012,"I have written very few reviews on IMDb, I simply do not have the time, but on this occasion things are different. This movie could have been so good, yet it is truly awful. I am a total advocate of having fun at movies and suspending belief but in this movie, even attempting to do that is interrupted by shocking characters with shocking lines. If people reacted in real life like many of these do in the movie, you could be forgiven for shooting them on sight.The main character played by Taylor Kitsch is so annoying, so arrogant, so stupid so utterly imbecilic that for him to be allowed in uniform would be a slur on a nations entire armed forces. He seems to have adopted a role trying to emulate bad boy comes good Chris Pine as Kirk in the 2009 excellent movie Star Trek. But it doesn't work and he displays himself as a complete and utter loser in every respect, and frankly the screen writers should not work again. Every cliché possible is thrown in, trying to make what is termed 'an extinction event' funny. As aliens battle to use an earth array radar to communicate with their planet and bring on the destruction of the planet, the geek in charge of the array who knows everything about it says 'what! are they trying to phone home like ET'??? Shoot that man!I am saddened that Liam Neeson's bank balance is so low that he needed to take on his role in this movie. If he was that short of cash, had he just put an ad on IMDb I am sure we would have all chipped in $5 each to keep him out of this disaster. The boys and girls in the CG room did an awesome job, but it was so unoriginal with all the trappings of Transformers that whilst technically superb it was just all pointless. Just where have they spent $200 000 000 ? It must all be in CG or was it the fee for Rihanna? Whatever, the budget for this movie would have been better spent on saving some third world country from economic disaster.At the end it becomes clear that whoever the military adviser was, whatever their sins during the main part of the movie, should definitely have been sacked and not paid. Our main character the man who has led a team of misfits to save the entire planet is awarded ...the 'Silver Star', the third highest award the military can give. Where was the medal of honour? the top banana, they must have been limited as only one was given to our main mans dead brother, who did nothing other than stand on the bridge of a ship and get blown up (apart from also putting up with his cretin brother for which he definitely deserved the award).In summary, totally disappointing. To base a movie on the Hasbro game of Battleships was always going to be a challenge, are we now going to face movies based on snakes and ladders and 'frustration'? Too many agendas were hidden in this movie to ensure a politically correct Hollywood ra ra ra conclusion. There were many points in the movie where I totally wanted the Aliens to succeed and destroy the planet, as it's occupants were proving that there was no intelligent life here. If you are dragged along to this movie then maybe just put your iphone on silent and play angry birds or some other garbage game to keep yourself entertained, or better still play Battleships.",Battleship
510,jshelm,Abysmal,1,7 January 2013,"As a long time movie buff, I am up for virtually anything that the screen and actors can throw at me, particularly Science Fiction. Suspension of belief and reality is never a significant issue for my son and I. My son (21y) and I went to see this ""film"" the second week of release and after 45 minutes, we both looked at each other and said, let's go. I have probably seen 350 films at the theatre since the age of eight and this is only the second time this has happened.Why? The film is a classic case of a lead character (Lt. Hopper), who is not believable. In a nutshell, this is the linchpin upon which this film lives or dies; since the CGI is quite spectacular. By the time the real action starts in earnest; you just cannot see this character in the role; the character development is abysmal (and for an action film of this genre, the expectations are quite low) and quite honestly, he is an unpleasant person with whom no empathy can be achieved, IMHO. Even my son, who is likely the target demographic for the film, and a full bore college student who enjoys his weekends immensely (not the studious type) thought that Lt. Hopper was a ""tool"". When the lead hero has a clown suit on, this does not bode well...While there are a lot of recent action films with spectacular effects that are not particularly well done that can be entertaining, this film does not fall into this category.

How old is the director and his script writing buddies, 12 or 13? I thought the part where the old seadogs show up to help drive the battleboat to get the aliens was down right embarrassing. The only thing Hollywood knows how to do these days is spend gobs of money, probably from the government, on garbage that supports the warring military as that seems to be the vocal point of all the aliens coming to attack earth movies this century. The only intelligent thing about this film was the ability to create it, and yes its fun to watch all the silly bloodless mayhem, but enough is enough when all that visual technology is wasted on the continual American propaganda to make people fear what isn't true. Its purposely aimed at the dumb down young kids of today so as to get them to want to join the military. Is that what young people still really want to do these days? Kill, and Kill someone they don't know? All these types of movies only prove that we are being lead by the wrong leaders, and to prove my point its the Americans who shoot first and ask no questions in this movie. (There was a hidden meaning in that many will miss) Also the reason there are so many clichés in this film is because its cheaper than originality, and cheap has never been so expensive. But then, in the language of the people who think this film had something of value to say, duhhh U C this pic I rea rea like it. Goosh_t man. Do you think Hollywood is trying to brainwash people by hiding what their really doing in plain sight? Reading the other reviews I see some see it but most don't. I guess making a film where the aliens come in peace and with a higher level intelligence to help show mankind the error of the New World Orders way, without any armies of mindless soldiers firing away at everything, must be against the law or the new rules of modern day film making. Who really controls Hollywood these days? I know its not me. I rather believe if you've figured out how to travel though space at faster than the speed of light, because the distances are just to great and would take to long to travel anywhere at any lesser speeds, then you would have no need to be aggressive, as there is nothing here on this planet that can't easily be found throughout the universe as they would have the technological ability to find whatever resources they need without having to kill other intelligent like forms. It seems all these childish film makers have totally forgotten all about the Prime Directive. In closing I'd like to say that I'm glad I don't have to pay to see these films, otherwise I would have nothing to say. And to my friend Phil, thanks for inviting me over to watch. Now I know, and now I lay me down to sleep and pray for a grownup version of ET.",Battleship
513,urmonk30,Fun and Patriotic,9,3 April 2015,"This movie has got a lot of bad press which I don't think it deserved. Everyone I know who has seen it likes this movie. It's fun, thrilling, patriotic, and even inspiring. Besides being a action thrill ride with stunning visuals it has a heart. Some may think it is corny or cliché to show patriotism in the way this movie does, but it allows me to see the men and women of our armed forces as they mostly are: brave and courageous. People in the theater clapped when the older crew of the Missouri came slowly marching on the deck, ready to sacrifice for their country again. A movie like this gives me a good feeling about our service men and women. Good acting for a action flick, the characters are played as I would imagine them to be, and to some point know as I grew up around many in the Army. Taylor Kitsch is one of those overlooked gems. Not all guys who play heroes in action movies can act that good. I was pleasantly surprised in Brooklyn Decker and Rihanna, coming from modeling and the music business you don't necessarily expect acting chops that good. Liam Neeson is always a pleasure to watch in whatever he is in. Gregory D. Gadson did a wonderful job. I know none of these performances here would win any awards as awards standards seem to be geared to overly dramatic roles, but if anyone in this movie deserved one it would be Gadson. I enjoyed the development between the characters of Lieutenant Hopper and Captain Nagata, the progression from enemies to allies. And I enjoyed the humor.Some of the ideas and concepts are played for dramatic effect, such as the signals which in reality wouldn't be visible, but making them visual enhances the viewing experience just like adding sound to outer space scenes. However I didn't expect a hard science film when I went in to see this. The aliens are interesting even if humanoid. Making the aliens humanoid soldiers gives the movie a sense of soldiers fighting soldiers as opposed to soldiers fighting monsters as in Aliens or Starship Troopers. It is still science fiction-fantasy-action but it does have that war movie feel. When going in to see this movie I hadn't realized it was based on the game, which I played as a kid. I felt the 'pegs' were made to work quite well given what inspired them, making them out to be some sort of alien device. The whole idea of turning the game into an alien invasion movie made for a nice twist.Battleship made for a great beginning summer action flick that I really enjoyed.

I found it to be entertaining and a fun hour plus.

But apparently in such subtle manner that it's not obvious to everyone, considering the rather abysmal rating.Absolutely everything in the movie just slams ""tongue in cheek""- mentality to your face, from start to the end. The movie was extremely entertaining for that simple fact. Watch it and just consider everything from the direction to the actual dialog. It's almost like they're acting for the audience, instead of ""in the movie"".I certainly consider Battleship better entertainment than eg. Indiana Jones & Crystal Skull, the two latest Star Treks or the three previous Star Wars movies.",Battleship
516,preiso,Fun Entertainment,8,18 May 2012,"So, I read a LOT of posts, and many said they had some problems with the film. So, I'll go over a couple of their major issues and give my perspective.1. The alien ships hop around on the water... - So, what. I think it added a more human element to the story. Does every alien race that comes to take over our planet have to have giant hovering ships? These creatures were just like us; no special anti-gravity devices. The come, land in the ocean, and do their best with the four little ships they have. Props for trying. (The one issue I kind'a had was, hey, these ships just traveled thousands of light years as a preemptive invasion force through insane amounts of space debris, and one of their ships is taken out by a small satellite...? Go figure... But, whatever. Who knows how many they originally sent that got destroyed by space dust along the way...) 2. The aliens only try to kill things that turn red on their sensors... - Understandable. They got here with a limited amount of resources, and the whole idea is to conserve as much as possible until their armada arrives. Makes sense to me. Take out only what you have to - anything that may be a threat, and move on. Why roads? Because they can be used to move troop lines! Duh! I can see why they thought this was a good idea.So, yeah, some of the acting was a little lame. Oh, well. They can't all be awesome actors. Some of you, I'd like to see you do better. Just enjoy it.One thing I was really proud of was their display of the American flag, and their tribute to the old salts of our Military. Good job, Universal/Hasbro/etc. Let's show a little respect.Yeah, there were a few minor plot-holes, but overall, it was fun, entertaining, and if you go not expecting too much, you can be surprised at how much good you can see in it. Over-analyzing is a great way to ruin any movie-going experience.What gives me any right to say all this? Well, I'm a film school graduate for one, and while not everyone who has a Bachelor's degree in film is necessarily a good movie critic, I do understand what it takes to make a good film.Just relax.

517,roblynmouth,Brainless escapism,10,13 April 2012,"There comes a time when, the movie goer realises, that the reason why they go is to be entertained. Moreover that Movies today are but another example of that, along with TV, the Internet, Radios and even books.There is no need to examine why, just the joy of sitting back and being entertained. Battleship is but one example of that but possibly one of the best of 2012. Its a romp, it rocks when it needs to, it gets to the point apart from the beginning, which seems to be tagged on as an afterthought and it blasts your senses with spectacular CG I, FX, and all means of other movie magic. So what if the story is contrite, that the actors are shallow, the story line looses its way and the script stinks. This movie is about shear b****y enjoyment and the classic good guys -v- the bad. I loved the Aliens, I loved the ham acting, but what i loved most of all was the imagination given to just how one side get to kick the arse of the other. It also has one of the best Battleship manoeuvres you are ever likely to see and possibly the most impossible. However, first and foremost this is about 2 hours of escapism and i loved the depiction of Alien weaponry. So Mr. Berg, full marks for this one and as for Battleship 2, what about a 4 'man' alien special forces team, which is sent to Earth to find out what went wrong sort of the Alien SEAL's, makes contact with home and then Earth has the 500,000 ship attack that Rhianna promised us.",Battleship

Incredible visual effects and the aliens in this film look very terrifying, coupled with the music, but that's just it for this film.It felt very rushed towards the end, but maybe that's just me, but i wasn't happy with the abrupt ending. Characters of this film where very flat, i guess blame the writers. One thing I loved was Rihanna's performance in this film, her very first feature and she well looked like a seasoned actor. The rest of the characters where just mehh. Liam Neesen was Liam Neesen, bad ass as always but he simply didn't appear enough, But non the less all the characters carried the film through.The aliens are super dumb, sorry to say but they are. How the hack do they have such awesome technology beats me. They looked pretty awesome though, but they don seem intelligent enough. The plot was pretty average, ""aliens wanna kill us, lets kill them first"" kinda thing, that was it really. Its good that there where moments when i thought its over for earth, but yeah, you know the deal. If you liked the Transformers series, I believe you'll like this film cause the visual effects are AMAZING! Life Like.Go see this film in the theater, its a real visual treat.

521,schuesseled,Forgivable,6,22 July 2012,"Great Concept, exciting looking trailer, and all round not a terrible film.(Spoliers)But there are several parts of the film, which though forgivable, are absolutely ridiculous. For starters, the protagonist goes from a almost homeless humorous almost successful criminal to super major general of staff in the navy overnight. (slight exaggeration). Then later once the film gets into the sci-fi stuff I came for, although it is funny to see someone fail to rob a shop, the aliens arrive at earth, the ships are capable of punching through the atmosphere, smashing into the ocean at 1,000 mph, but gets completely disintegrated when they knock into a satellite a 30th their size...Later the aliens show a significant lack of ""smartiness"" by not having a computer controlling their countermeasures. Let a little light into their bridge and they are all bumbling about unable to stop a swarm of missiles from obliterating their ship. And again later their munitions despite all the technology that goes into them, to make them all explode at the same time, have no way to track their target and change their directory as is seen in the final battle.These kinds of screw ups are forgivable the film is still good, and entertaining.

522,Sergeant343,"Why, just why",2,8 June 2012,"I really don't know where to start, for it has been about a year since I have seen a movie coming close to being this bad(Battle Los Angeles) and is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Who's bright idea was it to make Battleship into an alien invasion movie anyway, board game movies can be good, just look at Clue for that. Everything in this movie is a failure of film making other than the effects and Liam Neeson's performance.The movie is centered around the smartass hero Lieutenant Alex Hopper(Taylor Kitsch) who leads a band of misfits against the alien invasion all the while his girlfriend(Brooklyn Decker) and a crippled army vet try and assist in the take down of alien communications. Now you would think that this movie would be cheesy as all hell, nope, having a root canal is a more pleasant experience than this movie. There is a fine line between a cheesy movie like Independence Day, and painfully bad, Battleship comes no where close to that line it is just bad, and very predictable.The Characters in this movie are all cardboard cutouts, you have the lovable idiot, the hardass dad, the love interest, the nerd, the badass girl, the rival, and the hero. None of these characters have any depth to them and when they die I don't feel anything, because I don't feel anything for them, for I don't really know them. The acting outside of Neeson whos gives way too good a performance for this movie, ranges from bad to mediocre, surprisingly Rihanna is only mediocre. Decker is atrociously bad in this movie and basically plays a Meagan Fox role. Kitsch looked like he was trying, but the script and the Character let him down. The special effects in this movie are well down, but they aren't things we have already seen in Transformers and don't really add anything new to the picture. However the action sequences are so poorly done that it is boring, how does one make action sequences boring. I haven't seen action this boring since The Matrix Revolutions, not to mention the Shaky cam, it may not be as bad as the Hunger Games, but it is bad. Outside of one sequence that reminded me of Armageddon, there really isn't anything ""good."" The aliens themselves are unoriginal in design, yet had an interesting concept behind them with sunlight.I could go on and on nitpicking every detail that is stupid and makes no sense I would be here all day. Overall this movie is a colossal waste of time and money with the only good things being the effects and Neeson , none of which make this movie worthwhile. The only way I can possibly recommend this movie if you see it with friends and bring booze.1/5 stars",Battleship

Liam Neeson is good. in a small role. Peter MacNicol is good, in a small role. Brooklyn Decker has great bounce. Rihanna doesn't sing. (Col.) Gregory D. Gadson, a real wounded warrior, acts like he wants to be somewhere else, and who could blame him. Taylor Kitsch probably wishes he had stayed on Mars.

After all it is noting but a Aliens movie (breaded ones this time, don't really know whats the insinuation)but if you compare it with some classics in this genre like Aliens, Predator, this movies would probably find the bottom drawer. The all too predictable story of a loser turns hero in the hour of desperation, is all stale bread. The Aliens look too human by the way and the idea of getting them dressed in the Iron man suit was a pretty lame joke.

525,Freyguy6,"C'mon, it's not that bad",8,21 May 2012,"There may be some inadvertent spoilers in this review, so beware! I went to see this movie with my girlfriend expecting an action movie with (based on the previews) really good special effects. After the first 5mins of the movie, it became apparent that Battleship was going to mix in some comedy as well. Both my girlfriend and I were both laughing a lot at the beginning of the movie, and it loosened our original perception of the movie. Now, we were just there to have a good time.For the most part, I was impressed. A good amount of the negative reviews I have read seem to not even be about this movie. I read one that literally stated, ""Why did we have to slaughter these aliens that were just trying to get home?"" They were obviously not watching the same movie. These aliens were trying to use our satellites to bring more ships to earth to take over the planet! They were piggy-backing on our technology because their communications ship crashed at the beginning. They weren't some well to do aliens who accidentally crashed and were trying to get home! This was an invasion! Another review said there were too many side stories... There were literally two. The main story arc deals with the main character fighting the aliens, and then his girlfriend is helping an army vet who lost his legs and they get into some trouble. That's pretty much it.The one big problem I had was the super cheesy part towards the end when all of the old veterans working on the Mighty Mo are posing all over the ship and Hopper gives them the mini speech about asking them to do more for their country. Plus, the idea of running a WWII era battleship with about 10 Navy Sailors and 10 60+ year old vets is a little... unbelievable. I'm not 100% on this, but the standard crew for a Missouri type battleship is over 2000. That was just way too corny for my taste, but it didn't take away too much from the over all movie.All in all, it was a lot of fun. The movie had great special effects, the interplay between the actors was amusing, and at times, just plain funny. The story was okay, there are a few things that were kind of left hanging, but this isn't supposed to be some artsy, independent film. I disagree with the reviewer who says that ""It's an action movie"" isn't a good excuse. I say it is. If you want moving dialog, Oscar worthy acting, and a swath of top name actors... This probably isn't the movie for you. If you just want to have a good time, have some laughs, see some great special effects and walk away from a movie with a smile on your face, go see this movie.",Battleship
526,febinphilip,One for the action loving young-lings,5,10 April 2013,"Personally, I am yet to play the Battleship board game so let me just stick to the movie. It stars Taylor Kitsch at the helm with a bunch of other folks whose faces we are more likely to remember rather than their names but god forbid if we forget Hollywood veteran Liam Neeson and not to mention Alexander Skarsgard from True Blood fame. There's also Rihanna playing the role of Petty Officer Raikes and till this day I have no idea what the director was thinking when he signed her on for the film.Anyways, as the plot line clearly states this is another one of those alien invasion movies with a whole bunch of graphics and; well and nothing more! The story line is bland and predictable and while Taylor carries the character of Alex Hooper in the first half quite well, I fail to see how the second half is quite described as acting; for I assure you the second half leaves little room for it with all the guns blazing canon-exploding mayhem. Liam's screen space is practically little to none and if I was not a fan, I would have gone like 'who's this old timer playing Admiral Shane?' The movie was a waste of his talent and I sincerely hope he does not make the same mistake again. However, a welcome addition to the movie was Stellan Skarsgard and I found him to be a very good blend into his character.All in all, Battleship is just another one for the young-lings who enjoy a good action movie with all the CGI graphics, a sappy love story and some popcorn on a Friday night.",Battleship

Then there is Tyler K, another shocking acting performance!Notwithstanding the unbelievable-ness of the aliens actually attacking us, you have the old crew on the USS Battleship!! We are expected to watch/believe/give in too the fact that if there was an alien invasion then the US would have to rely on a load of old duffers and there oldest ship - #yawnAaaanyway, the one redeeming feature and regardless of what i have written above the reason to watch this film, are the SFX they are superb!

I watched Battleship because of Liam Neeson and Rihanna(she looks GOOD in this movie).I have to be honest. It was quite a fun at the movies. When it comes to this kinda movies, I know I cannot expect much more than a whole lot a booms. I mean, a PG13 Hollywood-Alien- Explosions-Canons-Kid's Fiction movie. I didn't expect good writing or dialogs, which there weren't. (there were some funny puns that made me chuckle, but that's it.) The acting was not excellent, besides Liam of course. NEVERTHELESS, there were some great effects going on. I don't wanna spoil anything but to be honest, the effects were actually the entertaining part of this movie. I am talking about a less imaginative and creative Michael Bay. The effects were the fun part.Overall, I believe it is a decent, not bad, summer Hollywood blockbusterWriting: 2 Acting: 4 Dialogues:2 Special effects: 6 Film in general: 5/10It was a good try, but it couldn't have been any better.

The movie is a fullpacked action film with stunning special effects. It reminds me of a naval version of Transformers: Dark of the Moon, and that's a good thing. The story is about yet another alien invasion, where you follow the good guys fighting to avoid a human extinction. It all works great.. well most of it does. The acting could have been better, but they are not awful as many people claim. And the movie does have a sudden and quite unrealistic ending. I'm not going to spoil it for you, but I believe they could have come up with a much more fulfilling ending. As I mentioned earlier the special effects are fantastic! They are without flaw, and it's the main thing which drives this movie forward. It's the best I have ever seen in a film!So overall I would say this is a good movie.

I had expectations of watching this at that cinema a few times and getting it on blue ray - this is my type of movie!; or at least that was the expectation. With such great promotional footage and Liam Neeson heading the cast, it had to be great. In reality, Neeson has almost a bit part (in fact you see most of it in the promotional adverts), clearly there to increase sales of the movie; with the bulk of the 'acting' coming from Taylor Kitsch.A ludicrous start with Kitsch playing a 27 year loser who, on the recommendation of his brother (Alexander Scarsgard) joins the Navy, suddenly to become at Lt Cdr - The script is clearly written by someone with no military knowledge or experience and that the actions, demeanour and interaction with all that are supposed to be military personnel, is a non sense. It makes Top Gun look believable! However, it gets worse;with aliens that have made there way to earth with great looking craft,that impressively rise from the ocean (great CGG) - you see it on the commercials for the movie, the only weapon they possess are melee type Armour - pretty ridiculousreally and by this point the movie has lost any form of credibility. The outcome is obvious from the first few minutes and I certainly wouldn't go back for a repeat viewing.

As you can see from the other reviews a lot of people didn't like this movie, so why did I? 1. I came in with low expectations - I was expecting something horrible, boring, long and pointless, but despite myself I liked it, I laughed at the jokes, I connected with the actors (yes, Rihanna too), I was excited by the action and while clichés the plot held my interest 2. The actors did a good job with what they were given - Taylor Kitsch did a good job, Rihanna wasn't that bad, I dare say good, in her role. She was there, she didn't try to chew the scenery, she did her job as an actor/secondary character and it didn't bother me. I give her kudos3. lost in translation? - you try to make a game into a movie and you want to put parts of them game in it? Not easy, a little cheesy? Of course, but fun? Yes, fun, enjoyable, and in the end it was a part of the story that wasn't as forced as it could have been. So in conclusion, ""Battleship"" is a fun, corny, typical summer movie that I like but as you see a lot of people didn't. I think it is a guilty pleasure, something to be enjoyed by the few but annoyed by the rest. In the end I can only suggest this - go in with low expectations, expect a little over the top patriotism like in ""Act of Valor"" ( but not so heavy), and don't think about it. The movie is not without its flaws or questionable logic, but as it was said so well in another movie - ""I suggest you don't think about it and just enjoy the ride""",Battleship

You travel light years through space but you cant avoid a satellite. You can make an impenetrable force field but cant protect your battleship? A decommissioned boat carries life ammunition, and its former crew? And so it goes on and on. And yeah i know in an action movie they can stretch it a bit so you better don't think to much, but this one wants me to shut down almost every braincell while watching.

This film is a prime example.It is so over the top jingoistic that it makes Stalin's propaganda movies look quaint. It feels like we're watching a recruitment movie for the Navy. The weapons and warships are glamorized with pumping AC/DC music, omitting the fact that these warships and big guns are meant for blowing up real people to bits. There's no glamor here. It's not ""cool"".Of course, all the crew members are super heroic and fight to the death to save the world. They get rewarded with nice little trinket medals in return. ""Look Ma! I got half my body blown up and the President gave me this shinny piece of metal to wear on my shirt. That was worth it!"" The aliens are beyond stupid. They have spaceships that can travel billions of miles, but they still use inaccurate WWII type grenade launchers and are completely useless in combat.

I do not see why there are such dramatic haters. Perhaps they just want to hate it? Nonetheless, I rather enjoyed it.

545,phasetrek,A fun movie.,8,30 July 2016,"This wasn't Oscar material. Just a fun movie with an interesting premise. (Possible spoiler follows.) The only problem I had with it was the science - the sense that, unless the satellite dishes were destroyed, danger to Earth was imminent.At the very best, ""Planet G"" would have to be in the nearest solar system to us - Proxima Centauri - which is 4.2 light years from Earth. In other words, a satellite signal (at the speed of light) would take 4.2 years to reach Planet G. Even then, assuming the aliens had ships that could travel at the speed of light, it would take another 4.2 years for the aliens to send reinforcements to Earth.There was a lot of alien technology left behind. This would give our scientists 8.4 years to study it and develop countermeasures. So, while the danger of a 2nd invasion was real if the satellite dishes weren't destroyed, it certainly wasn't ""imminent.""P.S. One more scientific faux pas. NASA didn't build the Project Beacon satellite array until 2006 according to the movie. That means, assuming Planet G was in the Proxima Centauri group of planets, the signal would not have reached them until 2010. The movie came out in 2012. And it gave every impression of ""present-day"" events. So, to make the trip to Earth, the aliens would have had to travel in ""faster-than-light"" spacecraft - theoretically impossible (unless, as in ""Dune,"" the aliens could ""fold space""). Nah, let's not go there, hehe.",Battleship

A lot of creative effects and new alien stuff, but I think Berg's time is up in making blockbusters (along w/ Kitsch). It's always a Friday Night Lights reunion with his movies, and that formula doesn't work anymore. First off Kitsch's mono-tone one-liner-attempts in becoming the new badas.s John Wayne / Clint Eastwood just doesn't work. He's got no depth when it comes to playing the character, it's the same type all the time, and he's no leading man. Now he was great as a side kick in Wolverine which I enjoyed and thought he played it very well, but leading badas.s headliner guy - - no way. His former FNL sidekick Jesse Plemons actually does a better job in scenes when he's stressed and frustrated and showing emotion and getting antiquated instead of Kitsch. Small doses of Plemons is good, it would have been nice to see more of him as he mixes it up. There seems to be no rapport between Kitsch and Neeson, you can tell Liam is in a whole different level when they have dialog. Gregory Gadson's character was pretty good, I thought he did a solid job even though some of the dialog was just Steven Segal wannabe tough guy full of cheese, he at least executed well. It's a 3 out of 10, had there been more sex appeal maybe a 4 but that's it (I'm JK). Very disappointing, the plot and substance was filled with vague sci-fi bologna. With a budget just north of $200M and an opening weekend of $25M, I'd say the vast majority is aligned w/ the Razzies. At least it's not as bad as Waterworld, although the acting in Waterworld was much better.",Battleship

Intimidating general, doting big brother, reckless little brother, hot chick, arch nemesis turned right hand man, goofy sidekick and toss in a nerd who finds his courage.The two dimensional characters were what made Gadson's storyline and presence so compelling.

And I wasn't disappointed.A storyline so full of holes you could pass one of the excellently realised alien craft through, so many errors and goofs you could do a BBC special on it (surely someone was responsible for ensuring the insignia on the uniform actually matched the rank that the character was referred to??) and so many cheesy lines you could feed the world in pizza for a year but admittedly one of the characters does comment on this fact at one point.But, and it's a big BUT: I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish. The 2 hours 10 exploded by in a heartbeat and my eyes were glued to the totally non-stop action.The effects are something special and did offer the idea of scale that some movies miss out on. The sound in the cinema I visited was extremely loud and the bass fair rattled my fillings, but it all added to one fantastic experience that was worth the £11.10 it cost to see.So a bit of a guilty pleasure and my suggestion is to grab a big box of popcorn, sit back and just be entertained.",Battleship

Apropos of nothing, the movie included a scene of protagonist Alex Hopper breaking in to a convenience store to steal a chicken burrito for a woman he had just met. The odd thing about this was the scene was a shot-for-shot remake of an actual, hilariously inept robbery caught on CCTV which went viral thanks to sites like YouTube. It was such a bizarre decision to include this scene that I started paying more attention the movie, and that's when I discovered something:Virtually every scene, line of dialogue and plot point in this movie is a direct reference to something else. I actually lost count of the references in this movie, which I now realise was written with an Edgar Wright-level attention to detail. Armageddon, Under Siege, Titanic, The X-Files, The Office, Dr. Who: not just the number but the sheer range of other movies, computer games, comics, TV shows and internet memes is staggering and makes turns the movie in to a great game of hide-and- seek. How many references can YOU spot? Battleship, the board game, is referenced itself (obviously) but so ridiculously it is obviously done tongue-in-cheek. The camera keeps panning out so you can see how all the players are arranged on the ""board"" and the aliens literally shoot little plastic pegs at the humans, just like in the board game.The self-awareness of the movie almost made me skip over what a bizarre decision it was to cast Rihanna in the movie. I mean, she's not an actor. Why is she in the movie? Was Liam Neeson not a big enough selling point? You could argue that Neeson is hardly in the movie, but here's the thing: neither is Rihanna. She's practically an extra. She had no memorable lines and does absolutely nothing a jobbing actor couldn't have done just as well. I don't know why she wanted to be in the movie, I don't know why the producers wanted her in the movie and I can only feel sorry for the writers who were obviously forced to crowbar in things for her to do. At one stage, she opens a door. I think that's the most impressive thing she does.This movie is silly, but knows it. The ""science"" is so far off correct that I had to ignore it completely and the aliens are forgettable and uninspired. It's respectful to actual, real-life serving members of the Navy and the characters, as shallow as they are, are pretty likable.

So, here goes; It made the previews of upcoming attractions we saw before the start of Battleship something to look back on and what we fondly reminisced and talked about on the drive home. Spoiler alert: Today's theater popcorn just doesn't taste as good as it did ten years ago, are they using different oil or something? The seats are much more comfortable, tho. What did we learn about aliens? Apparently despite being capable of traversing millions of miles of empty space to get here, they are incredibly stupid, so we are safe. What did we learn about the US Navy? If you are a tattooed up ex-felon with a drinking problem you can in the short span of two or so years become a Lieutenant Commander, so there is hope for even the lowest of the low if you have the awakening desire to lead men and and apparently the only woman in the Navy into life and death combat situations.

562,Scannain_com,"A completely mental, completely bombastic, completely stupid summer blockbuster",5,12 April 2012,"Turning a board game into a big-budget summer blockbuster was always going to be a stretch. But Hasbro the company behind the cinematic juggernaut Transformers series thought they had locked on to a winning formula for their adaptation of their best-selling board-game Battleship...namely ditch Michael Bay for the supremely talented Peter Berg, add aliens and throw shed-loads of money at the screen. And it almost works...The plot such as it is sees Taylor Kitsch play the lovable aimless reluctant hero. Drafted into the Navy after a drunken stunt to impress a girl goes awry he soon rises up through the ranks as his natural ability overshadows his confrontational nature. Meanwhile scientists have discovered a new planet light-years away that might just contain intelligent life. Sending a message to this planet they are seemingly unaware of the potential consequences, that ET might answer and drop by. Back in Hawaii the Navy is gearing up for a massive military exercise when our new ""friends"" decide to pay a visit. What happens next is man v alien in a spectacular battle of technology and wits for the control of the planet...So lets start with Kitsch. The poor boy never can quite get a script close to that of his breakout TV role in Friday Night Lights. He's a likable guy, who does his best with the material and can handle the action sequences with aplomb. He is however overawed by Alexander Skarsgard, who manages, in a significantly smaller role, to show why he's better equipped for leading man duties than his John Carter starring cohort. Liam Neeson gives another in his trademark gruff father figure performances. You never get the feeling that he's exerting himself, but that's okay. Rihanna casts aside her singer-cum-actress background and manages to give as good as she gets playing with the boys. Brooklyn Decker never equates to more than eye-candy and the rest of the actors are all given screen-time but no background.As a feat of technical film-making Battleship is a tour-de-force. It's visually stunning with obvious state of the art effects and seamless CGI for the most part. The alien technology is beautifully rendered, although the aliens themselves leave a lot to be desired. Likewise the movie slows to a crawl during the misconstrued slow-mo weapon loading sequences, which serve to remove the audience from the action rather than immerse them in the spectacle. Aurally the film is amazing, way to loud, but the sound design itself is full of merit. The soundtrack works well in places, less so in others. The liberally used rock classics that magnify the action are well timed, as is the wonderful interjection of the Pink Panther theme. Sadly it all comes apart when we get to the script. The story is woeful, with under developed characters serving only to spout unnecessary exposition and act as the most needless array of clichés seen in many a year. Even by the standards of sci-fi films based on board games this is ludicrous. Berg has a good eye for action but even he can't help but channel his inner Michael Bay when it comes to blowing stuff up. Given a couple more months to develop the script, a good edit job and 40 less decibels and we'd have a real contender on our hands here.As it stands Battleship is a completely mental, completely bombastic, completely stupid summer blockbuster. A missed opportunity perhaps but maybe just what the doctor ordered if you like your movies loud, crass and Americatastic.",Battleship

The film touts Liam Neeson as one of the actors so you may be lured into thinking it might be good, but he only plays a minor role in the movie. Two of the main characters are played by a couple of wash outs who starred as high school football players in the TV series ""Friday night lights"", so this should give you an indication about the quality of this film. The main issue though is a complete lack of plausibility. This is always difficult in any ""alien invasion"" movie, but in this one, it's lacking completely. First, the lead actor who starts off as a long haired, drunken bar fly who gets arrested for breaking in to a convenience store, emerges in the next scene as a member of the US Navy -- Not as an entry level sailor, but as an officer??

565,Acello,Turn off your brain and enjoy,2,25 May 2012,"I can see how this movie will work to the eyes of those who don't look past the stunning CGI and bombastic music. The level of detail in the destruction scenes is on par with that of the Transformers movies (although this time, you always know who's destroying who, which makes Battleship perhaps less confusing) ; yes, the CGI is awesome -- as devoid of any life or magic as it may be. As for the soundtrack, it tries really hard to be as uplifting and manly as it possibly can (altough it was puzzled as to why they chose 20-year-old classics, including two great ACDC songs, to woo the Rhianna-era audience the movie was obviously targeting).To be awed into total mental submission by sound and light isn't new ; your local caveman ancestor, contacted via a Ouija board, will tell you all you need to know about the gods of lightning. It dazzles, it deafens... it works. A powerful experience all the way, he'll say. However, if you're not that dazzled or deafened, or if you simply drift away from the path the movie constantly hammers you into taking, you might find yourself having some strange, unintended and unexpected thoughts. Beware ! Theses flashes of intelligence (and unwillingness to be ONLY entertained) might ruin the movie for you.Here are a few of them : 1. The most obvious (which is, although a few reviews I've read have picked on it, one that seems to go widely unnoticed) : the choice the aliens make between who lives and who dies. It's CLEAR that MANY scenes mean to show that these aliens have a unique (and very interesting, IMHO) way of dealing with war or aggression. They will not attack an unarmed person, even if basic human logic, on the other hand, would normally warrant a preemptive strike. That is, a human garrison would never let a alien spy wander into a restricted zone without consequences, whether he seems aggressive or not, but in a key-scene, the aliens allow exactly this (the scientist is clearly allowed to infiltrate the alien base and escape unharmed, simply because he doesn't have a weapon on him). And it makes total sense, given some 4 or 5 other scenes we watched before, and which SEEM to be destined to ADD UP and lead to a big revelation. This was truly interesting. So that scientist, his mischief done under the very eyes of the alien sentries, runs back to his friends unharmed, panting and not understanding why he was not dismembered on the spot ; you then expect (finally !!) someone a bit clever to notice (and USE later !!) this obvious fact... but it never happens. No, I guess he and his friends just put it down to sheer luck. That's utterly stupid and a huge let down, since it makes a big part of the script look like a half-hearted attempt at something important that was ultimately discarded (but the related scenes remained !!).So there was ultimately NO attempt, in spite of the obvious initial intention, to try to understand the aliens' motives and psychology in any way, although it was CLEARLY intended in an... early draft of the script, probably. That alone makes the movie seem amateurish. I can't think of ANY movie of that kind that didn't try to explain the way the enemy thought. And while it was uninteresting in some other movies, in Battleship it seemed to build up constantly, throwing hints at you, leading to something huge, and... poof. Zip.2. Then there's the obvious rant about alien technology VS human technology. Other reviewers have said it already : basically the way the aliens attack or defend makes NO sense at all, whether you consider their ships' technology or their power armor technology. Advanced alien ships leaping and crashing clumsily over water instead of flying (sure must be great to be a pilot or passenger in one of those) ; inability to shoot down incoming missiles (humans can, but aliens can't ??); great power armor but no weapons to speak of, or none EVER put to use in the movie in spite of a dozen show-offs of stupid rotating hand-blades) ; inability to track human vessels (what, advanced alien tech can't track a floating pile of metal ?) ; and the worst offense by far, the fact they use weird exploding shells when they could use the all-powerful ""wheels of destruction"" instead. The list goes on, and it could be really really long.3. The 25 minutes featuring the Missouri were by far the worst. I won't rant about the seniors still squatting onboard after the ceremony, or the Pirates Of The Caribbean rip-off (and what a stupid rip-off of a stupid scene it is) of the instant turn thanks to an anchor drop (OK, I'll rant, it's even sillier here given the sheer mass of the Missouri compared to the Black Pearl !). Oh, and of course that 60-year-old museum-ship was fully armed and operational, just had to bring a few gadgets onboard on rushed metal trays on wheels (and I didn't get what those gadgets were).Suspention of disbelief is something I give into without too much of a fight when the movie is not too dumb. But this one wants to be the mother of all dumb movies ; even ""Independence Day"" or ""2012"" didn't stoop so low. Worse than any Emmerich movie, and that's saying a lot.",Battleship

Taylor Kitsch did the job rather nicely. Even RIHANNA was alright. The CGI for the film was amazing kinda reminded me of transformers a bit still they did it pretty well.

569,Kobestarr,Somehow - its not thaaaat bad....,5,18 April 2012,"I went to see Battleship at the weekend and at each stage of the of process I hung my head in shame. I bought the ticket online so that I didn't have to speak to anyone to tell them what I wanted. I'm sure that the machine laughed at me as it coughed up the ticket! Battleship is exactly the kind of film that I didn't want to see. A story crow-barred from on a plot less board game, a pop stars's first feature, stealing its ideas from Transformers has to make for a terrible film. Hasn't it?! The reason that I bought the ticket was the Curiosity got the better of me... and you what I liked it...much against my own rational I hasten to add. I really don't know why. Maybe it just wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, the old law of diminished expectations!!Lets list the Faults! 1) The story makes no sense. The aliens half the time seem like good guys. They were attacked first and half the time they didn't kill people. I didn't know who we were supposed to be championing most of the time! 2) The main guy is an idiot with no redeeming features.3) American films should never feature what they call ""soccer"".4) Rihanna wasn't bad but i had no idea what here character was about.5) If they had to shoot the aliens why didn't they use the missiles that they used at the end.6) Liam Neeson from ""Schindler"" to ""Taken"" to ""The A-Team"" to ""Battleship"" to ""Taken 2"" ... his futures not bright.So why did I like it? 1) There were some parts there were genuinely funny, such as with the chicken burrito the scientist guy made me laugh, 2) Even though her character is troubled Rihanna didn't play a typical attractive female role and I think there is hope for it in the future, 3) They DID actually play Battleship in the game, 4) It didn't drag on too long, (That is a bonus in this day and age) 5) The whole final third with the veteran marines coming on in slow motion like a geriatric ""Reservoir Dogs"" is actually so ridiculous you have to see it.I'll probably never watch it again but I wont be asking the cinema for two hours of my life back either!",Battleship
570,lulzpharcyde,Thank You,6,2 March 2013,"First off, I would like to thank the hundreds of reviewers who gave this film HORRIBLE reviews. My expectations were so incredibly low, that the movie ended up entertaining me for a couple of hours on a rainy day, and I actually ended up enjoying it.I have to ask... What exactly were you expecting from a movie based on a board game? Oscar nominations? Some of the finest writing and directing since The Godfather or Citizen Kane? Like come on people. As soon as I heard there was a battleship movie coming out I didn't have to see one preview or hear a single scrap of information about it to know that it was going to be sub-par. The reviews were almost as entertaining as the movie was! Watching people tear apart a movie that was highly influenced by Hasbro and based on one of the most terrible board games of all time, was one of the funniest things I've seen to this day on IMDb. Well the film itself honestly was nowhere near the disaster the user reviews are making it out to be. Furthermore, the CGI was actually quite good, and the action sequences were pretty well done. The acting wasn't horrible either. I doubt we'll be seeing any best actor/actress awards or nominations coming their way, but it was definitely tolerable. If you're looking for incredible acting, plot, writing, twists, or anything like that, look elsewhere. If you want a decent action movie to pass the time for a few hours, this is not a bad flick to watch. That's what most action movies are anyways... Things blowing up, chases, fight sequences, etc for 90 minutes.In conclusion, again thank you for lowering my expectations even further with your oh so serious reviews. You improved 90 minutes of great and at times hilarious (unintentionally) entertainment. Thank you Hasbro for making up for your horrible board game with a mediocre (but entertaining) action flick. For anyone not planning on seeing this movie based on the reviews, watch it. You'll be pleasantly surprised. pzPharcyde416",Battleship

But if you are as smart as you think you are, you would have realized what this movie was all about from the trailer alone. I just watched it with my 8 yo son and he really enjoyed it. Yea, its not going compete with Chris Nolen clever type movies but it is fun and well paced (except for the first 15 min during the character build up, which is not really needed for the target audience).

572,bookreadever,Eyes Open or Opinion Beforehand,10,12 November 2012,"I saw this movie in cinema. Later, I asked about the DVD in a rental store. The clerk said this was a Michael Bay movie. I did not make the connection, and even now I see Peter Berg is the director's name; but the clerk went on to say Michael Bay directed Transformers 1,2 and 3. High-tech aliens, lots of explosions, an underdog human race that the viewer will root for. Does Battleship fit that bill? Yes. It may be recent years have changed us in that we can see the special effects in this film are first-rate, and we no longer find a great light-show sufficient, but must subsist on the fetish requirement of that unidentified something we were looking for when choosing a movie. Let us seek that which this movie offers. Spoilers follow. Since Captain and Executive Officer are killed by the enemy,the rebel brother takes command and proves resourceful against a prominent foe by redirecting fire and repositioning ship for a strategic hard hit. When it is discovered the enemy has very effective stealth technology, an innovative method of learning their position is illustrated. A self-admitting coward, an amputee, and his therapist become instrumental in foiling enemy communication attempts. A perfect ending to illustrate our condition. Liam Neeson plays the father of the rebel's love interest. After saving the world he seeks permission from the girl's father to marry her, and he says no. ""Saving the world is one thing; marrying my daughter is quite another."" As with the Admiral whose criteria might be unreasonable, it appears that lately every movie is required to qualify before it can be called acceptable. Let the movie stand on its own, and you may be surprised; but it's not to impress me or because some reviewer thought one way about it. You make your own mind.",Battleship

Battleship is an epic! viewers and critics around the world has trash talked this movie, saying that the plot was very crappy written. Its an action movie! an big alien invasion movie, it suppose to have a crappy written plot because it doesn't need a plot. Just big special effects and a lot of action mixed with humor and trust me this movie delivers. I found this movie awesome and fun to watch, and I don't give a sh&t what other people say or think! I loved it and movies like this is the reason why we go to the movies today. Im sorry that its not Titanic or The Blind Side and have nothing but plot and dialog, but its a big a$$ action movie with aliens and explosions and awesome special effects. Its a pop corn epic that deserves to be seen!!!!

574,showboataussie,Brilliant,10,17 August 2012,"The storyline isn't mind boggling stupid, the sequence of events isn't so ridiculous that it leaves you thinking 'wtf just happened' and the acting and action isn't so terrible that you stop the movie because you're so embarrassed for all involved. In fact, the acting and action distracts you from bothering to care about the technicalities. What you have is a hilariously funny action movie that took the premise of a simple board game and applied it, imo, brilliantly to a big action movie.I laughed so long at them copying one of the most funniest 'dumbest criminals caught on camera' videos, I got excited when I saw the shape of the bombs the aliens were using to destroy the ships, and thought it was great at how they managed to integrate the actual board game. Who cares if not every detail makes sense, the movie isn't confusing or has a complex twist ending. All I know is, Battleship kept me in my seat from beginning to end because I didn't ask too many questions, I didn't try and poke holes in the plot. I just sat there and allowed myself to be entertained, forget enlightenment or trying to figure out clues that aren't there, sometimes you just gotta chill.",Battleship

Right!""....but I'll let you figure out what that could be.pssst! Its to do with The Missouri's Health 'n' Safety certificate. See if that narrows it down for you. :) It still gets 10/10.

It's full of humour, drama and cheer-on scenes. I also see how brave and smart our men can be in the Navy and how they achieve the greatest award ever: Respect.

Also the comment made about a new element that is not on the periodic table discovered cannot possibly be true there are no holes in the periodic table and even if there were to be a new element we haven't discovered which there may be it would be incredibly unstable and would probably decay into something we already know about so it's almost impossible that even an advanced alien species could keep such an element stable is ridiculous I just think that if you are making a science fiction movie you should get the science part right.

The deck seaman of the the fleet, the FCs and the DCs and MAs? Not many, The Sand Pebbles? That is about it. This movie is for the type of person who loves action, comedy and thrill. Peter Berg, god bless Friday Night Lights, is great. I give him mad props for taking this ridiculous idea and turning it into something worth watching.

As for Rihanna... we're yet to see her *acting* début. This isn't the sort of movie which requires acting.The movie generally is strongly reminiscent of the recent Michael Bay Transformers movies, which makes it seem derivative and unimaginative. The various alien designs are stylistically very similar. The 'hero' is an impetuous loser with no common sense and a xenophobic attitude to the Japanese.Every aspect of the storytelling and plotting expose a severe lack of competence. Plot holes, irrational decisions and unlikely events abound. Irritating, irresponsible liberties are taken with serious topics such as NASA's activities, how navies operate and the immutable universal laws of physics.I didn't stay for the extra final scene.

Even the scene that pays homage to the film's inspiration was entertaining.Despite what people say, the aliens aren't that dumb if you consider that they are just scouts who aren't really prepared for all-out war. The plan was to isolate themselves so that they wouldn't have to fight anyone at all; instead a navy battlegroup shows up right in their backyard.I even found myself surprisingly devoid of boredom during the character development scenes.
Just don't try to question why a radio signal looks like a fat laser and it will be perfectly enjoyable.This film is perfect if you just want to watch some badass navy dudes kick the daylights out of some aliens with loads of explosions without cringing. 6/10.",Battleship

CG was decent but I'd say it was only one of the few good things about this movie, the other being Liam Neeson's solid performance.

When it opens with Taylor Kitsch stealing a burrito to impress Brooklyn Decker I thought ""oh boy"" but thought it was funny and it quickly turns into a well-paced action film. So five alien ships arrive (in response to a signal NASA sent out seven years ago after discovering a habitable planet) and set up a shield around Hawaii in order to use it's communications array and satellite feed to boost the signal and call for reinforcements because their communications ship crashed into Hong Kong. Kitsch, his elder brother Alexander Skarsgård and assorted American and Japanese naval ship crewmembers (including Rihanna...didn't want to take me eyes off her :) do battle with the aliens inside the sphere shield. Liam Nelson is around, giving an impassioned performance as the barking Admiral here and father to Decker. Adam Godley and Hamish Linklater give us the science info., although a bit of that got past me at first because the close-up of Rihanna was still lingering in my mind. It was good to see Gregory D.

How can you hate a film that knows what it is so well? What, you wanted an accurate representation of battleships and sea-based war tactics? Against an invasion force of previously un-encountered aliens, vastly superior in technology and firepower. So realism is going to be key in this flick, i can tell straight away.For me, the highlight is, ""What do you need, son?"" as AC/DC starts fading in - that's not a spoiler in any form, you'll see it coming so far off it's almost sad, but in a really awesome way that just gets you more pumped.Yes, it's clearly a US Navy recruitment campaign, but luckily i'm too old, too cynical, too peaceful and too not-American to ever join, so i'll just sit here and enjoy the fireworks and try to resist the urge to punch the air and shout USA!

605,crazzzik,Perfect action movie,9,20 May 2012,"First to haters: looking for deep meaning and finding mismatches in this movie is the same as hating marvel's superheroes because their abilities go against laws of physics.IMHO this is one of the best action movies ever. Battles and damage animations are loud and meaty as h3ll! There is love story that doesn't involve making difficult decisions in the middle of the movie. There is a protagonist that is not trying to become something that he is not, but rather trying to achieve what he might be good at (in the movie several people refer to him as to a guy with potential. The movie itself didn't contain that scene but one of the early trailers stated that he went from private to major in shortest time ever). There are some famous characters. There is an old school twist at the end (HINT: battleship). There is even character progression. I think those are quite important aspects of a good action movie and they nailed them.Now, this movie is NOT: an accurate representation of an alien invasion, a movie that makes you think about your own existence for months after, a deep psychological drama. It contains MANY mismatches and hiccups that do not connect with the plot, mostly because of certain deleted scenes. Yes, it makes no sense for police to arrive in three cars and leave one behind. Yes, it does not make any sense to miss battle ship parked near the island (or continental shore) with full crew. What was important is that it didn't ruin the story and me discuss those little things after the movies.Bottom line: The movie has a solid naval warfare along with some interesting but simple characters. On the weak side it had a lot of mismatches with a plot mostly due to cut scenes. Overall, the experience is rather pleasant and complete with a fair ending.",Battleship

To bad for the aliens, however, because the US Navy is there to stop them! This is an edge of your seat action adventure inspired by the Hasbro board game, Battleship, that delivers in action and special effects. Don't expect amazing acting, or stellar dialog, though; much of the dialog is patchy at times and the writers took great pains to include random hilarious quotes into the mix. But, fortunately, that is not the focus of the film. You can also expect to see random hints connecting the film to the board game in one scene; that I found to be pretty awesome. And for the boys and men out there; Brooklyn Deker is in this film : ) One word...HOT!!! Why 8/10 rating you may ask? Here is a summary: Less than stellar acting Patchy writing Randomly inserted humor Limited screen time with Liam Neeson Less than believable scenes (The USS Missouri, for example) Otherwise, this film is awesome and action packed!

There was absolutely no character development or even a distinct plot at all. The story line kept jumping around to make this movie very confusing. It also uses just about every action movie cliché in the book. If you are going to see a Liam Neeson masterpiece, STAY AWAY. Neeson has a pathetic amount of screen time for being such a huge star. The acting is sub-par at best. Most of the emotions seemed forced and unnatural and was quite disturbing throughout the film. The action scenes are much like those in the Transformer movies, but not nearly as exciting or thrilling. The movie wraps up far too quickly and gives a very non-satisfying ending. There is some inappropriate language used in the movie, but that is about the only reason it should be rated PG-13 because the action scenes are not overly intense. Overall a very promising film that sadly disappoints.",Battleship

614,kone51,"If you like sci-fi action films, give it a chance!",8,4 October 2013,"First off - this movie is your standard 2 hour action romp, and in that, it in my opinion does well. If you have trouble accepting an excuse of a plot, that lasers do not work that way, and that aliens want specifically our planet even though there are much better planets nearby that wont fight back, well,this film just is not for you. If you expect anything else than big explosions, lame puns and a simple storyline, you will be disappointed. The key to enjoyment of this film is simply to not take this movie seriously at all, flick the critical thinking off switch in your brain and just enjoy it for what it is - an Independence Day -esque battle against aliens that want to conquer Earth for whatever reason. Again, if this is too much for you, just stand back and leave the movie back on the shelf... If you don't, don't say I didn't warn you.As for myself, I found the movie well enough entertaining to use it for passing a couple of hours on a Friday evening and did not regret it. The visuals are easily what you would expect from a movie such as this - adequate-to-top-notch CGI (even if the designs themselves were corny), plenty of visually impressive explosions and of course not all of the things are realistic - we're talking about aliens here.The plot... Many people chide this movie for the plot, but come on, reading the premise, what do you expect? To me the plot is just an excuse for the action and I have nothing to complain about the action scenes - explosions, tactical combat, more explosions, fun times were had by all that were not invading aliens.If there's anything I'd fault this movie for it is the acting. Or an actor. Two actors. Generally the acting isn't that bad, but Taylor Kitsch and Alexander Skarsgård chew the scenery, so to speak, and hard. It's probably not their fault, just how the characters were written, but neither really don't have the action hero charisma to pull it off - if we had Bruce Willis or Samuel L. Jackson in the lead role, this would of been a 10/10 movie for me. Also, Rihanna surprised me in this film - I'm not a fan of her music, but she would make a pretty decent actor if she ever quits singing.",Battleship

I was roped in to going to watch it, it wasn't actually that bad though. OK, the script is iffy and the acting is average but the film in general is fun, easy watching with very good visual effects and sounds. I found it easy to switch my brain off for this film up until the last half hour, where it was as if the director had needed to leave set and got the local Gloucester downhill cheese roller to fill in. You'll know what exact point I'm speaking of when you see it, it caused my mate and I to turn to each other and say ""do you want cheese with that"" in unison. From this point everything that happened seemed to have a Brendan Fraser feel to it. Up until this point they had done quite well at keeping the cringe factor down to a tolerable level and the fairly long run time had gone by without me checking my watch. All in all, this film is worth watching for yourself when you are in the mood for a brainless film full of action.

Why were the Aliens hear, why did they pick a fight without understanding their opponent. Seeing that they are more technically advanced, why have they not tried to make contact before, etc.Liam Neeson and Skarsgard, good actors were wasted in this movie only playing minor roles. Taylor Kitsch character I found annoying and I could not understand how a person with such a dislike for authority and lacking common sense could be the Navy's best. Brooklyn Decker performance was OK and was pleasing on my eyes. Rihanna wasn't bad for her first movie but I kept hoping that she would breakout into a cameo and sing ""My umbrella"". A battleship is normally operated by 2,000 to 3,000 men but this battleship that had not been running for 20 years or more could simple start working at full efficiency with a compliment of 20 people at best and having live ammunition on board was unbelievable. How the Aliens were defeated in the end was just a nonsense. Apart from the performance of Rihanna, Decker and Skarsgard. The only thing of credit in this movie is the special effects.",Battleship
621,LawyerTom,"Silly, vapid, but fun, and bless the disabled and old vet's",7,2 February 2013,"Nearly all of the professional movie reviewers trashed Battleship. Its characters were classic stereotypes: the younger brother screw-up who becomes a hero despite himself; his beautiful girlfriend with a heart of gold for injured war veterans; the brilliant and successful older brother (who unfortunately lacks tactical insight); the depressed paraplegic veteran of the Bush wars who rises to the challenge; the butch combat control officer who is tough as nails; the tactically brilliant Japanese naval officer; and, the wimpy geek who warned the world of the dangers of contacting nearby star systems. Yet, if you enjoy science fiction, and can get past the awful first ten minutes, the movie is a hoot.Science fiction is a troubled genre. There are a few brilliant films over the past decades (e.g., The Fifth Element (1997), the original The Day The Earth Stood Still (1951), several of the Alien series, and the original Star Wars trilogy), and so much trash. Battleship has many story elements that make no sense. How is it that aliens can travel faster than light to Earth, and yet have weapons that are relatively primitive (a short range tumbling 16"" shell equivalent and the spinning wheel of death, whose purpose appears to be to destroy freeways, military bases, and cut ships in half). Where are the photon torpedoes, the Phasers, even the railguns? Still, suspend disbelief and go with the flow. Once the action starts, the movie provides plenty of surprises and laughs. It is fun to watch as a small group of U.S. sailors (with the assistance of one brilliant Japanese officer) struggle to overcome the threat posed by the advanced force of aliens. Do not let ET call home.The producers, directors, and writers deserve gold stars for the strong supporting roles played by the injured and the elderly veterans who help to save the day.

The best part of the movie was at the end when the Museum steam ship had to be used. All the other ships were destroyed and Earths only defense was an old steam battleship that was used. THE BEST part is that it was a museum and the veterans from prior wars all in their 80's and 90's helped the few soldiers that were left from the abandoned ships.

Plot holes are as big as earth itself. I was always sure that at some point people would start to ask ""What do these aliens actually want from us?"" and start to TALK to them. There are many hidden hints that this would happen and this would make sense, since you constantly see that alien technology only classifies weapons as being ""red"" and dangerous (why do aliens use our red-green classification?). But no. If these stupid morons (the main human characters) would have watched Star Trek just once, they would have known that it takes some courage to try to get in contact and verbally solve whatever the problem might be. The main characters here just try to look beautiful and kill 'em all. I don't know if this is more sad or more stupid.

(He claims he knew I was videotaping him, and was just trying to mess with me, but I think he's lying).While the movie was really different from the boardgame (don't expect any white or red pegs in the movie version), I still thought it was pretty good. In fact, I hope they release a new Battleship: the Movie: the Game, that includes the aliens.Here's an idea for an updated version of the game: One time per game, each player can use an alien ship. It comes up from under the water, just like in the movie (they could make some sort of little motor mechanism that brings up the alien ships from under the board). The alien ship should be able to nerf bullets or something.Also, you should make it so that players can't move their ships once they've been put down.

But, the movie is also based upon the premise of Navy personnel and thus, in this day and age should benefit from some sort of technical guidance from the wealth of military personnel available.I expected that the acting would at least be somewhat acceptable given the names involved. Sadly, this was not to be. The acting int his movie makes Delta Force III look like Apollo 13 or Iron Man. I believe that the Navy must have been jealous about Battlefield Los Angeles and how the Marines and Air Force got so much screen time and decided to lower the quality by 8 notches.First, Rhianna is just dreadful. She sounds like a 13 year old boy going through puberty most of the movie and her actual acting skill is on that level as well. I would go on to other characters but do not want to spoil the plot should you put yourself through this.***Possible Spoilers below***As far as storyline, lame. I mean, LAME. Just think of Stephen King's ""Langoliers,"" Final Countdown, Armageddon, Top Gun and borrow some action plots and they are in here. Then take a cliché from nearly every bad action movie you have seen and add those too. Then, top it off with some creative license from Space Cowboys (Old men...except here, even older men...coming to the rescue and helping to save the day).OH! OH! On top of that, the main strategy for winning this impossible battle is based on the most simple board game of all time, hence the title.Finally, all Naval personnel should be truly ashamed that the Navy was involved with this since a far sub-par Naval Officer which would never be allowed in the Navy as an officer let alone at all (this is not the 1960's with Vietnam recruiting standards) gives up command of a U.S. Naval Destroyer to a foreign Japanese officer because he (the American) is too much of a coward to take command.My wife and I put it in x2 play speed at about 3/4 through because it was just to painful to listen to. You will get a great laugh, however, when they introduce the old veterans in the final sequence.On a positive note, I do like that they brought awareness to past and present veterans, both disabled and from previous wars. That was a really neat idea...but that does not improve the actual quality of the movie in any way shape or form. It was also nice to see a city other than New York or Los Angeles actually be affected by incoming space craft. Yes, they generally show one or two other cities get beat up but the focus is usually on how destroyed America can be. I did notice that the Buddha statue did not get scratched where as any Christian statue is generally wiped out. Just saying'.If you are dreadfully bored or that curious (as my wife was) to see how the actual movie is, do not expect a blockbuster. This was one of the biggest flubs of the year in my opinion. For those who loved it, hey, everyone has a different standard in movies. That is diversity right?I am saddened that this is the best they could do with such capabilities. This could have been so much more if they had simply hired that 14 year old kid!(P.S. There was no 14 year old kid that I am aware of and that is simply an exaggeration towards how bad this was)",Battleship

It's moronic but OK if you can turn your brain off.However, near the end it becomes hilariously bad with the introduction of a series of obvious non-actors who are only there so people who love the military can get all misty eyed and salute whatever flag while overusing the word 'hero'. The scene where these characters are introduced standing at the various points on the ship is one of the worst I can remember in a main-stream blockbuster. Presumably we were supposed to be in awe but all I could think of was how they A) Got up there and B) How they'd get back down without breaking a hip.Oh and while I know it's pointless questioning these things in such a film but it seemed to me that all the aliens really needed was a couple of those spinny ball things.

645,someguy123-1,The Battleship sinked pretty deep,2,26 May 2012,"I'll be honest before I write this review. I thought the idea of making a movie based off Battleship was a pretty stupid idea. I think making movies based off board games is a pretty stupid idea in general. Let me first start off with the good aspects of the movies, the special effects are actually quite good, which is why this movie gets a two besides a one. In a technical aspect, this film isn't badly directed, and there isn't a horrible performance in the cast. That is the only positive things I could say about this movie. Now let's start with what I think is wrong with the picture. First off, the dialogue is this film is god awful, most of the characters in this film are scientist and members of NASA who manage to talk like 12 year-old children. The film had a budget of over $200 million and they couldn't afford to get a good screenplay writer? Wow. What's worst was that it seem Peter Berg tried to make Battleship a comedy as well, it seemed like when there wasn't action going on, Berg starts pushing in this cheesy sitcom style comedy that feels off to me.My perfect way of described this movie is that GI Joe and Transformers had sex in a pool, they thought that they couldn't get pregnant in the act, but then Battleship came out unexpectedly 9 months later. This movie is big, overlong (it's over two hours) and dumb blockbuster, the worst part is that it's not enjoyable dumb. If you want to make an enjoyable dumb action movies, please resort to The Expendables or the recent Rambo flick, this is just a waste of time.",Battleship

Amazing.If this was a movie made with the purpose to discredit America i would understand it fully.

653,ColoradoGuy,Great SFX -- But Really . . .,5,5 July 2012,"I'll give it 5 stars because the CGI (Special FX) are excellent as we now expect from any such Sci-Fi action film. I saw it with a friend because our wives refused to go (and they would not have been impressed). The ""acting"" is, well, acting. The characters are caricatures. No chance to take any of it seriously. From a science point of view, there is one major problem - the film shows the scientists ""throwing the switch"" to send a signal to a star with an earth-like planet, and it seems within seconds the aliens show up! The closest star to earth requires over 4 years for light to travel to or from earth - radio signals, or the very strange ""light beams"" in the film would travel no faster. And the closest star has no earth-like planets. In reality, the first earth-like planet was discovered just last December (2011) which is rather a fine coincidence for the film makers, but it is about 600 light years away, meaning light or radio waves would take 600 years to travel one way. If the aliens could travel at the speed of light, it would take 1,200 years for them to arrive if they left immediately after getting the signal. But their ships seem rather crude in some ways - they even crash into a satellite as they approach earth, so they aren't very advanced space people! Others have commented on the absurdity of a down-and-out slob like Alex Hopper joining the Navy and seemingly in only a few months (weeks? days?) becoming a lieutenant, and then in the battle being promoted to captain. Also the outfitting of the USS Missouri to operational status in a couple hours is beyond absurd. The aliens were another problem, though I did like the fact that they were not insect-type or weirder than they were. All of them looked like twins (triplets, quintuplets?) People in the film and in the world have many different physical characteristics (hair, eye, skin, color and size, etc.) but each of the aliens we see look identical to all the others. Of course the plot is pretty predictable (what do you expect from a movie ""based on"" a board game). The good guys win, no one on the USS John Paul Jones seems to be injured after it is spectacularly blown up, and the slob turned Captain promoted to Lieutenant Commander at the end gets the girl! We saw it at our local $2 cinema (yes, only $2 for a 2D film - they didn't have a 3D version this week) and the special FX alone were worth it.

Sure this movie may not be 100% realistic, but I wasn't going to the theater to see a Documentary, I was going to see an Action Movie.Although this movie might of had some parts that were slightly unrealistic but at least it didn't abandon all sense of reality. It was a good action movie if you didn't go to the theater expecting the movie to be a documentary. Its a movie that you can follow and enjoy if you like action movies. Advice #1: If you don't like action movies, THEN DON'T GO SEE IT just so you can leave a snarky review on here saying it sucked! Go watch Wizards of Waverly Place or iCarly and quit trolling. Advice #2: Some may claim the aliens may seem unrealistic, but after all, they are aliens! Not humans. They are aliens who had to seem like they could exterminate the population, not wimps who would make E.T. look like a Spartan in fierceness. This movie made allot more sense then a number of other action movies that are out there, so if you go to the theater to watch this movie and are going to see AN ACTION MOVIE, then you will most likely be pleased.

(jeeez!!) 4. the aliens are extremely passive as if they have a huge desire to die: from a pack of aliens (about 20 to god knows how many) only one starts a fight with a cripple retired navy officer, and none of the other aliens even seem to care 5. they shoot down with a sniper riffle a window of some sort that resisted both atmospheric entry and impact with sea at huge speed as in mach 10 or something (it entered atmosphere without slowing down)... must have been a hell of a rifle... 6. ...and the list goes on...and on...",Battleship

This movie is basically how we manage to start Armageddon; only they end it before that starts. I imagine so that movie-goer's can leave feeling as if nothing can beat humans, and the navy always wins. Or something along those lines. Upon sight of the aliens, who make zero offensive maneuvers, we shoot. They respond defensively. We shoot, they respond defensively... this pretty much sums up the entire show. The graphics are pretty good. Even better, we invited them here. And when they show up and do NOT start shooting, we do instead. Even better, they only shot back at the specific targets that shot first. At the end of the day we managed to destroy our first visitors before even bothering trying to make contact with them. Destroy robots several times the size of carriers, with city-sized impenetrable shields, capable of interstellar flight, the rapid manufacture of advanced weaponry and controlled by beings that wore robotic body armor with built in artificial intelligence. 4 such robots, destroyed by one single naval vessel. Yeah... that really what they tried to sell us. And of course, they didn't bother tying up that small loose end of ""who did we just start war with"" or why we weren't worried that they would respond in force for their next visit. Or why such an advanced civilization would only use mortars to defend themselves. Or why the body armor/aliens carried no projectile weaponry. Or how it's possible that a man could out-muscle body armor that just an hour earlier was capable of ripping through steel. The graphics were decent, but all too common these days.

This is not how action movies should be made and it is not fair to make bad movies just to cash some money because ""hey, it's an action movie!"" I don't believe in low class genres: is not a sin to enjoy an action movie, but it should be a good movie anyway! Battleship has an horrible plot, actually nothing happens but it does it in more than 2 hours. God if it was boring! I don't understand how you could ever make a movie with explosions and fast-paced editing sooo boring. There are elements that make to sudden apparitions and too much plot holes. There are some TERRIBLE comic scenes, like the one where the guy is stealing a burrito for his bigtittied trophy. In that moment it becomes American pie, the family guy, epic movie. There's a LOT of FAKE lens flare. I don't understand why, is it a fad now? In super8 they had a meaning, but in battleship there are even more and they really make no sense. Every single clichè, you can find it in here. well, we live in a postmodern period so that's okay, we are used to see old clichés. The problem is that they use them like it is 1980 and it's the first time. If you care about that, the aliens are really a bunch of pussies. They invade earth and the humans have to struggle a little to fight them. Yeah, just because they use only THREE American ships (actual war ships, not space ships) and a couple of airplanes.

665,alichino1,Battleship - or how to sink profits,5,21 May 2012,"The point of modern movie making is to ensure that those in the suits and high rises of the Hollywood Hills - that is, their mansions overlooking the ocean - remain rich. The act of entertaining, the process of telling stories that will last, the underlying drive that gets us, the consumers in the seats, is a mystery to most of the people that finance film anymore. They don't say it, but they all know it. ""If you want film"", they say, ""go to Cannes or Telluride and all those other money sinks we pour dollars into as a use for a tax right off and if after saving all those Benjamin's from Uncle Sam we win an Oscar, all the better."" Battleship exemplifies this approach.The plot, if you can call it that, is a vehicle to lead the audience from one action scene to the next. Like a ride at Universal Studios Hollywood, where whatever drivel the bored ride attendant is reading from his cards is ignored by the people being flung around from one room to another watching as aliens or robots or sharks attack you in your seat. What we have here, in Battleship, doesn't even count as a movie plot, for less than ten minutes in they attempt to play out a reason to get our anti-hero into the position he is: the bad boy. Frankly speaking, someone with that much of an attitude would never make officer, and even if he went to college and went through OCS and managed to pass it he'd be assigned to oversee the Mess hall or the team that cleans the hull of barnacles, notice, that I didn't care for the character, because that's the point. You don't care about them. You can't care about them. They are so small, so thin, so uni-dimensional that you have no reason to care. You sit in your seat and say, ""gee stop talking idiot, shoot at the aliens!"" And the writers oblige you, because that is their intention.One of the biggest flaws of people is that we can't see what an alien race would really be like. This is a philosophical argument that need not take place here, but it should be touched on at least, for these 'humanoid' looking aliens in their flashy fancy armor and rocket ships from outer space made from material we can't even manufacture on this planet have one weapon. Yep you heard it, one. They have mortars. Yep, you heard me, they have a lobbing grenade shot from a stationary platform. That's it. Even in close combat they act more like a lumbering hulking version of Michael Myers than they do an advanced troop (probably suppose to be the 'elite troops' too, seriously pathetic) party there to set up for the army (whom should be right behind them after all). These aliens deserve to be beat. But the human character's aren't worth saving either. Who do you root for? For me, the only decent character was the vet without any legs. I put all my stock in him and his anger. I was feeling his anger.Every time there wasn't an action scene they were playing Tony Scott type music with big heart string pulling sweeping camera work. The formula is old, the process, really, just stupid, and as I mentioned, Mr. Scott did it better, even in ""The Fan"", yes, even there.**Spoiler --- of a sort** If you've actually read this far then I'm going to say one thing that might be a spoiler Hasbro owns this property, therefore Hasbro's board game entitled Battleship must appear in the film somewhere. Like most of you, I expected it to appear as a gag. A couple of sailors playing the game on deck or something, but no, no such like. It turns into a main plot point.

The effects were superb, action was non-stop, and the characters were believable enough. As for the show being based on the Hasbro game, one sequence loosely reminds you of it when they're trying to shoot an alien ship blindly, other than that it's in name only.

As for everyone else, what we're left with in this summer blockbuster is a handful of solid action scenes with some of the cheesiest dialogue of any movie in recent memory in between.I went into this movie not expecting much--after all, how could a masterpiece be based off of such a simple board game? I was expecting something very simple, which was a mindless action movie with some great special effects. On that note, Battleship succeeds. The special effects on display here are reminiscent of what we've seen in the previous three Transformers movies, and even though all the action takes place on the ocean, you get a sense of exhilaration as one by one the ships are destroyed. If the entire movie was like this, it would be infinitely better. Unfortunately, this is where the problems begin.Seeing how Battleship was created with nothing in mind other than the spectacle of explosions on the sea, it should be made obvious that the plot is almost non-existent--a signal is sent into space to make contact with a planet similar to Earth (because that's ALWAYS a good idea), and alien battleships come to take over the world. Cliché as anything Hollywood has ever conceived. This would be fine, as I believe that movies should be taken for what they're meant as, which in this case is a plot less excuse for Hollywood to blow up more stuff. However, the movie tries to stretch its minuscule plot to fill far too much time--so much time, in fact, that the actual good parts of Battleship don't start until at least half an hour in. Until then, we are left with the introduction to Alex Hopper, whom we will describe as the ""protagonist"". At the beginning of the movie, Hopper is nothing more than a drunken man trying to get laid in a bar. Although the idea behind the character is simple, it doesn't make well for a likable protagonist. He continues on to prove to the audience that he is capable of being a good leader, although his conceited and lazy personality get in the way. His character is saved slightly by the female lead, a girl named Sam (the same girl he was attempting to seduce earlier), that he wants to marry. This subplot is mentioned briefly, but it is ultimately drowned out by the introduction of several stereotypical and annoying characters (including Rihanna, whose role I did not like in the slightest). And while Hopper isn't a very likable character himself, he is easily the most memorable in the movie. This is unfortunate, because as the explosions start rolling out, I would've liked to care more about the people getting shot at. As more ships are sank and more people die, I found myself almost bored in a way--Hollywood explosions are a dime a dozen, but true action only truly works if there is suspense.Suspense is another thing that is sorely lacking in Battleship. I am absolutely positive that every twist and turn of the plot could be predicted by a child. A destroyer fires a warning shot at the enemy? Looks like that's blowing up first! The enemy is seemingly impossible to defeat? Here's a convenient weak-point we found! One guy says ""We're all going to die""? No worries, the main guy just said ""Just not today""! The whole thing just feels like a recycled, dumbed-down version of previous action movies and old Hollywood clichés. Even during the action scenes, it is so obvious that certain people are going to live or die that it almost takes you out of the experience. Every time a main character is about to die, another one comes out of nowhere and saves the day. The whole event is so predictable that it wouldn't surprise me if they had taken the script from another movie, changed the setting to the ocean, and slapped a new name on it.Speaking of which, the worst part of this movie by far is the script. Finding a movie with cheesier dialogue and music choice than this isn't an impossible task, but it is definitely difficult. From the overly stupid exchanges, to the stereotypical slanders, the ""comical"" remarks, or even the obligatory session of retired members of the U.S. Navy swearing, the entire movie is filled with stupid and corny moments. The plot holes are a pretty large problem as well, being strewn all over the movie in the most obvious ways (the largest plot hole to me was when Hopper and his crew decide to use a 70-year-old museum-displayed battleship to fight the aliens, which just happens to be filled with live ammunition and they just happen to get running in a matter of hours, despite it being based on steam boilers which would take at least a day to warm up).Overall, Battleship is a mess in every single category except its special effects. I really wanted to like this movie--I wanted it to prove me wrong by actually being better than just pure spectacle--but it just wouldn't let me like it. In the end, if you go into Battleship expecting nothing more than some great action surrounded by cheese, you'll come out satisfied. However, if you're looking for a memorable blockbuster that actually has substance to it other than the spectacle, I suggest you keep looking.",Battleship

The military seems to be ran by a bunch of teenagers and puts a bad name to the uniform.

That should set the compass to all those who expect a Contagaion like playing through of events, what would happen if an alien race should attack the earth.Once the action starts it hardly stops. And whenever you think they fired up the last bit of the 200 Million they top the scene before. I was absolutely surprised how great this movie works, my wife was constantly laughing or thrilled and enjoyed it just as much as I did.One week later we watched the Avengers. IMDb score 8.8.

The movie is fine for children under 10 and it's entertaining but extremely predictable. The characters are so weak and the cast act weak as well. I like to mention to few points : 1-In what country a drunk looser guy after a few years became a lieutenant with great responsibility in navy . 2-Why did they gave the older bother a medal because actually he did nothing but standing on deck and getting blown up. 3-How they communicate with alien only with sending some laser rays into the deep space blindly hoping someone hear them. 4-What was the neeson role in this movie I think he made a mistake accepting this role. 5-If you ever want to kill an alien with high technology just shoot their ships and put they in sun light because one of the marines says that his lizard is sensitive to sun.

To absolutely anyone who wrote a review with statements like, ""the Navy doesn't...."" or ""the aliens technology wouldn't be..."" please stop posting things. That's like watching transformers and saying a 30' robot can't fit into a ford mustang or James Bond's watch would need a battery the size of a person to fire a laser that cuts steel. Folks it's fiction, not a documentary. I feel bad for anyone who watches action movies like this and point out errors in military procedure. NCIS is one of the most watched shows ever and it's not even close to being right. Battleship was a fast paced action movie with ultimately a low amount of real violence. I really liked it and for the life of me can't figure out how it's not at least a 6 on IMDb. Also, I read a few reviews that eluded to the movie exploited veterans with horrific wounds. I guess I saw it as a double amputee overcoming his situation to kick butt. For those who say it was mind numbing and pointless.

679,theguywhoknowsallaboutmovies,Think about the impact...,1,9 September 2012,"Like many movies over the past few years... lets face it all effects, big budget, no class. Battleship is a $200 million project which involves less than notable actors and even diverts to the level where it attempts to make a few extra bucks through the addition of a 'singer' into the cast. I watched this movie (surprisingly under the influence) for 40 minutes before (filled with resentment for Berg) turned it off by the power cord and found only two words to sum it up, ""fu#king sh#t"", a shallow plot, crap acting and possibly one of the most basic story lines in history left me attempting to figure out if this was a 'blockbuster' or a 'mockbuster'. The characters were not relate-able and complete clichés with even worst dialogue than the actors attempt to portray the character. I cannot find the words to offend Michael Berg for making such a horrid movie, he pretty much has offended himself for presenting something like this to the general public... Even the addition of David Spade to the production.. No even Kevin James would improve it the slightest bit. If I had to sum this movie up, I'd have to say a true zeitgeist for today's youth, the lack of appreciation for a good picture is by-far incredibly disappointing and how the next generation cares more about explosions than a well-polished storyline. In reality I wouldn't be surprised to see Berg's career up in flames and Kirch never finding a job again (possibly the worst movie to follow-up a starring role in after John Carter). Come on everyone... It's based off a board game, it was guaranteed to be anything but mediocre.",Battleship
680,hqpcrepair,Poorly done,1,19 April 2012,"!!!!Warning, you may find spoiler info in this review!!!! I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. It turns out this movie is a Transformers technology ripoff. The script is substandard and predictable as usual. You would think the aliens, coming from a world that has oceans would have far Superior technology for traversing the surface of the water, instead these machines hop and bumble around like they can't figure out where they are. The continuity needs a great deal of help and most of all, Liam Neeson or better yet, his script writers need to go through some Rank and Recognition training. A LCDR is not what Hopper's rank is in the end of the movie. His shoulder Boards reflect a Lieutenant. A LCDR has Two Gold Bars and One Gold Stripe. Message to Hollywood : If you wanna address military ranks do your homework first and stop hiring amateurs to do it for you. I'm surprised the Navy consultants didn't catch that, if they even used them at all. Not to mention Hopper is out of uniform without his undershirt on under his Dress Whites. I spent many years in the Navy and I'm sad to see this relaxed attitude for the Navy uniform REGS. Over all this movie is Very Disappointing.",Battleship
681,moagueus,An awful insult to film,1,10 February 2013,"SO it was mind numbingly bad. A dreadful, nonsensical train wreck. If you have seen it, maybe you can help me with this. I just have a few questions about this film:1) Okay, so the aliens come here from outer space, they bring five ships....Do they need to call home to ask to send more ships? Don't they have more ships? If they do, why do they have to phone home for them? Wouldn't not hearing from the five ships they sent be a good indication they needed to send more ships? If they don't have more ships, why call home? What good would that do? Why didn't they just send the ships to begin with, you know, hit us with overwhelming force? Don't they have more air power? They send these massive ocean ships, but only one flying saucer thing? What happened to the force shield that had the last destroyer trapped? How did they get so close to that island when they needed to in like three minutes when they said they were 120 miles away early in the movie? Was it a supersonic destroyer?2) With regard to the transmission array...If they were outside the force shield, why didn't any human jet planes from somewhere else help out to take out the communications array since it is the key to winning? Why not send something else? Motorcycles with soldiers? Special Forces on ATV's? Tarzan and a few apes? If they were inside the force shield, why didn't any human jet planes from pearl harbor help out? If all the aliens needed was three satellite dishes to call home to their planet, why didn't they just put three satellite dishes on every ship they sent? I mean, they had thousands of those bomb things, and dozens of those death ball things, couldn't they find room for three satellite dishes in the trunk or something?3) With regards to the transmission/communication ship that got ""broken up"" by the weather satellite...So the ship traveled millions of miles through space and was designed to enter the earth's atmosphere at thousands of miles per hour, but a collision with a weather satellite fatally damaged it? If it was headed for pearl harbor, why did the mass of a satellite 1/10000 of it's mass knock it so far out of its path to china? If phoning home to the alien planet was the key to victory, why didn't they use the force shield thing to protect the communication ship when it got close to earth? If phoning home was the key to victory, why didn't they just send two communication ships, or three? Why did it enter Earth's atmosphere at all? Couldn't it just remain in stationary orbit above Pearl Harbor and pass along messages, without subjecting it to danger on the surface? Did the aliens have all this technology but couldn't make a communications device good enough to send a transmission a few miles into space? Wouldn't you think every alien soldier would have a satellite phone good enough to do that. If the force shield worked like they said, why did they send anything but communication ships with force shields? Why not just do what I said above to phone home, why have a massive, yet exceedingly fragile ship that is the key to winning the whole deal? Why did any of the ships enter Earth's atmosphere? Why didn't they just launch death balls from space while orbiting earth? The Death Balls were pretty unstoppable. Why not put half their forces on the surface and the other half in space so if things started to go wrong, they could just split, or wait for more help to arrive from the home planet? What kind of missiles did the jets shoot at the end that vaporized the death balls? I have never seen any missiles like that. Those death balls were ten foot diameter super space metal balls that chewed through steel, concrete, whatever like it was nothing. Those were some pretty strong missiles. Were they magic missiles?",Battleship

684,lessesk,Definitely enjoyable and one for Sci-fi fans,8,22 April 2012,"I was not going to see Battleship after reading several official reviews. However I ended up seeing the film yesterday and I am glad I did. My true score is more of a 7.5 than 8.Battleship is never going to be a Sci-fi film rubbing shoulders with the greats but it never tried to be. Putting it into an analogy, it's like getting home on a Friday night shattered from work and you just feel like pizza. You go out and buy pizza and it tastes pretty damn good. Battleship for me is just like that. There is no point reviewing the film like a 3 course fine French cuisine when really its pizza on Friday night. That's exactly what I wanted and that is what I got, so I am pretty happy. NO SPOILERS The movie has the common storyline about aliens invading earth with a human story of love and trying to overcome an attitude problem. Pretty much exactly the same as 'Top Gun', except with Aliens.What I liked about this film which is different to most of the others. - The love story only took up 5 minutes at the beginning, with very few moments throughout, and it was funny. - Aliens didn't just land in the USA/Hawaii for no reason. There was a specific scientific reason. - There was a distinct global feel to the movie. The USA was partnered up with the Japanese and I spotted a British flag on a pilot's helmet. In fact there was plenty of tongue in cheek moments aimed at the Americans, which was funny but not demeaning. - Aliens showed a lot of intelligence and there was an effort to show their thought process and emotions for each other. You even get to see their viewpoint and some clips of them in their ships directing fire etc. What they did made sense and this actually made you connect with them more. - The aliens weren't impenetrable. Thank you Mr Director! I get so freaking bored at alien movies were the whole movie is about bringing down a generator so we can hit the mongrels. The aliens are much more advanced than us, but they take hits just like any mortal would. From a viewer perspective it was gratifying to see a destroyer wreak some havoc on ET's cousin. - There were plenty of funny moments without trying to be. A good sign of any movie is seeing the audience laugh at the same moments and there were plenty of those. Regarding the casting, Rhianna was fine for me and in fact, a little surprising, I didn't think she would pull of that type of acting. The lead actor who also starred in John Carter is one to watch. I find his acting to be quite authentic and he has a natural manner about him. I hope he continues to get roles as I can see a reasonable career ahead of him. Overall the movie is exactly what you see on the tin. It's a Sci-fi film that has some very cool looking aliens (The mech armour was amazing), stomp all over Hawaii and firing some creative weapons that tore up human ships but also getting their behind handed to them by some heavy artillery mounted on destroyers and a Battleship, adding to that is loads of cannons going off and explosions with some funny quips in between. Add AC/DC's Thunderstruck in the middle and you get yourself a very enjoyable fun Sci-fi. If you are looking for a Ridley Scott Sci-fi classic then this isn't it. However if you just feel like seeing a film that is an enjoyable explosive ride then this may surprise you. It's definitely one I will pick up on the BluRay to pump out very loud at home.

A - Fly B - Hop on the water (in one direction) like a cross between a water strider and a frogAnswer: B - Also staying true to their weapons system which only work line of sight.Q3: Once the alien destruction robots are launched to attack and weaken the human defense, do they A - Destroy 20 unarmed helicopters B - Ruin a field where kids are playing baseball C - Destroy the only remaining docked Battleship equipped with Harpoon and Tomahawk missiles D - Attack some concrete pillars holding up a section of a freewayAnswer: A,B,D - Who would ever think that the USS Missouri had a better chance of attacking the aliens as opposed to a freeway.Q4: Your a bad-ass alien who traveled ten's of light years to take over another planet, what do you bring as a personal weapon? A - A ray guy than can evaporate anything in sight B - Any other type of projectile weapon C - A knife that looks like a screwdriverAnswer: C - The only weakness being that it takes this weapon 20 seconds to warm up, giving a double leg amputee enough time to walk up to the armored alien kick-box it in the head and take off it's helmet.Q5: The humans have fired a tomahawk missile at your alien ship. What do you do? A - Try to shoot it down with your own weapons B - Try to maneuver your ship out of the way C - Have your alien ship hop directly into the missileAnswer: C - Oh yes that's right the alien ship is only equipped with grenades and it can only move in the direction it is facing. Q6: Your building an alien war ship that will be used to take over a planet. What material do you use to protect the bridge? A - A type of super strong metal B - GlassAnswer: B - Taking over a planet is not so easy when a few sniper rifle rounds breaches the hull on the bridge and kills the alien commander.

694,teshan87,"This is about a movie about an invasion of alien war ships in the world and how the US Navy eliminate that with their war power, teamwork and imagination",10,1 May 2012,This movie is one of the best I have watched so far in English war scenic movies. Apart from others this is about an alien invasion which we have seen in many more movies. But the specialty is the way those soldiers alleviate the threat to the world with gigantic team work. The way they think about the situation is nice. And also a solution. Especially the way they used the tsunami warning objects to understand the alien warship movement in the sea. The plan on using the old warship with its retired navy members too is a nice concept. It is one inspirational movie that everybody must watch. In that sense I rate this the maximum that a movie can obtain. I recommend everyone to watch this movie before it leaves your nearby theater.,Battleship

Being a Naval Petty Officer has taught me a few things:1. A lieutenant is not going to take charge of a naval vessel once the CO and XO are killed.2. A member of a foreign military would not be authorized to take command of a US Naval vessel.3. The Mighty Mo has been de-militarized and would be incapable of firing a single round from the light machine guns on deck, much less the gun batteries that are filled with concrete. 4. Being that the Mighty Mo is a de-milled vessel, ammunition for said de-milled deck guns and gun batteries would not be on board. Kind of ironic they made such a big deal about moving a single round from the aft battery to the forward battery...5. Admiral Liam Neeson, I am assuming, failed in his attempt to breach the alien force field under the water's surface since we didn't see any submarines in this entire film. For all the hype the youtube videos made of the cast and crew spending time on naval vessels...I think they mistook the Disney cruise for the RIMPAC cruise they were scheduled for...severely disappointed.

They have 2 weapons, a canister than explodes and some sort of spinning destruction ball, which actually is effective.They tried an independence day blow up the base scene but ended up just destroying 20 helicopters, a baseball field and a few pillows under a motorway. They meant business it seems.Liam N is a bit part in the middle and end, thats it. Rhianna does her job, nothing more or less.An army of war ships end up being split off from 3 smaller support ships, which is reduced to one within 15minutes of the film whilst the others wait outside some forcefield. Then they let all hell break lose for 40seconds at the end.Then there's the fact americas latest and greatest destroyers, which are a lot better than battleships in says in the film, all get blown to pieces withing seconds, yet a 50year old 'battleship' saves the day with darylea sponsored attack on the 'mothership'.Basically no real consistency.

699,christopher-lewis-518-782454,OK action film,5,16 October 2013,"I've seen this film twice now and on both occasions I have been left with a feeling of slight disappointment. Whilst the film is a good action film and ticks all the boxes required for that there are a few points that let it down. Firstly the mistakes they make in the filming and continuity are appalling and even I know that a battleship of that size can't be started in a few minutes with a skeleton crew. Secondly what job does Rihanna do on that ship? First she's working the fire control console and then she's manning a gun then she's working the radar, then she's back at the fire console again very very strange if you ask me. It seems like the scrip writers are aware of the money they have paid her and so want to use her in every shot possible (and when the acting is not the best it spoiled the film for me a bit). Thirdly and as some other people have already stating in their reviews there is a bit too much back slapping, aren't we great America, high fiving,fist pumping for my liking. Especially the speech made by Hopper when they bring in the veterans (I am all for thanking veterans, people who fought for our country and others around the world risking their lives, but this films seems to cheapen the thanks we should be giving to the ex-forces.) Fourth point is that the drop out kid who should be in prison for B&E is suddenly 3rd in command of a naval vessel. I am not a military man but surely someone with a criminal record and, as we were already told a propensity for violence, would not be hired by the navy and then rapidly promote such a man!",Battleship

Independence Day, Howard The Duck, Predator, War of the Worlds, etc. If you haven't seen it, but still want to, just remember to pick them out! I had time to kill, so I watched it. I guess that justified it to me, but I would have been upset to have sat through this in a theater.

If you like action movies or ""guy flicks"" instead of ""chick flicks"" then this is the place to be. My wife makes my family watch so many romantic/marriage/dating movies, so this movie was a very welcome relief. This movie would have been perfect if it wasn't for the language. Every time a character cursed, my eight year old daughter kept asking, ""Daddy, what does that mean?"" Having worked in the military, of course I was exposed to tension and profanity. I was happy to see that when the admiral was under stress, he did not curse but just hung up the phone, instead of unleashing an explosion of profanity. It is a very weak argument to say that profanity makes the movie more realistic. Other military movies, ""War games,"" and ""The Final Countdown"" would have been better without it. Indeed, ""The Final Countdown"" was put on television in the 1980's and the profanity was edited out. It was much better that way. So, add a star if you don't mind the language.",Battleship

It's not hat I expected anything from a game-based movie, but people, there is a thing called script. I really enjoyed played said game when I was a youngster, though I distinctly remember no aliens-might be just me, of course. Previous critics have mentioned every flaw of the movie, but let me chip in my highlights. A. Laughable ""direction"", if any. B. inexcusable ""acting""' again, if any. This poor leading guy, kitsch or whatever he is called, could probably do something else. Anything else, really. Unacceptable though from guys like Neeson or Skarsgaard, who can definitely act. Now, the positive points. Rihanna, though not an actress and with no script, has a presence, has a twinkle in the eye that's entertaining. Ms Decker on the other hand, is a movie by herself, simply breathtaking. Obviously, that doesn't make her an actress, but still... Triple A to the CGI crew, it's really a pity such magnificent effort gone to hell because of all the other grievances of the film. So, 2 stars, being very very generous here.",Battleship
704,dangerpigart,Possibly the worst pile of crap ever made.,1,10 October 2013,"The movie opens with two brothers in a bar, one wants to impress a girl who happens to be an admiral's daughter, commits several felons to do so. Instead of being in jail he is free, although he is tazed twice by cops in the process and resists arrest. Somehow he becomes an officer in the navy with felons and no college education in a very short amount of time. He is getting booted out of the Navy after war game exercises due to fighting with a Japanese rival he later becomes best buds with. During the exercise aliens land and decimate the naval fleet. Only one or two ships are left and somehow defeat the armada under the command of the felon officer and his Japanese rival. This move is total crap. The officer who is a Lt. somehow gains command when two superior officers die. The movie has no sense of the command order in the Navy and realism in the sense that a felon with no college education wouldn't become a Lt. in the Navy in a short amount of time or at all. The movie is packed with inaccuracies. An alien in it's armor can punch a 100+ pound door off it's hinges, throw a human 20 feet with ease, which would obviously kill them, and resist any bullet fire. Yet the people get beat around by the alien in the armor then get up and walk after being slammed into metal walls. Just a pathetic excuse to have tons of explosions and CG action scenes. This is possibly the worst movie ever made in history. I wish I had more then 1000 words available to describe just how crappy this slopfest of a movie is. Do yourself a favor and watch something that isn't utter garbage. Seriously trash here. I wish there were negative stars for this movie. Maybe the mildly retarded would enjoy it if all the excessive explosions and overly loud soundtrack didn't cause seizures. Whoever gave the morons 200 million to make this should give me that money.

706,simononeill-1,Battleship is easily the best stupid movie I've seen since Armageddon,10,10 November 2012,"Battleship is easily the best stupid movie I've seen since Armageddon - it is infinitely better than every Transformers movie ever regurgitated onto the screen (apart from the Cartoon Transformers one from the 80's).Battleship it is the romantic story of how a 26 year old former high school jock John Carter, with no qualifications or experience, ends up in charge of a giant battleship because Eric from True Blood is his brother & he runs a battleship.High School Jock John Carter and has to destroy an alien invasion in order to impress Naval Commander Liam Neeson so he can marry his really hot daughter that wore that yellow bikini in Just Go With It - he does this by letting Japanese people do everything for him. They use a grid showing the surrounding floating Tsunami alert devices (because the aliens disabled the radar you see) to actually play the game 'battleships' and blow up the aliens using complete guess work & then they ask Old retired war veteran people to borrow their museum battleship & help them blow up Hawaii after they broke all their own battleships while playing battleships with the aliens earlier on - and then at the end he takes the credit for it all, gets a medal & goes for a Chicken Burrito with Liam Neeson. Despite the fact he knows nothing of the man, Liam Neeson agrees to let him marry his really hot daughter as thanks for letting the Japanese & the old people save the world while he stood around and watched.Rhianna is in it too - but don't let that stop you watching the movie as she is like a hot version of Vasquez from Aliens - and to the movies great credit, but also to my great disappointment, at no point does the movie allude to the fact that Rhianna has breasts. Amazing Wonderous Breasts.

It was exactly the movie I had wanted to see.Back in 1977 I saw the billboards for Star Wars and we were living in Los Angeles area at the time. We went to the drive-in premiere of the movie and were blown away. Both of these movies are campy, but who cares? Hearing a space battle comes to mind in Star Wars. Many types of Hollywood reality changing blunders happen in this movie too. I won't mention them because that would be cheating and not necessary, they are easy enough to spot.I don't care if they leave the science in the fantasy pool, I still enjoyed the movie. Movies should be fun, this was FUN. Many story lines also make the story interesting, as do the special effects and a little romance.

708,Sevenixx,This movie isn't what it pretends to be! See beneath the Macho clichés and you will find an awesome movie.,7,5 August 2012,"I saw the trailers for the movie and expected another Transformers, SFX for all your money. When I started watching the movie though I noticed something wasn't just right. Why don't the aliens to more Bad things? We are supposed to hate them, they are here to take over our world, Right?Nope. And this is where this movie actually Shines, and the reason it gets so many bad reviews is that people miss out on 2 very important facts.Aliens are the Good Guys Humans are the Bad Guys. The movie just makes quite a good job with camouflaging this in regular Blockbuster Cheesiness. The movie is a direct documentation about how hellish and pointless war is.1.Humans in the movie are very aggressive and dumb. Our Main hero is a guy who should never have been put in command of anything! And here he gets to greet our first ever contact with aliens, using Guns, Cruise Missiles and Torpedoes!2. Aliens never want to hurt anyone. The Aliens Are Passive, Never firing unless first fired upon. The point is made extra clear with the scene where a DeathBall stops in front of a child, re-planning its route in order to destroy the highway without harming the child. How Much Clearer Can It Get?3. Aliens have no Military Grade Weapons. This is another point where people seem to watch this movie expecting the regular Blockbuster, and then hate this movie because it isn't! The Aliens didn't expect a war so they didn't Bring Weapons!The Satchel-Bombs they fire of their ships are actually terrible as weapons, the only reason they work at all is because we humans have such slow ships. This is probably because these bombs aren't designed for any sort of ship to ship battle, but rather for clearing up debris. And what we see on a personal level is an engineering tool the aliens seems to use a lot more for setting up their generators than to actually fight with.This is NOT your classic race of Evil Aliens equipped with Independence-Day Lasers, or Corrosive ""Aliens"" Blood! This is a peaceful advanced race, which came here not expecting to fight, but to talk.Once you realize this the movie starts making sense. what our ""hero"" does is in fact to constantly seek out conflict. Doing everything he can in order to destroy these Aliens, all because of some miscommunication and stupid decisions. If this movie teaches anything, It would definitely be that when the time comes for humans to face another, alien race. Make sure the ones we send to greet them aren't Military.So Basically what the movie is Really about is about a peaceful race of aliens who receive a message from an apparently peaceful race. We then greet them by firing upon them, trying to kill them even if they aren't even firing at us. So when they realize their mistakes we do our best trying to prevent them from sending a ""Its a trap, humans are evil"" message.Regular blockbuster movies often manage to build up a mountain of evil actions on the aliens account, making the ""Heroes"" fight justified and true.Battleship doesn't do that, It puts the regular Blockbuster Patriotism into a setting where it becomes totally destructive, not only preventing the Aliens and Humans to communicate, but also started a war that have already seen thousands of casualties, and may see millions more before its over.I rate the movie 7 out of 10. Its a really fresh take on the whole Evil Alien Invasion theme.",Battleship

The movie starts predictably and only goes downhill from there. Honestly, I sort of wish I didn't know it was based on the game. Once you know that and see those flying pegs and the search in a 'grid pattern' it becomes comically stupid.Also bad: The 'soccer' game near the beginning was sad and predictable.Unforgivable: The love interest's father is 'the big boss' in charge of the naval fleet. Some of the goofy ""fun"" nature of this movie seems like it is from a script from the 1980s instead of the 2000s. ""Watch the rag-tag group of heroes come together"" vibe.Also bad: The music selection is a total bro-frat-party vibe. That's not a good thing. I'm pretty sure most of the most of the tunes played in the pivotal moments are from the 1980s. Just examine some of the songs and artists on this soundtrack: Blue Sued Shoes, Hard as a Rock (AC/DC), ZZ Top, Billy Squier and the song in every military movie - Fortunate Son by Creedence Clearwater Revival.The good: There is still some good in this movie. Rhianna did a decent job in her acting debut. Also, Gregory Gadson (Lt Mick) was great. Every scene with him was pretty solid. Doesn't hurt that he has actual military experience.Also good: The scene of the convenience store break in was pretty on point reproduction of a real life event that had me legit laughing.Finally, the better than good: The SFX and VFX in this movie are genuinely superb. Even watching this movie years later, most of the video effects and CGI hold up amazingly well. The alien ships look like mechanical waterbugs. It's actually pretty cool. The armor they have for the aliens is also pretty amazing looking. The transitions between CGI and actual effects are done smoothly. The missiles and other weapons have nice sound and visual fx.
Skip this movie: Just re-watch flicks from the 1980s. Watch Top Gun or something. Top Gun you get volleyball instead of soccer. You get decent acting and a better plot. And the soundtrack is year-appropriate (except perhaps the Everly Brothers schtick).",Battleship

The love interest is stupid and unnecessary, but who's ever heard of this type of film without a love interest. I'm guessing the NY stock exchange would crash if there were no love interest. We, the audience, being stupid and all, need to be aware that the Hero is fighting not only for sheer survival but also for the hot blonde waiting on the island (who is also, in her own blond way, contributing to the humanity's fight for survival). God, just typing this makes me wanna puke.On the other hand, I really liked each and every action scene. I know, it's packed with CGI but it's interesting, dynamic, and has a nice flow to it. Yeah, it's no Friday Night Lights, but after five days at the office, this is just the thing I needed to unwind. :) Btw, Rihanna... I don't know what she had to do to be made part of this film.

Liam Neeson also has a twinkle as the Admiral and father of Hopper's girlfriend. Rihanna is not terrible as a sailor with attitude and the other actors seem to be having fun blowing stuff up.It is definitely Transformers/Independence Day at sea but when the film is made well, that's no bad thing. It doesn't have the misogynism of Michael Bay/Transformers and it is way less jingoistic than Independence Day which can feel slightly uncomfortable if you're not American. All in all, it is definitely a guilty pleasure.

The movie leaves you will some feel-good emotions on how people, when united in saving human existence, can be stronger, and can defeat enemies. Something us humans are missing at the moment.

This film is so awesome so just sit back and enjoy I say. Great CGI for 2012 and as said above it doesn't fall for the trap of plot or character development it is just balls out action with AC/DC cranking loud and the aliens are freaky cool and Rhianna is awesome and the ship scenes are awesome too. 9/10",Battleship
722,LittlePike,Battleship review - poor storyline,6,12 April 2012,"Battleship has very good special effects and a lot of action. If this is what a person requires than he needs to see this movie. However, it cannot be compared to the classic movie called the independence day because the storyline is very weak. I do not want to release any spoilers but Keep in mind that a few years ago the Chinese have destroyed a satellite in orbit around the earth. If the Chinese can do it then so can Americans. Due to this fact the whole battleship movie is pointless. Another factor that I do not like is that the movie hints that the invading aliens are total idiots i.e. apparently they cannot see a warship in front of their eyes. I might have been persuaded by the events taking place on some stealth nuclear submarine trying to evade and fight the aliens under the ocean but that is not in the movie. Therefore all I can say is that Battleship is a very expensive Hollywood project designed to make money out of ignorant people. I give 6 for the very impressive special effects.",Battleship

725,arturzinatullin,"Seriously, guys?",2,11 November 2019,"Cinematographically totally solid Hollywood movie.
Special effects and nature views and lots of sooting and KABOOM!!! Some love story for the background and a main character being charismatic misfit.Actors and playing? Well, the band is not a first row stars here. They play quite ok, except some of them do not look like physically fit into the role. Especially that Rihanna girl who is ridiculously small to be a boarding party or whatever navy action team member.Now the sad part.
The plot itself is a standard. Alien scout team relies on local resources to send a message home (really?). Valiant US Navy group cut off under alien bell glass. So far so good.
As usual for Hollywood movie the tactics and arms use are... suboptimal. But everyone is demonstrating exceptional valor in the face of the enemy.The further if gets the more questions arise. But don't worry not these sailors are completely incompetent idiots, the movie writers are.
For the moment we get to the battleship part, to the eponymous hero, the authors lose last grip to the logic.Battleship doing bootlegger turn? RLY?! Turn the guns to the left, alien guys won't see us as a threat. RLY?!
Some nursing home residents carrying ""500 pound"" main caliber shell on their shoulders through the ship narrow passages? Never mind the thing weighs between 2200 and 2700 pounds depending on the type.
That is far beyond ""artistic hyperbole"". This is plain BS.All in all, despite cinematographically it is quite solid, the movie is 131 minutes of wasted time. You have some spare time for netflix and chill? Choose something else.",Battleship

The directing is so awful that most of the time you don't know what the movie is trying to say. Acting is lousy, partly due to the ridiculous dialogue. Taylor Kitsch should quit acting because clearly he doesn't know how to act. He can do a better job to be a waiter in a restaurant. Other actors are not much better. Most of the time, I don't even know what they are doing. I think it might be because of the poor written script and bad bad directing!! Not even to mention the pre-school level special effects.

I'm not sure whether the hilarity is deliberate or accidental, but either way, I recommend this flick for a boring afternoon, or perhaps the week after Final Exams. I have to give credit to the previous reviewer about the virtual cameo by Liam Neeson. Personally a little disappointed in the lack of Science from the Sci-fi angle.

I knew NOTHING about the movie in advance and had read no reviews in advance either. My kids knew nothing, either, other than that it was a take on the Hasbro game and that Rihanna was in it. In fact, Rihanna's presence was the ONLY reason my kids went to see it. Not having any advance clue of what to expect, I went in with zero expectations whatsoever. I can honestly say...I liked it! A lot! My kids LOVED it. Now, I am the type of person who used to go to the movies a lot but ""life"" kind of gets in the way of spending time at the movies anymore so any time I go, it's a treat. I go to the movies to be entertained. I don't go to be educated, I don't go to epic movies, documentaries, I like just entertainment. Comedies rank highest with me (think: Bridesmaids) and action movies, too (i.e. ConAir--my fav action movie ever). Battleship has a few comic lines and IMHO a lot of action. How other posters can say they were ""bored"" is beyond me. Yes, there are many, many holes in the movie--most notably, how a complete slacker can go from breaking and entering (can't really say he ""robbed"" the store since he DID put down the $ for the chicken burrito...) to being an officer is ludicrous but, again, I didn't go to the movie to learn about rank progression in the Navy.

Someday in the not too distant future (I hope!) enterprising movie companies will make movies of these greatest sea battles of modern history: (1) the Battle of Jutland in 1916, in which 150 British battleships and battle-cruisers and cruisers shot it out with 100 German battleships and battle-cruisers and cruisers at short range for the better part of a day and night; (2) a modern remake of the 1960s classic ""Sink the Bismark"", a battle that took place in 1940; and (3) the battles of Surigao Strait and Leyte Gulf in 1944, which consisted of several fierce brawls between Japanese battleships, cruisers and destroyers, with American battleships, cruisers, destroyers and PT boats.

It seems most people are very opinionated and can't enjoy a movie for what it is, these days, if it's not a marvel movie or have the right stars in it, it's not likely to get a passing grade.This movie is entertaining, something worth watching, especially if you have it on in the background while doing mundane tasks/chores. Without adding too many spoilers, I love what they did with the USS Missouri. Take it for what it's worth, not perfectly accurate, but an interesting take on a hypothetical science-fiction alien invasion.

Ripley was a badass - Vasquez from Aliens was a bad-ass. Rianna is a freakin joke. You want to make an alien movie then you better have some bad-ass characters - this had none. This was straight crap. And it wasn't a satire - they tried to make a serious alien picture - even the aliens weren't cool.

I've read a few reviews of people here and I'm frankly stunned at how harshly people criticize this movie. It's NOTHING LIKE TRANSFORMERS AT ALL! Yes there were personality traits about the lead character that were annoying and frankly un-becoming of a military officer. But, that is the point of his disposition prior to engagement folks! Get real!Most people who have NEVER had any experience in the Military probably think all the crud is weeded out prior to actual duty - but that is by no means true. In fact, the Officer ranks are where you find it the most in the real ""war"". That's why all the political correctness garbage actually gets implemented! Anyway - The move is based on some very unrealistic sci-fi, you know, kind of like a guy with a super-powered electro-magnet in his chest powering a super-human suit and keeping shrapnel from moving into his heart. The movie is entertaining, realistic LOOKING due to the incredible special effects, and at the end I literally jumped out of my seat at the theatre and shouted ""YEEEEESSSSSSS"".I came away feeling much like I did after seeing TOP GUN about 6 months prior to basic training for the USAF. It will give you a good feeling about the US Navy, the heart of Americans when faced with impossible situations, and it's fun.OH - and it's CLEAN! That is probably another reason the critics and others are so harsh on it. You can take your 8-13 year old and not worry about gratuitous sex scenes, unnecessary camera angles on female anatomy, and bedroom scenes or locker-room scenes. All of which are totally unnecessary unless you are trying to appeal to perverts who go to the movies to see something other than bad guys getting blown up by awesome, Realistic military hardware.This movie is a must see for patriots and military fans alike.

Glares, smokes and fast moving objects - those are not used to display aggressiveness and agility - they are there to reduce the level of detail displayed.Also the inconsistency with the real life was just amazing. The way the characters acted - i am actually amazed how inaccurate they managed to make it. Most people wouldn't be able to make it so dreamland even if they purposely tried - and that speaks something of itself.Throw together a bunch of clichés and multi-million dollar special effects and you get a perfect PG-13 summer let's-make-a-buck movie.

But I wasn't sitting there analyzing everything or biting at the bit to impress readers here with my remarkable intellect by bashing the movie in every way possible - if I was that smart I'd make my own movie.

In the Hawaiian Islands, an international naval fleet at Pearl Harbor engages in a dynamic and intense battle against an alien species known as ""The Regents"". The aliens come to planet Earth on a mission to build a power source in the ocean. Upon their visit, they come in contact with the naval fleet.The story-line is nothing new but how it played out was great and a joy to behold! It shows both sides of the story, not just the Humans but the Aliens' point of view too, this is what was quite unique about it and makes it different to all the other crappy action films out there e.g Transformers 2 and 3. There are a few clichés in there but it didn't really bother me as I wasn't expecting it to be so original. The plot, in the end, as you all should be able to tell is quite predictable overall but did have some nice surprises.The acting all around was great. Taylor Kitsch was good, I've heard about him before but I've never actually seen any of his movies but he was good in this one. Liam Neeson, for the parts he was in, was fantastic as he always is. Rihanna wasn't as bad as I thought she was going to be and considering this is her first movie I think she did OK. I mean, she was watchable, I guess.Peter Berg did a fantastic job directing this movie, he used a wide range of camera angles to show us everything that was going on. The sound fx and design was astounding and the soundtrack by Steve Jablonsky was superb too. All in all I think that Battleship isn't as original as a film like Inception but it's still a great summer blockbuster and it's definitely worth watching on the big screen. 7.5/10",Battleship
750,Eric H Bowen,Real-Life Missouri Sailor Here,6,25 September 2020,"I served three years aboard the battleship Missouri in the 1980s, so I was kindly disposed to the movie ""Battleship"" from the beginning. And I did enjoy it, for the most part, but there were two gaping plot holes which I simply could not overlook.They weren't technical in nature, although I know from experience that it took the better part of a full year to bring USS Missouri from mothballs back to combat readiness. That said, we left the ship in excellent condition and I'm willing to grant the filmmakers their premise that with the full resources of the Pearl Harbor base and shipyard mobilized that they could have the ship ready to steam and fight after a long night of round-the-clock work. I'm even willing to grant the premise that, in a base as large and rambling as Pearl, that sufficient suitable ammunition which had escaped disposal as obsolete could be found for at least a modest combat loadout.What I can't grant, however, is the premise that command of arguably the most prestigious and historic surviving naval vessel in U.S. history would be handed over to a junior lieutenant...regardless of how well he had performed the day before! With all the captains and admirals ""on the beach"" in Hawaii, both active and retired? No chance. I could see him being given a slot as, say, acting Weapons Officer based upon his success against the alien enemy the previous day, but not command.And yet, and yet...from a cinematic standpoint I can see the filmmakers wanting to continue with characters which we have grown to know in the first and second act of the film. But where I completely lost it was when I saw the scene of the 16"" shell being hand-carried (!) from a damaged Turret 3's magazine to a forward turret which was out of ammunition. If the filmmakers had bothered to do fifteen minutes worth of research with an actual sailor they would have learned that on Broadway (the third deck fore and aft passage through the engineering spaces) there is an overhead monorail and trolley with a chain hoist which was designed and built SPECIFICALLY for that task! Using and filming it would have been just as cinematic and just as dramatic, and would have had the added bonus of being accurate and true to life.I like the movie still, but no more than 6/10.",Battleship

752,vegetaurus-1,Anti-hero storyline/arc never overcomes his own flaws_Major oversight,5,29 November 2014,"★(very minor spoilers)Battleship is a 2012 American military science fiction war film loosely inspired by the classic board game. The film was directed by Peter Berg and released by Universal Pictures.There's an arc with an anti-hero; a character who's a ne'er-do-well who become the hero—overcoming his own flaws and shortcomings to do so-- someone didn't explain the concept of the arc in this film however, and therefore the standard formulaic pattern isn't followed which leaves the watcher wondering why.Lt. Alex Hopper (Taylor Kitsch) starts as the charming/affable/(hopeless romantic?) character and then is pressed into serving/service (the Navy) by his straight arrow older brother Stone (Alexander Skarsgård)—and yet somehow --still in the 1st act-- loses his way (again) and appears to be letting us down again.Then as in many of these films; adversity strikes and so everyone, let alone our hero, has to step up and 'test their mettle' As he deals with major trauma and the mantle of responsibility coming his way; he at 1st acts impulsively and continues on an attack path that has already been shown to the audience, let alone the characters, to end in disaster/death for the crew. He's pulled back from that brink by a crewman. So that's not leadership; he was just being a headstrong male. It's not till later when he listens/reconciles with his former enemy (Captain Nagata) that a plan starts to shape.And herein lies the other issue. The plan/the great idea is not his! It's the former enemy's; yes our protagonist follows it; but his 1st instinct was to be rash, not follow a clever plan-like solution. So as they now all work together yes the victory is theirs and the dénouement a good one, but not due to the protagonist's ways and not worthy of the turn around and awards at ending of film that are de rigueur. A ceremony is held to honor the Navy personnel, where Alex is promoted to lieutenant commander. He is presented with a Silver Star—again, his own actions were still brash (and there's even a scene of him crying/ feeling sorry for himself hiding in a ship bathroom) and it's hard to see where he earns *Silver Star* status in the arc of the film. If anything he should have shared the glory with his Japanese counterpart (Captain Nagata) with whom he ended up forming a bond and listening to his ideas.Instead of showing his development and maturation, they use him like (they did Paul Walker IMO); super handsome shots; various shots of him looking thoughtful, proud, smiling and just beauty shots really what is he a woman?They spend so much time on montage shots of him looking good (and *really* concentrating while looking good); and very little on the storyline of him overcoming his own worst enemy status that they themselves initiated. In addition there's a direct rip-off (copy/ homage?) to ""Independence Day"" for no discernible reason when one of the aliens establishes a mind meld with Hopper, showing him how the aliens have attacked and conquered other planets. This is never mentioned or referred to again & certainly seems therefore superfluous/unnecessary.The best part of the film was the large number of real military personnel used as extras and especially casting double amputee U.S. Army Colonel Gregory Gadson, who had never acted before, & plays LTC Mick Canales. He was cast after Berg saw a picture of him in the National Geographic Magazine. He is quite arresting in his 1st screen appearance and is a very worthy addition to film.Rotten Tomatoes site's consensus reads: ""It may offer energetic escapism for less demanding film-goers, but Battleship is too loud, poorly written, and formulaic to justify its expense -- and a lot less fun than its source material.""But as I've said they actually veered from the formulaic—which was nonsensical. If you want the character to grow up and *earn* the accolades at the end, great; but you do have to actually show us that arc.Some of the special effects are great, and mind you I don't mind looking at really good looking people (fighting aliens), but there was a disconnect with the main character's storyline and development that can't be overlooked.",Battleship

The unlikely but obvious hero marries the beautiful princess, the elderly retirees get their second chance at being heroes, the handicapped soldier also gets a second chance at being a hero and the Japanese marine helps the USA save the world from an alien invasion.

There are some plot holes about alien intentions and behavior, but that makes you even more interested in the whole movie.

755,celal_bilen,Another Hasbro classic turned into action packed sci-fi,7,15 April 2012,"Growing up as a huge Transformers fan, this movie has grabbed my attention particularly because it was a movie adaptation of another Hasbro classic game (with the same name). These two have always been my favorites, with Transformers having the sci-fi story and battleship for its strategical mind games. Therefore I wasted no time in going to see the highly anticipated ""Battleship"".Frankly speaking, before going to the cinema I had serious doubts about the cast. Liam Neeson is without a doubt a terrific actor, but my concerns were about Kitsch and especially Rihanna. I disliked Kitsch's performance as Gambit in X-Men Origins: Wolverine (which to me and all hardcore fans was the most disloyal movie adaptation ever) but my main worry was Rihanna being cast (wait a second, as a soldier?). I was also surprised to see Neeson's character being thrown into the background, which we are not used to a lot. Starting in a comedy-romance tone, the plot then hits the audience with sci-fi in the first half and then jumps right into action in the second half. All action scenes were awesome, and being a huge fan of the Transformers trilogy (especially as a hardcore fan of the first one), the action scenes here are as good as Bay's franchise. I think Peter Berg did a pretty good directorial job (although I disliked Hancock, which was extremely overrated) in handling the huge budget, but Kitsch's performance was dull and far from satisfactory. You may not want an Oscar-type performance in an action movie, but it seemed as if he was forced to speak his lines. As an anti-Rihanna fan, I was really surprised by her acting, I think she did better than Kitsch in many ways. Skarsgård played his responsible brother duties very well, but Brooklyn Decker couldn't go beyond the cliché ""chick"" role. A surprise was Asano, who was incredible in supporting Kitsch; and Gadson, who played the veteran heart-broken soldier extremely well. There are two kinds of movies, those that you see for the quality and those who you go and see just for fun. This movie does not disappoint you in terms of entertainment - it's a 2 hour action-packed sci-fi flick which would satisfy most fans of the original game. Yet, taking the first Transformers movie as a reference, it is far from matching the expectations from such a huge budget. I am a bit hesitant whether to give it a 7 or a 6 (the perfect score would be a 6.5, which is quite good for the genre), so I round it up and give it a 7.",Battleship
756,hahn_merx,Navy goes to war with actually realistic aliens,9,17 April 2012,"I simply loved it.I love watching movies and being surprised. So before I head of into the theaters, I don't come here, check ratings and comments, etc. I see it for my self. I don't usually read plots, either. So going into the theater, I had no idea what to expect. Except maybe that Rihanna starred in it.I enjoyed Battleship a lot, one of many reasons is because of the really amazing effects. Next is the cast, I found each actor very suited for each character. Next is the story line. It isn't one of those usual plots where the lead would have his ship, destroy the aliens, the end. Here in this movie, it's actually thrilling. The part where they used the old battleship at the end was brilliant.To top it of, I simply didn't really find anything so cliché about this movie. I guess that's why I enjoyed it. It's twists, etc.I also liked the fact the aliens weren't the usual overly alien-ish type. They were actually pretty believable.The way they introduced why the movie's called ""Battleship"" was smart, too. Like I said, entering the theater, I didn't know what to expect. I didn't know that it was based on the game, I thought it was just because of the ships. Quite clever if you ask me.One thing I didn't get though is why wouldn't they attack humans who are right in front of me? Did I miss something?",Battleship

This movie has one of the best CGI i have seen so far! I can confidently say, best action movie of this year... maybe until ""Avengers"" arrives. Don't pay attention to other bad reviews, seriously. This is an action movie, don't expect Oscar winning performances or amazing storyline. Yes, the movie is cheesy but i expected it, most action movies are made with cheesy dialogues. I went to see it because i wanted to be blown away by the action scenes, not the dialogs!Months ago, I went CRAZY when i watched the trailers. A few days ago, reading the bad reviews really lowered my expectation. I decided not to waste my money on this. Yesterday two of my friends, who are not big fans of action movies, told me that this movie is OK, not a disaster! So i thought, ""what the heck, let's give it a shot."" Today i watched this movie and it TOTALLY made my day! While watching this movie i was actually waiting for bad parts. Surprisingly, i was entertained the whole time! Especially the action scenes made me go, ""Oh My God! Damn! Holy S***!"" You have to watch it to believe it... trust me, it's THAT Awesome! This movie doesn't have Megan fox but Brooklyn Decker is no less hotter! I expected bad acting from Rihanna but surprisingly she was OK! This is my first movie review. When i saw the bad reviews, i couldn't wait to write a good one, this movie deserves it! If you are an action movie fan and you are wondering whether you should watch this movie or not, then I strongly recommend that you do. I hope you'll enjoy it as much as i did. Cheers!",Battleship
760,JosephLCooke,A keeper. Best film of 2012,10,20 May 2012,"Battleship, so far, is the best movie of 2012. Action for 2 hrs. The choice of Liam Neeson is very easy to second guess and he didn't have anything like a haircut an admiral would have. Adding the Japanese captain was a good touch to the movie. The audio was excellent and the director is one of the few who realizes that because its loud doesn't make it good. One nit: too much blue tint effect and not enough full color. Nit 2: Why didn't the light bird have a CIB on his uniform? Fights, gunfire, explosions, and the ultra hot chick (who has all the right moves in 3 sequences) Brooklyn Decker (you'll want to Google Images that name right now). And, there wasn't a dry eye in the house during the scene when Missouri's crew was assembled. Battleship; go see it.",Battleship
761,White-Leigh,Why are people not seeing this for what it is.,10,20 May 2012,"People are giving this movie misrepresentation. AGAIN. This movie is about a board game based on Naval strategy and it just happens that the opponent is aliens. Loved the science, the strategy, and the men of our military that helped demonstrate how difficult an older battleship was to operate. Not to forget the veterans themselves. I think Peter Berg did a decent job with the story given to him. I can only imagine the filming was difficult. The cheesy lines were appropriate because the game was what was important. I can say from personal experience; my grandfather said some really cheesy lines when he spoke of the Navy and the war. Personally, I'll put on my Navy tee and go see it again.",Battleship

The movie surpassed my expectation by 10 times. If you are a real man, you gotta love this movie, just like a real man would love a Custom 1911 with pearl grips. If you like movies with two guys kissing and drive a Volvo, then you would nt like it. If you were a woman, I would not expect you to like it at all but if you did then you would be my kind of woman. I can't believe people who go to a movie like this and say things like the love relation between the main stars was not believable enough or something crazy like that.

Doing that it was a fun time with my wife, however as a Science Fiction writer myself I still cringed more than I every want to admit.What I will say in critic is something that Asimov and Clarke both agreed upon.

764,smillr,Just plain embarrassing!!,1,4 March 2013,"Peter Berg's got to be the worst Dir. in recent history But actually there's more crap flowing out of Hollywood now more than ever.

Don't waste your time... I can't believe you have to put 10 lines of text down in order to get a review posted. There is not three words worth writing about this movie let alone three lines. So I will just have to go on talking how crappy it is. The acting is bad, the writing is incredibly bad, the storyline is so absolutely ridiculous!! I can't believe the Navy actually signed on to do this movie. The best part of the movie is the end, now you don't have to watch anymore... Finally I think I can now submit this review for the worst movie ever made!!!",Battleship
765,mcneil039,'Bayhem' of a different kind...,7,11 April 2012,"Although alien invasion is a theme that has been featured in many examples over recent years, the 'benchmark' set for Battleship has always been Transformers. The very fact that Universal and Hasbro somehow think it's a good idea to spend $200 million on a board-game and then turn it into a completely irrelevant alien invasion SFX extravaganza shows you that they want this to replicate Transformer franchise's style and success.The resemblance is quite striking to basically anyone who has seen a TF film. The story is a pretty standard one (means its perfectly alright). We have this protagonist who has plenty of talent and raw skills (emphasizing the word 'raw'), a little personality issue which will be solved later on, and he happen to be madly in love with a woman who is played by a supermodel (luckily she's better - or less crap - than Rosie HW) and whose character's dad is his superior and happen to dislike him. You'll also see a lot of Rihanna, even though her character has no importance whatsoever to the central plot. You can tell Rihanna's 'starpower' gives her a lot more screen time than her role deserves, but I have to say her performance isn't at all bad, at least it was way above my expectations.I'm not interested in explaining the plot in detail, however I do want to comment on Peter Berg's direction, which is very well done. Perhaps As others have pointed out, Kirsch is much better in this than in John Carter, and other major members of the cast have pretty much all delivered at least what was expected of them. Who knows, maybe Peter Berg also deserves credit for Rihanna's above-expectation performance, and that is quite an achievement... Then there's the action sequences: the most striking difference between Battlship and Transformers' visual spectacles would be that, to me, the action sequences in Battleship simply feels more 'alive'. In TF you get your 'hourly dozes' of Bayhem which blows everything up in a ridiculous way, and despite the main actors in the battle scenes - the transformers themselves - being able to move around like human martial arts experts, many of TF's battle sequences just feels like Michael Bay shouting 'look at my masterpiece isn't that fxxxking awesome' at your face because everything is so overdone.In Battleship Berg manages to make battles between massive ships - which in reality are slow to move, slow to turn etc... - dynamic and intense. Berg also employs an extremely large variety of shots, so it's aesthetically pleasant and you're less likely to get bored - well, not during the naval battles anyway. The land battles between those technically advanced but intellectually (as usual) retarded alien foot soldiers and a few human civilians and not as exciting, but overall the quality of the visual spectacles exceeded my expectations. Here are two particularly 'epic' sequences:-SPOILER ALERT!!!- 1. When the two wheels like alien weaponry strikes an airbase full of helicopters. 2. When USS John Paul Jones sank... If you wanna know what a 'moneyshot' is like, then look no further. They somehow managed to mix an entire minute of various types of intense action and make the whole thing look like a single set-up shot with all the bits seamlessly put together. Truly amazing stuff here. -SPOILER ENDS-Once the aliens turn up, the film turns into one massive show off of visual effects (obviously the advantage of having such a huge budget to blow) and the momentum rarely gets disrupted. There are explosions everywhere, but they feel somewhat 'contained' and not as overblown as the ones you get in Bay's TF films. This is probably because a large part of the sound effects you hear are those of artillery/missile firing - from alien ships as well as human naval vessels - and the subsequent impact & explosions, as compared to the weird and definitely 'unhumanly' voices the Transformers themselves make. Jablonsky's soundtrack is OK, if not a bid generic. It sounds just like your typical style stuff heard in similar films. However with all the explosions going on the music really don't stand out - sound mixing is brilliantly done though. I did not notice any particularly memorable music. However I did recall hearing tunes from ""World Collapsing"" (inception style music used in the Snow White and the Huntsman trailer) used not just once, but twice, which is weird.So overall I'm quite satisfied with what I've seen. The visuals look better than any other film coming out this summer. I mean the Avengers and MIB3 don't look bad in their trailers, but the SFX in Battleship is simply amazing, and I think amazing visuals and great action scenes are what a film like Battleship is about. Sure there's the occasional humour (which seemed to have worked on people sitting around me) and a post-credits scene that made me mad for missing it, but why else would you, unless you're a Rihanna fan, want to watch Battleship?-FINAL SPOILER-If you're expecting Niam Leeson to say that famous line 'You sunk my battleship' in the film, then I'm afraid you'll be disappointed. There's only one battleship present in the whole film, and it's bloody USS Missouri, yep the 'ancient' ship where Japan surrendered. After the JPJones sank, the crew and a bunch of old naval sailors turned this museum into battle ready and used it to not only stop the alien invasion, but literally blew up the alien 'mothership' in the process, and USS Missouri only took a few hits in the end. Oh, and Liam Neeson is on his aircraft carrier commanding the fleet (that is, never engaged in any battle until the very end) almost the entire time. Sounds incredibly stupid I know, they really used the IPs name 'Battleship' very loosely :)",Battleship

If you're wanting a good movie to go out with your friends, forget about the real world, then yes, I'd recommend this. This movie is in no way Oscar bait, or any other type of accolade-drawing attempt for that matter. I just turned my brain off, and enjoyed the film; in the most non-condescending way. I enjoyed the action and visuals, the lead actor wasn't so bad, and the throw back to the veterans was pretty cool to see.Final thoughts: Take your kids, friends, or anyone else out to see this movie.

768,Kane_1,"Eventful, enjoyable, fun. Not the best, but worth a watch.",8,26 May 2012,"I'm really surprised at some of the negative reviews. I'm rating it slightly higher to offset them, but I'd probably rate it around a 7 to a little higher.First off, I'd like to say that it was a very enjoyable movie. I was actually expecting something a lot worse, so it may not have been the greatest starting expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised. There's depth to it that I was not expecting, especially for such a crappy trailer which doesn't display the depth at all. The war veteran who had his legs shot off, trying to feel like a whole, functional person again, and the retired vets who'd served, proving they aren't just washed-up-and-out soldiers, really impressed me. There's too few movies that show what happens after war, and this movie melded what happens in war with what happens post-war beautifully, especially since this wasn't one of the focuses of the movie.Pros: Beautiful special effects, the viewer is left guessing about the aliens intentions at the start (it's not your typical ""aliens arrive, aliens attack movie"".), intriguing plot that may surprise you at a couple points, is slightly predictable, but enjoyable nonetheless.Cons: A little too much focus on the battle scenes, the aforementioned posing of the war vets is comically ridiculous, and there are a few scenes where you end up scratching your head and asking if you missed something or not, or laughing at the nigh-ludicrous scenario that is presented. However, they are generally short and don't often take away from the rest of the movie.Overall: Pretty well designed, fun movie. It's not jaw-dropping spectacular, but it's well worth the watch. Liam Neeson is always enjoyable in his role, and while Rihanna is a backstage character, she does add a fun bit of fire to the guns. Main characters are actually deeper than they initially appear (the blonde girlfriend is a physical therapist with interesting development beyond just sex appeal, the main character is a screw up who never quite gets it right, which is a helluva lot more realistic than the ""zero-to-hero"" movies, etc.) Fairly good character development, enjoyable and beautiful cinematics, and action-adventure that leaves you smiling makes this far better than your typical, run-of-the-mill summer movie.",Battleship
769,markalugo,Alien invasion toy based movie.,8,3 October 2012,"OK everybody blasting this movie needs to stop for a second and think who made this movie and for who. It was made by Hasbro a toy company and for young kids. This was not meant for Oscar consideration. It was meant to entertain while teaching lessons. Even a loser can turn his life around to become a hero. Even rivals/enemies can come together to accomplish a common goal. For those complaining about ""the old guys"" running a ship, well those ""old guys"" were in the movie to honor the WWII and Korean Vets who might not be as familiar to the young target audience. Having met some of these real life old vets let me tell you something those were some of the toughest SOB's ever. They were boys asked to be men at a time that their country needed them and they answered the call. Pretty soon there won't be any left so I thought that was very cool move by the maker's of the movie to honor them in this way and another lesson taught that no matter how young or old, handicapped or whatever else anybody can make a difference.

I was very exited to watch this movie. Battleships, aliens, lots of action, Rihanna(!), yes please!. Boy, was I let down... From now on, I'll have you know that I'm a physicist.So the movie starts with some potential, NASA wants to contact extra- terrestrial live using some sort of signal. This is the first tear the physicist in me released. Somehow they thought it was a good idea to build the telescopes (I think) atop a mountain. dafuq? Why go through all that trouble just to send a signal to a satellite. Even my phone can do that from sea level. And it's not even a radio signal, no, the people in NASA with advanced degrees in physics thought it was a good idea to use... visible... light... Visible light scatters everywhere and three signals can't converge, change direction and form one huge ray. Then we meet the cast. Your typical American movie stereotypes. Handsome, perfect, dumb. See it as your daily dose of America propaganda. Some irrelevant stuff happens next to give the movie a ground to stand on.Black screen, protagonist is a captain of a marine ship 0.o Right. Then the aliens arrive, which of course we can see clearly using non-existent software which precisely shows the earth, not all the satellites, and the location of an alien ship which it can distinguished as 5 individual ships . One of them crashes in one of our satellites, the aliens don't have navigation?Next, bullshit, irrelevant story, blablabla. Aliens crash into sea and set up a force field. Then they decide to attack, using some sort of wheels, a playground, a highway and a child. In stead of the ship that just attacked them! The humans discover they have lizard like eyes that happen to be exactly the same as our lizards. Convenient isn't it?Oh about those alien ships. What would you think is the best way to travel on earth? Flight? Driving? Sailing? Nope, hopping around like a dolphin, that's the way! Combat, very important! Let's give our aliens some bad-ass armor, that'll make them look though. What!? a main without weapons and legs can kill our soldiers? Oh well. At least our ships are strong. They rockets? Oh noes! Even snipers that can shoot through glass?! How strong are these humans? This must go though every one of those aliens' head.I can really go on and on about this movie.

Then all of a sudden he got the pleasure of skipping any kind of training and became an officer right away!!! Well the story gets better. Apparently this spaceship can fly to earth, but when it gets to earth all it can do is hop...thats right no flying whatsoever.

But, what is better is that it just so happens on the ship are about 15 old guys in uniforms who know how to work the ship. Also, the ship has been in port for 70 years but fires right up and apparently they forgot to take the ammunition off the ship because the ship is loaded with ammo.

And after that we continued to made very bad decisions, of course explained by some very bad propaganda trying to persuade us that we are good guys. exactly how NOT TO conduct First Contact.We had some peaceful visitors, met by army and after our very unreasonable moves, they were responding to some very unfriendly moves on our part with very limited force. All that marred with accident when one of their vessels crashed, unfortunately killing some people (all aliens aboard, of course unmentioned because it would show how lame story is). We missed to recognize that repeatedly on numerous occasions, throughout entire movie, espetialy in the first hours of encounter.

Unfortunately, even things that they marked ""green"" or not attacking them have shown their real face (what else do you expect from military) and attacked them. One thing leading to another we ended in ""war"" with their scouts. Even they haven't fought, and ALWAYS responding to threat, we saw them as ""evil"" and needed to destroy all of visiting party. Of course we won it, by using their ""weakness"" which is actually ""do not attack anything but defend from immediate threats""... We acted like beasts we are...

Do yourself a favor and watch something else - a plain white wall is a great substitute.",Battleship
782,clevortrevor-loomis,Unbearable,1,1 September 2012,"The film is so bad it's not worth reviewing honestly. The only redeeming quality was the CGI, but every other aspect was just so predictable and boring. From the very beginning of the film you know its going to be bad. One cliché after another with that generic Top Gun feel, with the lead male character a maverick in the navy. Rihanna is acceptable but appears in parts of the film where you wouldn't expect her to be. The inclusion of the real WW2 veterans was touching, but exposed the poor story line and plot even more. The highlight of absurdity came with the revival of the old battleship from a museum piece to all of a sudden being fully laden with ammo and able to fire up the engines at a moments notice. The adverts for the film gave you an entirely different idea of what was to come. In other words false advertising. This is yet another example of Hollywood relying on CGI and that feeling of being on a roller-coaster at an amusement park. Finally, if it wasn't for the fact that I had to write 10 lines I wouldn't have. As for the film don't bother.",Battleship

Forget that aliens are supposed to be more civilized than us (they found us, we not them). Disregard some laws of nature. And accept the outcome for the American people will be a happy one.

784,marchingbagley1,If I Could Rate It Worse I would,4,20 May 2012,"I went to see this movie with a few of my friends, thinking it would be a brainless action movie, with a few good points here and there. I greatly over-estimated it.The setup of the movie was particularly cringe-worthy. Taylor Kitsch plays the deadbeat, loser younger brother of Alexander Skarsgård, and from the start could not be more unlikable. There should be a point where suspension of disbelief gets thrown out the window, and it happens about 15 minutes into the movie. Kitsch robs a convenient store for a burrito (for a girl), gets tasted, and then somehow is the captain of a ship (and is still just a terrible person). It is utterly ridiculous.Then, on a training mission, aliens attack (absolutely no surprise there). A force field gets set up, which not only stops anybody besides the 3 ships from fighting, but also has the ability to cut the only good actor (Liam Neeson) completely out of the film. The fight scenes are not only incredibly hard to follow, they just don't make sense. The aliens are super-advanced, but they can't figure out long range attacks, or regular flight (instead skipping in a straight line), and the actual alien soldiers have...I don't know, fancy eggbeaters or something? I don't even know why they showed the weapons, because the aliens never did anything with them. There ships are guarded with tinted glass (they can't see in sunlight), and the glass is so weak two snipers take it out, basically destroying the alien ship. The last ship is destroyed in an equally silly manner, with the use of an old ship that somehow wasn't considered a threat to the aliens (while a highway was?) and a bunch navy vets that just attack the ship, which just sits there until it goes boom.The acting is equally, if not more horrendous. Taylor Kitsch's character is just stupid, to the point where I was surprised anyone listened to him. Rihanna was equally awful, adding nothing to the plot, and not even any kind of eye candy like she would be known for. I think the worst acting came from Gregory D. Gadson. He plays a double amputee, and was so wooden, so unbelievable, that I could have sworn he was reading off of cue cards. It's a shame that the only actor with any kind of skill was in the movie for under 10 minutes. Since the movie has to get one star, I'll give it to Liam Neeson, for being the best actor, by far, even if he was barely in the movie.Lastly, the effects. The CGI was not too shabby, but the aliens and the spaceships looked more like video game characters than believable threats. Every fight was flooded with explosions, debris, and screaming to the point where all CGI looses relevance. The soundtrack was actually pretty good, but I found it excessive to use the entire songs (It seemed like they were burning time, or shooting a recruitment/music video). All in all, the effects exceptionally crappy, but all other aspects brought it down.The movie was at best a two hour Navy video, but still a stale, horribly acted, wanna-be action movie. The only reason I could see for someone paying to see this movie is if they want to laugh that a movie this bad actually got to the big screen. It is just flat out bad.",Battleship
785,jordanstock,A very successful 'battleship' adaptation,9,19 April 2012,"After seeing this trailer I thought that this film was going to be another transformers film with no storyline, bad acting and CGI which makes you sick after 30 minutes.But boy was i wrong.Aside from some corny clichés this film is stunning. The storyline is very interesting and is gripping in its own unique way. The special effects are absolutely stunning and the acting superb. and I've got to say Rihanna does a pretty good job for her first film.The way Peter berg managed to incorporate the battleship element in to the film too was done very well and brought back many childhood memoriesThe added comedy was at times 'corny' but their were some scenes involving a certain 'burrito' which cracked me up!A very solid 9/10.",Battleship
786,zmanmaster,Absolutely Horrible (spoilers),3,18 May 2012,"I saw the preview to this movie, and thought to myself: this may actually turn out to be pretty good. My dad was convinced to. He spent years in the military and loves movies about them. So I gathered my friends together and set off for the midnight premiere.That was possibly one of the worst mistakes of my life. This is a movie to watch for free when it comes out on netflix, and you are supremely bored. It is so unbelievable, I'm starting to think Willy Wonka was a true story. The aliens who have come to see what our planet is all about. Have five ships that they plan to use. These ships apparently can fly millions of light years through space but cannot avoid crashing into a satellite?? So that's alright, I mean not every planet puts up satellites before discovering space travel right. But then the aliens crash into the sea outside Hawaii but all of their ships must be supremely disabled because they can no longer fly but only hop around on the water like frogs or something! Also, the aliens seem to be having an intensely hard time deciding whether or not they want to take over our planet at all. They destroy some ships but leave others to live? But that's not that bad. I can deal with that. But the only weapons they have are these grenade things that they toss at other ships and these VERY Transformer like characters that are some sort of mining equipment based on how they just drill through things. And the alien ships are unbelievably vulnerable. I mean a decommissioned USS Missouri, that apparently was fully armed and fueled and capable of battle, took out the mothership, with a couple shots. The other ships were easily taken out by a couple of cruise missiles. If the aliens shield thing had been a little bit bigger so that the aircraft carrier was inside. The aliens would have had no chance. I also think this aliens were like Predator since they didn't seem to like to use guns in close combat, but some sort of plier things.But all that was just annoying. What really killed this movie was the story. The main character saw a girl in a bar and broke into a convenience store for her to get her a burrito. Then the next minute, he's the captain of a ship? His brother , also, gets the medal of honor for doing nothing but dying. Why not give the medal of honor to one of the other thousand of troops who died on his ship. I'm so frustrated. I'm ranting in this review. The acting was horrible. The story was horrible. The movie was horrible. All I can say is that the CGI was kind of cool. But it's summer! Every week a new movie comes out with cool CGI. This movie was pathetic. Push this filth back down the throat of the people who spat it out at us, and do NOT go see this movie! It will waste your time, and unnecessarily wear down the seats of the theater you sit in.",Battleship

I don't understand why people are complaining that the movie was based off the board game well when you go on I am db and search this movie and read the description it said that it is sorta based off the board game BATTLESHIP!. And yes it did have a good story line in my opinion.

788,jaym911,Lack of vision from many other reviewers.,9,5 September 2012,"I don't normally review too many movies unless I see reviews from others that do nothing but bad mouth a well done movie. This movie has more then enough action to keep anyone entertained. It is yes borderline Transformers style of movie but the general story doesn't quite copy it. The graphics are as good as, if not better then that of Transformers but nothing else resembles.The story was fairly fresh with a few hiccups here and there but nothing major to throw you out of sync with it and some humor mixed into the story gave it a bit of comedy. The characters were fairly well chosen except I was skeptical about Rhiannas parts. At times her voice seems to... ""peek"" as if she was chocking while trying to say or yell her lines.I see a lot of complaints about the Aliens shooting bombs that resemble the pegs from the game, But it helps to compare to the game by having them, and its not like they just ping the ships with them. The bombs land, and dig in, once in place they explode, implode, then explode again. That's not exactly a plain old peg bomb hitting the ship and someone screaming ""You sank my Battleship"". Its more entertaining.Overall the movie is a good watch. I myself rate it 8 of 10. Well worth a watch. If people find it a boring movie, they either a) didn't watch the whole movie, b) have narrow minds and lack of vision, c) only like movies with a super hero in it and a redhead / blonde female taking up half the screen time, or d) all of the above. If they REALLY find this movie boring they REALLY need to go out and buy the Battleship game, sit there for 5 minutes to learn the game, THEN watch how boring the real game was compared to the movie.I myself, can't wait for the next movie if they decide to continue it. If a show like Jersey Shore can scrape by 6 seasons with horrid shows, this Deserves to be continued. Props to Hasbro for this new Movie.",Battleship

790,darkknight15011,Avoid At All Cost,1,7 June 2012,So everyone keeps asking me why I hated Battleship (I'd call it Battlesh*t) so much. So here goes (Contains Spoilers). It was a hotchpotch of a number of ideas and did not deliver on any of them. A wannabe crossover of an alien invasion/war/transformers movie. The plot from the offset is wrong scientifically. What took seven year should actually take over 20 years (Trust me I asked Sheldon Copper !!). But you can forgive that I suppose but there on in the whole story is just there for the sake of the explosions and FX. The Leading man Taylor Kitsch is poor he maybe eye candy for the ladies and some guys but that's about it. He does not carry the film well. I found his acting mono toned and dull. As for Rihanna her first role should be her last with grating one liners all throughout the movie and having a super cap that seems to be glued to her head no matter what explosions and falls she takes here's a link to all her lines in the movie and you can hopefully see where i'm coming from http://bit.ly/NjaJyn . I understand a movie trying to be patriotic I enjoyed movies like Independence Day but with this movie it was done in a really silly way. When a bunch of Veterans aged (50-70) team up with the few survivors and use a decommissioned Old Battleship now a tourist attraction to defeat the aliens and their high tech equipment. When the aliens already took out a few modern day Battleships is beyond laughable. As for Liam Nesson he was probably in the movie for a total of 5-6 mins so anyone going thinking he has a big part to play he doesn't.

794,mattwithwheels,Alien ships VS. Navy Ships,5,8 June 2012,"OK so this is my first review I'm ever writing about so where do i begin? I've read numerous reviews on this movie, some people liked it, others didn't, some compared to transformers on sea, so i wasn't so sure to go see it or not. After 2 of my friends told me about it, i decided to go see it since i was somewhat interested.It does drag in the beginning, nothing really important, Taylor Kitsch plays the lead character, a drop out loser who robbed a convenience store to get some item for a girl then gets tazed. Then later joins the navy thanks to his brother, and soon enough becomes a lieutenant with big responsibilities on a naval vessel with some few hundred men beneath him when he doesn't even have a clue what to do at times and walks away from the situation until he realizes he is much needed. So fast forward to the sea ships and the aliens. They did seem a bit transformers like when the ships were either at sea or on land...but Transformers are completely different. Their giant robots, one race who trys to destroy earth and the other race that wants to protect it, so I see where people will find a similarity to transformers but, their not really anything near them. Rihanna was ehh, nothing exciting bout her character arrangement. The aliens were alright in costume, nothing awesome looking. I am a huge Liam Neeson fan but this movie didn't show much of the awesomeness that I usually see with him, even though this movie wasn't structured around him. The only characters i cared for/ liked were Commander captain yugi nagata, chief petty officer walter, and lieutenant colonel mick canales, stone hopper/ and samantha. There are some movies i see twice, this will not be one of them. This movie could have been way awesomer, I'm disappointed that it wasn't, if it was ever remade again tho id have some of the same characters, not all of them tho. I was aware of the end credits scene but did not wait for it. I may still get this movie on DVD but its worth a shot at seeing or rental.",Battleship

The actual aliens were pretty believable, not like any I've seen. I also believe they may have used actual veterans which if true, would explain the bad acting. I love surprises and there were plenty! In the end, I laughed, cried, and cheered. Any movie that puts me through all those changes rates pretty high in my book. Pure entertainment for me.

Name of this movie could also be Transformers 4 except for all the transforming stuff. It's not unwatchable but it's emptiness is hard to get around especially when walking out of theater feeling like you've just been deprived of something. Kids will love it and it's not bad make out movie also but i don't have a girlfriend right now. in a sequel i believe we can expect more aliens coming back to see what happened to their friends. I was also disappointed by crappy alien weapons. i think they only have one kind of it but hopefully their friends will bring some more when they come back. this story was told so many times they didn't even see necessary explaining what these aliens really want from us.

The special effects were very nice, the action was great and it had a lot of ""keep you engaged"" humor. Mick's character was too dry. I get he was trying to come off as angry, but in reality he just came across as bored, like he just didn't feel like acting. I thought it was creative and entertaining. Not especially brilliant, but clever. Taylor Kitsch was enjoyable to watch. I get that the whole PG13 means we can't use the F word, but the amount of times they cut off ""motherf-----"" to give it that edgy feel was a bit redundant. Why did the aliens sometimes attack (like when Hopper ran on the ship, and the alien pursued) when they weren't threatened but other times did not attack when they weren't threatened? Perhaps a 5 or 10 minute segment on some discovered knowledge about the aliens would have been helpful. Someone makes reference to ""Columbus and the Indians"" but doesn't go into detail about why he feels that way. I also like that they didn't overplay the movie's basis on the Hasbro game; only one key scene used the Battleship game targeting theme.All in all, good fun.

The storyline is crap, many stupid scenes and lame jokes! If this is considered an action movie, then no action in it. If this is an expansive movie - then the aliens r so poorly assembled.

802,parthigeth,different,6,25 November 2013,"first i think it is usual Hollywood movie to save the world....... but it got something different about the plot i liked it. The main heroes in this movie are indeed American navy sailors, but the one thing the film-makers really failed at is making these people likable and realistic. Taylor Kitsch plays the lead character, he's basically some drop out loser who robs convenience stores to get girlfriends and joins the navy at his brothers behest, and in what seems like no time at all he becomes a lieutenant with big responsibilities on a naval vessel with some few hundred men beneath him. The special effects are the only thing to keep you invested, however they're all completely CG so it just likes a cut-scene from a video game . Something that should be impressive (like a ship sinking) is made pointless because it's something clearly rendered on a computer.The soundtrack to the movie is okay composition wise, but it's often loud and draws attention to itself and it sounds exactly like the Inception soundtrack on numerous occasions.",Battleship

Why the alien have a huge shield field but have no shield for their own ships, so that even WWII battleship can beat the alien ""high tech space ship""????Why the alien have no personal firing weapon but only do melee combat?

806,willr_iblylt,Battleship - better than expected,10,11 April 2012,"Initially after seeing the film's trailers I was disappointed as it looked mediocre at best. Obviously we all know the purpose of the film is to display the beautiful special effects and explosions and such but after seeing the film, I was pleasantly surprised as it turned out to be better than expected. Admittedly, most dialogues were cringe-worthy at best but the storyline is simple yet effective enough to capture the attention of the viewers.The special effects definitely did not disappoint and were a treat to watch. The soundtrack to the film was also amazing and worked well with the scenes. The acting was mediocre but in all honesty I wasn't expecting an Oscar-worthy piece of acting so I wasn't too fussed about that. Taylor Kitsch was believable enough as a Navy and definitely did well in my opinion, same applies to Alexander Skarsgard and you can feel the brotherhood between the two of them. Brooklyn Decker was OK-ish at best, very beautiful and an eye-candy to watch, her acting wasn't good but as I said above, the acting wasn't anything special. Rihanna definitely did well for a first-time actress, nothing outstanding but she was extremely charismatic and had a couple of good scenes.Overall, I enjoyed the film and learnt a new lesson that trailers are never the basis of what a film is, turns out some bad trailers are only potentially bad because the director doesn't want to spoil the best bits.

I felt that Rihanna wasn't the right person to play her role as it was her first major one, if they used somebody like Michelle Rodriguez who would be perfect for the part rather than having Rihanna as by the end of the film she seemed like a Megan Fox of the Transformers films.

It does not get better until you walk out of the cinema scratching your head and scream at someoneDon't expect any more action other than what's in the trailers -that's about 30 minutes in this two hour dragyou can sleep through the whole movie and won't miss a thing",Battleship

They should have paid me to watch this film.I have 3 kids under the age of 10 who loved watching the Transformer movies. After 30 minutes into this film kids were asking where's the action? My son was saying this is boring. I myself was falling asleep filled with disappointment. My kids didn't like the movie at all.All the action is what you see in the previews, don't expect to see any more watching the whole movie.The aliens are suppose to be lizards in human form who eyes hurt in direct sunlight. Quite pathetic in my opinion.. No special abilities what so ever. The 70 year old battle ship at the museum they had to use replacing there battleship that was destroyed had more gun power??Finally it was very poor acting from all character's.This film should have not hit the cinema's.. I'm doing you a favour by suggesting u save your money wait for it to come out on video and purchase it on a cheap Tuesday for $1.95 at Block Buster.. That way once you feel deceived you will feel relieved u didn't waste your hard earned money on this crap..I also feel the people who have given a great review for this film have been paid to do so. :(",Battleship

It. is. awesome.It's been a while since a movie has engaged me for the whole two hours but with Battleships mix of action, comedy and storyline, I was into it. I'm sure there are probably a few technical things you could pick out but only if you went into the movie really looking for them as they are so minor and don't affect the story at all. Actings great. Lots of funny and ""feel good"" moments. Although Liam Neeson wasn't in as many scenes as perhaps people wanted, he was a very dominant character and was definitely present all the way through.I had a great time watching this movie and would recommend it to anyone.",Battleship

Unfortunately, it i think is the latter.It's not often that you think 'hmmm this would have been better if Micheal Bay had been involved'Plot : Nice premise - but massive plot holes, and complete lack of common sense when it comes to the Aliens. Cast: Terrible (except Mr Neeson) Effects: What you'd expect - pretty good, although no massive Naval battles on the scale you're hoping for. Acting : Dire. Stick to the day Job, Rhianna (whatever that is)I'm pretty objective when it comes to films, and like to be open minded - and enjoy a film for what it is. In that respect, i'd watch this again in the future - but as a spoof.",Battleship
815,Cybetron,Good movie to watch but not an Epic,6,15 April 2012,"The movie is an ostentatious (and somewhat flawed) adaptation of many similar alien invasion themed movies. Having said that, the movie also has its own tweaks and turns of a plaid plot that makes it watchable. May contain spoilers if you regard them so. The story revolves around a young Alex Hopper (Kitsch) who ""finds his calling"" as a responsible Naval Officer in the course of an impending alien invasion, camaraderie with his Asian counterparts, winning the trust of the father (Neeson) of his beloved girl friend (Decker) and respecting veterans for what they seem to offer after their twilight years in the Navy. The only new feature in this movie that seems to set it apart from its predecessors is the fact that the war with the aliens is mostly Naval. The aliens somehow cannot manage to launch flying objects (except for the spike-laden yo-yos, which for some reason destroy only a part of the city/enemy forces). The alien's fleet travel, not by sailing or swimming or hovering, but by ""jumping"" on the water. These ""jumps"" are later tracked by the use of buoys in what appears to resemble a game of Battleship. Both parties can not, for some technical reasons, perceive each other's presence on the waters so they rely on movements and deploy projectiles based on guess work and hunches. These are only a few of several flaws pertaining to the alien race (The Regents) spread across the movie.The actors did admirably well through out the film except for a few inconvenient and clichéd scenes. The plot could've been much much better if it was set to focus on the ingenuity of Naval Battles and if it hadn't focused on the alien race being so weak and easily surmountable. The last scene was very well shot and also reminded me of a battle in Pirates of the Caribbean. The graphics (especially the last half hour) were realistic and the sound-effects were appropriate and not too loud. I, personally, enjoyed the AC/DC songs in between. Overall, the movie is definitely watchable (once) and enjoyable if you are not looking for something that would involve too much of your cognitive powers. I would also like to mention that the movie, as per my understanding, does not offer any plausible reason behind the actions of the alien invaders as those claimed by some reviewers.",Battleship

YES, we REALLY had to watch actors playing 'battleship' for 30 minutes!We then had the most hilarious scene I've watched for ages, a gang of geriatric sailors hanging around an old battleship like some kind of navy village people tribute act!

It doesn't hurt your eyes to look at the effects. Lovely original storyline. A very good acting debut from Rihanna. She plays a bad-ass and is nothing like her normal provocative self. Some eye candy for thee girls when it comes down to Taylor Kitsch and Alexander. Taylor Kitsch is quite the bad boy and will make the girls swoon. He did to me! The humour entered in the film is well executed and well timed. One criticism that I have about this film is that Liam Neeson could've had more screen time but apart from that very good.,Battleship

I couldn't bear to watch another minute after about 45mins in, I could spend my spare time watching something that actually appeals to someone of higher iq than a 12 year old. because thats the only audience I can think of that would enjoy this movie. it's plain dumb, and awful in every way thinkable. stay clear if you haven't seen it because you will think the same thing. i'll end off by saying the acting makes the robots in transformers look good in comparison, and the script itself is as if it was taken straight out of something like pokemon. just don't bother.",Battleship

It cannot be as an investment, unless they thought they were buying a battleship, because they were not making a film to entertain. They could of course be aiming for the award for worst film of the year, which in my humble opinion, they will win hands down.Do reptilian aliens have molars for teeth? Can reptiles, who adore hot climates, really be shy of bright lights?Can an anchor chain really stop dead a 15,000 ton fast moving battleship? Why use all your missiles to knock out 3No. alien ships and not the force field generator?

This is by far the worst movie this year in my opinion.There was only just 1 or 2 good things that I can say about this movie, first of all in the beginning where the main character tried to get the girl's attention by stealing a burrito from the grocery store was considerably funny. But all that followed afterwords was simply terrible,there were a couple of scenes which were so illogical and not realistic (not talking about aliens), for example firstly let's take our new outstanding actress Rihanna's character, she is only female of the ship but she is just simply doing everything from communication, to shooting missiles, to going by the boat to explore the strange object (which turned out to be alien ship)and then trying to destroy it by machine-gun- unbelievably stupid.Secondly the ending of the movie was so predictable the main character is dating the admiral's daughter and wants to marry her, her father doesn't give his permission, cause he doesn't trust the guy,Can you guess who is going to save the world from aliens and gain his fiancée's father trust... That's right!To sum up do not waste your time, or even worse- money, if you want to see special effects, go to movie with decent plot!Thank you for your attention!",Battleship

One of the reasons is why that the movie brings a sense of an intense feeling when watching the previews. Now, the movie did not spoil any parts of the movie, it seems that the movie is portrayed as an imagination of the mind to which it attracts the viewer. The picture in the preview was anything but fake, the use of the technology that we have today makes these specific kinds of movies pictures be portrayed as realistic. The point in which the movie can attract people is all but certain. Giving it a six is well in its reach when looking at picture, quality, setting, and the general aspect of how the viewers love it. I cannot wait to see the movie in May, lets see if it lives up to the viewers expectations.",Battleship

Plemons was my favorite believe it or not. I think a lot of the negative ratings are comparing it way to much to the board game. I watched this movie 2 days in a row and still thought it was as good as the 1st. And lastly I would like to add that even though this movie was based on a board game, it brought attention back to our history and what a lot of soldiers endure for us. I had to go back to the U.S.S Missouri site and read up on the ship. So it reopened my eyes and made me more appreciative, even though they were fictional characters there are a lot of men and women who sacrifice themselves for us everyday. I gave the movie 10.",Battleship
824,paulhenriawagner,"**SPOILER** Way awesome FX, Great plot, and mediocre acting",7,18 May 2012,"First of all, WOW! Way awesome special effects. I was left wanting to look at the alien spacecraft much longer due to all of the detail. The spacesuits were very advanced and I couldn't get enough of them- a true sign of in-depth FX work.The plot was pretty decent. Man searches for life on other planets, sends out a message, aliens receive message, they see our planet is awesome and theirs sucks, so they come to set up a ""beach head"" conveniently within striking distance of a multi-nation naval fleet. Hhhmmm... a little too convenient for us? Also, when you save the world, the POTUS would present medals, not a fleet admiral... just saying. I had fun watching the plot unfold though. They definitely did their naval warfare research and the salute to veterans was a nice touch.In general the acting was OK but having been in a combat zone myself (OIF 1- 2003), I can say that these people didn't have the facial expressions or fatigue that an all day and all night combat experience would place on a person. Liam Neeson definitely added bonus points but didn't get enough screen time. Rihanna added some sex appeal but I just don't see a weapons officer going out on recon runs to inspect alien ships- don't they have Seals or Marines for that? Overall, Battleship is definitely a fun movie to see. Whether you're a sci-fi nerd or action movie guy, you'll really like it. (I'm both) *SPOILER BELOW* It's worth the wait after the credits. Sneak ending, secret ending or whatever you want to call it. Some Scottish boys find a crashed space vessel, about the size of a Federation escape pod (yes I'm a Trekkie). Some worker guy comes by in a truck and breaks out a blow torch and cuts open the ship. They look inside and out comes an alien hand and then it ends. Obviously this sets things up for a sequel. You also have to consider that not every alien got killed on Oahu or in the ocean. There was also talk early on in the movie about crashes in Iowa, China, etc.",Battleship
825,cjcochran,Disappointing,5,18 May 2012,"Waiting for a long time to see this movie, went with some (high) expectation after watching the trailers.In my opinion, it is just a hole lot of other movies and console games mixed into one. Liam Neeson plays a not so strong character (even being an admiral). Wrongly represented ranks in the Navy and... where were the marines, ship security is handled by them, not regular sailors. Nice Audio and Visual Effects. Idiotic aliens with mediocre ship armament alien armament looked cool though.Well, it is entertaining at least. People should go see it thinking on supporting the movies (box office).",Battleship
826,kanejeeves,Great for what it is,8,20 May 2012,"Obviously this movie was meant to be a fun, nothing fancy, battle movie based on a board game. And that's exactly what it delivers: lots of action, lots of ""let's fill'em full of lead"" trite dialog, and a pretty girl. (Oh and it definitely seems like a promotional video for the Navy, which you have to expect too.) If you're expecting Saving Private Ryan, like some of the reviewers here evidently, then it's your expectations that are off, not the movie.Also, I was impressed by how the makers handled language. There are a few scenes where a swear word was used and was appropriate BUT they did it such a way that the effect of the word came out but they didn't actually use the word. You hear just a hint of the sound of the word but not the actual word. They knew this was geared towards younger boys and so made the effort to sanitize the dialog.

People are not sure about him yet but I think he will prove to be a bright young star with a great future ahead of him. This movie was worth my time and was exactly what I expected and then some.

829,jl952,The ignorant director needs to re-take his high school U.S. history class,1,20 May 2012,"This movie is the worst movie I have ever seen.The director is not only ignorant in his movie directing skills, but also in ignorant in US HISTORY.The first question I had was what this director had for Japan and Japanese military, and why he beautified the Japanese navy so much.The second question I had was, does Peter Berg know anything about the Imperial Japanese flag that he showed multiple times during the movie? For those of you who aren't familiar with the Imperial Japanese flag, its also called, ""the rising sun"" flag, which the Imperial Japan used as its flag during the World War II. It symbolizes the Imperial Japan's will to establish an empire that spans across the entire bulk of South East Asia. The flag is considered to be offensive to the countries that were victimized by the Empire of Japan during WWII.THIS INCLUDES NOT ONLY ALL THE SOUTHEAST Asian COUNTRIES THAT SHED BLOOD DUE TO Japanese RULE IN WWII, BUT ALSO THE U.S. THAT HAD HEAVY CASUALTIES FIGHTING THE EMPIRE OF JAPAN.The movie supposedly makes our WWII veterans proud and takes place in Hawaii where Pearl Harbor is, and Peter Berg used the Imperial Japanese Flag????????? this is like spitting on the faces of the victims of unprovoked attack on Pearl Harbor by the Empire of Japan and all our veterans of the U.S. who fought the Japanese army to protect this country during WWII.The fact that Peter Berg used this flag in this movie that takes place in Pearl Harbor, a historically significant place that was victimized by the Empire of Japan shows not only his ignorance in the history of his own country, but also his incompetency and carelessness in directing a movie without knowing anything about what he puts in it.I hope that after reading this review, people look up what the Imperial Japanese flag is, and learn the meaning of it. NOTE that this comment is not against Japan or Japenese, but against the ideals that the Empire of Japan had during the WWII, which is manifested in the Imperial Flag of Japan.Woe to the ignorance of such an incompetent and ignorant director who insults the men who died fighting for us, and who saved our own country.",Battleship

Since it's still around, maybe it's getting some word of mouth....it would be a shame to miss it on the big screen.The score was a great fit for the movie, subtle in the story driving scenes and thunderous in the battle scenes. Lots of great rock as well. I recommend this movie for its patriotic feel good story and it's great action. In summary, this movie rocks! Don't let the Eurobuzz keep you from enjoying a great Summer movie!",Battleship

It was nice to see a Navy oriented movie. It was neat to see how the Navy fights on our seas, and all that entails. It had plenty of action, a cute love story, and it showed reverence to our US Navy Veterans. It was kind of predictable, but overall, it was outstanding. It had some humor, some fresh faces, and a really good storyline. Those who criticized it for not being ""realistic""... I have to ask, How realistic are alien invasion movies? I thought it was very well done and an excellent movie. Very entertaining, overall. One of the best movies I have seen in a long time! A must-see on the big screen!",Battleship

There are moments when you wish you could unseen the tacky ways they (the movie makers) try to make heroes and bad-asses of certain people. Most notably the old sailors on the USS Missouri which are posed (yes, really posed!) everywhere, high and low in an awkward way that just makes you wanna squirm and throw up a little bit. d",Battleship
846,Elliot_Hogan,"Battleship; a fun outing, filled with battles, and a fair few ships.",7,13 April 2012,"Let's jump straight in with my overall view. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Like really. It was bloody brilliant.Rihanna's 'acting' aside, I have very few complaints at all. Sure, it was filled with a considerable amount of plot holes, a bit of troll science and it was way over-the-top. But that's what made it so darn enjoyable.To be fair though, I am probably being a bit too harsh on Rihanna with my thoughts on her performance. I am not a fan of singers who think they can act, but this isn't really a movie she could have failed in. So for all intents and purposes she does acceptably. On the other hand of the acting scale we have Tadanobu Asano, one of my favourite actors who I have followed for quite a long time, and despite my opinion of him being slightly biased I think he gave a very solid performance and showed he is capable of playing supporting roles in Hollywood. Taylor Kitsch was surprisingly watchable, considering his involvement in John Carpenter (A movie flop of epic proportions). And the rest of the cast was decent enough for this kind of movie. The use of real war veterans was a nice touch. It hindered the overall acting quality (well what Rihanna hadn't already tarnished :P ), but, there was couple of surprise performances (most notably Col. Gregory D. Gadson) and it made for one hell of an epically hilarious/bad-ass montage to look out for.The characters themselves weren't particularly deep and there were errors in consistency in places, but it's not a movie that needed perfect character development. The few characters that were there were humorous and provided varying degrees of entertainment. Also any hefty romantic storyline would have hindered the movie, and luckily that is kept to a minimum.I was also fairly impressed by the action. I found it far more watchable/enjoyable than some other stuff I have seen. The design of the aliens was a pleasant bonus; where some movies chose to not bother with actually showing the aliens (the fairly terrible Battle: LA), Battleship took time to design a decent enough looking race, with a fair amount of impressive tech at their disposal. Although I did have images of the video game Dead Space when seeing their armour so not completely original.This is one of those cases where listening to harsh film critics can be a bad thing. Sure comparing this film to more serious Hollywood blockbusters, à la Inception, is going to result in it doing badly. But compare this movie to any of the other stupidly expensive, cheesy, OTT 'popcorn movies', and you should be able to recognise the superior quality of this outing.As far as bad things go, the ending was a bit rushed and there were plenty of plot holes. It was fairly loud throughout and the dialogue was often weak. And I consider it too be a bit too patriotic towards the American Navy. But I am willing to forgive these things as they didn't hinder my overall child-like enjoyment during the battles.If you want something a bit tongue-in-cheek, with over the top action that's incredibly easy to watch yet still enjoyable. I would recommend it. If you go in expecting any kind of deep storyline or complexity, then it's your own fault if you don't enjoy it. As that is not what this film is about.Battleship is a likable action romp, that won't win any awards, but shouldn't be ignored either.",Battleship
847,tipkalo,"A movie made purely for fun, worth watching! :D",10,10 November 2012,"This movie has some extreme digital modeling in it. All of the special effects (space ships, ships, explosion) are of the highest quality. Yes, for the most of the movie I was thinking realistically and have noticed a flaw (for example, if a ship has a bunch of rockets on it, why doesn't it shoot all of them instead of not shooting them and sinking because of the enemies attacks witch could have been prevented by destroying the attacker with rockets)here and there. When the movie ended, I realized one thing. This movie should not be watched with an expectation of a masterpiece ""indepthening"" story. This movie is made for fun, for epic fun. It was extremely entertaining for me to watch it, because there is always something happening, not much dialogue, you don't get to connect with the character, but the movie is just epic for it's pure fun(AND MUSIC!).P.S.

Loved how they used the U.S.S Missouri in the movie. I don't see why other reviews are getting so held up on bad lines, because I think I'd better watch the movie again to spot a single bad line. I went in with high expectations, mostly because of the trailer, and how it's cut all the good bits in. When I finished watching the movie, I thought there were... 'missing parts'. You know in all movies, you want to see 'gradual love'? Well I don't see how the lady fell in love with the man all because he went through an unarmed robbery to get a chicken burrito for her. You also want to see a good battle. In good battles, you'll see the good guys fail first. That pretty much happened on Battleship, but not exactly. I don't see HOW to explain it, but I guess if you watch the movie you'll see the battles aren't very long. Overall, impressed, but felt like the producers were set with a limit- so the movie wouldn't be any longer than 130 minutes. I sure felt like the story was too short. Anyways, 7/10 from me.",Battleship
850,Danellecanales,Things other reviews fail to mention about a decent action film...,9,6 July 2012,"Saw this movie at the LA Premiere and went in with an open mind untainted by reading reviews (only tainted by the fact that Nokia theater ran out of popcorn and I wasn't sure what was louder: my stomach or the alien ships.) Obviously you can read the other reviews and find critiques a plenty, and I've read quite a few of them myself, but let me tell you some of the information I think they are missing: 1) Hardly anyone mentions the funny parts of this action movie. Jesse Plemons, Rhianna, Taylor Kitsch, and Col. Gadson all say and do funny things throughout the movie, which had me laughing out loud.2) The action in the film is really good... it is very Transformers-ish, but I read some of their reviews too and less people talked about how ""unrealistic it was the the Decipticons came to Earth, made stupid mistakes..."" blah, blah, blah. It's a movie, people! Please don't tell me you went in expecting realistic scientific facts about aliens... the movie is exactly what it promotes itself to be - an action flick: US vs. the aliens. We doubt that we'll win because all hope is lost, but thanks to some dedicated misfits we miraculously turn things around and kick alien butt.3) Go NAVY! I've yet to read another review that mentions that the ""actor"" who plays enlisted amputee Mick Canales is true retired Army hero Lt. Col Greg Gadson, and the ""old retirees"" on the USS Missouri were retired servicemen from 3 or 4 generations dating all the way back to WWII or Korea. I believe the film did a great job of portraying the brotherhood within the military, and that those men LOVED being able to act in the movie and promote the US armed forces. There were tons of servicemen at the premiere (enlisted and officers) and I can't remember any of them bitching about how unrealistic it was to ""drop the anchor and swing the battleship around"", in fact, I recall a lot of whooping and hollering in approval. If for no other reason, this movie is a good one because it promotes the armed forces.I think Peter Berg (director) and the actors did a fine job of creating a sci-fi action thriller based on a board game. I left the theater smiling with a very ""Rah, Rah USA"" attitude and now days that's in itself is a success. Bottom line is the movie was entertaining, and that's what movies are supposed to be. I liked it.",Battleship

Sure the acting was Academy Award Winning, but it was good enough to keep me interested, and the action was purely off the hook.Explosions, effects... sure.. a 500 lbs alien in a suit could kill anyone with one swipe.. but this is a movie, and in the style of the old A Team show where No one ever got shot despite 100 rounds going off... its purely entertainment.

It has such a good cast and thought Peter Berg would have made it much better. I lost my attention within a half hour in and never got it back. I literally got up out of my seat and left after 45 minutes b/c I felt dumber for watching anymore. I like Skarsgard from True Blood and was kinda let down he didn't play a bigger role. I would normally say this type of summer flick is watchable for the action and visual effects but I can't.

Peter Berg hasn't exactly directed anything worthy of awards in the past but this is a new low!!!

860,spirovski-b,An mindless eye-candy flick,3,21 August 2012,"I watched the movie last night, and it immediately reminded me of Transformers. The lame plot, aliens, hot girl, explosions and alien-tech are all Michael Bay look alike. There are so many things that bother me in the movie, but i'll delve into the things that bother me the most - Warning - spoilers. 1. Jackass spending on a radio-signaling array toward deep space - When you find a 'goldilocks' planet, you try to investigate it using passive information (optical and radio telescopes, orbit variations, radiation specter lines to detect complex organic components etc...). Nobody invests into a high-powered signaling equipment to shoot signals at a planet that can possibly support life. 2. Aliens are driving like drunken idiots - I won't even bother with the time needed for the Earth signal to reach Gliese 581 and the FTL speed of alien ships. But if the aliens are able to transit a distance of 20ly in less than 4 years and their intentions are on invasion, one would expect that they'll make a careful final approach toward the planet, observe the orbital junk and equipment instead of diving headlong towards Earth and destroying their communications ship by slamming into a satellite 3. Alien ship designers and strategists were brain-dead - Alien ships are able to generate a shield with a radius of several miles, but are unable to hover/fly - instead they are moving using a tremendously inefficient hopping motion. Even if unable to fly, a much more efficient way would be to move underwater like submarines. On the same note, the aliens have the technology and intelligence to traverse the risks of interstellar space but have no concept of radar or sonar? 4. Alien devices suddenly become weak just in the nick of time - The aliens helmet visors can withstand a point-blank shot from a pistol without a scratch, but the viewport of their interstellar faring vessel can be punched with an anti-materiel rifle shot. The screamers-like destruction rotating blades can rip through tens of exploding helicopters, blast through tens of reinforced concrete columns apparently unharmed, but are easily blasted by AA missiles once the earth planes arrive. 5. Aliens are almost human??? - really, whoever designed the aliens should return his/her salary with interest!. There is no reasonable assumption which will explain how aliens coming from a different biology and planet will be EXACTLY humanoid - the aliens looked like some ugly biker dude with a goatee.6. The Navy is conserving it's weapons - after the first shots with the 120 millimeter gun obviously didn't do anything except to provoke a destruction of one destroyer, one would expect a full salvo of tomahawks, sea-sparrows, torpedoes, even dirty underwear and anything else they have on hand. But no, the first idea was to lob some more shells, keep your weapons for when they are really needed - like for an alien invasion anyone?",Battleship

This was one of the worst movie experiences I had in a looooong time. If you're a teenager that likes computer games, CGI, a lot of explosions and perhaps a Rihanna fan, then maybe you'll enjoy it. If you're a fan of the unanticipated, twist, unoriginal, believable and intelligent - you're going to hate it, because it has none of those.OK, let's just break it down to be simple.Acting: I really don't know, I don't think there was any.Soundtrack: Like many movies nowadays, trying to ripoff Inception.Story: Again, sorry I don't think there was any.I just want to ask those of you who have actually seen this film and liked it, to answer the following questions.1.What do these aliens want exactly from our planet?2.When an alien race comes to take over the planet, shouldn't they have ships better than just hopping on water like a dolphin?3.If they can build an electromagnetic border 1000 miles high, shouldn't they at least have force fields on their ships to resist the attack of a 70 year old battleship? 4.Why is the highly sophisticated alien ship (which travels through space) main bridge made out of ordinary glass that can be broken by a sniper bullet 2 miles away? 5.Why the hell do the aliens attack the concrete pillars under the highway, the kids baseball field and leave the largest battleship around? 6.Why does the battleship sink in the exact way the Titanic did?7.How can a drunk junkie that steels chicken burritos from a store become (in NO time) a great hero and captain on the ship? These are the only ones I can remember now. This film doesn't respect the mentality and logic of the human brain. Period.CGI and visual effects don't make a good movie anymore.

I mean really, who really thinks they're going to base the movie completely off of a board game. That's just silly. So right before I watched the movie, I googled the ratings on ""Battleship"". I saw that it was rated 3/5 stars pretty much on all websites. So I came into the movie thinking, "" Wow, this movie is probably going to suck "". I don't think the reviews have ever been so wrong. Everyone that's so adamant about writing bad reviews about this, saying that it's, ""Another action movie, with special effects to cover up any story-line "". Aliens come from space, and try to invade the planet. Yeah, it's simple, and it's fun. Throughout most of the action scenes, I was either like, "" F U ALIENS! DIE, STOP KILLING US!!

I don't know what all these bad reviews are about, either people who thought this was going to be about a board game or people that were critical of the movie before even stepping foot into the movie theater. This movie wasn't heart felt, or inspiring, or meaningful, sentimental, heartfelt(didn't I already say that?). Stuff blows up. Ships get sunk. Buildings get dropped. Aliens get smoked. Citizens run in panic. It's an action movie. To all the people that give this movie bad reviews... go watch ""Titanic"" or ""Sleepless in Seattle"" or ""Crash"" or something like that.

Don't listen to your friends, or the 17 millionth person saying, "" Its all special effects and esplozions! It has no plot! No character development! "" DURRRR, it's an action movie. It has plenty of that, just not an overabundance of it, which seems rampant in the movies now-a-days. No life lessons. No sentimental heart- felt moments that make you go ""Awww "".

Good thing because if I had spent the money to see it in theaters I would have been really upset. There are some big names attached to this movie but in the end it doesn't really matter because there is no character development and by the end of the movie I didn't really care who was alive and who was dead. The story is also very lacking. As others have pointed out there are some plot holes. Plus any similarities with the board game are mostly coincidental. That being said the special effects are wonderful. Lots of explosions, nonstop action, and aliens. This is definitely a ""don't think too hard"" movie.",Battleship
871,Danielles20,Good watch,8,13 October 2012,This was very entertaining and some humor (that the world always needs). It's not a blockbuster but its not so bad to be 'B' rated. I loved the character 'Mick' more than the primary character. I didn't pay for this at the theater but got it from a redbox for $1. So it was worth it. It is most assuredly nothing like The Avengers but it has its positives. I will not put any spoilers in here. But if you are looking for an action movie for a night in with a someone than this could be a good choice.I went in thinking it would be silly but I did not know it was supposed to be based on the board game until the movie was over. I grew up playing Battleship and really I can't tell you the story behind the game either. This movie does a good job at substituting and I think they go as far to leave some openings in the plot to throw in a sequel. Enjoy!,Battleship
872,junkboxjohn,So many unanswered details,5,20 October 2012,"The movie was fun to watch, all the actions and the thrill. But there are so many unanswered events in the movie. Below are some I could think of: 1. Aliens taking pictures/focus on human eyes - Maybe they want to capture human eyes because their eyes suck? 2. Flashback from the captured alien - what was that for? 3. Aliens don't kill everyone -I guess they if they felt threaten, they kill. 4. One of the alien got inside the ship and was doing some stuff to a piece of machine part - what was that for?? Didn't explain... 5. Why can't the aliens see the destroyer? 6. You post more.Also, some things are just stupid... or I didn't understand them: 1.Weak alien weapon - those bomb things don't do enough damage, and it doesn't have tracking/lock-on? that spinning ball thing was awesome. Alien hands-on weapons are weak as crap, didn't have gun? With all the gadgets on that arm but no guns? 2. Taking forever to fire - Alien ship had to load every single spots, fire when ready doesn't apply to aliens I guess. 3. So Hoppers girlfriend could talk to Hopper with the help of that science guy, but the entire US government was not smart enough to do the same thing? 4. When the alien was chasing hopper, it was just enjoying the moment? And didn't hear that huge gun more? 5. Too many to think of...",Battleship

From the first 10 minuets every one with a brain can understand that this is all about some looser being a hero at the end of the movie..)these aliens cover a whole area with a so called shield, and all the top chairs forget that something called 'submarine' is already made on this earth.

Me, my wife, my dad, my brothers and father in law all thought it was great. The story was not the greatest but still it was good, the alien ships were awesome the special effects were amazing, the cast was great especially considering only one was actually a famous actor and Rhianna did great for her first time acting in a blockbuster movie. It's so good I will be buying it on blu-ray. It was great how they couldn't use radar and used the tsunami bouies and made it look like the battleship board game.

875,austinoram,A real review,9,26 November 2012,"Not sure why the IMDb rating isn't a few points higher, this was a great movie.It was not corny, silly, pointless, mindless, and not predictable, or maybe it was predictable for those who've seen one too many sci-fi films but I was too much engaged. The thing is it was believable and perhaps that is why I thought it was better than the Transformers franchise. Nothing had too much screen time, not CG, the aliens, the actors, the ships, it was all very well rounded, including the characters.I dislike many stances the US has taken in the world and yet this film brought out some intense emotion in me. I do not like war, I do not like seeing it glorified, but this movie did not do that, it portrayed an ideal purpose for military powerhouses that seems to be unmatched in recent and current events, that of self-defense.There were only a few points of interest worth noting regarding continuity which in no way whatsoever made the movie any less entertaining (from my logical thinking this is amazing). The first point being the alien force-field and the battleship being able to leave it though it was not shown having left it. Another point was that most of the military vessels were outside of the force field and the heads of command were able to deduce that the coastal transmitters needed to be destroyed yet did not do so. The final quirk I can believably explain away to myself, that of the alien's threat-detection technology and how it seemed a bit off when targeting obvious threats, right? But without those extra ""5000"" spaceships to back them up it was wise not to put too much pressure on their enemy into discovering their weaknesses. Without a direct threat better leave it alone.Although those issues popped into my head I can't blame the movie for how I think, so deducting one point for the first two issues everything else turned out to be a 9 for my review. I still would not join the military!If you have not seen the movie it is a good one and I would recommend it to others. Also this is my first review because I saw too many people attacking a good movie.",Battleship

The acting by everyone is to such a high standard and even though it is a rather long film, it flies by quickly. By the end of this film I was flabbergasted by the sheer momentum and energy which is contained in this movie. I highly recommend this film to sci-fi and action film lovers as it will blow your mind.

878,loganporter,Check your brain at the door and enjoy the ride!,7,28 January 2013,"Before I begin, let me say that this movie needs a certain mindset: it isn't poetic. It is mindless, flat-out apocalyptic destruction, and one needs to have that in their head when siting down to watch this. With this in mind, I will begin with the bad, since this seems to be the thing that many see (WARNING! Many spoilers!):-The aliens acted a little weird. Okay, I understand them acting in self-defense when their ship is looking down the barrel of a battleship's main battery, but then they go and destroy a harmless highway with seemingly no provocation. Perhaps this can be blamed on the machine that did the deed, but it is still peculiar.-The acting was sub-par, definitely. For example, a Marine made the calmest curse ever when facing giant spinning saw-blades of doom and destruction falling from the sky, right at where he was standing.-The aliens' ships had a really odd way of moving, hopping about like giant metal whales.I saw a lot of good here, however:-They did their homework. I really found most of the tech here believable, and I mean this with the aliens as well. Instead of god-like laser beams, they have believable cannons barley above Earth's, though the force-fields were a little iffy.-LOTS of pretty effects. I liked the CGI work, and though there are some gratuitous lens-flares, overall my eyes enjoyed the experience.-There is some good dialog.-Some decent comedy is included.-Sound work was good, with a nice stereo system, your ears will enjoy the ride with your eyes.-The alien invasion was well thought out. The aliens we see are scouts, hence their relatively light forces and the whole plot of the movie, which shows some actual intelligence in tactics instead of just sending a jackhammer force in to see what happens.Overall, this movie is again not for it's plot, or dialog, or deep drama, it's a roller coaster of explosions and action, and should be seen that way. If one can not get into this mindset, one won't enjoy this movie in my opinion. If you like a brainless mess of awesome destruction, go right on ahead!",Battleship

I must have watched it 4 times already and yes, it's hokey in many parts, but the entertainment level was 10 stars. It was great seeing Rihanna in an acting role like this and I look forward to seeing her in future films. Forget trying to nitpick every part and look at it from a young kids perspective. And I'm 72 years young. Watching something like Battleship was refreshing after watching the crummy made for TV SiFi stuff. All the actors fit their roles perfectly.

Loved the crew.This movie is not meant to be heavy and meaningful or even really terrifying. It is ,however, engaging.

881,Sianellenskelding,I actually thoroughly enjoyed it,8,22 February 2013,"Good film. I think some people didn't understand it. Which I think is stupid. Probably because they didn't give it much chance. I thought Rihanna may not have been the best actress but don't forget she is a singer not an actress so give her some credit. I thought she played the part well. She was feisty and funny and what you'd want from a female with such a roll. I thought it was good for the girls as well as for the boys because there was some hot guys in it including the main guy hopper. Simple story line but played very well as it was supposed to link with the game battleship. I think it worked. It wasn't cleverly written with things you were supposed to work out which I think is why some people didn't like it because it was simple and predictable. But it's perfect to watch when you don't want something too full on. It made me laugh and get that feeling when you are shouting at the TV. And you cannot disagree that it had some amazing ideas. The aliens weren't to over the top and the spaceships were awesome. Simple which made it more believable. Personally I enjoyed it. I wasn't sat there bored. I was entertained which is the whole point of a film, surely? I agree it wasn't the best things I've watched and there's far better but it certainly didn't deserve a 5/10 rating.",Battleship

I ignored it was a military movie with old style uniforms, ships and such.I saw the style in problem solving and approach to the enemy as in Star Trek. For instance, figuring out they were light sensitive and then using it to their advantage. I especially loved the slingshot-effect firing at the alien ship to destroy it.

Yes, it is over the top realistically. No, the acting is not terrible...we've seen plenty worse in Get Out, The Hunger Games, etc. Perhaps we're just too old, but isn't the point of a movie to suspend reality even for an hour or two and just let you enjoy it?

Plot was excellent and yes, some scenes were similar to scenes of the Transformers. Think of the tall glass building being destroyed. But the aliens looked quite original which is refreshing. The detail of being able to see their eyes through their helmets was super. And the opposite thumbs. But most important of all, the movie also contained humor.

Are the aliens really coming here to attack us? Yes, earth is trying to establish communication with the aliens but the John Paul Jones was the first to fire a ""warning shot"". All the aliens did was create a defensive position after they landed near the origin of the signal. What happened in Hong Kong was due to an alien ship hitting a satellite in space (accident). For those of you who are saying ""Whatever.... They came with the intent to attack...."" I just have to say, they did never attacked until they were attacked or felt threatened. They also attacked the highway system and helicopters because they needed to take out anything that would prevent them from establishing contact with their home planet. Not sure what that flash forward or backward scene was when Alex and the alien touched each other but I never saw the aliens attack unless they had to.",Battleship
888,ntdavis2000,Pretty good to me AND I am liberal leaning and all,8,31 May 2013,"I didn't go watch this movie in the theater, but I do that with few movies these days. I saw it on cable while visiting relatives over the Memorial Day holiday. I just stumbled upon it flicking channels.I really enjoyed the movie. It is full of clichés but I took it in for what it was. It was nice to watch a movie where the U.S. did well against tough odds and where the enemy was clearly an enemy and deserved all the might of the military, though much of it is unbelievable and doesn't add up. I didn't care all that much. It was like Independence Day. It was entertaining. And I though it was pretty well acted.It was ultra-patriot and pro-military and I'm liberal, but I don't hate the military or our country. Plus, what the military did in this movie seems pretty reasonable to me, though they certainly had lady luck on their side.Look, Roger Ebert gave it 2.5 out of 4.0 stars, so it can't be all that bad. I do agree with him that it is better than Transformers (I couldn't watch more than 10 minutes of that - horrible acting!) and that there was enough character development to get invested in the characters and their success. I disagree with Ebert when he talks about how it is bad that the first response was military rather than something else. (1) The object landed near the military exercise and a battleship sent out a few crew members on a smaller boat to check it out and one crew member physically touched it. In response to being physically touched, the object pointed its ""guns"" at them and created a force field around it and several in the fleet - that is not exactly a diplomatic action - so it doesn't seem problematic to me that the military fired (2) The fleet was on a training exercise and thought that many the giant object in the ocean was part of that exercise, though too much of a coincidence I agree, but it explains why they were firing early on.Overall, a guilty pleasure as other reviewers have said, and I will probably watch the hinted-at sequel -- on cable or amazon.com or something, not in the theater. The fact that there is a sequel takes some of the unbelievability out of it: it was very hard to believe that these aliens were simply going to send a few explorers and never come again if they didn't get any word from those explorers.",Battleship

Seems as the movie is some navy recruiting documentary where you brainwash American Boys into joining the navy (As portrayed by the lead character) who has no life of his own plus he is a burden on his family and on the society in general but he can easily join the US Army and reach its top ranks within few years or months. If these are the standards of US army then no wonders why the whole world admires the US Army.2. So he is in love with some blond bimbo ohh and she isn't dumb amazing ehh? Not to mention she isn't a snob. Isn't that great portraying a sexy blonde women as some reward the Man gets in the end of the movie when he saves the world. Ehhh pathetic.. 3. An arrogant obese guy with no legs of his own is some what a weird and mindless addition to its already mindless cast. I still do not know why is he given this medal in the end? For being fat or to use him as a balancing effect to neutralise its predominately ""RACIST"" white cast.4. Now comes the aliens. If the atmosphere of planet G is alike earth then why are those aliens allergic to sunlight? Why are they here on this earth in the first place? And why do they want to destroy earth? And why are they equipped with some cluster bombs and a BenTen bay blade to annihilate the human race? Why do the aliens ignore that one ship whose inhabitants later on destroy them? So many questions about those pathetic aliens. In short why are they so lame and mindless? 5. The part where those oldies appear out of no where and that irritating punk rock music starts to get played in the back thats the part where the comedy starts and the fact is revealed upon the viewer that this isn't just some serious alien vs human action movie but its a comedy alien vs human action movie.5. The end is even more preposterous. Not to mention Rihanna who acts all cool in her as expected trashy accent and am so cool attitude is just another worthless addition in its cast therefor i wont waste my time on her.I can go on and on like this.

Nobody stands out, nobody really sucks, but it's not about the actors right?HUMOR: A lot of one-liners, a quite funny opening scene and a lot of scenes that makes you smile. Its entertaining!ACTION: We'll the most important thing is the Action. And the movie totally delivers. After about 20-30 Minute introduction (which is not too boring too watch) the action starts and it doesn't stop until the end credits. So basically it was one big action scene with some time to breathe between the attacks. There's everything. People with guns vs aliens, Ships vs alien spaceships, man without legs fist fighting an alien, it's all in there! Also the action always has a 150% testosterone in-your-face attitude...EFFECTS: state-of-the-art. if you saw transformers 3 you know how good special fx can be, and this movie is on the same level. there's nothing new but also there's nothing that looks bad. everything is made pretty damn good, and without 3D you even have a better overall view when the thing goes down.MUSIC/SOUND: sound effects are brilliant. sometimes you really feel that the screen is going to explode in front of your face. The Soundtrack clearly proofs for me again, that Steve Jablonsky is the new Hans Zimmer when it comes to loud action movies. Epic, epic, epic, as brilliant as transformers when it comes to the music department. Also the use of AC/DC songs during battles felt right and cool.ALIENS: I don't want to spoil too much. But YES you will see some alien faces, you will see them walking round, and battling humans in all different ways. They we're done pretty cool, but also not in a way which leaves you at the scene with an open mouth, pretty cool but nothing really new.OVERALL: Overall i can only say, this is a real damn good blockbuster. It has more action than all recent movies i can think about, and it's entertaining throughout the 2 hours. Yes, the style, the action, the heroism reminded me many, many times of Michael Bay, so if you're into really loud, stupid, fun action movies this is one for you!!!Go and see it in your local theater, because we want to be sure that Hollywood continues besides all these intellectual films to make loud, stupid action flicks!",Battleship

I don't care if its based on the Battleship game or not, I don't watch it to be critical or to look for any little thing wrong with it. I didn't get to watch it in the theater, so I bought a digital copy on itunes, then on vudu. It gives me a good feeling to watch it, even if some of the dialog is corny. I like the music, and I especially like all of the special effects! My kids warned me before I saw this movie, that it wasn't going to be any good. They haven't seen it all the way through, just bits and pieces of it when I'm watching it. For me, this movie is just plain fun and entertaining.",Battleship

Military propaganda film with a lame romantic which should be obvious to most intelligent individuals. Movie has weak character development,a disjointed story line, and the action centers around long boring stretch of property damage. Okay, yes, the graphic are pretty good, but having that that alone is not a good film in the make. The acting is stiff and mediocre at best where even Liam Neeson didn't save this film.

The alien characters are done up good almost human like and not like ET and Predator imitations. The alien technology is good. It is funny to see that the aliens have a conscience .

911,gnomegeorge,Great action film with great sound effects,9,10 March 2015,"Honestly, I don't see why many people hate this film. It is a fantastic film with great effects.If any of you actually commanded a destroyer or even a ship in your life, you'd realise the commands they say are in fact legit ship commands in real life. ""Ahead flank"" for example is commanding the ship at full out speed. The sound effects are awesome, especially through proper speakers with sub-woofer response. This is one of my go to films for when I want an awesome sound effect to make me feel great.Who cares if it isn't ""realistic""? How the hell would you know what realistic is? So many people are up their own arse they forget what a great film is all about. Sci-Fi is all about the impossible and that is what makes this film great. If you want to know my back story, I have watched a SERIOUS amount of films in my time and I know when a film is good or not. I hated the Amazing Spiderman 2. It was bland, full of so many holes and even unrealistic events. Yes Battleship too shows the exact same things at some points but they made it about the actual BATTLESHIP that they commanded at the end. Not the actual board game despite their references towards it when the Japanese commander Nagata took control and used NOAA data.. now that's something! They also reference The Art of War... I mean come on, that book was written on warfare and is still relevant to this day. I love warfare and strategy, this film told me they knew exactly what they were talking about.Anyway, it's great for when you want to watch something full of action and aliens. So it's not realistic and the acting is mediocre apparently... who cares? Let that go and just enjoy it. They have made up for it in terms of actual references towards REAL life situations and quoting actual warfare.You can have serious amounts of fun with this film if you just let all reality go. Same with Pacific Rim. I predicted every part of that film but still loved it because the action was insane. So many people forget that what makes a good film. Seriously, just enjoy it and you'll find it's a great.",Battleship

However I have seen the critic and user reviews and personally I am wondering what they went into the cinema expecting. Was the science accurate, no it wasn't. Was the acting high quality, not really. Were the CGI and special effects good, they definitely were. I've seen people complaining about lack of character development and storyline, but what were they expecting from a film based off a hasbro board game containing enough explosions to qualify as a Michael bay movie. Personally I think this movie does what it was designed to do, entertain. Anyone who tells me they saw the trailer and went for complex plot and dialogue is in my opinion a complete idiot.",Battleship

A little bit unrealistic in parts, but its Hollywood, so that's to be expected. Liam Neeson provides his usual solid performance. Rihanna is believable as a Navy enlisted sailor. Brookly Decker is nice eye candy and not a terrible actress. Would have like to have seen a little more attention paid to the purpose of the aliens. Peronally, I thought it was better than battle for Los Angeles. But I love Battleships, so I may be a tad bit biased. :) Overall, I would recommend the movie, but don't go in expecting a Oscar winning effort.

(Hint: give yourself a big CGI budget so you don't have to pay for trivial things like actors and scriptwriters)From this mix, remove some of the less important stuff like: Physics, logic, common sense, acting, dialogue, character development, etc. Finally, make sure you have the whole thing scripted and directed by a video game designer that played one too many games of Battleship when they were a kid and you too could create a ""Blockbuster"" :-) Oh yeah, almost forgot... It's important that you give a 5-minute part to a well-known actor so you can attract some viewers... I'll give it 4 stars simply because the folks that did the CGI work actually did put some 'effort' into it...

I can see that it didn't get a lot of money and good ratings and I can see why. There are some plot holes that make you cringe a little and some of the acting isn't all that great. But its one of my favorite movies to watch. Im a huge action junky and I can appreciate a movie like this when it comes to the plot and the story. It may not be the best movie of all time, but it sure is something to enjoy when you look past all the minor mistakes. I think its a cliché but that makes it all the more exciting and thrilling to watch. Plus, I think most of the cast is pretty attractive and i'll admit their witty jokes make me laugh. Maybe try re watching it and not looking at it from a cynical 50 year old critic's opinion. (No offense intended) Its a lot of fun to watch.",Battleship
919,roquecarballo,Entertaining,7,2 August 2016,"Battleship appeared in cinemas in 2012 and the duration is 2 hours and 11 minutes. The people who participate in the cast are Taylor Kitsch, Lieutenant Alex Hopper, Alexander Skarsgård, Rihanna, Brooklyn Decker, Tadanobu Asano, Hamish Linklater, and Liam Neeson. This film can fall into 3 genres: action, adventure and Science- Fiction. The film is about sea war exercises with other countries in Hawaii. During the exercises, five alien spacecrafts arrive and the US destroyers open fire. The battle was a trap and all of US destroyers exploded. But the survivors went to the old battleship ""Missouri"" that was in a museum. They turn on the engine and they went to the final war. In my opinion the story is very bad but the special effects are epic. Moreover the war settings, which I love it, and the music makes my stay very exciting. The most important evidence that I base on for this opinion is: the aliens appears are bad explain because the NASA don't advise for the rapprochement. We should know that is a patriotism film because the new ships are better than the old battleships but now is in style the ""old school"".

I am normally a sci-fi fan and I even tolerate (enjoy) exaggerated movies such as ID4 and Skyline. Battleship, however, breaks a very basic rule: it insults the audience's intelligence. Seriously, in what universe the writers/director got the *brilliant* idea that a museum ship which is docked at least for 10 years, boarded with a bunch of retired (really) old veterans would destroy an alien spaceship? Give me a break!!!! I felt like someone had raped my brain. This movie was a waste of money. The special effects are good (not the best I have ever seen, but still good and the only reason for my 4/10 rate). Acting is mediocre. Plot is close to zero (based on board game LOL).

If you read one that doesn't, you might as well go see the movie. Yes, its that bad. Stupidity has a new name in cinema - Battleship! US military propaganda for morons, defies belief. Actually, i have to give credits for propaganda, as complete opposite in itself. Some folks talk about how CGI was wonderful, even that was nullified , as it was stunned, bashed and smacked into ground by everything else in this movie, story, plot, acting... you name it, its epitome in negative terms.This movie is actually a statement of neoliberal capitalism, in its finest purified form...

The protagonist is in the beginning of the movie a loser and later turns out to be the leading hero. This just happens very fast and with a lack of character development. The other characters and the main character feel very clichéd. What else should one expect, when watching a typical Hollywood movie. The special effects are really good, which made me endure the movie from the start to the end. The worst thing about the movie is the plot, which just makes no sense. This is what bordered me - An alien species can travel light years from their standard point to earth, which indicates that they are technologically far far ahead from the human race. One would think the alien race would have super high tech weapons or a powerful shield to protect their ships, but the film shows nothing of a kind even do the alien races ships are a bit superior. And still like in every Hollywood movie, the human race with their inferior weapons manages to defeat the superior alien race.I suggest not wasting your money watching these movie in the cinema.

However...Battleship has no misconceptions about what it is. Its a pop corn flick.I watched it with my girlfriend the other night and I had been putting it off because I kept hearing bad things and reading poor reviews. I was happy and surprised to see that this was an entertaining movie that I would indeed watch again. My girlfriend also enjoyed it because SHE KNEW what we were going to see. The message in this review...if you can call it a review...more like a defence....or an attack on 'so called' movie buffs who just hate on everything that's not safe to like....anyway, the message is that we the viewers have the power to go and see what we want. If you went to battleship and got ANYTHING other then was clearly advertised...you need to rethink your viewing strategy. I did not go see 'The Vow'....Why? cause I thought it looked like a tear jerky chick flick and I can't stand that crap...I went and saw Battleship....why?....because I wanted to see sh*t blow up!I'm looking forward to seeing Taylor Kitsch in Savages.

937,enoeth821,Another typical hollywoodian bullshit wrapped in a nice package !,3,16 June 2012,"Contains spoilers !!! The script is just awful, how in God's name would extraterrestrials that travel light years from earth, not only send flying ships that DON'T FLY .. just hop around the water !! ?! #$@!$ but also carry no other kind of weapons but flying cans ... that's right, FLYING CANS !!!! ... no lasers, no fast-firing-guns ... not even some freakin' guided missiles ... And to top it all up, although they sent the ""scout"" espadrille apparently to invade the planet later on, they not only not instantly destroy any potential threat to them (such as those destroyers), letting them try once or twice to attack them, taking their time as if they're playing with them, toying with them, BUT they don't even destroy the destroyer that was coming towards them on a collision course ... what the hell ?!?! just because the destroyer decided to change course and rescue those people and he had his weapons jammed and couldn't fire, doesn't mean it wasn't a threat THEN and neither in the future !!!! ... they analyzed the ship and it had dangerous weapons.Just because the screen goes from red to green DOESN'T mean it's not a threat ... okay, perhaps not right then, but if they were smart enough to build star-ferrying ships, they should have been smart enough to realize they could pose a threat in the near future.NEXT: The yo-yo flying thingies destroyed an entire freakin' base, but just happened to miss a whole HUGE freakin' standing battleship right in the harbor ... unbelievable.And the aliens just hesitate and don't instantly destroy their enemies ... WHAT ARE THEY, SLOW ? are they mentally retarded ? Cos' if they are, they shouldn't be flying around in space. It's bad for their health and others, hazardous, danger danger.And the alien who just popped on board the destroyer out of the blue, saying he was ""fished"" out of the water by a fisherman ... really !?!? WHAT, WHERE, HUH ?And when that Japanese guy tried to shoot those two alien ships using the signaling buoy. The buoys would send data of their position, how much above/below the sea-level, and logic states the buoys would change position when the enemy ships would HIT them .. and since they showed that they're underwater every time the ships were there, then it means the ships HOP around. In lack of radar, they targeted the buoys using rockets. Tomahawks perhaps.This being said, how STUPID must the writers be to make the Japanese guy give the firing order of the rockets right when the buoys are being hit, knowing that the rockets take a reasonable amount of time to hit the target. WHAT THE F#%! ?! And he did this ALL THE TIME, THREE TIMES IN A ROW and if you watch closely, the rockets shouldn't have hit the last time in any reasonable universe, given the velocity of the rockets on the radar. IT's IMPOSSIBLE !!! FOR GOD SAKES, he should have fired the rockets 2-3 seconds before he thought the buoy would be hit by the ships, since the rockets were targeting the buoys ...WHO THE HELL writes these piece of crap of a screenplay and more importantly, how the hell does it get approved ?!?! And the absurd way the battleship gets instantly stopped by the anchor ... what did it hang on to, THE TITANIC ?!??! even if it did, it wouldn't have stopped the ship that way, it is absurd ... in all the movies you see how the anchor, at high speed of a ship, gradually slows the ship until a minimum amount of speed is reached, when it can ONLY THEN sink properly into the sea floor. I mean, I'm no geologist, It's just plain f'in common sense.Then again, well, I'm a computer engineer and I do have a brain, unlike the people who write these pathetic screenplays and get them approved. They should get sued for wasting everyone's time and money with such a HUGE CON !!! I mean, this happens so bloody often these days, you get a trailer packed with impressive graphics, action, that's soooo misleading and makes you think the movie's so good, while all-in-all, the trailer has ALL ... not some, but ALL the best parts in the movie and you can basically tell how the entire movie's plot is going to be, BUT not how the movie overall it'll be. So disappointing...Many Hollywood movies nowadays are such HUGE CONS because the end product they are promoting and marketing is nowhere near the one you end up seeing ... It's like they're promoting a movie telling you it's worth 10$ by showing you 3 minutes of it (2.5 % of total movie), and with those 3 minutes in mind, thinking that at least 50 % of the movie will be like that, you're bought ... when in fact just 5 minutes tops is of any comparable quality .. so just 4%. I'd say that is a CON ! Too bad the movie has such a frustrating screenplay, script, because the computer generated graphics are decent, quite good and the tech team really did it's job ... unlike the writers ...",Battleship
