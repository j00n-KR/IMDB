0,Leofwine_draca,Perfect storm,2,23 September 2021,"This was incredibly bad. No wonder the studio didn't want it and I wonder why Netflix picked it up. The perfect storm of what happens when you pick a bad actor and pair him with a bad director. Washington has his dad's voice but none of his talent, so he looks like he's playing in a comedy for the most part. Even worse is the amateur director who adds no suspense, intrigue or thrills to the story, so the whole thing is predictable and to order. The only saving grace this has is the Greek locations, which make a nice change from the norm; the rest is pure trash and one of the worst mainstream films I've seen recently.",Beckett
1,kosmasp,Not my vacation,7,14 August 2021,"Remember this is a movie. For that there are things that are heightened. I for one thought it is interesting having some villain shadow ... whatever operate in Greece. Also our main character here is no superhero. He won't Bourne his way out of things ... he has to rely on luck (and some shoody writing on the bad guys part too of course).Having said all that, bonus points for shooting in Greece (evident on many occasions and just a small little detail like the plastic water bottle being used during a car drive almost at the beginning is one testament of that) ... and having many talk in Greek. Which our main character does not understand at all.You could argue that he puts a lot of lives in danger of the folk who are so willing and eager to help. But there is not time to think about small things like that ... the movie has a pace that seems relentless and never stopping.Works out pretty fine at the first half of the movie, gets a bit dragging towards the beginning of the second part. And as stated above the villains seem especially ... well light minded? Is that politically correct way of putting it? Whatever the case, this is a rock solid thriller, which is not an indicator how your next vacation (in Greece or elsewhere in Europe) will go down.",Beckett
2,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Flawed but enthralling thriller,7,31 August 2021,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningBeckett (John David Washington) is on holiday with his girlfriend April (Alicia Vikander) in an exclusive resort in Greece. One night, they are forced to take a detour, and a car accident occurs. Beckett awakens in hospital, while Lena is tragically killed. Met with some interference when he discusses taking her body home, upon leaving the hospital, Beckett stumbles upon a conspiracy that sees him pursued by two crooked cops, drawing him in to something bigger and more deadly than he could have imagined.Fresh from his star-making turn in Christopher Nolan's most recent big budget mind bender Tenet, John David Washington follows up this big event piece with this smaller scale, but more grounded thriller from Netflix. With a title emphasising the central character, it's fitting given it focuses centrally on him, making his way through his increasingly convoluted chain of events, and not breaking away throughout.Director Ferdinando Cito Filomarino creates an eerie sense of isolationism and claustrophobia with the sunny Mediterranean outback, and deserted side streets our protagonist makes his way through, as well as a genuine air of mystery and suspense as to what's going on and the motivations behind it. He also taps in to the current social climate, with the depiction of a lone black man begging for help from the public who see him chased by police he says are accosting him for the wrong reasons. It's let down, though, by an overly drawn out ending that crushes the suspense rather than keeping you on edge, and an increasing sense of disbelief as events proceed.It's flaws stop it from being the complete sum of its parts, but Washington is still a commanding leading man with oodles of potential, and this is nothing to be sniffed at on his resume. ***",Beckett
3,Cineanalyst,Delphic American Savior,5,14 August 2021,"What a nauseating beginning to what turns out to be a perfectly mediocre action movie. After going on for some 10 minutes, much more of the eponymous Beckett and his girlfriend's lovey-dovey, cutesy-wootsy foreplay, and I would've been ready to run their car off the road. These American vacationers (well, I guess Alicia Vikander is Swedish, but whatever) in Greece display some of the most irritating intimacy ever filmed, I swear--talking nonsense to each other, fondling each other while driving, drawing a heart on him--grown adults acting like horny teenagers.Otherwise, and despite what the extra-T ""Beckett"" might conjure regarding more thoughtful fare involving a Thomas or a Samuel Becket, this ""Beckett"" is a good alternative for anyone who enjoyed watching John David Washington running around in ""Tenet"" (2020), but would rather not engage with a complicated narrative, or those who liked the conspiratorial intrigue of him in ""BlacKkKlansman"" (2018), but wished the politics of it were vague to the point of irrelevance. Communists and fascists, oh my. An old-fashioned American-savior narrative, but without the white guilt, an unwitting wrong-man mystery solved during panting breaks in between fighting and chasing. The scenery is nice, though, and, granted, a movie that begins by prophesizing the hero at the ruins of the Oracle of Delphi can't be all bad, although grand, Ancient Greek tragedy this isn't. Watch the ""John Wick"" shoot-'em-ups for that, seriously.There's also the debatable appeal of Washington's hero not being without personal guilt and being mostly realistically human--limited by injuries, fatigue, panic attacks, an' all. Yet, he still ends up doing a Batman in a parking garage. If Washington keeps this up, Marvel or DC is going to cast him in one of their superhero burgers.",Beckett
4,ops-52535,great film but...,6,13 August 2021,"Made on a ultrathin budget, with a directing that may have been a final exam at a italian film school, shot and filmed mostly in italy, in a plot of american citizens fight or flight thriller that never gives you rest. The even more disturbing truth is that its supposed to take place in greece where a soothing love story turns into a nervewrecking political communistic/anarchistic and ever so opportunistic drama where you cant trust anyone, not even your fellow citizen diplomats (u.s. Embassies has a fringed reputation it seems.)well its a very basic production, not many cameras and shots made, and that the film turns out like it does is due to the magnificent acts by mr washington, and his co actress, cause the plot of greek politics is like a dantes inferno, and to know the greek turmoil and unrest over the last years will be of great value to understand the storyline.So dont boost your expectations, and just let yourself be sucked into the groove of the action, its not a must see film, rather a could be seen film.the grumpy old man awards with a max of 6 stars.",Beckett
5,Thanos_Alfie,In tense...,6,21 September 2021,"""Beckett"" is an Action - Drama movie in which we watch a man finding himself in the middle of a political conspiracy after the occurrence of a car accident. He has to find his way out before it's too late for him.I liked this movie because it had a nice, mysterious and very in tense plot with plenty of action scenes and much of a drama. The combination between drama and action worked very well and the result was this beautiful movie. The interpretation of John David Washington who played as Beckett was very good and he made the difference. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Alicia Vikander's who played as April, Boyd Holbrook's who played as Tynan and Panos Koronis' who played as Officer Xenakis. To sum up, I have to say that ""Beckett"" is a nice movie to spend your time with and I highly recommend you to watch it.",Beckett
6,cruise01,Entertaining thriller but plot is boring.,7,29 October 2021,3.5 out of 5 stars.Pretty fair action thriller film. John David Washington did good. Alicia Vikander had a short role. It does have a lot of action thrills. Watching John David escape corrupt officers and bad guys. While getting shot at or stabbed. Plot loses itself with its political protest premise that is boring.,Beckett

8,alindsay-al,A Poor Convoluted Film,3,24 August 2021,"It seems like this film has been watched plenty over the last few days on Netflix so I watched Beckett and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a man trapped in Greece on the run for his life.Main Character
John David Washington has been really busy lately and he plays the lead role here and he is very good in the role. He is really the only character in the film and you follow him all the way through this mad journey and his performance is easily the best part of this mess. It is a very physical performance and he just feels like your normal guy and he is the one you feel sympathy for.Supporting Characters
As I said Washington is the star here and the only real character in the film despite there being some stellar talent on show here. Alicia Vikander, Boyd Holdbrook & Vicky Krieps are in this film and all of them are fine and decent as you would expect but it just feels at the same time that they are wasted. These are some great performers and they are all basically cameos who Washington comes across and that is a let down.Story
The story is an absolute shambles, I still am not sure why Washington's character was on the run. The film overcomplicates every aspect of the story and I checked out after 10 mins, it struggles to engage and make you care about anything other then David Washington's strong performance. The film also has a pretty insulting ending that makes you wonder why you even bothered.Script
The script is also weak, this is a boring miserable script that doesn't connect you with what exactly is going on. Whoever, wrote it clearly wanted to make this really complex thriller but it just fails miserably at it.Style
The style of the film is also just a bit slow, I think this is meant to be a thriller but it doesn't have much that is thrilling about it. There are some action scenes but they don't make sense, this is an average guy who somehow turns into Batman and manages to beat people up in creative ways and it just doesn't add up. The film just isn't paced well and takes way too long to get going and doesn't keep you hooked throughout.Overall
Overall, Beckett is a bad movie. It has a strong lead performance and not much else and I just don't see who it appeals to so I would give it a skip.",Beckett
9,kwenchow,"Another worst action film! Full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Avoid at all cost!",1,10 September 2021,"This film start with two people(Beckett, and April) talking on the bed, and they copulate scene! As turnout, this film is about Beckett need to survive from the killing of a bunch of corrupted cops, after he knowing a kid been kidnapped! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the walking scene, overuse of the searching scene, overuse of the staring scene, overuse of the calling names scene, overuse of the eating scene, overuse of the drinking scene, overuse of the running scene, overuse of the driving scene, overuse of the treatment scene, overuse of the riding train scene, overuse of the talking on the phone scene, and overuse of the song playing at the background scene! Make the film unwatchable! All the action scene have blood at certain point, but overall portray by sideways, messy, and occur in too short in time! Make the film frustrated to watch! At the end, Beckett saved the kid who been kidnapped! That's it! Wasting time to watch!",Beckett
10,joiningjt,"It was decent, it's no fugitive but what is? Worth a watch!",6,2 September 2021,"1st off people QUIT COMPARING John to Denzel, it's not fair and its moronic. They're different people, just because hes his son doesn't automatically make him exactly like his father. He does an excellent job yes I prefer Denzel more but hes a once in a decade kind of talent. His son is above average and who knows where he will go from here. This film wasn't the fugitive and the writing AND directing didnt come close. So he did what he could with an average script and plot. I didn't like the 3 story jump onto a moving car just leave crap like that out but we both enjoyed the film and it was entertaining which is why we ALL WATCH MOVIES, TO BE ENTERTAINED!!! Give it a go!!",Beckett
11,masonfisk,JDW BRINGS IT HOME...!,7,24 August 2021,"A recent Netflix original starring John David Washington. Washington is vacationing overseas in Greece w/his girlfriend, played by Oscar winner Alicia Vikander (frankly wasted here!) who do the usual touchstone sightseeing practices but on their way to their next pitstop at night, Washington falls asleep at the wheel causing their car to crash, go off the road & slide into a shack, breaking through its wall. Coming to, Washington sees a woman & child in the rear of the structure who quickly vanish when they see him stirring. Alas Vikander has died in the accident & as Washington is still visibly shaken by the entire episode (he wears a cast on an arm) even not telling Vikander's parents over the phone the bad news, he's definitely in a bad place. Hopefully to shake him from his obvious funk, he makes his way back to the scene of the crime where a woman appears a distance away who opens fire on him, sending Washington into the Grecian wilds hoping to get to safety. He befriends a pair of women in a town, one of which was played by Vicky Krieps (currently in Old), who give him a ride & where the obligatory exposition dump comes where we find out the boy Washington saw was presumed dead but is actually being held hostage to hold leverage over a politician running in a current election. Even finding solace at the American embassy is a pipe dream when an unctuous operative, played by Boyd Holbrook, promises sanctuary but tries to kill him as well. Not as fun as Hitchcock would've made in his day, this film still manages to fray the nerves as the audience tries to get ahead of the narrative & our sympathies fall back on the battered Washington as his situation becomes perilously worse & worse. Washington does a lot of the dramatic heavy lifting here & its to his credit he makes what could've been a mundane affair of suspense imminently watchable as he essays a man who is very real & not some superhero who'll worry about the tears later.",Beckett
12,ks-60500,A cat story,6,15 August 2021,"I really enjoy this kind of self survive kind movie. From beginning to the end the excitement was there, along with the mysterious parts. Wonder a cat life he has since he's not Liam Neeson.",Beckett
13,I_Ailurophile,Suitable if familiar political thriller,6,14 August 2021,"Between initial minor exposition and the dramatic turn, early scenes feel a bit common, suggesting right away we could be watching any politically-tinged thriller from cinema spanning decades. The notable uptick in intrigue as the plot begins in earnest is more actively engaging, and holds our attention well. 'Beckett' isn't the most wholly original film in the world, but it's duly entertaining, and well made.It's easy to be low-key drawn to star John David Washington, as he bears definite warmth and charisma. I think this is the first film I've seen him in, and it's instantly noteworthy how closely he resembles his father, Denzel. In the way he carries himself, and in his vocal timbre, the likeness is unmistakable. One hardly wishes to emphasize this point when speaking more directly to a film, but it's a worthwhile point of comparison since 'Beckett' feels in no small part like a classic Denzel vehicle - and John David handles the part most capably.If somewhat familiar, the twists in the plot are suitably exciting. The writing is generally fine, though connections between A and B are sometimes specious. Scenes are orchestrated well, especially more action-oriented moments, even if there's nothing specifically remarkable about the technical craft. For the most part the roles are somewhat strictly defined for the cast, but everyone embodies their characters well, helping to bring the picture to life. I do appreciate the original music of composer Ryuichi Sakamoto, ably building and maintaining suspense with a largely minimalist score.It doesn't feel like there's a great deal more to be said without discussing plot points. This is enjoyable, satisfying, and reasonably sound in its build, even though it doesn't necessarily stand out among similar films. I'm not sure I'd say one should go out of their way to watch it, but to come across 'Beckett,' it's a thriller that's an okay watch if you're not hyper-discerning in your selections.",Beckett

15,nancyldraper,Convoluted and Implausible,5,14 August 2021,"This is a convoluted plot, filled with implausible twists and turns. I wanted it to be better for Alicia Vikander's sake but it just didn't work for me. I give this film a 5 (meh) out of 10. {Crime Thriller}",Beckett
16,arungeorge13,The film doesn't do justice to its beautiful locales! [+53%],5,13 August 2021,"Beckett borders on being an okay-to-good action flick. The commendable aspect of the film is that its set-pieces are realistically paced. Also, every bullet piercing, limb snapping, and wound inflicted upon the protagonist adds up to something. So, the makers respect the action genre in a sort of ultra-pure way. Beckett is also very Hitchcockian in its plot (only on paper) but it's nowhere as thrilling as any of Hitchcock's works. John David Washington is still very green when it comes to the emotional scenes, while Alicia Vikander leaves a greater impact even though she's hardly in the film. A sense of urgency is lacking in many supposedly 'thrilling' scenes. A number of scenes feel a tad stretched out. The Greek locales, however, are just too beautiful to look at. Maybe, they deserved a better structured, less derivative action flick to represent them? Overall, a strictly serviceable effort.",Beckett
17,leftbanker-1,"Terrible Script, Nice Scenes of Lovely Greece, Not Worth Your Time",1,17 August 2021,"Right off the bat, before I've seen a single frame of the film, I can tell that it's too long at 1h50m, or probably too long. This is a common problem with Netfix movies I've noticed. Just because we are watching these movies in the comfort of our own homes doesn't mean the runtime can overstay its welcome. A thriller should be 1h30m. Everyone knows that. Twenty extra minutes can be an eternity.Even the title is stupid.I can tell them how to cut out ten minutes: lose the first ten minutes of the guy and his wife. We know from the trailer that she dies in a car accident, so start after that. We don't need to see him killing his own wife by driving while sleeping.Some truly awful action scenes, but more than anything, this was just a complete mess. Hire a competent writer would be my recommendation. This made almost no sense.",Beckett

20,HabibieHakim123,"With All The Lacks, Once It's Good, It's So Good",8,16 August 2021,"8.5/10
The movie lacks in every non-dialogue scene, it was too slow and it was pretty boring, but while they back at it, with a great dialogue, amazing performance by everybody especially Washington's, incredible action, great score, and great story, it was pretty hard for me to really going way down for the score, once it's good, it's so good, Beckett is still overall a great movie and one of the years best film.",Beckett
21,Movi3DO,Not a good thriller,4,14 August 2021,"So The Protagonist from Tenet is being hunted.A new Netflix political thriller. Beckett, on a tour with his girlfriend to Greece, got in a car accident and was then mysteriously involved in a political conspiracy.I generally don't like this type of thriller where a protagonist runs through a foreign soil while being chased. They usually felt lackluster. And unfortunately this movie was no different.The first noticeable thing was the choice of music during the intense and running scenes. For some reason, the director used the string horror sound effects for a political thriller. Not only did it feel out of place, it also ruined the thrill. There were also other odd music choices that just did not fit the situation.Even though the political conspiracy was the main mystery, it did not matter that much in the movie. The purpose of the mystery was creating a sense of urgency to the chase scenes and making audiences anxious to see the revelation. I got none of that from this movie. There was only 2 exposition scenes where characters just spit out info on the political background in Greece. I just could not see the importance of the political situation in the movie. When the twist hit, it almost made no sense.The thriller, although got ruined by the awful music choice, was still okay in certain scenes. John David Washington's decent performance helped the thrills just a bit.Overall, a weak thriller with a weak story. 4/10.",Beckett
22,lareval,"Watchable, but underwhelming",5,16 August 2021,"'Beckett' managed to kept me interested in its plot all the way but it's a disappointment overall.

So in order to create sympathy for him he must be continually shot, maimed and injured in nearly every fight scene.Lots of puzzling questions about why things are happening to him that only get answered later. This movie becomes more unbelievable as time goes on, finally ending with him being shot in the arm but he's fine. He gets shot through the belly and winces for 10 seconds and recovers. Then jumps from a 4 story building and lands on a car and still has the energy to fight and win.This feels like a super powers movie.",Beckett

25,jordan2240,Be skeptical of the good reviews,4,15 August 2021,"I'm sure there are people who genuinely like this movie, as pretty much no movie is ever bad or good to everyone, but I'd be skeptical of any review over 5. The whole premise makes little sense, there is absolutely no reason JDW would be able to defend himself, as his character has no background that would indicate it, and Greece looks like a slum, so there's no reason to watch for the cinematography. Can't really say much without revealing 'spoilers', so watch at your own risk. We watched because it starred Washington, but we're finding that he's not a particularly good actor, and the movies he picks aren't particularly good either. Haven't liked the last few he's been in. He's smart to be cashing in while he can, and I certainly don't blame him for working. This movie is unintentionally funny in spots, so it's not totally devoid of entertainment value.",Beckett
26,PedroPires90,Good but not for an American audience,7,14 August 2021,"👏 Really liked all the European vibes on this movie: scenario, cinematography, atmosphere, unusual pace for a thriller, direction style, score. Because of that, I also know many Americans won't like it.It doesn't feel like an American thriller at all, the action scenes here are not the focus and those ""little thriller"" vibes feel like fresh air after all the latest thrillers that try so hard to be bigger than the world.The plot is not that original and it's a bit predictable; The story could go further in many aspects and I would like to see a bit more of the supporting acts, but it is a very solid performance by John David Washington and it feels a realistic film for the most time (well, forget that jump on the parking lot 😄).",Beckett
27,namstonk,Woeful script and matched by the acting,1,14 August 2021,"Ok you can accept Vikander being bad as she has been in virtually all her previous outings, but for Washington and Holdbrook you expect much much more.

28,stevenrotherforth,Don't jump Beckett you'll never make it!,7,2 September 2021,"BeckettMovie 6.5/10Whilst holidaying in rural Greece with his Girlfriend,
Beckett played by the ever likeable John David Washington is involved in a tragic accident. His life is turned upside down when he awakes and is mysteriously pursued by crooked cops and officials all out to put an end to his existence.We the audience are every bit as confused as Beckett as to why these people are trying to kill him. This helps ramp up the tension and excitement allowing the audience to go along for the ride. For the most part 'Beckett' is a slickly paced thriller. The first ten minutes or so are sickly sweet as Beckett and girlfriend April played by Alicia Vikander constantly tell each other how madly in love they are. I believe this was DirectorFerdinando Cito Filomarino's attempt to make the consequences of the horrific car accident all the more poignant. Instead it becomes vomit inducing and painful to watch.""I love you!""
""No I love you more!!""Oh just get lost will the pair of you!!!Vikander's support is short and an actress of her calibre wasn't really needed for the role. Another familiar face is that of Boyd Holbrook who can play the sleazy bad guy in his sleep. It's no spoiler as you can see through his characters persona from a mile away.As far as thrillers go 'Beckett' isn't a bad offering and the action is mostly grounded. However there's a couple of jarring set pieces that belong in say a 'Mission Impossible or 'James Bond' movie. A certain scene involving Beckett jumping from a ledge in a parking lot wasn't fitting with the films more down to earth approach. Another scene where he leaps off a cliff into a tree was reminiscent of Rambo in 'First Blood'. These scenes momentarily took me out of the movie and spoiled what would have been a believable thriller.Picture quality 9/10Available on Netflix'Beckett' looks sublime. Presented in 4K with Dolby Vision, this is a gorgeous natural looking movie. Very cinematic with a fine layer of film grain. Detail is razor sharp with facial closeups revealing every pore and wrinkle. Clothing fibre is rendered superbly with the fibres of material being very visible.Buildings have a rundown appearance with crumbling brick and rock expressing deep textures. This isn't a flashy looking picture rather one that will show off the capabilities of a good TV or projector. Panning shots of the sumptuous Greek landscapes are majestic. Cinematography by Sayombhu Mukdeeprom is breathtaking. The Dolby Vision presentation elevates colours giving scenery a more natural and rustic appearance.Sound quality 7/10Unfortunately'Beckett' gets a standard Dolby Digital Plus mix. I'm puzzled as to why. We are gifted with a glorious Dolby Vision image only to be short changed in the audio department.The 5.1 mix offered isn't a bad one but the fantastic musical score by Ryuichi Sakamoto would have benefited from the use of height speakers. An Atmos sound mix totally makes more sense. However the mix on offer does a decent job. LFE is handled sparingly but effectively. The car crash scene offers realistic impact. Gunshots have a nice bassy pop but 'Beckett' is subdued in terms of dynamic sound.It's all about the nuances and fine detail. Crowd scenes and the expanse of wilderness offer great atmosphere. All the more reason why a Dolby Atmos sound mix would have been the icing on the cake.Final thoughtsI enjoyed'Beckett'. By no means a masterpiece of the genre but it is entertaining and showcases the fine talent of John David Washington. Like his father it doesn't really matter what he's starring in. They both elevate the production just with their presence.",Beckett

30,whitemanfromtowne,A six only because Washington is playing roles that you don't see most American black actors playing.,6,14 August 2021,"Beckett is a slow burner meh film. But my real take away is Washington is playing roles you don't see a host of black actors playing. An actor not coming from hip hop, or comedy, or sports, no tats, no piercings, no cross dressing, and he's non British. You don't see a lot that coming from the African-American male genre of actors today. And although this film was kinda boring Washington is bringing back a sense of norm to black actors I haven't seen in a long time outside of his father, and Will Smith. That's why I give this film a six.",Beckett

32,ginocox-206-336968,Sub-par direct-to-video fare,2,24 August 2021,"Beckett (2021) starts at a painfully tedious pace, chronicling a romance between Beckett (John David Washington) and April (Alicia Vikander), two Americans vacationing in Greece, neither of whom seems particularly interesting. The inciting incident doesn't occur until thirteen minutes in, but it seems more like half an hour. A calamitous event occurs, resulting in Beckett seeing a seemingly inconsequential something he wasn't supposed to see, making him the target of some bad people who spend the rest of the film trying to kill him.The romance adds nothing of consequence to the film and could easily have been cut and replaced with a few lines of dialogue. In fact, Vikander's character could have been cut from the film. The relationship between Beckett and an activist is much more nuanced. Beckett is not an interesting character with no special skills, other than perseverance. He works in business systems integration, but seems a little slow on the uptake and never uses his professional skills. He seems to be the only black person in this area of Greece, making him an easier target for the villains.Alternatively, Beckett's character could have been eliminated and replaced by April, and would probably have made a more interesting film.The film ends abruptly with uncertain consequences and never fully explaining the plot, or whether several characters are alive or dead. Production values are typical for direct-to-video - adequate, but not exemplary. The best performance is by Boyd Holbrook as an embassy employee with his own agenda.",Beckett

He has a very narrow range of talent.I like Vikander, but she seemed really out of form. Really felt like this was a movie she would have done starting out her career.",Beckett
36,nidhunmoviebuff,"A bland, boring film that completely lacks narrative punch",5,17 August 2021,"John David Washington has been a very lucky actor so far in his career. In films like Black KlanKkKlansman (2018) and Tenet (2020) he was backed up by superb scripts and technical expertise.Unfortunately with the limited script and technical crew behind the new Netflix release Beckett, Washington's shortcomings as an actor are severely exposed.He plays the eponymous Beckett, a US tourist who gets stranded in Greece then goes on to get entangled in a political conspiracy to overturn an election.He comes across as extremely one-dimensional with his constant 'deer caught in the headlights' look and limited body language.For a movie intended as a survival thriller, director Fernando Cito Filomarino hasn't managed to imbue enough intrigue, edginess or suspense to keep the audiences engaged.The supporting cast doesn't do enough as well with Boyd Holbrook and Vicky Krieps putting in tedious performances. The usually dependable Alicia Vikander is criminally underutilized.Poor writing and execution let's down this interesting premise. Not recommended!",Beckett
37,leavymusic-2,V good,7,17 August 2021,"Wtf 5.6 in 2021, what do people want?Excellent, exciting film! One of the better ones of the year, surprised at the low rating.It's a rough tough ride in Greece for a couple that leads to gripping race for life.",Beckett
38,carlos-pires,Good effort... turns out boring and uninteresting,3,20 August 2021,"This movie has a couple of very good things. First and foremost, the amazing performance delivered with total commitment by John David Washington. And then you have the stark realism of how everything is shot and played out. But in the end, nothing can make up for the fact that the story is not interesting and the character is just another dumb tourist caught up in a conspiracy. It's just a badly written script. There is no character arc, there is no apparent inner conflict, there are no plot twists, nothing to hold your interest.The realistic mode of direction (which in itself is very well accomplished) actually turns out to be a flaw, turning the dull script into an even duller movie.It is also now clear to me that Netflix movies are stretched out on purpose. This one is almost 2 hours long when it could have been less than 90 minutes.",Beckett
39,Mivas_Greece,"Inspired by true events in previous years in Greece, very good action/crime movie. Worth a watch.",7,22 August 2021,"Crime / action film shot entirely in Greece. The film is somewhat reminiscent of the Fugitive style with Harrison Ford or Jason Bourne with Matt Damon, someone alone, chased by everyone who can not trust anyone and can not find redemption and rest. Although the film has a fiction story, it is inspired by real events of previous years in Greece. On the one hand the great austerity of the measures imposed by Germany during the years of economic crisis and Greeks suffered and the rise of a left-oriented political party that had not come to power until then and said it would change everything, on the other hand the empowerment of the Golden Dawn Nazis and murders they did as well as the murder of Alexis by a police officer, a teenager who had done absolutely nothing but he was just found in the wrong place and time. Overall, the film does not promote Greece as touristic, but it exaggerates some difficult years and combines them with fugitive and action. Washington was quite good and in the beginning played also sweet and beautiful Alicia Vikander, although the film didn't really have known actors from Greece or abroad. Overall quite good in its genre and recommended.",Beckett

But the story that the film develops may not be so convincing because in the end it becomes confusing, the film also handles many improbable situations when the protagonist has to get out of trouble, there are several script holes that come to light until the end of the movie.I enjoyed the suspense that was handled almost the entire film but the story of why that happens and how it is resolved seemed absurd to me, as well as the script holes that leave many doubts.",Beckett
42,lediscipledessocrates,Quite contrived,5,21 August 2021,"There is no way I can write a review for this film, without adding spoilers. So please be warned.Starting out as a promising movie ( in part due to the summary provided by Netflix), it takes very little time for the film to fall from grace.One tries hard to look for meanings and deeper interpretations, only to realise that the premise was in fact silly and contrived.Washington , for his part, does a great job; Other than that, the actors don't deliver in general.The screenplay and dialogue are not great. Attempts at dramatic twists fail on most occassions.In short, Beckett an American tourist accidentally drives off the road crashing into a house. He is badly injured, while his girlfriend dies due to the impact. Beckett witnesses two people in the house ( whilst he struggles to come out of the car. One being a young boy with red hair. After being rescued, the local Greek cops, learn that Beckett saw a boy in the house. They try to kill him and the thrilling race to survive begins for monsieur Beckett. Later in the movie, we learn along with Beckett that the kid in the house was a kin to an important politician, kidnapped to coerce the leader into oblivion. Some officials in the US embassy are also involved. Now the reason all these evil men and women are trying to kill Beckett, is to prevent him to spoiling their plan by revealing the truth.At this point, please step back and consider this for a moment. Had the cops not tried to kill Beckett, would he ever have put all these pieces together by himself? A person reeling under fresh trauma, who for a passing moment , while still in a crashed car so barely saw a boy and a woman in a village house.I don't think so. And hence the movie from that point on, is a farce.As a standalone, cat and mouse movie ( without the unnecessary political conspiracy, right left baggage), the movie is not bad.But then, is this reason enough to watch it?",Beckett

It became a repetition of - run, find someone/something convenient to help you on your way, they betray you...and then back to running again! It became very predictable by the third act, with nearly everyone becoming a 'double-agent'.I have to agree with some of the other reviews with regards to JDW's acting...holy mackerel - he clearly got his acting genes from his mom...because there were scenes in this that were so amateurish, that they wouldn't look out of place on TikTok. I've never watched a JDW film before (except a small part of Tenet), so I didn't realise he was so bad. His dad needs to have a few words with him.The sound isn't very good, but the cinematography is top-notch, with some great shots of the landscape of Greece (or wherever this was filmed).I somehow feel that this film could of been better if they had kept the girlfriend alive...and had both her and JDW on the run. Or even HER getting kidnapped...and JDW trying to rescue her, as I don't understand his motivation to rescue a little boy that he doesn't even know, or is actually 100% sure that he even saw.Overall - watchable, but very repetitive, with awkward pacing and sub-standard acting.",Beckett

Some locations are beautifully eerie, some other not at all. Every single room angle, every road turn has a local feeling. Greek people's english accent indeed sounds heavy like that. But most of them are - according to ancient custom of philoxenia (hospitality) - willing to help a fellow human in need despite his origin, providing food, shelter, or help.Inspired on actual events of the economic crisis, like the rise or extemist parties presenting themselves as saviors while in reality being more rotten than the rest of the political system, while their confrontation uses innocent teenage lives.

But once the accident happens it gets interesting.There are lots of positives - I loved how it was set in Greece, very fresh and different and I loved the rural authentic locations. However I didn't really enjoy the plot with the kidnapped boy and the political unrest. The ending was a little immediate for me - I got left feeling 'is that it?' - I wanted to see what happened next to Beckett.He should have been more suspicious of the people he trusted and you lose the sense of the films realism once he jumps off the multi-storey car park onto the car!

The story is nothing special and another twist on the (Hitchcockian) concept of an innocent man being caught up in a political scheme. JD Washington does a more than solid job and the Greek location feels fresh and authentic.

This, despite have a car crash, getting shot twice and getting knifed.There was no discernible story and this was even thrown out at the end. Don't need to kill you now, end of story. Trite garbage.I did learn that despite the aforementioned injuries, you can still outrun and outfight able bodied highly trained bad guys and do a perfectly timed jump from a 4 story parking lot building without getting hurt.

56,untilnow99,It Has Its Moments,7,16 August 2021,"Argghhhhh. The beginning was SO s-l-o-w. I nearly gave up at around 15 minutes. Painful to watch especially because, as other commenters have noted, the chemistry between Beckett and. April is Less Than Zero. What the hell was that dopey dialogue between them? Pffft.I thought ""April"" looked familiar. Didn't even realize it was Vikander. But never mind, she was soon out of the picture. Washington is kind of fun to watch, but he needed better direction and the script definitely was lacking in so many ways.At one point (SPOILER ALERT)----I found myself saying, out loud, ""Okay. So far this guy has been in a major car accident, broke his wrist/arm. Been shot at and wounded, jumped off a cliff into a treetop, finds a helpful local who is then either beat to crap or shot------plus the dude's dog gets killed . . . He's been stung by a honeybee (FYI----if one honeybee stings you, the rest are gonna come for you)------Let's see ------ Oh, yeah, he wrestles with a Greek cop and shoots the cop in the foot. Then he (fast forward) gets stabbed in the underground/subway (or was it just his hand got sliced?). He runs and runs and run some more. Finally gets to the US Embassy only to find out the US Consulate dude is part of the team trying to off him (easily predictable).Another car accident, running head on into a truck. He's stumbling all around, in filthy clothing (he must have REEKED on that train) and for the longest time his hands are zip-tied cuffed (with the German girl FINALLY asking, 'Do you want me to get that for you?' Well . . . DUH.) Oh---- and this entire time we see him eat and drink NEXT TO NOTHING.""After the to-myself recap, Beckett runs a marathon series of steps, with the Consulate guy only a few steps behind. Beckett beats the crap out of the US Consulate jerk and then breathes in a ton of tear gas, with no ill effect whatsoever. Next Beckett gets gut shot ----- up close ------and then runs and runs even more, only to jump off a great height and time it so as to land EXACTLY atop the Greek cop's car, as it tears out of the parking garage onto the street. Yeah, sure, why not?No broken legs or other injuries after landing on the car. Beckett is definitely super human.The whole thing, the entire film, blithely flits from suspension of disbelief to suspension of disbelief. But, guess what? I hung on till the end, to see if the red-headed kid would be rescued.My burning question: What happened with April's parents? They never made it to Greece?The scenery was great. I LOVED the two German girls, too. Lots of action----even if a lot of it was kind of unbelievable.To sum up: If you're not doing anything better, you could do worse than to watch this.",Beckett

But in reality, 20 mins in I was alternating between 1.25x and 1.5x speed due to boredom.*Casting*This type of movie really needed someone who can nail a slow paced movie, with *high level* emotion i.e. Life / death situations. However, the camera often lingers on JDW and he's not giving us enough; the facial expressions doesn't align with the tears.He & the woman have no chemistry; whilst they have minimal scenes together, it doesn't help.*Storyline*This is difficult to assess when you can't connect with the characters. However, the 'man on the run' premise has been done so many times & significantly better. It's predictable & I wasn't on the edge of my seat.Overall it gave me low-budget movie vibes.

58,The_Swedish_Reviewer,A story about the unluckiest man on Earth?,2,16 August 2021,"He kills his girlfriend in a car accident when he falls asleep behind the wheel. The car crashed into an abandoned house where he see something he shouldn't, becomes a target for two corrupt police officers and ends up on the wrong side of a manhunt. He is betrayed by an American diplomat he first trusted. He's beaten. He is stabbed. He gets shot. He's bleeding. Although he survived all the unfortunate events, he concludes that he should have died (instead of his girlfriend). Can one be that unlucky? Well, in ""Beckett"", Mr Beckett can.Few things make sense in this poorly written action thriller. The story itself is about political extremists, corruption, mafia affiliation and a man being on the run after being involuntary involved. But not much of the conflicting information about what is going on is really explained and the movie ends with some unanswered questions. What we know is that a black man is pursued by right-wing activists. The director made himself the trouble to put a picture of Obama at the US Embassy, ""forgetting"" that Trump most likely was the president when the movie was shot - an unnecessary and annoying liberal attention to detail. The location (Greece) may appeal to Americans, but for me as a Swede, the location felt very far-fetched and out of place for DJW's character. Like the director needed a black American actor in an anti-right-wing plot in order to land a lucrative Netflix contract.I've no idea why JDW was casted in this film, except the obvious reason above. He is a bad, two-dimensional, stone-faced actor with zero charisma and facial expressions and his interpretation of ""Beckett"" is no exception. Also, praised Alice Vikander (who is *surprise* *surprise* white) makes a stereotypical boring white girlfriend character nobody will remember. Unfortunately, all of the characters suffer from this problem.If you like to kill 2h on something meaningless, ""Beckett"" serves as temporary entertainment but will never go down in history as a memorable film.",Beckett

One thing that stood out to me is this film's depiction of Greece; it's not all white marble buildings and grogeous ocean vistas. I loved the grimy streets, the graffiti, the realistic looking characters. I thought it was really refreshing.Overall, I thought this was a pretty fun movie, with effective tension and a plot that thickens at the right pace. It is pretty shallow, politically, but is relatively believable. I just see this movie as a ""tourists worst nightmare"" story and it resonated with me.John David Washington is really likable as well and really grounds this kind of insane movie.The Bad: The first 10 minutes of this movie are absolutely awful. Alicia Vikander has a terrible American accent and delivers some truly bad dialog. It's awkward and stifled. Then, the car crash happens and the movie gets significantly better. I also felt like JDW gets a little too beat up in this movie, to the point of absurdity.The Ugly: In the spirit of unorthodox things to talk about, the opening song for this movie, (Honeydew or something) is TRULY awful.

He was awesome in BlacKkKlansman and Tenet as the leading man. I even enjoyed his work in Malcolm and Marie. So when I read an article last month saying this movie would be coming to Netflix I was excited. It had a good premise, and more importantly it was going to star Washington and the extremely talented and beautiful Alicia Vikander.Beckett was quite simply, awful. Netflix continues to let me down. They have spent so much money on rushing to create their own content and IP to compete in the streaming wars that quality has taken a backseat. Occasionally they will buck their own trend and give us something great like The Irishmen or Old Guard, but the usual is trash like GunPowder Milkshake. It's almost too obvious that the budget of these films is mostly spent on acquiring talent like Washington, leading to lackluster production in all other areas, like the Score, Cinematography, or even simple things like Editing. It's odd to me that Netflix can usually produce a quality series, but they can't figure out the formula for a good movie.Beckett is only watchable because of the acting talent of Washington, Vikander, and Holbrook. At this point, we should all give up hope that Netflix will ever produce quality movies on a consistent basis. The goal seems to be quantity of content, and not quality.",Beckett
65,filmtravel101,Jason Bland Beckett - terrible script and directing,4,13 August 2021,"I was very excited to see Denzel's son John David Washington and Alicia Vikander in this film yet once it started it was obvious in the slow burning first 15 mins that this first time director needs more time to learn the craft and writing better scripts. Another netflix straight to video terrible film in almost all aspects except the lovely Greek scenery.The chemistry does not work between Washington and Vikander and thankfully her part is very short lived and just a cameo or maybe she wanted a nice Greek holiday. The shots in the beginning are odd and trying to be artistic like cutting to her converse sneakers do not work and the editing is not very good and makes for strange moments rather than intimacy. It is almost like a bad euro romance film and then suddenly it turns into a Wanna be Jason Bourne on a low budget. Once the accident happens after 20 mins it just becomes hilarious and hard to digest that any of the main lead Washingtons actions have any merit whatsoever. There really is not enough back story of the political implications of the kidnapping to really care about the story or plot to push the action forward. The director is good with action sequences once things get started but with a script so shallow in any depth and confusing even when they finally explain the plot that you are left scratching your head why any of this is happening and who really cares. This is unfortunately a poor choice of a film for these leads and should have involved no name actors from EU. It is sad to see such a terrible script or maybe the back story was left in the editing room. It is a watchable film if you want to watch an endless scene of Washington being chased across all of Greece..and i mean literally ever village, country home, bus, train, bar and with pathetic fight action scenes that are non realistic action scenes and almost painful to watch. The best part is his jumping out of a 5th story garage on to a moving car below and not only lands on the roof - but then beats the driver with his own door and head. It is simply hilarious! At that point you just wonder what was the writer thinking when he wrote this script. And how did this get green lit and be acceptable to both main lead actors. Jason Nonsensical Beckett on a shoe budget. It might win Razzy awards.4 stars for the Greek scenery and both main actors trying their best to make a mess out of terrible script. Kudos for giving a first time director a chance... from Tenet to low budget Jason Boring film.. .is shocking to see how Washington thought this was a good idea.

Sure the plot was a bit weak, we never really understand why the US Embassy was in on the kidnapping, of who the mystery blonde is.... but I've seen worse.However, there were a few bits that would make even Jason Bourne weep, like when the male lead jumps 4 floors from a multi-story car park onto the escaping car, or that no matter how badly shot he is he still has enough energy to run about and escape very fit CIA types and policemen chasing him, etc.But the worst bit by far was Mr Washington's constant irritating stumbling around in almost every scene..... he really needs to go back to acting school and get that sorted out, it looked absolutely terrible, not convincing at all!The next worse bit was the incredibly bad casting of Alicia V as the short lived (literally) girlfriend love interest. She's an amazing actress but as a pair there was simply zero chemistry, it looked very amateurish and stilted, not convincing at all either!

It's almost as if it was a made up name by someone who didn't want to be associated with a flushing turd like this.Covid times must be tough in the Vikander, Holbrook, Krieps, households if they're taking nothing roles than would normally be reserved for cheap as chips up and comers looking to make a mark. There's nothing in any of these roles that's remotely enticing, it's certainly not the dialogue, the plot (an aspiring 1970s B movie knock off), or the characters.Vikander, Holbrook, and Krieps can be excused for taking the money and running. If they spent any longer than a day shooting their bits in rush of single takes reading from a cue card I'd fall over.Washington, this is his film all the way through. He plays a relentless exhausted overweigh systems integration blah blah blah wearing the most ill-fitting trousers in cinematic history who must run badly, exhaustedly, relentlessly through Greece because bad people want him dead because government stuff.You know when you've had a long day and collapse on the couch and switch something on and after 10 minutes you can't believe how bad the thing is that you're watching but you just don't have the energy to press the button and change because the will to live is seeping from every pore of your body and the only way out is to get to the credits?This is that kind on film.",Beckett

Literally every 1 star review is from a fake reviewer with just one lifetime review. This is a classic and deserves to be watched.John David Washington delivers one of the better performances of his life in this getaway thriller set in Greece. After the first half hour where he and Vicky Krieps give one of the most realistic portrayals of young lovers I've seen in film this year, the heart pounding pace build and sustains for 90 solid minutes. My eyes were riveted to the screen throughout.The story is focused delivering the action. Everyone from protagonist, supporting characters, and antagonists all drive towards the final showdown with little thought to character arc.Frankly, I didn't miss the lack of deep plot or dialogue. Everyone felt real. The acting and stunts are solid on all fronts. The Greek countryside is gorgeous and everyone has years of history etched on their faces. I only wish we had time to linger on the side characters.",Beckett

The only saving grace for this movie is the decent scenery, being shot in Greece earned it an extra star from me, but otherwise it is just a 2-hour snore-fest.

He lacks basic skill & comes across flat & emotionless...even when the scene calls for a specific emotion. Its like he doesn't quite understand the assignment & it's so cringy to watch.

Becket, the titular runner, is being chased. But why? And who? It'll take the whole film, corrupt cops, embassy agents and protesters to find out. And the answer isn't as satisfying as you'd like!With no time to mourn his loss, no time to film the events leading up to their trip in the countryside of Athens, and no time for character development (we don't know what he does for a living until 3/4 of the way into the film!), this carbon copy of every Wrongfully Accused hunt film made is average.Hard to care about Becket, the storyline, nor the little-mentioned subplot of the politician's kid!

What I liked about the movie is the reality of Greece that is presented versus what people see in the travel blogs. The plot, which I won't spoil, unfolds and probably could have done so by slicing off 20 minutes of the film and the directing handles it in the sort of minute by minute way you would experience the situation if it were true. I liked it. I might not watch it again but it was worth watching and I am glad that I did. It was something different versus movies that have shortened over time.

86,r-fronimides,"Could be much much better, but the director mixed up poorly.",6,18 August 2021,"Ok... Lets see about it.First of all, I'm 51 years old Greek. So, I really enjoyed a film created totaly on Greece's soil. A lot elements were so REALISTIC, so REAL. The scenes, the landscapes, the food scenes, the dining shops, police uniforms, cities, trains, all were so REALISTIC.But... the scenario was the MAJOR ""NO"" (negative) element. The scenario was like an 8 years old kid wrote it. The director (and scenario writer) tried very poorly to create a ""Fugitive"" (Harrison Ford) like film, in Greece. And, he tried to take several (not a couple, but a dozen!) totaly different things happening in Greece and ""mixed them up"" to make a silly scenario.Also, all the foreigner folks they watched the film they didn't understood how IMPOSSIBLE is to travel ""like that"" (so easily) from Epirus (Giannena the major city) to the capitol of Greece (Athens). The trip from Epirus (Giannna) to Attica (Athens) is about 4 hrs and 30 minutes with a GOOD car (not that pathetic old one, the two women had) and there are AT LEAST TEN TOLL BOOTHS between this travel! And OF COURSE, there are police cars in EVERY tolls (in regular/common base! Think about when they HUNTING someone, how MANY policemen they would be on those tolls and SEARCHING THE CAR ONE-BY-ONE)!So, totaly silly scenario how he got so fast and easily to Athens...Furtner more, the guy (Beckett) was injured several times (gunshots too!), he had NOTHING with him (no money, no ID, nothing) and he was managing to get a bus ride, get on a train, everything... so amazing EASILY! Also, everybody (the Greeks) he found in his quest were speaking quite good English (their Grammar were almost perfect) - that's not realistic - and they were all so easily able to help him instantly (that's not happening, the Greeks don't trusting so easily the foreigners and they are super-willing to HELP THE AUTHORITIES if they hunting a fugitive!).He was so hurt, so injured, but he was running like an Olympic Winner runner, he was jumping 4...floors parking bulding on a car (!), he was surviging from professional personel with guns (and he was unarmed), etc.So, Becket found these two female activists and they SO EASILY had the will to help him, even if they saw him under arrest and police hunting him - that would also never happen; yeah, Greek activists don't like policemen but they also don't like to GET INVOLVED to a case the police is after!Then... when the plot was in Athens, we watched a super... mixed ""cocktail"" of MANY cases took place in Greece as part of the film's scenario (the assassination of teenager Grigoropoulos by policemen, the rising of Left Wing party ""Syriza"", the brutal attacks that ""Golden Dawn"" - the Greek Nazis - were involved, political assassinations)...
...I was almost waiting to see a military coup (like we had between 1967 to 1974)!A lot things mixed up in a poor scenario.I believe, with a MUCH BETTER scripter and MUCH BETTER director, this film could be superb - but its not, now.",Beckett
87,Narce,Really annoying soundtrack - Bucketts?,4,30 August 2021,"The movie as a whole was sort of gripping and yet confusing.What do you do when you are in a foreign country and people keep trying to kill you - but you're not sure why? That's the gist of the plot in one sentence, with no spoilers.The first part, of him and his girlfriend touring around Greece is a bit slow, but this soon changes to scenes of pursuit and escape at a breakneck pace. The stamina of this guy is amazing, after a car crash, being shot and stabbed a few times and the (less than realistic) blind jump onto a moving car. Schwarzenegger and Stallone, you have found your successor.But I kept being jarred out of the story by the soundtrack, which is most annoying. It has some screeching, a lot of drum sequences that sound like urban youth beating on garbage cans and plastic buckets, and the occasional orchestral swells that drown out the dialog. Sorry, but no Oscars for score or sound editing.And the plot could have used a little clarification regarding the politics involved and the reasoning behind the incidents that we witness.

He is equally aloof in this film. His portrayal of Vikander's lover at the start of the movie is as unconvincing as it gets and once he becomes a fugitive, his stumbling through the Greek landscape snubs the last hope of finding decent acting in this film.Acting aside, the script is equally constipated and the director attempts to build tension through a soundtrack that consists of electronic noises but that only manages to irritate.Ultimately the movie just does not make sense.I did enjoy the Greek landscape though, so 3 stars for the Mediterranean.",Beckett

And then, when he was lured out of hiding, why try to shoot him from a distance when I was going to come right up to them?How do so many older people in rural Greece speak English. That was a detail so unlikely.Shot in his shoulder and he jumps off a cliff using a tree to pad his fall? I don't know if anyone would really attempt or consider something so unimaginable.So you're in traffic coming up to a police roadside check where they are going through cars, in heavy traffic, Beckett gets out of the car bloodstains on his clothes, jumps over a barrier, and no one seeing this alerts the police.While being led to a likely death by Tynan the embassy contact, Beckett was able to subdue him enough to escape the vehicle and run away. Why not tazer him again, tie him up, and then get all the answers as to why people are after you and why he just tried to kill you???Tynan is chasing Beckett, and Beckett looks around for something to surprise him with, and picks up a fluorescent light to hit Tynan with? Really, off all things.Beckett umps off the third story parking garage, perfectly timing when the car will come out, while just being shot in the stomach, recovering from multiple stab wounds, broken finger, previously being shot in the shoulder the day before. He was able to turn his body around mid flight to land facing the opposite direction that he jumped, wrestled with the cop who was driving the car, who himself was just shot in his leg but acted like he was dying from it.

This can be perceived in one of two ways, the film is immersing you so well that you feel as confused and lost as the protagonist (Beckett) feels within the movie. Which can be seen as genius or the film is simply being careless with providing an understanding throughout.Nevertheless, we are thrown right into the film , in the beginning it seems as if the relationship of the couple is boring and forced upon us. Leading up to the climax, the protagonist faces an unprecedented chain of events that causes more anxiety and confusion. I attribute the confusion to the film choosing not to allow us to know what the natives were saying aka no subtitles when speaking a different language.As a result, Beckett is getting crickets from me. Not only is the film pacing a snooze fest but the lack of clarity of this film is unnecessary. The confusion can be pointed out as a smart movie from another lens, but for me personally it wasn't worth it. I would suggest if you want to watch this, multitask because with your full attention you may fall asleep.",Beckett

I love that this was filmed entirely on location in Greece. I also love that, unlike so many Greece set films, it is not focused on the summer beaches of Greece but the countryside. I also like the use of real Greeks in the supporting roles. John David Washington is good in the role- the main issue is that the dialogue feed to him is a little weak. I am a big supporter of films that are outside the blockbuster or superhero genres in this day and age.

As he is running from the threats everywhere he goes no one really reacts to his strange appearance, are not only able to speak English with no problem but hand this bleeding American stranger their phone with no questions asked or concern. It was almost comical after awhile. I been to Greece before but I didnt notice the residents being quite that chill.

The movie was at least a good 40 mins too long and the worse offence was the last 10 minutes. Someone in another review said its a movie so people should turn off their brains but does that mean if Beckett had turned into a Transformer I wouldn't have viable complaints? I should just accept it is a movie and so what he turned into that out of nowhere? We understand we are watching a movie but unless it is science fiction I expect things to make sense and obey the natural laws. There were so many eye rolling developments and coincidences on top of long looks, pauses and shots that had no real impact on the movie it was frustrating. Maybe if Beckett HAD turned into A Transformer or maybe even a vampire I wouldn't be so disappointed in this movie. This was almost 2 hrs I will never get back.",Beckett

Some nice location shots and real settings.But sadly it's a film that goes nowhere slowly. It's a fairly straightforward story with little action, no thrills and no story twists to surprise you or keep you guessing.John David Washington offers little emotion and just ambles his way through the very thin plot filled with irrational actions, convenient coincidences and undeveloped characters.Expect to be clockwatching pretty early.",Beckett

The script was lacking overall, but John made the character as whole as he could.An annoying thing is that his girlfriend was just kind of an empty character in the end.

128,myignisrules,Boredom thy name is Beckett,4,14 August 2021,"John Washington has been on a roll of late, with his turn in Tenet most recently showing what he's capable of as an actor. But no matter how great a performer you are, there's only so much you can do to carry a movie that isn't well executed, which brings me to the slosh-fest that is Beckett.Heavily inspired by the political thrillers of the 60's or 70's, for instance the iconic and thrilling 1976's Marathon Man kept popping into my noggin' while watching this movie and by the way, if you haven't seen Marathon Man, feel free to turn off Beckett and go watch that masterpiece of film making instead.Anyways the setup here is a basic thriller staple. A couple on vacation are having a gay old time until things inevitably go horribly wrong. When girlfriend Alice, played by a woefully underused Alicia Vikander (Ex-Machina, Lara Croft) dies in an accident, Beckett is left as the sole survivor. But what should've been a tragic but ordinary end to his time in Greece turns deadly, as Beckett is chased by a cop and his cronies who want him dead for reasons he needs to figure out, if he's to survive.It's not the acting. Washington nails it as the ordinary man caught in an extraordinary situation. He's not an action hero, doesn't have a history in the military or is secretly some bad-ass spy. He's just a man scared out of his wits, who wants to get home safe but who is unwittingly caught up in a conspiracy not of his own making. As I said before Vikander is here and gone, but their short time on screen together worked well. Everyone else barely makes an impact.It's also not the score, which evokes those old school thrillers I spoke about before (this movie also made me think if Kurt Russell's Breakdown, a more recent thriller that is also way better than this one) and it wasn't the story, which on paper is a solid synopsis for this kind of movie. No I'm laying blame for the complete lack of energy and tension needed to make this work at the feet of director and editorial department.Scenes ran way too long sucking the tension and my interest out of the room and now that I think about it, maybe the screenplay need some polishing too as I sat through what seemed like multiple versions of the same thing over and over again. Beckett runs, someone chases him, Beckett gets away with/without help, Beckett is spotted by baddies, Beckett runs again. This nonsense went on for way too long without any new plot points or beats being added which had me reaching for my remote to hit the fast forward button. If someone is fast forwarding through a movie they never saw before because they just want the redundant moments to be over, you know you have a problem.This one was a huge disappointment for me folks. I honestly thought I was getting a slick, tightly shot action thriller, full to the brim with interesting characters and fun twists. Instead I got a weak imitation of much better movies I've already seen and at nearly two hours, that's precious viewing time I'll never get back. I already named two movies far superior to this one. Here's a third, The Fugitive, now got watch any of those instead of Beckett and you can thank me later.Score 4.5 out of 10.",Beckett

He just came across a bit awkward in his mannerisms and dialogue. Alicia Vikander's role was short lived and could probably of still worked had she not died in the film as it wasn't really instrumental to the story.

S. embassy in Athens. When he arrives he meets an embassy guy Tynan who tries to shoot him in a mall basement. For what reason exactly? This is where the story becomes fuzzy. The viewer doesn't really know why because the writer Ferdinando Cito Filomarino didn't provide a definitive answer; the issues are unresolved at the story's end (never
mind all the running). Too bad because the viewer is left to his/her own devices. He/she might as well write the version that suits him/her. So, the viewer feels cheated.Alicia Vikander's star power isn't put to good use here. She plays an inconsequential role. John David Washington lacks heft in this film despite his attempt to come up with a convincing performance.Well, at least the viewer gets to see Greek sights that are off the beaten path.",Beckett

133,pacocharte,"Come on, what did you expect?",7,15 August 2021,"The complaints about bad acting are completely unfounded. Washington does a more than passable job of playing a man in shock, on the run and in a strange place where he doesn't speak the language. Other actors also do a fine job at their parts. If there's a knock on this film, it's *not* on acting.The complaints about it being poorly shot are equally puzzling. I found the cinematography and scenery to be very engaging. It's like you're in Greece. The director makes use of a few first person (POV) shots that were really quite cool. The drive into Athens near the end, for example. I watched it on a very nice OLED panel in HDR and it pulled me in.I like man-on-the-run movies and all in all, up until the last few minutes, ""Beckett"" had me engaged and curious about what would happen.Granted, the plot (once revealed late in the film) was thin gruel and the political lectures from the mystery man on staff at the American embassy about politics were completely unbelievable. But that didn't negate the gripping 80-90 minutes of the movie that preceded the final act.The deeply unsatisfying ending was lazy, contrived and unnecessarily vague.I don't care about the budget and how much money any given actor (Washington most frequent subject of complaints) was paid. It was a well shot, well executed, well acted story for 90% of its run time.If you're in the mood for an action movie with minimal violence (by today's standards anyway), I can recommend ""Beckett"" - it's certainly better than 98% of whatever else Netflix is putting out these days.",Beckett

But the chase scenes should have been edited better. Did we really need to see every running scene they filmed?

137,syd9907,Disappointed in the Film & Washington,2,15 August 2021,"I wanted to like this film, but ""Beckett"" starring John David Washington is basically a confusing rambling snooze-fest. And I'm being kind by giving it 2 stars. I hate to compare him to his father Denzel, but John David Washington doesn't have the charisma to pull-off a film that has it going from a romantic tragedy, to a combination thriller and elements of ""The Fugitive"". If this were the great Denzel Washington, he would have had us hooked from the opening scene, and we would have willingly gone along for the ride. But don't get me wrong, John David Washington is a serviceable actor, for instance his very good performance in BlacKkKlansman. Spike Lee knew how to play to his strengths and keep him in his lane.Washington needs to work harder at perfecting his craft. He's not there yet and it shows when he's in something like Beckett, Tenet, and even Malcolm and Marie. When a director doesn't know how to set the tone and keep him from stepping out of the zone he's more comfortable in, Washington has the tendency to either overact or not give us enough to make us care about what his character is going through. Oops, there's that charisma thing again...he doesn't have any. John David Washington is the wrong actor for a role that needs someone who can put this type of film on his or her shoulders and carry it and the audience across the finish line. I honestly believe the potential is there, but he simply doesn't know how to harness it.",Beckett

It's just silly, clearly the writer and director have been binge watching too many Marvel movies during the production of this movie.Even Captain America wouldn't get up after the beating Beckett took.Also, he is totally unlikable as he essentially murders his own girlfriend in first ten minutes of the movie, I'm assuming the whole thing was him trying to find redemption of a sort?Finally, the US embassy staff involved in a local mafia kidnapping? Really? Fits in with all the other unbelievable events though.I think Denzels lad is a good actor and he does a good job in this movie,it's just that the movie is lacking in the reality and plausability that a good thriller needs, hence the subpar rating it has on IMDB.",Beckett

Things have been fictionalized a bit but all key players are present.The plot is in the vein of solid 70's 'man-on-the-run' political thrillers. John David Washington puts in an immediately believable performance as a clueless, lovestruck American tourist stuck in the midst of it all.

After observing other people's views, I can safely say this will be an underrated, perhaps cult-followed kind of experience. John David Washington gives an overlooked performance once again that very few will recognise the merits of.

Surely no one involved in this had any previous experience in the movie business. They must have made this as part of a college course.From the very first minutes I could tell this was a cheap dud: The title sequence was bargain basement as was the accompanying music. Like something you hear in a lift. In fact, there is very little incidental music in this mess, just a few blips and bloops that add nothing to the attempts at tension.Young Washington is totally out of his depth, stumbling around holding his arm with a blank as porridge stupid look on his face. We have to endure too-long close-ups which presumably the director thought would add pathos or audience sympathy...but are just annoying. Move on...!The script is laughable. The locations drab.

Some things get answered along the way. But as you learn more and little pieces, the only question you keep coming back to is why are they chasing this guy Beckett so hard?! It would have been far easier to just let him go back to the US and he would have been none the wiser to what was really going on. It was only them chasing him so incessantly that put him on the path to figuring out the motive. Which was incredibly weak at best.In conclusion, stupid plot. Stupid motive. And same ol' paint by numbers bad guy pursuit movies. Random bad guys can traverse all across the town, city, state and country with ease, finding who they're looking for, on the absolute slightest of leads, eventually bad guys lose.

Some people criticized his lack of grief, and that he just acted irrational. Ummmmm, he was breaking down like 4 times, and of course the character would act irrational because he didn't care if he died. He was at a stage of shock.

172,phizzle21,Beckett is an atmospheric thriller which ultimately shoots itself in the knee.,6,7 September 2021,"6/10 (only minor spoilers)An intense film with good atmosphere and some gripping hitchcockian scenes.Unfortunately, there are a few things that jeopardize the film and keep it from being really convincing:There are quite a few holes in the story and some completely unrealistic scenes, like all these lucky coincidences, the narrow escapes, the 4-story-jump-fall on to a driving car (WTF?) and him suffering multiple broken bones, gunshots, beatings, falls etc. But still keeping on going.The question I kept asking myself during the whole movie: WHY does he walk around like he crapped his pants all the time??",Beckett
173,nasimzhosein-695-794748,Really Bad acting,1,17 October 2021,Believe the other reviews this is a bad movie. The theme was interesting but with bad acting and poor chemistry between the actors it as bust.Don't waste your time watching this movie.,Beckett

style incidental music. Whole thing has an improvised feel to it. 4 stars for the movie and an extra one for the scenery.",Beckett
175,BennyBamLegacy,Surprisingly Bad,2,18 August 2021,"Where to start? Continuity is real in movies. If you don't make things correlate shot to shot when someone has a wound or they do things you cannot do with said injury, it distracts from plot because it is unrealistic. This movie isn't in an alternate universe where people get shot 3 times and keep jumping off carports onto cars and barely dent them after being in an accident and moving country to country almost entirely on foot in rugged terrain. Another huge issue that bothered me a lot is this starts out in the remote Mountains. Yet somehow everyone he encounters speaks english if he asks if they do. It is absurd. What a series of coincidences and good luck for someone who seemingly is in this situation because of shit luck and reckless driving while too tired to steer. After such a start with Blackkklansman and Tennant I can't help but wonder what Washington was thinking when he read this and said okay. The plot is awful. So many loose ends... why did they kidnap the kid, what the hell is going on, why would they kill someone who doesnt even know the country or can ID anyone he sees especially after a traumatic accident and event like losing a significant other. Why go back to a heart on his hand when you spent the last hour making her life meaningless by having her death be the thing that coincidentally sets off a political murder plot over literally nothing? I'm really asking. Love John, and like his dad the movies arent all perfect, but nowhere to go but up after this mistake.",Beckett

178,llipsis,I can't believe the negative reviews,9,14 August 2021,Until I remember most of them come from US citizens who wouldn't know where Greece is and it's politics. This is a very subtle movie about how extreme right in Greece is operating since the Colonels dictatorship in the 70's. The car accident put everything in motion and move the dust around enough for the cops to shoot first ask questions after.,Beckett
179,johnkampouropoulos,Could be better,6,13 August 2021,"First off, I loved the Greek scenery of Epirus and Thessaly. Brilliant idea to shoot a film over there.The script was OK -really, I think there was a meaning through it all: the crash, the boy, the chase, the political scheme, the redemption. I understand this type of script story: there's a template, a plot, which is needed in order to expand the characters, play with them and have the final catharsis in the end. But in this particular case, it was so minimal it became predictable and hilarious in some occasions. There were no subplots to widen the friction and fusion of characters. Which, by the way, were not as bad as some viewers describe. I've seen other movies in which the characters do not ""deploy"" or ""expand"" or ""change"" - they just stay the same throughout the film, trying to find out redemption. We see that clearly from the beginning, regarding JDW's character.Washington is a good actor. I think he was directed in such a minimal way, his acting could be easily misjudged. I've seen similar directions (e.g the 1960's original ""Breathless"" starring french actor J. P. Belmondo) but it's the whole thing that carries the audience away. In ""Beckett"" I didn't get this feeling, except partially.Overall, ""Becket"" had its good moments - and some are really good and keep the tension and the viewer's focus; at least it kept mine.One thing that made me laugh my heart out (as an Athenian), was the downtown Athens chase: they started running in Omonia Sq. Back to the old Parliament's back streets, then past Exarhia in an instant to appear in Kolonaki streets, then in Kipseli - a total route of a 8km distance, hard task for a sleepless, wounded and beaten man. But I understand that it was the point of ""the chase"", so- OK, I'll take that.It's a good movie to spend some time watching, could have been better directed imo.",Beckett
180,awessel-58117,Way better than expected,8,30 August 2021,"I went into this thinking it would be some mediocre Netflix film. I was dead wrong. JDW carries this film with his acting. The setting of Greece is both beautiful and haunting, and the idea of being a foreigner amongst a government conspiracy you didn't want any part of with no way of getting help sends chills down my spine. It kept me thinking about what I would do if I were put in the same scenario for hours after I had finished. And the soundtrack! It's spectacular and sets the mood so well. A must watch for thriller fans.",Beckett
181,AccessCardRequired,Too many things wrong with this film,2,13 August 2021,"There's a lot wrong with that movie, which I really wanted to like... Why Alice took the part, no idea (money?). Her first 10 Minutes for screen time is a waste, cause I don't believe a second both the leads are great lovers. Washingtons charaktere is a joke. He pretend stumbling is annoying as he does it all the time in this film. Still didn't get the part of the embassy guy. What was that? They wanted a realistic thriller, but the moment Washington jumped off the what, 3rd floor of a car park, I was really really glad the film was over.",Beckett

187,platon_mp,not your saturday night movie,6,15 August 2021,"What i liked was the old fashioned way its filmed. Reminds me of classic greek cinema. Also as a Greek watching many beautiful locations or streets that i walked thousand times cetrainly keep my interest. Greek actors were fine, their acting felt natural. Im not a camera expert but the way its filmed feels like you re not watching a movie but events unfolding in front of you, like a documentary.And here is where my biggest complain is. In order to make up for that normal like 'anti-cinematic' way of filming you need to balance it with something very captivating in order to keep audience involved, in other words some spicy flavour. Its like filming myself running from Metsovo to Athens. It may be a movie, but not an art, not something more than a few people would care to watch. And if someone makes a movie without some sort of a greater philosophical meaning at least he owns the viewer some kind of entertainment.Do you remember some american shows where you have the real person tell a life surviving story and in the meantime they make a short cheap movie to alternate so you dont watch a person talking on a chair for 50 mins? Make those 50 mins 105 and you have Beckett, only the story is about politics, a subject few can relate to.I wont even discuss about Johns performance as he wasnt given a fair chance.Summary: it captured some greek elements and it felt real and natural but it was missing taste and artistic touch to make it appealing for a larger audience. Dont feel like trashing this movie since im from Greece so i cannont give it any less than 6/10, propably more of what is worth for.",Beckett
188,muchocabrio,So many bad reviews,6,16 August 2021,I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Why people have marked it down so harshly I don't know.

191,blixakos,"8 for the greek details, 4 for the rest",5,17 August 2021,"As a Greek, I can say that all the details were correct. The people were speaking real greek, and all the places were in Greece. Of course the places choosed by the director are maybe thw most deprived areas in Athens, but real as well. Everything else is bad, the film as a plot is not watchable.",Beckett
192,dewilliams30,It had an interesting story and it's watchable... the reviews are as always bias.,6,14 August 2021,So I set out to watch Beckett when I saw the trailer awhile back. Then I was like I think this is going to be about something much more than what the trailer is giving off. I was right. No I didn't believe the two characters surrounding this story had good believable chemistry but was that really the basis of this film? No! The movie did hold my interest from the moment of the crash to see where this story would go and like another reviewer I did see the resemblance of Breakdown in this film. Again I don't watch movies to dissect them if I'm watching for entertaining purposes. Cinematography details really? I believe some reviewers are looking at Robert and Egert and other professional critics and literally using their opinions in their own reviews. I caught to many similarities. I guess some are using this platform as a portfolio. I didn't catch where the acting was so horrible. However I can say that it's not on a high scale for this type of movie. John David Washington is a very mellow actor. He leads with a personality of a nonchalant attitude and a playful sense of humor that was not needed in this role. Every actor should test their range. And to compare him to his father- Denzel whom in my opinion great actor yes but his range is not exceedingly competitive imo. Overall it's not a bad movie and I didn't regret watching it.,Beckett
193,steveneli,Meh,5,18 August 2021,"John David Washington is one of the best actors in Hollywood right now but the idea of putting him in a foreign film, filmed like it was being made in 60s or 70s, probably was a poor casting choice.

It's got an old school scandi noir vibe to the cinematography and directing. Washington's acting is solid and the story line is solid.

197,maryannfarley,Baffled by bad reviews,8,15 August 2021,"I'm not sure what the problem is. Are people blaming JDW for not being his dad? And those saying he lacks the charisma or depth for this part REALLY have me scratching my head. I was so completely engaged with the relationship between him and Vikander that I honestly didn't need it to be established any further. The charm, intimacy and chemistry between them was palpable and terrifically established with narrative economy. And surely the expression of his grief would be limited by the fact that, ya know, cops are trying to kill him. It totally fits the events as they unfold.I found Beckett to be an adept, tight, steamrolling thriller that had me with JDW every inch of the way. There's an everyman quality about him that fundamentally makes me care about his characters right out of the gate. And while he's handsome, even his good looks are of the real life variety. The only thing I didn't like about Beckett is this odd, lukewarm, sometimes even hostile reception. It's strangely and completely unwarranted. I can't help but think his paternity has something to do with it, where he's not allowed a great superstar dad AND a great career of his own. No one is allowed that much luck, right? Keep going, Mr. Washington, and let your work ultimately speak for itself..",Beckett

208,AussieJim,A real treat from start to finish,9,17 August 2021,"Like many other fans of this film, let me start by urging readers to ignore the low reviews. Many of these writers make a point of demeaning Washington's acting, and numerous entries claim that the film is ""woke"", an obvious hint that something more than an honest review is going on.Quite frankly I suspect there has been a deliberate campaign to lower the rating of the film, especially after I checked many of these 'reviewers' only to find that for most of them, Beckett is first and only movie they have rated.As for the film itself, I thought it was excellent, and far better than what many Hollywood thrillers are able to deliver despite much bigger budgets.John David Washington is entirely believable as a man who is caught up in a political conspiracy that he has almost no way of unraveling or understanding, until the final scenes in the movie.I have been to Greece several times as a visitor, and I have stood on the sidelines and watched one or two massive political demonstrations that terminate in front of the Greek Parliament where some of the final scenes take place. I don't know if the protest scenes in Beckett were filmed during a real protest, or if they were staged, but they looked very real to me.Beckett is film I would be more than happy to watch again, and I urge readers to ignore the naysayers and give it a try.",Beckett

Also, a lot of the dialogue is weird and unnatural, clearly put in there to reveal something to the viewer but makes no sense in the story.The script is really terrible. It is almost fascinating to see so many amateurish mistakes in a movie that otherwise holds a fairly decent level of production value. John David Washingtons acting is flat and uninspired, he uses both his two facial expressions through the movie and you soon get bored and annoyed with both.

The update of political upheaval based on greed and money was sadly mentioned as a band aid to the plot and not fully explored in terms of modern day crisis gripping the world. Washington inherited his father's name but very little of the charisma or acting chops, I had hoped that after Tenet, he would have proved me wrong.

220,yjk316,I kept swearing while watching,6,13 August 2021,"There were a number of problems with this film, which means how deeply I was involved with the story of the film, but in a negative way. I kept swearing about two thirds way in.The film depicts a typical American in a foreign country -- an American who doesn't speak the local language and is totally unfamiliar with the local situation. His only aim is to get to the U. S. Embassy, believing that his U. S. citizenship will protect him. Beckett has a perpetual expression of incredulity on his face throughout the film, which makes me frustrated. He seems to learn nothing from his experiences, thereby walking into one trap after another. He is powerless, in physical pain, not very smart, and clueless throughout the movie, and this fact makes it difficult for me to connect with the character emotionally. That explains why I kept swearing as I sat watching.How long will Americans make movies about their feeling like an alien once they step out of the U. S. border? They have terrible time adapting to the local conditions and protecting themselves from potential danger.Overall, an interesting story, but the protagonist's struggle is all too familiar. Shaken out of his socks, Beckett has no clue, no plan, no wits to come to a realistic understanding of his plight. He could not protect his girlfriend and he couldn't protect the two women strangers who help him.Overall a frustrating movie.",Beckett

It is up to everyone if they liked the sequences shot on film and the shots seemed kinda old-school.Then the crash happens. At that point the movie lost me.It was totally predictable what was going to happen. Nothing schocked me. He was so unrelatable.

JDW and AV are on vacation in Greece and they're making love in bed. AV is playful but JDW seems to be having problems with his lines. I thought he was breaking up with her initially but he was just commenting on her loud orgasm--bad dialog delivery on his part. Within 15 min, they kill off AV's character in an auto accident and JDW has to carry the rest of the film on his own and he really needs help!!!JDW sleepwalks through the rest of the film running away from a host of baddies who want him dead because his car crashed into a house where they were holding a kidnapped politician's son. Everyone is chasing JDW--local authorities, an American official at the US Embassy, etc... JDW has no facial expression at all. I didn't feel any empathy for his character even though he's being chased all over Greece and he's been shot, stabbed and beaten. I just kept wondering why he was so stiff and if the cast and sling was not just immobilizing his arm but his acting skills as well. In one train scene, a little girl staring at him stole the show because JDW couldn't express discomfort.I looked back at his performance in Tenet and he's so much better without any physical handicaps even though his deliver is still deadpan. Without high tech gadgets and CGI to distract you as in Tenet, carrying Beckett requires some acting skills. They brought AV's lifeless body back towards the end to help but there's only so much a pretty corpse can do to salvage the movie. Too bad JDW didn't ask Michael Caine or his dad (Denzel Washington) for acting lessons before taking on this role.",Beckett

He runs bended over with a big ass so he is just the opposite of his father.If after A and B we could use more letters of the alphabet, I would describe this movie a Z-movie. The only way this movie could be a hit, is to send it to the 70s in a time machine. I think at that time they would ""love"" this movie.

But 30 minutes before the end, at another chase where he runs like a girl AND with 70's thriller music, I gave up .... Doing the dishes seemed more fun than to wath this movie to the end ...",Beckett

230,nadajio,Another propaganda piece,1,22 August 2021,Hollywood and Netflix/China thinks its viewers are really stupid... Flipping reality to make the left the good guys and the right the bad guys is a crock of crap... They're all bad guys in my view but we all know that the right wanted to exit the EU and the left wants it to remain. In this movie they twisted the plot around to make the left look like the party that wants to leave the EU... Trying to rewrite history through visual art is not going to work this time... Just like tearing down monuments is not going to erase the past nor blaming Jim Crow on the right when it was the Dixiecrat south and Woodrow Wilson that implemented it... Bad movie and Bad political tactics on trying to trick the general public... Hollywood needs to stay the hell out of politics!,Beckett

Either John David Washington was offered a fat pay check to star in this and he phoned in his performance.Or.The director is legitimately amateur hour.This movie at so many points contains poorly shot scenes that feel amateur. Dialogue and responses that lack urgency or feeling like a real person would behave that way etc.The way the main character behaves despite his girlfriend being dead and being aggressively pursued is laughable. Zero sense of urgency, no sense that he's legitimately terrified etc.It just kind of lurches from scene to scene and theee is no impact and it feels like it was shot on the wrong film or lens.

Come on! LolAnd the biggest plot issue is why they're chasing him in the first place. He saw a boy. So what? They could chalk it up to a concussion.

The story in itself was interesting, and most of the movie is realistic. Some people complain about Zagorohoria villagers speaking English, but only one of them actually did and that is not so surprising that one villager can say a few words. Overall everyone mostly spoke Greek and the situations were believable to me.Now, the story execution and development is just ?????? I thought the American officer was also a corrupt, far right supporter, in coalition with ""sunrise"" who reminds me of ""golden dawn"", a real fascist and criminal greek organization. But the last bit about everything being organized by the mafia makes 0 sense. Why would the American agent would want him dead in that case? That was very poorly executed. They should've stuck with the fascist organization (which in real life did murder a left wing singer, it got covered up, and they faced trial and got convicted many years later). But that mafia bit was strictly underwhelming and the fight will the agent begs the question: how will Beckett hope to get back to the states without facing jail time after having beaten him to a pulp?Oh also jumping from 4 stories on a moving car was dumb.",Beckett

Yeah, we're lookin at you Obama. And the seemingly sloppy, amateurish pace actually provides a welcome air of unpredictability and realistic charm, something I'll gladly take over an absurdly slick and boringly pretentious Michael Bay film.

It's neither so good (or so bad) to be afforded the memory storage which I guess is it's own punishment.I'm only guessing here but I imagine that this was tied in with some travel expenses for the few major stars that appear in the movie. Otherwise, I can't see how they enticed Vikander into taking the part. It's not 'artsy' enough, 'existential' enough, the director is insignificant etc. So . . .

The writers were very accurate about sceneries and the way they depicted post crisis Greece (although in a pre-pandemic era). They handled wonderfully greek speakers and the way they interact with an american.However, as an Athenian citizen I want to point out some improprieties.1) I found very unlikely that all rural habitants of Zagorohoria spoke english (while the nursery and the first policeman didn't).2) Beckett escaped the train after Kalambaka, possibly near Trikala, and he run out with some girls to Athens, via Rio-Antirio bridge. This is not an efficient way to head to Athens.3) The American embassy in Greece is in Megaro Mousikis station, not in Omonia.4) After a political assassination of the prime minister presumptive in his speech, deafening calm and quiet prevailed.

The trailer gave hope that Beckett could be exciting. Unfortunately, no. The plot had potential to build into an appetising, Hitchcockian thriller. Instead, it ended up jumping from one scene to another with hardly any emotive attachment. Even the romantic narrative at the beginning fell flat. I think this is due to the fact that some of the central characters - apart from Beckett - don't have a lot of screen time. Eg. Vikander's April is only in about 20 mins; ditto to Boyd's Tynan. Sad, 'cos their screen presence could have helped the audience to resonate longer with the story. What we get instead are unknown actors and actresses playing the meatier support roles, but this just fails to translate the thrill across. By the time you start to live with that, then the plot gets muddled; what is it about? Were Beckett's travails due to politics? Gangster wars? There's some explanation towards the end - but you still end up going, ""huh?"" The director could have also tried to inject a bit more realism, especially onto the action scenes. E.g. A severely injured Beckett could still put up fights against armed baddies, escaping from the jaws of death more than once. It should have been framed more like the scenes involving Richard Kimble in The Fugitive, as opposed to a combatant Joe Ordinary that Beckett becomes. It just doesn't click. Acting wise, it's average; Washington & the rest do just enough to finish at crossing line.",Beckett

The guy says something similar like even when they are fighting it's all good. This is the point where you are certain the woman will die.Girlfriend dies. People start chasing the guy. People try to kill the guy. Plot twist: even the ""good guys"" try to kill the guy.The guy saves the day but girlfriend is still dead.You might also notice that the main character is also surprisingly unkillable especially right at the end of the movie.",Beckett

294,crealsa,Surprisingly good,8,7 September 2021,"I'm glad I don't pay much attention to reviews, because this is a very good movie. The writing, acting and pace are strong. The lead actor ably carries the whole movie. It may not be high budget, but the locations make that not matter much. The action moves smoothly and the suspense is tangible. So glad I watched.",Beckett
295,hongalabonga,One of the worst 2 hours i spent in my life,1,16 August 2021,"The movie starts with a good thriller, then goes downhill from there. If it is a fantasy or superhero movie I still would find the movie unrealistic. It is supposed to be about a normal man in a normal job, but somehow he come out of accident and gets shot 5 times and jumps from ten floors over a car and still beats cops in fights. Really they gave logic a break in this movie. It was so bad that I decided to waste my sleep and write a review about it. May someone reads it and do something better with his time.",Beckett
296,xelnagazchild,manhunt that doesn't stop for one and a half hour,7,17 August 2021,"Ok, forget the first scenes with the hero's girlfriend, they are cringy and bland as hell. But what unfolds afterwards is a kind of thriller that is particularly enthralling. It's very classic in its one-man-against-the-world setting, but it doesn't let you breathe, and the political setting is somewhat interesting. It has the same kind of appeal as the Nile Hilton Incident : thriller with political elements, set in a contemporrary decor that is kind of rare for that genre. Not a perfect movie by far but really that chase felt right on point and well balanced !",Beckett
297,spanomarkouareti,Realistic and wonderful acting,9,15 August 2021,"This is pure culture. I adore the cinematography, and the locations. Great acting, very realistic situations.

298,keifwynne,Director?,4,15 August 2021,How is it a person who has no idea of how to direct a movie can see such terribly shot scenes but the director can't?

302,jonasmarkussen,A nice surprise,6,13 August 2021,"Beckett is an unusual Netflix original because it actually has an artistic quality to it. Its set in greece and really uses the greek culture and landscape to a point where you can feel it. The cinematography is so beautiful and so is the Sound design. The plot is gripping and you really will keep guessing how the hell this is happening to an ordinary man. I'd always been having trouble figuring out if Washington is an amazing or just a mediocre actor, but he makes his best performance yet, if you ask me. He is not your typical fit action hero, that knows how to fight bad guys and he is often more lucky than skilled plus he has a more realistic looking body than most of these type of movies.UNFORTUNATELY this movie has some plot holes and loses momentum at the end, which is a bit of a shame. The mystery that gets unravelled is a bit meh, so I dropped my rating to a 6, but it deserves around 6.9. Anyway its a good suspenseful, beautiful and enjoyable little thriller!(And as some reviews already said it, the person(s) responsible for the title should find another job, its a bit ridiculous naming this movie beckett)",Beckett

304,vadimdovbysh,Terrible main actor,2,15 August 2021,We all know that Denzel was an incredible actor who left a great legacy. His is son is not the same man and cannot act whatsoever though. The story is terrible throughout and I could only think that another lead actor would make this from a mediocre movie to something incredible. I have no idea why they keep casting him. He was terrible in the Tenet and any other movies he was cast in. I say just use another actor rather than go with a famous last name because he has no talent or skill when it comes to acting.,Beckett

If there were Oscars for ham acting this film would wipe the board. JD Washington ( never heard of him) plays the most useless clown ever, stumbling about like a five year old in his first egg & spoon race. Alicia Vikander is a good actress wasted in the movie - she new what she was doing with her swift exit. To be fair my wife and I spent most of the time rolling about with laughter so perhaps it could be rebranded a comedy.",Beckett

308,victor-ferreira,OK movie with bad acting,5,7 September 2021,"I didn't hate Beckett, but it raised mixed opinions on me. It is clearly a very low budget movie but it has a good plot and some famous actors. I was surprised with Washington (Black K Klansman, Tennet) bad acting. It took me a while to realize it was the same actor. He keeps overacting over and over until the end of the movie. At a certain point everyone else in the movie seems to be better actors than him.As an extra comment, there is something with his arm that really really bothers me. Draw your own conclusions.I recommend it anyway as a nice thriller movie.",Beckett

Netflix has become the Golan-Globus movie company. In the 80s The Cannon Group-Golam-Globus admitted they made movies strictly for profit, not for quality entertainment. Remember them?

316,sakisnikol,Felling proud to be EPIROTIS!,6,17 August 2021,"I feel really proud and honoured to see my hometown be called out on a big budget movie like this one. I've always believed that Ioannina and Epirus in general have some amazing locations for movies to be filmed. I have also spotted numerous things from Epirus during the movie like ""Vikos"" water bottle and ""Epirus TV1"" channel which was showing the news. Besides all the things that made me feel proud of my roots, the movie had a bad script and direction. The directors of this movie must be some kind of amateurs because I felt like I was watching a low budget film. Also it's impossible for someone to have a broken hand, two broken fingers, been shot twice and still be able to jump from a four store building on the roof of the car in perfect time. This is something that only in Sci-fi movies happen. In addition to that is outstanding how poor villagers in remote villages in Greece know how to speak English and communicate with a stranger without a problem. So the 6 stars are for the perfect locations in Epirus, feeling proud as Gianniotis to be heard the word ""Giannena"" outside Greece and for the whole world to know Ioannina. Only for these two reasons I will give this movie a 6 stars otherwise this movie is like 2-3 stars max.",Beckett

Some fantastic location shots too!,Beckett
319,greg_hull,Woulda Coulda Shoulda,3,16 August 2021,"This storyline had so much potential. A mini-thriller. Sadly, the director and/or the screenwriter must have thought the audience would connect the cavernous gaps in the plot by some form of osmosis.

Is that too much to ask?""",Beckett

NOW THAT I'VE GOTTEN THAT IT OUT THE WAY...This was a case of good acting paired with midiocre writing. It was enthralling, but to tumble on a car, run through a house, shot in the arm, stabbed, cut, jumping off cliffs, while injured, jumping on a car from an unbelievable height, shot in the gut, & still standing, & no coherent explanation why the Agent at the Embassy was involved, well for Regular Joe, turned Daredevil, if there were stories taken from headlines, maybe. They should have drawn more out of tidbits at the beginning, why there was a bottle of ambient, should have had flash backs pulling the bits & pieces, of the reading for the Ambient, whose was it, & bunch of other things that could have brought better clarity.That being said...

Everything doesn't have to be a Hollywood Blockbuster. The Cinematography was well done in an old style of filming. The tragedy of his loss and guilt was apparent.There were way too many whiney reviews of people that do not understand the art of Cinema here. Try attending some film classes be for giving your opinion. I feel most of the reviews here are similar to yelpers that have no understanding of film what so ever.This is worth a watch for sure.

I found this film very intense, maybe it was being lost in a country with a giant language barrier or it was the thought Of the police trying to assassinate you!

It's crisply photographed and has an almost documentary air about it. But in the end, the third act leaves a shallow and unsatisfying aftertaste, with both focus and timing not hitting the mark. A story based on redemption and revenge, 'Beckett' is somewhere between 'North by Northwest', 'The Fugitive' and 'Taken'. Being produced by Netflix, a happy mixed race couple is on vacation in Greece, and from there on things go wrong till the resolution at the end, with every resting moment only leading to new chaos. Cutting down the political side story in the third act probably could have made this a better film.",Beckett

And for this reason I can't recommend watching it to anyone. No one should watch it.The time leading up to that I was constantly skipping as the couple (particularly the wife) were just extremely irritating... maybe I'm being too harsh as I'm pregnant and everything annoys me.So yes don't watch.,Beckett

I liked the pacing and the ""everyman's world gets turned upside down"" storyline. One reviewer stated the hero is an average guy who doesn't ""Jason Bourne"" his way out of everything..., because he can't.That is spot on. I enjoyed it and then saw these terrible reviews. I'm giving it a 9 to counteract some of the low marks. I saw 2s, 3s, and 4s. Those numbers are for B movies with low production value, shot on a credit card budget, ""Hey you, wanna act in our movie"" type films.

But what made this movie work was the black man being chased by evil people across Greece. He doesn't speak the language and the movie intentionally does not provide translation for us when there's Greek spoken so that we can feel as lost and afraid as he was.I also like the old school feel of it from the way it was shot, directed and acted.

338,dougmennes,Much better than the metascore and rating.,9,17 August 2021,"This movie is outstanding entertainment. WATCH IT. Disregard the ratings and metascore and judge for yourself. Maybe they will improve later.Beckett is one of the best movies I've seen this year, and maybe the best that I can remember in a long time. It is absolutely beautifully photographed, with the first half littered with vista shots of the Northern Greek landscape. And whoever does a movie set in rural Greece? This in itself makes Beckett uniquely appealing. The sets and photography do not sugar coat the landscape, but paint a picture of a country whose infrastructure is covered in political graffiti, crumbling grittiness, and give off a very post-Soviet collapse vibe. A cohort of teen activist extras do as well. All this together gives the impression of a country on the verge of upheaval.The story builds systematically to a frightening crescendo. The chase scene in underground Athens is reminiscent of Welles' The Third Man. The police's actions and basic premise also reminiscent of Polanski's Frantic.The action sequences and chase scenes especially in the third act throughout Athens are realistic and breathtaking. No shaky cam quick cuts like you've seen coming out of Hollywood recently. In addition, unnecessary (expensive) but beautiful stationary shots placed in between action shots involving mostly unassuming architectural features add to the artistry and beauty of the film and playfully nudge at the underlying populist message.Themes of political intrigue, a regular man doing what's right after reaching his breaking point, and 'trust no one' are supported by the lead's race as well. He stood out amongst the citizens of Greece especially in the rural areas. Some trusted him, but I felt others immediately looked at him not as a hero but a nuisance or an 'other'. Others that did trust Beckett turned on him later. This made it even more uncomfortable for the viewer as like the character, I wasn't sure he could trust anyone he encountered. I'd like to see more of Washington in a
everyman 'anti-hero' type role. He nailed it..",Beckett

Great to see a movie in Greece - certainly gives the film distinct personality.

It's like watching a school play actor in a movie. He had zero emotions and chemistry with his wife (she on the other hand showed good chemistry with John). And through the movie his acting is just totally off and his lines are flat.

The beginning was a bit slow... yawn yawn... it is true there was no evident chemistry in the love scenes or the lovers' chit chat scenes... like why drag the viewer through any of it when we're not even familiar with the characters yet?But when the action started, the film picked up pace and kept me at the edge of my seat all the way to the end. The locals Beckett met on his journey were colorful and authentic. The villains were a bit unbelievable, especially the embassy guy. It didn't add up why they spent so much time and effort trying to off a dude who, at first, never even understood what he had witnessed until the ferociousness of the people chasing him made Beckett investigate the matter. So the script was, indeed, weak, but the acting of the main character, and also quite good directing saved this film from going down the drain.It was good entertainment - no real artistic value to it - however, suspense-lovers will not be disappointed.",Beckett

Ok, Alicia Vikander & Boyd Holbrook were both natural and believable... but the rest of the cast were one step out of acting school, frightened in front of the camera, and desperate to say their lines before they forgot them. (The honourable exception was Yorgos Pirpassopoulos who is a brilliant actor but criminally underused here.)And appalling applies to the story which had more holes than the Albert Hall. The final big stunt? Oh ffs.But the biggest mystery was how this got onto Netflix... oh wait... ah, I've just read about who was involved and that explains it all.My advice?

364,ArisSil,Not as bad as people say 6.5,7,21 August 2021,"First of all I should say I am Greek, so that I can claim a few stuff about Greece and Greek people. The second thing is that my rating is not 7 is 6.5. I put bit more than less because there are so many bad ratings that don't make any sense to me. Now let's move to the substance of the movie.1. The good parts
Film has great photography and descent direction (although I read some reviews that sometimes it was out of focus. I don't know a lot for direction to claim otherwise). Generally, I should say it was very nice!Music and soundtrack were perfect for an action thriller and helped a lot to improve the movie. It was the strongest element of the movie. I didn't like only the starting song a bit.2. The ok part
Acting generally was ok. The majority of the people were fine and what they were saying and the way they were saying it was ok. John David Washington and a few others were ok - not bad, not wow.3. The bad part
The writing. The writing was too much. Even the general idea was too much but I will skip this because is a movie and anyway it doesn't have to be realistic. The thing is that some parts just simply, even if you exaggerate, CANNOT be done. Nobody can do as much as the hero could and still walking. Even Jason Statham makes more sense in his movies. They could have different choices to be a bit more realistic. I liked it in the end when he said that he should have died. Still, too much.So! 1 star is lost from acting that it was simply ok, 2.5 for writing.Here I want to answer a few things to seanroger-82963
1. In Greece, especially starting from the 80s (even before), Greek people are taught English as a second language in private education centers from primary school years. So, its not a surprise to find a lot of people speaking English even in rural areas. Not to mention that even in such areas there can be tourists from time to time.2. About the traffic blockage, if you see how amateur are many policemen and how people don't care the majority of times, it makes sense to me.3. I would agree that Tynan as an agent was a pure failure.4. The fluorescent light was not something that I would care since in his confusion he didn't overthink itAnd here I want to answer to GeorgesDV's review, who is Greek.1. Sometimes is random who can and who is willing to speak English in Greece
2. If I am not mistaken, the guy ended up in Arta and not in Trikala. Through the main highroad there is more efficient to go through Patra and end up to Athens
3. I don't think the guy that gave him a ticket would care if he ended up in Omonia or exactly to the correct station. He just sent him to Omonia.4. I don't agree exactly in your fourth statement. There were protests in the streets which would lead to an urban war out there. Of course the police would try to make a curfew.",Beckett

389,tbloutsos,Nice and entertaining,7,17 August 2021,"Being a Greek myself,from Ioannina i was pretty happy to see a foreign movie that was set in the north part of Greece,it felt surreal to see all these places that i had seen thousands of times in real life in a netflix movie. The scenery was beautiful as for the acting,the acting was decent. It is a more realistic action movie instead of your typical over the top action movie and i was entertained throughout the whole film. It had a few minor mistakes like when the characters traveled from Trikala to Athens by crossing the Rio adirio bridge which is not an efficient way to go to Athens. The movie also finished a little abruptly but still it is worth a watch if you have some spare time.",Beckett

391,einar-samuelsson,Great ambition on reality action lost in luck,5,21 August 2021,"I like the fact that this aspires on being an action movie but takes the genre and adds something new to it; reality.A very ordinary guy loosing a loved one when making a very common mistake that makes people want to see him dead.It's interesting to see a modern man (the desk sitting one) taking on hell, hunched and with a seemingly poor stamina and even though John David Washington sometimes overacts this it's refreshing with such a mundane hero.Some of the more fantastic parts is a one in a million car crash, Beckett getting injured in so many ways that it sometimes reminds me of slapstick and his pure luck. Not to mention his impressive pain management.Last but not least:
I like that Greece is shown as something more than a vacation paradise and it's very surprising that the great actress Alicia Vikander is used as a mere a sob story.",Beckett

On the plus side the Greek scenery at the beginning was beautiful and wild and reminded me of lord of the rings, the acting of most of the cast and especially Washington was really solid too. Now for the not so good. The plot was really weak and almost paper thin the main idea was great but the execution not so much. Another thing that bothered me as a person who lived in Athens for 6 years is that they made it look like a distopian third world country which was weird because Athens is a really beautiful City. I get that the movie is set in a distopian political alternate reality but they made Athens look like Baghdad or something. As a final verdict I think the movie is watchable but had potential to be much more if the writing was better.",Beckett

395,Waldimore,Illogical characters ***SPOILER ALERT***,5,15 November 2021,"***SPOILER ALERT***
I have a problem w/characters who don't make sense. Screenwriters mistakenly believe that opening w/10 minutes of fake intimacy and playful lovey-dovey relationship drivel will somehow endear characters to you. After the car crash that kills his girlfriend the character is thrust into a political conspiracy in Greece. It should never have happened. Why didn't the police ever ask him what happened? Instead, they let him wallow in confusion which was his cover for denial that he was at fault. This led him to reveal that he saw a boy and a woman. They had nothing to do w/ the accident. Did he a foreigner know that the boy was kidnapped? Of course not. It was a foreign country. He didn't speak Greek. So why were they even intimidated by the fact he saw the kidnapped boy? And why was he so fixated on them other than it helped him stay in denial that he fell asleep at the wheel. They should have gotten him and his girlfriend's body to the American Embassy so they could get on a plane and go back to the US. Instead the film takes us on an illogical journey of a character who didn't even have the sense to say from the beginning: ""I just want to go home."" I've grown fond of John David Washington's work, but this vehicle didn't serve him well.",Beckett

John Washington puts in a solid performance. The anxiety ridden man we see dealing with the stress and confusion of be chased and attacked after what started as an accident is quite compelling.The moment the conspiracy is revealed where a far right group was up to no good, the review bombing finally made sense. From there it's a good conspiracy thriller. Perhaps the snowflakes review bombing should take a look at themselves if they feel attacked by a fictional narrative.All in all, its a good film in the crosshairs of right wing nut jobs who are detached from reality.

417,dnolson-96060,Truly enthralling thriller,9,22 August 2021,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. John David Washington delivers an emotional, heart wrenching, adrenaline driven portrayal of a man who finds himself truly on the edge when all avenues to normality are seemingly severed following a car accident on a Greek holiday in which his girlfriend dies, & after which he briefly sees young boy. Once it's realised he's seen the boy, who is missing, his life is suddenly in serious danger & he's forced on the run from the police.Directed by by Ferdinando Cito Filomarino, this is a fascinating portrayal of what we are capable of when driven to desperation & despair, & the choices we might hope to make when trying to save the life of another at imminent risk to our own. Set against the backdrop of Greece in post-austerity political turmoil, this film is in turn unexpected, surprising, dark & twisty - a truly enthralling thriller.Hollywood could learn a thing or two from this film about how real human responses to stress affect us as humans, & that real heroism is falling apart then carrying on anyways, but I suspect they'll continue turning out flawless action heroes from the production line instead.Bonus of wonderful music from the genius that is Ryuichi Sakamoto.",Beckett

419,jennifersinclair-84355,"A grown-up, complex action film",9,19 August 2021,"Beckett was really impressive. The cinematography was really interesting: the movie segues from scene to scene in straight cuts. It disorients deliberately. And what the director choses to film is anti-romantic - rock strewn fields, graffiti-covered trains, ordinary Greek people. There is no glamour here. The music was also really notable, very discordant at times, jarring.At the beginning, the relationship between Beckett and April is established, and this is the only part of the film where I found the dialog a bit trite. Afterward that, the film just blew me away. The plot is a little complex, but I don't think there were any questions left unanswered. The kindness and sympathy of the young people who helped Beckett establishes clearly enough (for me) who the real culprits were. Reading reviews and questions, I see many people thought the American diplomat might have been acting alone, rather than under orders, but I think that they just can't believe that the American government would do something deliberately bad to protect its own interests, which is naïve. The film really subverts expectations, in this regard as well as in the ending.The main protagonist ends up playing the hero for his own redemption, but he has no super-hero powers. He's a big guy, but he gets hurt a lot: the fighting is realistic and ugly.There are no words for how great John David Washington's acting is in this movie. He is given a lot of range of emotions and feelings to portray and he does so really convincingly. I felt the conflicts inside the character and physically, the damage he carries.This is not a film for action hero fans, or for people who like things black and white. The director, Cito Filomarino and all the film-makers involved have avoided almost all stereotypes and expectations. A big thank you to them all.",Beckett

Then it came, the writers voice, the Leftist propaganda. The ""bad guys"" are described as ""far"" Right Wing ""ultra"" conservatives. Did adding the adjectives make the writer think it would soften the insult to Right leaning and Conservative living people? I don't watch anything (sports, movies, etc) that insults me directly and equates me and people like me with criminals and terrorists. It is like hussein obama was a consultant!

431,stenies_rulez,Doesnt make sense,2,13 August 2021,The movie doesn't make sense. Some police officers hunt Washington for no reason. The plot is amateur like without any tension or something.

I liked very much the scenario... It wasn't too far fetched either.. sort of an alternative (and much more sinister) storyline of those turbulent times for Greece. Plausible though. The acting was adequate. And lastly
a nice surprise was the music, kind of low key low fi which actually accentuated the suspence.Go watch it, it's a nice movie.",Beckett

Have people given this a fairly good rating because it's Denzel Washington's son acting or has Covid 19 caused us to lower our appreciation of good movies. The acting in this movie is shocking.

Felt as though the characters really didn't have any chemistry and as much as we like JDW, his dramatic scenes reminded us of Jim Carrey in the blooper reel of Yes Man - ""Over actor!""My experience with Netflix and their movies has been, meh.

HOWEVER it deserves a 10 since the plot twists between good guys and bad guys in political movies are very rare nowadays.

The movie is so slow-paced it almost makes A Handmaids Tale look regular speed (kidding, nothing is as slow as AHT).Acting is poor, you can guess the every step everyone takes, you never wonder who the bad guys are, and generally it is just not a good movie.Only reason I sat thru it all was because of 7.4 rating on IMDb, so I kept hoping for something to happen; but I must have caught that rating early because when the movie was finally over, after what seemed like the entire period between when the first dinosaur lived until the last one died, the rating had changed to 5-something (which is still way too high).4 stars (because 3 and below is meant for the stuff that makes you want to ditch you tv in the dumpster)",Beckett

Beckett is in such shock that he never can tell his girlfriend's parents that she's dead. Annoying loose end?Then after being pursued all over Greece, he plays patty cake and politics with his pursuer.

I was hooked up by plot till the end and I believe John David Washington is next star on the rise. I was surprised to see so many bad reviews , but I think people have blurred the line between cinema and reality. Yes, there are scenes which are impossible to believe like his journey to Athens would have been more enduring for a ""real"" person and the character's ability to recover very quickly.

This movie is an intense thriller, and it delivers on that premise. The plot is intriguing, the chase sequences are pretty well done, and the acting is pretty top notch. The premise is very interesting to me, about a guy seemingly being in the wrong place at the wrong time, and having to propel himself to safety, after a massive tragedy. I did feel like some of the sequences were slightly unrealistic, but they never hit the point of this is an action movie character mixed with a video game protagonist that can seemingly just never die. Beckett stumbles around, not knowing how to defend himself, and certainly not being an action hero, but I think this quality really helped the movie out. The overall plot went well with the movie, and I think that the unrealistic aspects were subtle enough to be overlooked, and at the very least, excusable.Pros: cool setpieces, great performances, interesting plot, cool camerawork
Cons: Some unrealistic scenes of characters surviving unrealistic scenarios.",Beckett

You encountered a love birds talking to each other for a whole 10 minutes (which is kind of a boring). Some of us don't care about watching a love story of someone's else life or we can say it's the characters in the film. And what was frustrating besides of the fact that I waste my whole god damn time watching it, is the incoherency of the flow of the story. They first show and made you realize that it's all about love, then came to politics, then kidnapping and so on, until you realized and asked yourself ""what the hell is going on"". The script is one of the worst thing I've ever encountered in my life, It's childish and unprofessional. Most of the audience like me are finding or valuing the astonishing place, a good props, a good actors and more importantly the coherency of the story, which is not seen on the whole film. What a waste of time, I will not recommend this for those people who don't want to see or waste their time watching a boring movie on this time pandemic. Save your time.",Beckett
508,sakisioannou,Not a B-movie but worse...,1,27 August 2021,"Very poor acting. I'm very sorry Denzel but you should find another job for your son yourself. And not to let him drag your name.The action scenes are terrible and look's so much fake.I have seen low badget, cheap TV-series, that are much more well-filmed. There were scenes that were completely for amateurs. You thought they were shot with a cheap cellphone without a filter in the lens. No cinematographic sense.The film shows a Greece that does not exist in reality, even if some incidents during the great economic crisis seemed almost same.Apart from the natural landscapes and the archeological places, everything else is very difficult for a tourist to meet in Greece. For example an old big building before 1950 which mentions it as a mall.And also very rarely even a Greek meets them.In hospitals, police offices and public services and many people in Athens and the tourist places they usually speak English. This is much rarer in small villages from farmers, hunters etc. Also in non-tourist areas. In the film the exact opposite happens.Also when the episodes with the anarchokommunists etc (activists is the political correct term 😝) take place, in fact they are unfortunately 100 times worse...The whole movie gave me the feeling of one underdeveloped third world country in Africa or Latin America. No relationship with Greece. A safe country of the European Union...",Beckett

It was so mysterious, plot changing, and a pure difference in our normal action movie perspective. John David Washington acting skills are what I would call ""who could tell the difference?"" I literally felt as if he was living his real life through this role. I say this because if you're a true problem solver and try your best no matter how hard life can get, you try to find a way to the good side, this is a much SEE! 💜",Beckett

I had to look up the date of the film twice as it wasn't clear whether this film was set in present times or in the past as the setting, clothing and scenes where very old. Just really poor work. If it was set in the past this could have been made clear from the start. Second the leads acting was very bad. Not really sure why anybody thought this kind of sub standard acting was okay. I'm sure it's not just the actor's fault but I guess also the directors and production team. At times it was very cringe and made even worse by the poor editing. I don't think Washington should act in these low budget foreign films as it clearly ruins his image. However the script overall was not bad and story line engaging.",Beckett

533,cartereddie,Fully unsatisfying,2,18 August 2021,"Overall sense was that the movie doesn't hang together. Early scenes are weak with the dynamic being very forced between the actors (hard to watch it in parts) - but also seemed very amateur with the narrative being bizarrely over fed through the dialogue (eg the whole premise for being away from Athens etc). The relevance could have been developed in a less contrived way. All the main post accident scenes are repetitive and it was an unconvincing performance by lead, no sincerity or depth. There were also moments where it bordered on spoof like. North Greece and Athens with some impressive shots hence the two stars.",Beckett
534,tmyygx,Not a good movie.....,1,19 August 2021,"The storyline has so many gaps and inaccuracies. It's obvious that the director has tried to reflect on Greece's time to time political and social turmoils but he failed (e.g the protest took place in Exarcheia which is Athens' anarchist neighbourhood and not a communist one, you will never see a policeman in Greece with a beard, it is rare for the left party in Greece to hold the small red plain flags/ this is a trademark of anarchists, there was absolutely no reason for the ladies who were driving Beckett to Athens to follow that certain route /probably this route was followed to show the audience the scenery, but it was weird to watch if you are familiar with Greece's road network).Instead of this poor storyline and bad acting movie which delivers mixed messages about Greece, I would prefer to watch a movie/documentary about Alexis Grigoripoulos (a 15 year old boy who was fatally shot by police in Exarcheia, or about the murder of Pavlos Fyssas aka Killah P, a hip hop artist, who was stabbed to death by members of the Golden Down (far right party, those who have been named as «Sunrise» in this movie). Fortunately, Golden Dawn has been declared a criminal organisation and its leaders imprisoned.Back to the movie:Poorly written, bad acting, locations are superb though.",Beckett

537,dl_chatman,Exciting and Believable,9,21 August 2021,"This movie opens up with a love story that you're trying to follow to gauge how deep the connection is and then boom you're sent on an emotional rollercoaster in all of the best ways. I tried to imagine myself in the characters position and the way that JDW delivered this role mirrored my thought processes and his execution was incredibly believable. The portrayal of anxiety and adrenaline coupled with fear and paranoia did not go unnoticed.As a lover of film, photography and cinematography I thought the way they captured the shots were beautiful. Plenty of stills to choose from where you can examine the quality, composition and color grading. I love foreign films for their cinematic goodness and this movie falls into that category.I'm giving it a high rating because his acting is much better than others I've seen. Producing tears and making them feel real requires talent.In closing, I have noticed a strange trend with movies that feature an African-American lead. They are often being given low ratings that seem to be a bit malicious. It simply was not that bad and I'm disgusted that people would intentionally thwart viewership by discrediting this film the way that they are. Definitely diminishes the credibility of these rating & review sites.",Beckett

If you were in the situation and have a hard time explaining it because you have some mental barriers (from the story and director's narrative), its going to be exactly like this.Story fell apart at some places, could have been a multi facet revenge thriller, that April is murdered by those after Beckett, the connection to Karras could have been a bit better portrayed.

It's entertainment people, not a film that's going to relieve your inner angst, but provide some escapism with unsavory (unlikable) characters and themes! Washington and the other cast emoted the amount of fear, anyone in a foreign country with bad guys would feel, while grasping the tragic loss of a girlfriend, and the people (well-acted) that helped him along the way!

It reminded me of some of the classic films where the pace of the chase was so perfect at times, that I could actually feel my heart beating faster in anticipation.If you're a fan of flashy action that happens fast, but has no substance and intensity, then this film is not for you.

594,aguilarsamuel-98765,Waste of time,4,15 August 2021,"When I saw trailer thought I must see! Saw the movie and regreted it, boring!!!!!! The main character is boring .... story was not so bad... but overall really boring acting in general...",Beckett
595,chmpoure-1,Pretty good and somewhat realistic.,8,14 August 2021,"I am Greek and this was interesting. Nicely written Greek characters although poorly acted, good choice of filming locations. The plot is politically acute but the extend of the conspiracy over the top.",Beckett
596,lekeakinrowo,Beautiful Locations,4,19 August 2021,"Visually stimulating Greek countryside provide the main highlight of this movie. The plot is weak, acting (particularly for the main characters) appears generally poor, and directing is deficient too.",Beckett
597,tomhall-33847,Original idea. Worth a watch.,10,21 August 2021,"Ignore the 1 and 2 star reviews. People who gave it this rating are probably the same people who give 'Harry Potter' and the 'Avengers' 10 star ratings. This is a fun movie to watch and an original plot that works.I don't really think it's a 10, more of a 7/8, but I wanted to boost the rating considering all the so-called experts who left such negative reviews.Give this movie a go. Nice settings. Good acting. Original storyline. Yes there's a few things hat happen that are a bit unbelievable, but hey...Jason Bourne and Ethan Hunt perform some ridiculous stunts and they seem to get away with it. So why can't John David Washington??Watch it, like it, do whatever you like with it. But don't refuse to watch it just because some negative people who can't review a movie to save their own life decided to give it 1 star.Enjoy the movie 😊",Beckett
598,katerpapan,Waste of time,1,14 August 2021,"I wish I could find sth good to say about this movie but it was one of the worst movies I ve seen in a while. The leading characters are not likable, the plot is boring and silly to say the least.The film sets in the political reality of Greece in 2015 but they have slightly changed the names so that they wouldn't boldly plagiarize the actual names (e.g. Golden dawn is sunrise in the movie) which feels ridiculous right away.The dialogues and plot feel as if they were written by a 15year old. There are many ridiculous scenes with the worst one being the one where the American agent reveals classified info for no reason at all and decides to let Washington go with a warning.The characters are caricatures and have 0 depth while the protagonist gets shot several times, stabbed, falls off a cliff, jumps of a building and lands face first on a car, has several broken bones but never needs anything more than a bandage. Lastly, there is no reason to chase the protagonist. The plot is not believable and incoherent at best. That is painfully evident when the American agents calls off the protagonists murder because there's no need to kill him anymore.",Beckett
599,iliashhgr,"Not Batman, not James Bond, just a guy in a foreign country.",9,13 November 2021,"I loved this movie. From the start untill the end. It wasn't the stereotype action movie from Hollywood. Not that I don't like Hollywood movies they are really enjoyable but this movie was somehow very grounded. A single person can't just beat up groups of people like batman so every fight was a struggle here. The protagonist is not portraied as a superhero of some kind, but just a guy who gets mixed up in events that don't really have anything to do with him. The fact that the protagonist was not that superhuman James bond type actually makes it possible to put oneself into his position and relate better to the person here. What I also really liked was the acting performances. Every scene had a unique atmosphere and in my opinion captured greek mentality very well. So my conclusion is that this movie is not suited for a wide audience but it is still really a great movie. Thats why I give it 9 points. I recommend watching it if you want to see a different approach to action thrillers without huge special effects but with solid acting, lot of excitement and a good plot. If you like movies with David Washington or if you are greek and like to see a mix of American and Greek acting you absolutely have to see it.",Beckett
600,eduardoacrespojr,A refreshing to a classical action.,8,14 August 2021,"The movie starts off very pleasant with a romantic thrill that turns into an accident. The movie film goes retrograde. As you will experience a non-clarity modernized traditional film from this movie. The Character which is right on synchronize in survival. Becomes torn between a witness and a survivalist. This Movie becomes intertwined with a classic action-packed movie experience. It isn't your tradition of today's era actions, but is excellent in telling a story of opposites and unknowning people who you may encounter become wicked. The film deserves an audience of well delivered story of a man fighting to stay alive because he becomes a witness to a incident he never even knew about until they try to kill him. The actor becomes so real in his acting, and the story becomes clearer as you witness his story.",Beckett
601,kierand-63210,Farsical,3,30 August 2021,"Horrible movie. Dunno what was worse , the acting or the plot.Denzel may be hoping to start his son off but he'd be better off sending him to acting school.",Beckett
602,ahteshamkhan-31923,Brilliant!,10,14 August 2021,"Well... I saw this movie today, really liked the plot, the twists and turns are really applauding, Washington did his stuff fine, the cinematography is great, the scenery of Greece is just outstanding, overall a great movie... 10 stars.",Beckett
603,sanapol-75888,This can not go any slower,1,12 November 2021,"I thought that actors of this class could not be in a bad movie. But i forgot that the director counts also.. do not watch this, you will lose precious time, better spend it on something else.",Beckett
604,lloydemily,"Finally! An action packed movie with actual acting, minus all the over-done CGI.",10,22 August 2021,"What you get is a very well done, action packed, suspense-thriller without all the CGI and with actual GREAT acting. I've been looking for one of these movies. I was on the edge of my seat for a lot of it. The story line has depth and I was a little emotional at times seeing what the character was going through and cheering for him. It made me want to reach into the screen and give the guy a hug and tell him to keep going. Thank you for making a movie with some fantastic scenery and a real-life feel to it.",Beckett

609,gorourke-95334,Non stop thriller with a great suspenseful ending,8,16 September 2021,Not sure who or why ppl would rate this 5.6 do they watch good movies? Perhaps they don't like being entertained at all. This film has it all drama from the beginning you would think it's a romance then the scene where your at a lost as to where the plot is heading then non stop suspense. I couldn't look away. Hang there and your in for a hell of a ride not to mention a very polished performance from Washington JR.,Beckett

612,shoshanaisrael,THE WORST MOVIE,2,16 August 2021,"This is the WORST concept of a movie because to be honest this just simply isn't realistic.A black man running out of his wits to find a Grecian boy who he's never met after being heartbroken over the death of his girlfriend?!?Lol 😂 I'm sorry but it's not believable. David Washington gets shot several times, once in the stomach then in the hand then his finger broken, falls down cliffs, fights off CIA and other trained men....anyway- watch at your own risk.",Beckett
