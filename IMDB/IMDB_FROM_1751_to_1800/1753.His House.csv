0,Leofwine_draca,A decent stab at urban horror,7,6 November 2020,"The haunted house flick is old and cliched these days - to be fair, it's been so since the 1930s - but HIS HOUSE manages to breathe life into a flagging, overblown genre. The point of view, that of a pair of Sudanese asylum seekers, is spot on and allows for a fresh perspective on otherwise familiar events. This low budget film adopts an understated approach for the most part, painting a grim social milieu and interspersing effective flashbacks in the narrative to tell a story of sadness and despair. What keeps you watching is the quality of the acting from Sope Dirisu and Wunmi Mosaku, who are both excellent in their parts. My only gripe is with the climax, which gets a little too drawn out and over the top for my tastes, but otherwise this is a minor gem.",His House
1,kosmasp,Who's House?,9,17 November 2020,"Talk about a slow burn of a movie ... some may read horror movie and think this will be just one jump scare after another ... and while there are some of those, this builds up! And in quite the original and weird fashion! The fear of living or being in your own appartment/house cannot be put into words. Well not accurately that is - which is why this is also a visual treat.A horror movie that has quite impact - or is able to, if you let it. Visually stunning and creepy as it can be. The pacing probably will be an issue for some, but it isn't for you, do it! Watch it - you should be able to tell, if you like this after the first 15 minutes or so. And you can watch it again and again - because while this is a horror movie on the surface, there is a lot more beneath it ...",His House
2,jboothmillard,His House,7,19 April 2021,"Before Awards Season, I never would have heard about this British scary movie, it looked and sounded really interesting, so I was definitely up for it. Basically, in war-torn South Sudan, Bol (Sope Dirisu) and Rial (BAFTA nominated Wunmi Mosaku) are refugees fleeing with their daughter, Nyagak (Malaika Abigaba). They brave stormy waters on an overcrowded motorboat with many fellow refugees on the perilous English Channel from France searching for a better life. Although they survive the treacherous crossing, their daughter and many others are killed. Three months, they have made it to Britain and are finally granted probational asylum. The government assigns them a dilapidated house on the outskirts of London which has peeling walls, dismal furnishings and almost no cleanliness. They are given strict restrictions, or they may face deportation. They experience racism and hatred from their neighbours. They are met by their case worker Mark (Matt Smith) who appears to be friendly and hopeful for them. Bol tries to incorporate himself to their new life, including interacting with others, trying to encourage Rial to use utensils for eating, and even changing how he dresses. Bol wants to prove to the government that he and Rial belong in the UK. Rial, however, clings to their culture, including dressing in colourful clothes and eating on the floor rather than at the table. She also keeps the necklace of their dead daughter. Both Bol and Rial soon experience strange and disturbing phenomena in their new home, seeing visions of Nyagak and a mysterious man, who both lurk in the walls. Rial works out that the evil in their house is an apeth (a ghostly being of South Sudanese Dinka folklore) or ""night witch"". She tells Bol the story of a poor man in her village who accidentally stole from an apeth by the river. When the thief built his home, the apeth moved in with him and haunted him. Rial believes that an apeth has followed them and if they repay their debt, the apeth will bring Nyagak back to them. But they do not know what the ""debt"" is that they need to repay. Bol burns everything they brought with them, but the evil spirit continues to torment him, and things deteriorate between the couple. Bol goes to Mark to request new accommodation, claiming that their home is infested with rats, but is unable to convince him. Bol tears apart the house looking for the apeth, and the chances for the couple staying in the UK are threatened when Mark discovers the damage. But Rial tells Bol that this is fine and that she wants to leave. Bol locks Rial in the house before he summons the apeth himself, who calls him a thief and claims that Bol took a life. The apeth offers Bol a deal: his life for Nyagak's, but he outright refuses this offer, resulting in Bol becoming so angered that he momentarily becomes catatonic. When Rial is tormented by the spirit, she manages to escape the house but finds herself inexplicably back in South Sudan in a familiar classroom. She is reunited with old friends, and a flashback reveals them to be victims of a horrendous massacre. Rial survived the massacre by hiding. Bol found her and the couple made their escape as violence gripped the region, but a bus service would only let on people with children. Nyagak was found by Bol in the crowd and abducted, the couple falsely claimed that she was their daughter. The couple boarded the bus and escaped, leaving Nyagak's real mother (Lola May) running behind the bus, as gunfire erupted. Later, many Africans crossed a rough sea, when Nyagak and others fell overboard. Neither Bol nor Rial could reach her in time. Having accepted what they did, Bol decides to repay the debt to the apeth and tells Rial the truth. Bol starts to let the apeth into his skin and Nyagak enters the room and returns to Rial. But Rial does not accept this alternate reality, she saves Bol by slitting the apeth's throat. Later, Mark comes to inspect the house to find it repaired. Bol and Rial tell him they have chosen to stay and make it their new home. They say Rial killed the witch that haunted them, which Mark finds funny. Bol says they decided to live and go on with the ghosts of their past from South Sudan, including Nyagak. Through the doorway, the spirits of other unknown immigrants are seen, and with them in the home, but the couple are then seen alone and stand holding holds in their new home with a peaceful look in their eyes. Also starring Javier Botet as the Witch, Emily Taaffe as Dr. Hayes, Dominic Coleman as Lead Officer, and Cornell John as the voice of the Witch. Dirisu and Mosaku both give great performances as the refugees seeking a better life, the mix of displacement, trauma and social alienation and the evil ghoul terrifying the couple is clever, it has well done traditional scares and hideous visual that get your attention, it is an imaginative take on the haunted house movie, an interesting horror thriller. It won the BAFTA for Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director, or Producer for Remi Weekes (writer/director), and it was nominated for Outstanding British Film of the Year. Very good!",His House
3,Quinoa1984,not a very very very fine house,9,8 March 2021,"Truly terrifying, mostly because Weekes has great skill at drawing out the terror and how psychically linked it is to deeply personal trauma and grief. It takes both the thorny politics of assimilation, of what is one's home or place in the world, along with the horror of the value of death balanced with life itself (and Weekes understands and communicates that the political is personal, visa versa, so on). But his real win here is in the casting of Dirisu and particularly Mosaku - he manages to channel the ambivalence and Trying to Remain Composed type (but not holding up well) very strongly, while Mosaku is one of those major talents who can say so much with a look or a stare. In any just or healthy cinematic landscape she would be working steadily in good stuff forever, and hopefully she does. This is not something to throw on unless you're in the mood for a heavy mood (this isn't a frivolous like Conjuring or Blumhouse rollercoaster jam), this is more akin to like the Devil's Backbone as far as being exceptionally creepy, helmed by an artist in full command of his craft, and that it's about something - not to mention the genius of the premise itself, which helps bypass the usual question in ghost stories of ""why don't they just leave?"" Easier said than done, it seems. Oh, and that one masked girl... Holy god.",His House
4,searchanddestroy-1,Ken Loach as guest in The Haunting,9,17 January 2021,"I am not a great fan of horror films, especially from the last decades; I am still in the deep fifties or sixties period, such as Bob Wise's THE HAUNTING. There were full batches of those movies since so many years, so many, so many....But this one offers the particularity to show a kind of mix between social and horror topics. It talks of the immigration problem, how people from Africa have to deal to finally make it in an unknown country for them. I would also say that the woman's character, the wife, is terrific, so moving, this poor woman so dedicated in searching happiness for her and her husband. She is not a great actress, but only her presence is enough to convince, to bring something totally unexpected in a horror movie; because it remains a horror film. Not a main drama, though containing drama elements. And she is not a pretty woman, not a top model, as you could find in an US feature.",His House
5,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Chilling and creepy haunted house film,9,30 December 2020,"After leaving their war-torn village, a man and his wife are granted asylum in a small suburb in London where they're to remain for the time being, but as they remain in the house a disturbing presence makes them believe they're being haunted by a vicious spirit after them for malicious reasons and must find out why.This was a pretty impressive and enjoyable effort. A lot of the films' impact stems from the stylish and intriguing setup that brings about quite nicely here with the intriguing setup. Taking the backstory of this one into account where they have to remain in the house part of their conditional release from the holding facility where they're unable to move away or generally cause trouble for themselves or anyone else around them in order to keep the sense of freedom they have, it creates a rather chilling scenario for them. Essentially unable to leave the house even if they wanted to not just by the orders of the living arrangement but also the growing realization that they're trapped in the presence of the spirit, it generates plenty of creepiness and suspense throughout here. That becomes far more intense when the film capitalizes on the situation to bring about some solid scare scenes. The outlay of the house is somewhat creepy enough and then adding on the scenes of him trying to unspool the cloth to fix the hole in the wall who then sees the ghostly hand emerge and grab it away suddenly, the bouncing ball that keeps rolling out of the shadows to then stop suddenly in front of them or the stand-out sequence of the spirit showing itself and attacking him in the darkened room. Even the hallucinations work, from the dream of encountering her disfigured corpse in the sea of similar beings around him or the torment caused by all the various spirits and is only just barely saved through outside circumstances. These here manage to make for a wholly enjoyable and chilling effort while there are some issues to be had with the film. The main issue here is the absolutely nonsensical decision-making that goes on here with their house clearly being haunted by an unknown entity. There's plenty of evidence here to support the notion of that yet his stubborn-ness and single-minded nature to keep them both in the house in its crosshairs doesn't make any sense when he isn't aware at all of what it wants. Since he finds this out later, there's a disturbingly unlikable quality that washes over him with his insistence on doing so, even more so with the lame and lackluster reasoning given for doing so. That doesn't come off in any believable manner at all which just makes this whole thing seem quite pointless. The other problem with this one is the somewhat scattershot ending that loses quite a bit of the punch of the story. Turning into a confusing series of scenes about them going from their present situation to hallucinations back in their native village within the span of several minutes which is quite a jarring effect. Given that the use of so many of these scenes are dependent on going through the various hallucinations and visions that are quite jarring to go through while also contradicting the storyline by switching around a characters' point-of-view for no reason how they've been all fine long since it does nothing special. These hold it down slightly.Rated Unrated/R: Violence and Language.",His House
6,trashgang,totally not for me,5,11 November 2020,"Must be me because it's a bit hyped at the moment as it is mostly with Netflix horrors. A must see. So I did and left with mixed emotions.Original at the fact that it's full of African culture and the refugee problems in the UK. The horror lays in the fact that it's all about the African culture are things are being seen at the house given to refugees. A witc is in the house.Sounds great but it's a lot about blah blah and now and then indeed some zombiefied people appear and masked ones.Was I scared, not one bit. Was it creepy, not at all but the effects used were okay and the zombiefied ones were well done.But still, towards the end I was just waiting for it to be over. Not that much of horror to see after all. Not for me this one.

7,deloudelouvain,"Not bad, decent horror flick.",6,16 November 2020,"In this genre His House is a nice breath of fresh air, something different from the usual things we see. It's not all perfect but it's certainly good enough to entertain many fans of this genre, with creepy passages and decent horror scenes. The cinematography isn't bad with interesting camerawork at times. As for the acting I thought the two major characters played by Sope Dirisu and Wunmi Mosaku were very believable in their roles. Good performances from both of them as well as from the rest of the cast. It isn't a movie I would watch again but it was certainly good enough to keep me entertained for the whole duration of the movie.",His House
8,siderite,A messy combination of jump scares and social commentary,5,9 March 2021,"I feel like I missed something, as so many people said this was good, but for me it was a really boring story punctuated by pointless jump scares. Probably the biggest issue with it is characterization, though. I couldn't care less about the quietly judgemental black woman, the angry black man ordering his wife around and the non linear story that predictably ends in them feeling shame or regret for something they've done in the past, like good poor god fearing people. And yes, the film hints at bigger issues, at the refugee plight, at how difficult it is to adapt to a completely different culture, but it touches them in formulaic and ultimately Western thinking ways.There is always this silly morality in this kind of horror films, something to explain why it all happened, connect the special effects with some sort of human emotion that would make sense, a final twist that makes it all fall into place. But it just proves that until that connection is made, everything was pointless or at least unnecessarily obtuse. And it is thus with this film. It has about 15% of good quality stuff, but the rest is just filler and characters you can't empathize much with and the telegraphed jump scares.",His House
9,Edvis-1997,5,5,23 November 2020,Well I found it really boring and acting wasn't professional for me. Not sure why it has 72 Metascore but it wasn't my cup of tea. Wouldn't recommend to watch it if you like horror movies because it had 0 elements of scare. If you like drama/ghosts then maybe it's for you but the movie is bland and nothing special.,His House
10,Pjtaylor-96-138044,This is my house. I have to defend it.,8,7 November 2020,"'His House (2020)' follows a refugee couple who are moved into their new urban home and struggle to adjust to their new life, thanks - in no small part - to the otherworldly presence that lurks within their home. It's a film steeped in subtext, a marriage of genre and theme that creates an incredibly cohesive experience. Though it makes several missteps and is often too heavy-handed for its own good, the affair is compelling throughout and succeeds in pretty much everything it attempts. Its two leads do a fantastic job of portraying the terror of their situation, trapped in a haunted house and expected to be thankful for it. They have two distinct ideas about how best to proceed and this conflict makes for an interesting dynamic that allows the piece to explore its central issue even more fully, both on a literal and metaphorical level. Whether or not its horrors are 'real' is, ultimately, irrelevant; the movie's spooky events work just as well either way. They're a reflection of both the characters' inner conflict and outward situation, an intriguing and effective way of exploring how these things feel rather than how they are. These suspense sequences are atmospheric and intense, only occasionally tipping into potentially silly territory. As it moves towards its conclusion, the thing gets a bit more overt than it perhaps ought to (visually, at least). However, it sticks the landing thanks to its complex and satisfying final message. The overall experience feels oddly important, in a way. It empathetically delves into an underexplored situation, funnelling each and every one of its genre elements through this in an affecting and resonant way. It isn't perfect, but it's a gripping and distinct affair throughout. 8/10",His House
11,cricketbat,A chilling & heartbreaking story,8,19 October 2021,"His House is a captivating horror movie, because underneath the ghostly tale, you also get a deeper story regarding relocated refugees, marital relationships, and grief. Parts of this film chilled me to the bone, whereas others gave me an emotional gut punch. This movie also has an independent, low-budget feel that works to its advantage. I will be thinking about His House for a long time.",His House
12,paulclaassen,"Wow, incredible performances!",7,27 May 2021,"Hail to director Remi Weekes for a very different approach to horror!I fell in love with the main characters from the very beginning, and sympathized with them. The performances by Sope Dirisu and Wunmi Mosaku are incredible, especially Wunmi, who - in my opinion - delivered an Oscar winning performance. She was stunning!I found 'His House' so captivating that I was glued to the screen. The director effectively created suspense with background imagery and shadows - without the use of blaring scare music. This made it more realistic, and a hell of a lot scarier. Some scenes were truly creepy! The use of close-up photography and wide and long shots were also highly effective. 'His House' might come across as another haunted house film, but this was very different, with bucket loads of emotion - enhanced by Wunmi's fabulous performance!Eventually, the film offered more than I expected. It was a heart wrenching depiction of a couple who lost a child - but not entirely in the sense you'd expect. It was disturbing on so many levels.'His House' might not be everyone's cup of tea, but it is brilliant film making. The film received 37 award nominations, winning 8 - including Outstanding Debut by a British Writer Director or Producer, Best Director, Best Actress, Best Production Design, Best Effects, Best Film.Would I watch it again? Probably, yes.",His House
13,cruise01,Creepy and scary but shallow plot and tedious direction.,6,5 November 2020,3 out of 5 stars.His House is a fair horror film that does offer some scares and jump scares which will keep your heart pounding. But the story is shallow as it tries something new and direction is dull and bleak that does make it difficult to sit through.The plot is about a couple who was able to escape from an hostile country in Africa. Able to get shelter in England with a probation period to pass through the immigration laws. They move into a house. Until they begin experiencing some haunting noises and sightings.There is more to the plot without giving away spoilers which focuses on the couple and there tragic losses they dealt with escaping.The film does have several creepy and scary moments that will get your adrenaline going when the couple run into ghostly figures or strange sightings.The performances were decent with the cast ensemble. The direction is also decent which feels shallow and could have been so much more. While it feels forgettable to any other horror movie.,His House
14,eddie_baggins,A solid horror that works better as a straight up drama,6,5 November 2020,"Creating a significant critical stir at this years Sundance Film Festival where debut director Remi Weeke's topical horror/drama was quickly snapped up by streaming giant Netflix for a worldwide distribution deal, His House is going to be a divisive film amongst genre fans even if a number of moments in this solid effort suggest Weeke's is a director to keep a very close eye on.Certainly more drama than horror, His House will disappoint anyone entering through its doors expecting a fright a minute exercise, not to say there aren't horrifying moments to be found within of which there are occurrences, with pure horror fans likely to be left severely let down by this small-scale offering that is more focused on the mental trauma and refugee experience of its main characters Bol and Rial.Played well by Sope Dirisu and Wunmi Mosaku respectively, Bol and Rial are realistic examples of those seeking a better life in a Western country and there terrifying escape and tragic circumstances create the backbone of His House's morals and narrative as the two figures try to deal with their new environment, new house and new horror's that may be lurking for them both real and imagined.Similar in some ways to lauded modern Australian horror The Babadook, His House prefers to steep itself more in the realism spectrum of horror even if in its latter stages it goes all out on a more out there finale that will divide appreciation amongst its viewers but regardless of what you feel towards this final stretch it offers some of the films most thrilling and tension riddled moments that are needed after much of the film prefers to slowly get through its material that is mostly thrill free for the majority.This more event-filled portion of the film is both a good and bad thing for Weekes film with it showing off some great skill by the director to craft some unnerving and unforgettable moments but also his mismanagement of the film throughout much that had come before with a feeling ever present that the genre moulding that film does may've been better served had it focused on being an outright horror or a social commentary drama that was more interested in the horror of the everyday rather than the supernatural.Final Say -A film with some brilliant moments, intriguing ideas and some solid performances, His House is a valiant attempt at crafting something new and fresh but as a horror film it barely raises a pulse until its final segments hit, while as a dramatic effort its engaging without every becoming a truly gripping experience.3 prying neighbors out of 5",His House

18,southdavid,... in the middle of his street.,7,7 July 2021,"This BBC produced movie appeared on Netflix last year, and I added it to my list but didn't manage to get back around to it until this weekend. What I found was a wonderfully made film, particularly for a debut feature, that displayed none of the shortcomings I might have anticipated from the relatively low budget.A refugee couple, Bol (Sope Dirisu) and Rial Majur (Wunmi Mosaku) make it to England and apply for asylum. Their appeal is accepted, and they are allocated an aging house on a council estate in an unnamed city. They both come quickly to believe that their new house is haunted by a creature living mostly within the walls, but as they are on probation their case manager, Mark (Matt Smith) advises strongly against applying for relocation. But is the ghost real, or a manifestation of survivors guilt the pair have, following the dangers they've overcome.""His House"" has two really strong things going for it. First are the performances. Sop Dirisu had a great 2020, starring in both this film and as Elliot in ""Gangs of London"". Wunmi Mosaku also had a strong year, as one of the leads in ""Lovecraft Country"" and now is appearing in ""Loki"". They are both great, as is Matt Smith, with a role that might have gone down a more obvious antagonistic route.The second strength is the visual effects. The mixture of practical and CGI is really well done, in terms of the otherworldly characters, the dream sequences and the transitions between them. I was impressed about how deeply the film delved into the realms of the horror genre. Whereas I was anticipating a film much more about embedded racism, or the Asylum seeker experience, there was just enough of that to service the story without feeling like a lecture. I was also impressed with the surprises and twist that the plot delivered.It doesn't score higher with me just because the ending is a little underwhelming and some of the sections of ""haunting"" are a touch derivative, but overall I'd recommend this film and I'll keep an eye out for what comes next from director Remi Weekes.",His House

21,jtindahouse,The bulk of the movie so bland and unscary that by the time it has something to say it's lost you,5,2 March 2021,"The problem 'His House' has is that it has an interesting plot twist to deliver to the audience near the end - however if it hasn't completely lost you already by that point then you have a lot more patience than I do. The film plays itself off to be a regulation ghost story but they do that side of things so poorly that it becomes unbearably tedious very quickly. By the time it comes to show us what is actually going on I had zero enthusiasm left available to care.The story I thought would've actually been more interesting was the genuine struggles that refugees go through acclimatising to a new country. The little hints and glimpses of that we were given were far more interesting to me than a ghost running behind the walls of a house.The film doesn't really have any star power in the cast and so all the characters come across extremely blandly. Matt Smith is actually in the film, however he's given so little to work with that it might as well have been anybody.I respect what 'His House' was trying to do, but in order for it to work it had to either go a different path or it had to make the ghosts in the house element actually scary and interesting to watch. For me in films like this less is always more. The film showed way too much and once you've seen what you're meant to be afraid of you very rarely ever continue to be. This was a missed opportunity.",His House
22,billcr12,Good Horror Flick,7,10 December 2020,This is a horror film with a message. Two people feeing civil strife in Africa wind up in Britain as asylum seekers and are treated like scum by Brits both black and white. They are put in some grungy housing with peeled wallpaper and roaches but they attempt to adapt to their new surroundings. The African couple playing the husband and wife are excellent.

23,GiraffeDoor,It's kind of like the movie Jordan Peele wishes he made.,7,16 December 2020,"I really want to be positive about this one. Even the horror movies that try to push the envelope like ""Hereditary"" often have major technical flaws but this one, despite some drawbacks, truly feels like a professional job, not only in its production but in its writing. It feels neither by the numbers nor without a basic sense of prudence in its structuring.Get ready for some cheesy visuals but that is only a cosmetic aspect of the movie. This is one of those supernatural horror movies that tries to have a very human terror at its centre as very well developed characters have to deal with their personal figurative demons in a very material way.Sure, some will insist its all some kind of metaphor like how they insisted that ""The Babadook"" was really about depression and you can take that angle if you like but the story stands on its own two feet without the need to pull at too much subtext.With its slight, chill atmosphere in a stagnating corner of my homeland, the sense of dread almost never quite leaves us as our two main characters deal not only with the unknown menace but with that curious omnipresence of the authorities and no matter how good our intentions, it's hard to not feel like a criminal. You cannot tell me that they weren't going for a racism theme.Seriously, that candle terrified me. I'm not kidding.I never know what to say about acting except it's amazing here. Matt Smith is memorable but he doesn't manage to quite steal the show.This is one of those movies that confronts us with some of the very worst humanity has to give and can experience and although there are indeed wrong notes in there horror is hard and one feels that a lot of passion went into this and it truly does respect its audience.",His House
24,alindsay-al,A Good Horror Film,7,5 November 2020,"Yes, I know Halloween was last week and I am late with this review but better late then never so here is my review for the new Netflix Horror Film His House. The premise of the film sees a refugee couple arrive in the UK but struggle to adapt to new life.Main Character
Sope Dirisu who did a great job on Gangs Of London plays the main character here and once again he does a great job, he delivers a strong performance that makes you interested in his character. He just does a good job as a lead male in a horror film, there isn't much else to explain without spoilers just that he is really good.Supporting Characters
Wunmi Mosaku who was on Lovecraft Country, though I didn't care much for her character Ruby, also does a great job here. Her and Dirisu have a great dynamic and actually it very well could be argued that she is the protagonist of the film and the moral centre. She does a great job here and adds plenty to her role and the film that you are watching. Matt Smith has a small role here and he does a good job when on screen, he doesn't take away from the film by being in it too much and actually adds plenty to the film and his relationship with the two leads works well.Story
The story is good, especially in the last act for me. There is a twist in the movie that made it way more interesting for me and by holding off on it the reveal felt more impactful, also just the feeling of the surroundings was done well and made you feel stuck in this place with the couple. Though I will say that the first like 30 mins are fine but a bit slow, you aren't really given much in terms of plot and it feels a bit like it is moving through the numbers but it does pick up as it goes on.Script
The script is okay, it creates a tense filled atmosphere and helps develop its characters to make them interesting. There is some decent dialogue here but nothing particularly memorable and no real moments to rise it above other horror films.Style
The film does a good job of unnerving the audience and the characters, it relies on tension building instead of jump scares (mostly) which makes it more scary in my opinion. The film also is only 90 mins which is a good thing because any longer would have been too long, though I will say the pacing isn't quite there as I mentioned in the story section as to why it holds the film back.Overall
Overall, this is a strongly acted tension filled horror film that is a good watch. It isn't going to change the horror movie genre but if you like horror films and have 90 mins free then I would say it is worth a go.",His House

I am a big fan of horror films and this movie definitely delivers. The story is one that blends very well the horrors that many refugees face along with the manifestations of the terrors they bring. Often times the most scariest stories are those that deal with the non supernatural.More specifically, the movie is actually logical and doesn't fall for the classic tropes. In many scary movies that deal with a haunted house, I ask myself ""Why don't they just move?!?!?!"" but in this case they can't because they're placed in these specific, confining circumstances in order to get their asylum granted. I was also a fan of how the film portrays the female character as the strong, cool and collected wife while it's the husband who quickly descends into madness.Overall, I encourage everyone to watch this movie when it comes out on Netflix Turkiye.",His House

28,Pairic,Existential Terror,8,5 November 2020,"His House: A different sort of horror film involving asylum seekers from South Sudan. Boi (Sope Dirisu) and Rial (Wunmi Mosaku) are given a house ""in need of improvements"" in an outer London suburb. Bol ties to assimilate joining with other men in the social centre singing football songs, Rial sticks more to her culture. They both mourn their daughter who was lost at sea during their journey. Nightmares, visions and memories of the sea journey plague them to a frightening extent. While decorating, Bol finds a wire in a wall which turns out to be attached to a seaweed draped rope. Creatures and their dead friends appear in the house. Eventually Rial realises that an Apeth (Night Witch) is their house. Good imaging of this frightening monster as well other disturbing scenes. To be suddenly thrust again into the sea and be at risk of drowning incites existential terror. Being plagued by petty bureaucrats on to p of that doesn't make for an easy life. Convoluted at times but it hangs together in the end. Co-Written and Directed by Remi Weekes. On Netflix. 8/10.",His House

31,masonfisk,HORROR FOLLOWS YOU EVERYWHERE...!,7,1 February 2021,"A recent Netflix horror film. A married African couple are in detention in England when the good news come down they've been accepted (temporarily) for asylum. They're immediately provided w/an apartment (in an estate facility) food & other essentials where they hope to keep their noses clean for about a year where a final evaluation will come down whether they stay or go. The moment they get into the flat however things of a supernatural nature start to haunt the couple w/their lost daughter, who drowned in a boat bound for England's shores, the focus of the ghost's ire. The wife, played by Lovecraft Country's Wunmi Mosaku, insists the spirits need to be appeased so they should return home but the war torn circumstances of home doesn't offer any salvation. The husband, played by Sope Dirisu, being the atypical man of the house won't have any of it but when the specters begin to affect him (appearing as cadavers breaking through the walls) even he can't deny the situation he finds himself in. Using ambience & mood to set the stage for this frightfest works wonders when the lazy default of loud scares & overblown imagery would've been the usual ticket. Mosaku (along w/her appearance in the last season of Luther) continues to impress as an actress who can do no wrong no matter the accent or skin color while Dirisu, is great as the fulcrum of incident in this tale of regret & possibility. Matt Smith (Dr. Who, 2 doctors ago) appears in a small role as a beleaguered case worker assigned to them.",His House
32,valleyjohn,A film that's undecided what it is.,6,31 March 2021,"I don't like to be too critical about young debutant directors , especially British ones , let's face it , I couldn't do what they do but I have to be honest and say that this film did very little for me.I'm not a horror fan anyway which doesn't help but because this was nominated for BAFTAS, I thought I'd give it a go .It's the story of refugee couple who makes a harrowing escape from war-torn South Sudan, but then they struggle to adjust to their new life in an English town that has an evil lurking beneath the surface.The problem I have with this is that it's undecided what it's meant to be about.Is it a social study on how the nasty English ( note the sarcasm) treat asylum seekers. Is it about the journey immigrants go on to make a new life for themselves or is it meant to be a horror ? .
The truth is , It's a bit of all three and I'd have it be just one .The performances are fine. I particularly like Sope Dirisu who I first saw in the TV series Gangs Of London and I was a little surprised to see Matt Smith pop up as well.There are a few jump scares and it's mildly spooky at times but in the last third it severely loses its way with the saving the young girl storyline .Any other year I don't think the BAFTAS would have even looked at this film but with Lockdown and the new stance on multiculturalism in film , it did and that's good news for Director Remi Weekes.",His House
33,begob,But this is our home ...,8,13 November 2020,"A couple fleeing tribal violence find refuge in Britain, but their nightmare doesn't end there.Complex characters in a finely tuned horror - strictly for adults! This starts with a sequence of brief action scenes, almost a montage, that convey just as much as we need to know. That's followed by a glum depiction of refugee bureaucracy, which got my spidey-sense tingling that this might be another issues movie. We've seen plenty over the past few years, mostly family dramas that use horror to make a point: The Babadook, Relic, even Hereditary. Impressive, but either too metaphorical or incoherent.Well, this one hits the spot. It does raise the expected issues, but doesn't hammer them home, instead leaving us with their texture while the characters get drawn deeper into a mysterious terror. The performances are excellent, as the couple move together and apart, each absorbing in their own way the malevolence that stalks them. The emotional high comes in an accusation during dinner, with the couple truly at odds with their predicament and themselves.I prefer my demons introduced gradually, so while the director sustains the sense of hallucination, he does get a bit ahead of himself on the visuals. This blunts the suspense, and in the climax he goes too big on CGI. That's my preference, and I found much of the imagery startling, with some ghoulish touches out of Africa, plus a superb dream scene bang in the middle, followed by several atmospheric episodes. The sound design is subtle, which may leave the jump scares underpowered, and the orchestrated music only comes in later, finishing with a gorgeous choir.About halfway through I was delighting in the sophistication of the screenwriting - however, by the end me not so happy. The reveal genuinely confused me over whether there was one crucial character, or two. And if it was just one, doesn't that muddy the wife's motivation? It was the bus scene that made me think, ""Hang on ..."", so maybe I'll get satisfaction on another viewing. The final scene is touching - it was only afterward I realised the contrast between the two sets of people, but still a great reminder that horror is best when it digs a grave for our most basic and dreary troubles.Overall: a few flaws, but a superior horror that weaves its wicked way, rather than ticking off the frights.",His House
34,arungeorge13,Better than a good chunk of Netflix's offerings in the horror genre! [+62%],6,31 October 2020,"The horrors that asylum-seekers have to put themselves through when meshed with a haunted house storyline is what we get in Netflix's His House. Bol (Dirisu) and Rial (Mosaku) are refugees fleeing their war-torn country of Sudan; they brave bullets, rough waters, and even lose their daughter as they finally arrive in Britain where they're granted probational asylum. They're temporarily moved into a shabby, crumbling house in the London suburbs, and that's when the past begins to haunt them.His House is a pretty strong directorial debut from Remi Weekes, who has also written the screenplay. It may just be a 93-minute film, however, His House manages to dive equal parts deep into the struggles of immigrants as well as survivor guilt. While Bol tries to blend in with the new surroundings (he sings football anthems at bars, changes his attire, and prefers to use tables while eating), Rial holds firmly onto their culture (she wears their daughter's necklace, dresses in vibrant colors, and sits on the floor while eating).The scares, the greatest thing about horror films, are well-conceived. Weeks mixes jumpscares with more atmosphere-heavy ones in an effort to keep viewers on edge. Practical and visual effects are put to solid use in these sequences, though some fare better than others. A little inspiration has been drawn from films like The Conjuring and Lights Out, in a good way. Weekes, through some effective crafting that blur the lines between fantasy and reality, elevates His House beyond the conventional haunted house movie.Not everything works though. The final act switches horror for a somewhat predictable twist, and while the closing frames make for a powerful set of metaphors, it feels slightly sketchy from a closure standpoint. The performances are good for a film that revolves mostly around two (or three, if you include the beast) characters - Dirisu and Mosaku showcasing credible, lived-in feats.",His House

The bus was full of people and they somehow managed to get on the bus and took a little girl with them and her mother was running after the bus screaming. The beast followed them to the U.K. because according to the folk tale the woman told they stole the child and that's why they're haunted. The girl drown while they're crossing the Mediterranean. They arrived to London and they settled their new house which is a very old and dirty but big according to the English standards. The ghosts were lurking behind the walls and drove them crazy. The beast said to the woman if he severs his flesh, she can get the girl back. They were questioned regarding their naturalization when the man in charge saw the walls destroyed. It was a very sketchy neighborhood and their neighbor with the kid was creepy. He finally cut his arm and the beast rose from the floor getting into his flesh to have a body for itself an the daughter appeared next to the woman while she was weeping to his moaning husband. Then she got into the kitchen and slit the throat of the beast. The officials visited the house again and saw them a lot more then before. They said she killed the With and no matter what you do, you bring your ghosts with yourself. I loved how they didn't exploit the racial issues present in the country and I liked how they showed the black teens being racist towards the black woman. Other than that the ghosts and beast were creepy and the setup was very gloomy but the only thing that I don't get they made a deal with the beast and she killed it and they got away with it.

42,tonypeacock-1,Excellent twist to the conventional 'B' horror genre,7,2 November 2020,"I was surprised at this new twist on the 'horror' genre that begins as more of a Ken Loach style social commentary than a conventional 'B' horror film.It follows the plight of a Sudanese couple, Bol and Rial Majur (Sope Dirisu and Wunmi Mosaku) who seek asylum in England following a perilous journey over land and sea that tragically results in the death of their daughter Nyagak at sea when they are thrown from their packed boat.After a successful asylum application with strict conditions attached they are housed in a southern England town in what can only be described as a squalid, unfurnished council house.The house can only be described as dangerously uninhabitable in terms of dodgy electrics, damp walls, exposed piping and a front door that literally comes of its hinges when the couple are introduced to the property by unsympathetic council housing inspector, Mark Essworth (Matt Smith in a cameo).As the film develops a typical haunted house scenario develops complete with strange noises, jump scares and holes appearing in the walls. The noise is caused by a witch/apeth and ghostly images of the horrors of the Sudanese couple's past.Excellent acting by the leads and steady direction by newcomer Remi Weekes keeps the tension at boiling point as a clever plot twist explains the witches presence.It is the plot twist and the psychological emotions of it that are released by Rial killing the apeth.A good, suspenseful new twist on the genre delivered in a compact running time.

They also state that this film is amazing, but it's not that either.The 'twist' can be seen after the first 10 minutes of the film, and the ending, while not being anything original, was still ok.There were also some cool scary shots and nice surrealistic imagery, but sometimes the CGI was taking me out of the film.In terms of storytelling, there's not that much to work with, the whole film can be summed up in 4-5 sentences. Our family duo is overcoming their fears, and...that's pretty much all. There's also Matt Smith in this, but he's just sort of there. And there also was a neighboring lady that had 2 sentences in the film.Besides some social commentary and lots of victimization attempts and wishful thinking, there's nothing more of note. Lines like ""They will send you back to die like the ****ards always do"" and some more bashing on Europeans, as well as further pushing of an idea that if there is a military conflict on your territory, then people all over the world owe you something.P.S.

All being in the vicinity of a horror themed depiction.From its very commencement, grabbing my attention through surreal sound designing & an innate subtlety in the Cinematography. Capturing war torn african hinterland to a civilized London suburb; the transition is assiduously managed.
Depicting social conscience through its persuasive narrative. Barring few flaws, it sailed smoothly enough. With the help of two stellar performances from our leads; their intent eventually became discernible. Setting up an emotional barrier around the premise; effectively foreshadowing other horror elements.Although there was room for improvements.
We barely see any cognitive explanations for the supernatural occurences that take place.
Nor any befitting insights into their pre habitat or the violent consequences they faced in the past.
Apart from our two main characters, others didn't really have much of a screentime to reinstate their presence.In conclusion, the film took an unconventional route as a Horror project; indulging itself into various socio-political affairs. At the same time delivering ominous undertone which in return helped to create an unsettling yet tempting ambience.",His House

48,garethcrook,Not as scary as the reality at its core.,5,27 March 2021,"A young Sudanese couple manage to escape from the war ravaging their country and make it to England, but lose something on the way that will follow them wherever they go. It's not exactly a warm welcome, but they're released from a detention centre to a nondescript dilapidated terrace, that wouldn't look out of place in Trainspotting. It's all theirs though, just Bol (Sope Dirisu) and Rial (Wunmi Mosaku) and Matt Smith who gives them the keys thinks ""You two are gonna be alright, as long you can get along, fit in"". To be honest you could make a much scarier film just documenting the refugee process. Instead though we have our new residents in a haunted house. The haunting is their own though, brought on by the trauma of their loss or if you want to play along, the spirits they've invoked. Their surroundings are suitably eerie to set the tone. With strange noises in the walls inside the house. Racial tension outside them, all with a heavy dose of jump scares as Bol and Rial find themselves tormented by supernatural visions. There's some fun stuff, scenes that do raise the pulse, but it does feel a bit slow with a thin plot that struggles to hold attention until the next slightly trope laden scary bits. It's a shame as both Mosaku and Dirisu are good. Believable as their collective psychosis takes hold. As we get further in though, there's a real sense that we've seen it all and it's a simple case that things will just get louder and jumpier until the couple pop. Even a little twist that leads us into the final act isn't enough. Ultimately the reality at the base here, is far more terrifying than the standard horror fare it builds upon it. I've not seen anything intercut these themes before though and for that I applaud.",His House
49,johannes2000-1,A very original and effective horror movie with a message.,9,2 January 2021,"In this surprising alternative for the usual horror movies, some of the well-known horror cliché's are refreshingly shifted: here not a suburban well-to-do family but two refugees from Sudan seeking asylum; and not a creepy old manor but a dull dime-a-dozen terrace-house in a third-rate neighborhood somewhere in the outskirts of London. This by no means make the goings-on less scary: the atmosphere is very sinister, the weird occurrences are creepy and there are plenty of jump-scares. In the last part of the movie there is a major plot-twist that sheds a totally different light on the unfortunate couple and on their escape from Sudan and the dramatic crossing to the UK.The couple is played convincingly by Some Dirisu and Wunmi Mosaku, Dirisu very touching in his bewilderment and guilt, Mosaku with stoic dignity. There is a small but important role for Matt Smith as their civil refugee coach, trying to combine following the official rules with a sense of empathy and humanity. There is also a message, it's not hammered-in, it just comes along with the context of refugees seeking asylum in the UK. But the matter-of-factness with which the proceedings and the attitude of the officials are pictured is all the more poignant.If any, my only reservations concern the climax in the end of the movie. For most part the makers let the occurrences balance between being of psychological or of supernatural origin. But then in the climax things all of a sudden take a very fierce, almost gothic turn, which spoiled it a bit for me, I think I would have preferred it to have stayed undetermined.Anyway: original, scary and well acted.",His House
50,ridi-arahan,Our shadows follow us everywhere,8,13 March 2021,"What worked:
Perhaps the most impressive aspects of the movie for me has to be the introduction of an African culture in the movie letting us, an international movie audience a chance to peek into some culture texture and ways of life. And for that matter, this movie worked a big time for me. It's soft, heartily and a replica of maybe a life style of an immigrant refugee staying in a foreign land. Of course that does not mean I saw an African culture and lifestyle, but it's one of those few movies that I had watched regarding the culture that doesn't follow the cliche interpretations or makes it obviously melodramatic. The screenplay is fine, well acted and directedWhat did not work:
Maybe somewhere in between, the movie lost the momentum and felt like the movie is not commanding any narrative. Although the movie eventually gets back in track, the middle part of the movie feels the weakest. Also, the movie did not strike with a convincing finale, leaving us rather confused and unsatisfied with the execution especially near the end of the movie

The acting was good from all involved and it built suspense really well also.What I didn't enjoy was that I thought it was a bit dull at times. Long dream sequences you knew full well were dreams and, because of this I felt slightly disengaged from the film.

52,ebeckstr-1,A Netflix hidden gem,8,7 December 2020,"Chock full of excellent acting, writing, and production design, My House is the most surprising Netflix production I've seen so far.It's surprising in part because the story is inventive and unusual, and almost defies classification. It is more or less billed as a horror movie. It would be more accurate to call it a drama horror, though. The horror is literal and visceral if you want to watch it that way; but, more interestingly, it is allegorical and even political. At its heart, this is a movie about the horrors faced by people forced to flee genocide, and the resultant trauma they carry with them through having to make impossible choices, including having to assimilate into another culture at the expense of one's own selfhood and culture.Don't get me wrong: this movie has some traditional and extremely creepy, scary moments, especially in the middle third.

54,sweidman-28016,A New Face in Horror,7,13 November 2020,"""Your ghosts follow you. They never leave. They live with you. It's when I let them in, I could start to face myself.""His House is about a refugee couple that make a harrowing escape from war-torn South Sudan, but then they struggle to adjust to their new life in an English town that has an evil lurking beneath the surface. As a horror piece, this had the elements to make an effective experience. Storytelling is where it stands out. The premise is based off of a story from their background. There's a long monologue that tells it all in a great way. What it also utilizes is the fact of passing down stories from culture and generation. Going back into our characters' past lives furthers the experience. It's less of a dramatic past but more of a horror story of war and loss. A scene that captures a war zone experience is one of the best action scenes out there. Between the agony and how the scene is filmed, I couldn't have wished for a better directed scene. I don't know the story behind writer/director Remi Weekes but this must be a personal story for him to tell. Above all this is a story of what refugees must face after their given sanctuary.Actors Sope Dirisu and Wunmi Mosaku really did well. They're a great duo together and the essence of their character are portray perfectly. You wonder if what they are seeing is real or just a product of PTSD. What I found most interesting is the complex they live in. It's a character itself. As it's torn apart slowly, it doesn't just look great but also is done with purpose. Another scene uses the deteriorating walls to transition into a war zone. Everything is all meaningful. That's what makes this movie good. Sometimes I wish it could be just a little better. This is a more personal note for me but I wasn't always the most interested in what was happening. I appreciated everything but the slow paced scenes didn't always keep my attention. But I really do think this is a good movie. Horror should really aspire to be as meaningful as His House. The relevance and personal drama betters the connection and creates a psychological horror like no other.",His House

56,david-meldrum,Chilling And Moving,9,8 May 2021,"A long time ago, in a city far, far away I worked in a London hostel for young people who found themselves homeless. Over time one of my responsibilities became the oversight of the house next door to the hostel in which were accommodated a smaller number of people who had arrived in the UK seeking asylum. All these years later I can still remember some things about some of the people I worked with there Yugoslavia with whom I often watched and talked about football or the news updates from his homeland. At one point we even accommodated a man who was an IRA informer - not an asylum seeker exactly, but we were to treat him as such when he was placed with us.When I spent time listening to and learning about these people what quickly became clear was something I knew at a subconscious level but had never really processed or given active thought to up to this point - that when you move countries, no matter how few tangible, physical possessions you bring with you, there are some less tangible things that you can't leave behind. It may be your own physical body, your culture, your beliefs and expectations, your memories and hopes, or many other things. All these come with you, whether you like it or not. This was reinforced for me when my wife and I emigrated by choice to South Africa; in doing so you realise how much more invisible baggage there must be when one flees as a refugee.This is the territory His House covers so well - a small-scale British horror movie about a couple escaping Southern Sudan for the UK, placed for the time being in a nameless house on a nameless housing estate. They come with little in their hands, but much else they haven't been able to shed, and it's those things that haunt them so compellingly over the 90 minutes or so of this film.The film stands on two brilliant central performances from the actors playing the couple at the film's heart - at least one of whom is on screen for the whole of the running time. But it's also much more than the performances - it's the clever use of a wide range of ideas and tropes such as the haunted house story, the home invasion movie, gothic fiction, or even at one startling point the Narnia Chronicles. These tropes are both embraced and subverted often to subtly powerful effect; and it's the wordless moments that are often the most powerful - sound design or slow camera pans bring us some of film's most memorable and effective moments.On the face of it the film's ending may seem cloying and naive, but the reality is that it gives us a more profound truth than we may been prepared for; that in order to truly make a home for ourselves in a new context we must look squarely in the face of all the unseen things we carry with us, accept them, grieve them as appropriate and place them in their proper setting. Then we move on; not without those things, but with those things giving light and shade to all that we are in the new places in which we find ourselves. As such this is not only a powerful, chilling, and moving film about the refugee experience, but one about experiences we all go through at different life stages.",His House

Because the real time effects, and makeup are really super this time around. And it was a long time ago a ghost movie almost dropped every cgi and made it oldschool. But the hokus pokus flashback story, a couple that can't communicate at all. Really destroys the scary scenes and only gets irritating.
If the ghosts where a part of the house it would be thousand times scarier then having this sobbing daughter/ not daughter, demon witch that kills thiefs but only surface in a house in england and can die but not die?? Its just ridiculus.
his house undermines itself all to often with a convoluted mess of a story when it could have been the best ghost movie since the others.",His House

One of the few mystery movies where the backstory aka the twist, makes sense. The refugee couple who kidnapped a child (unfortunately drowns on its way) to get passage to Europe pursued by a dark entity. Maybe it's about Justice or faith. Either way a good, in parts atmospheric watch, rooted in and reflected on current global society issues. The generic formula: dark house (this time not the usual Manor in the middle of nowhere) a couple moves in (this time refugees not the successful author) a troubled past (this time a lost child and Culture) plus, a dark entity (this time African witch craft) it's not groundbreaking as outlined by others but that's personal taste I guess and should not stop watching his house!",His House

63,eagandersongil,Social fear,8,20 December 2020,"""What is left behind"" is a horror film with a great construction and development of characters and plot, we have a contained horror that permeates the work that goes beyond the supernatural, we have a social horror that works very well during the work, even if this aspect is explored in a light and often subjective way.The script, which tells the story of a refugee couple who flees to England, and in his new life needs to deal with prejudice, with social phobia and with the pain and regret of having lost a child in the crossing, the film is full of small mishaps and details that complement his work, such as the exploration of the culture of Sudan and the religiosity that mixes the psyche of traumas of the couple.The direction of Remi Weeks is very good, the director knows how to build tension very well, without resorting to sound effects or cheap scares, here the fear is real, it is built and grows throughout the work, the film also has a beautiful photograph, which contrasts well the gray of england with a yellowish palette of sudan.The performances, both by Wummi Mosaku and Sope Dirisu are great, both deliver characters full of quirks and with many dimensions, some explored and others are more on the surface, it is also worth mentioning the house where almost the entire film unfolds, we have a great scene composition and an aversion climate very well given the residence.""What was left behind"" is not a perfect film, we have a rhythm problem that bothers the viewer and we also have a third act very triggered by the rest of the work, but overall we have a great film.

Director: Remi Weekes
Starring: Sope Dirisu, Wunmi Mosaku, Matt Smith etcOverall rating 100/100His house is based upon two refugees who have fled their country, in search for a better life for themselves, but when they are placed in a rough housing estate fitting in proves to be more difficult for them as an evil is lurking in their house that will torment them forever. Wow what an amazing, creative, impactful and genuinely terrifying movie His house was, let's get started.First of all the movies cinematography, tense and uncomfortable tone and Jumpscares were excellent. This movies visual creativity was incredible, there was some shots and use of lighting, and camera trickery that I had never seen before and the movie blew me away, the visuals despite having one key element to them were always changing and getting more and more interesting as the movie developed. The movie also had an incredibly uncomfortable tone throughout, as the main characters mental health declined slowly and slowly more as the movie developed so did the increasingly uncomfortable tone and the characters became more and more unpredictable you never knew what was going to happen, which made it very uncomfortable due to the increased stakes and power that the witch was getting over the characters, the movie built up tension and had amazing Jumpscares, the movie did an absolutely incredible job at building the movies tension, it did an excellent job at extending the scenes and building the tension making the audience not know when a jumpscare was going to happen made me on the edge of my seat throughout, the creativity when it came to the Jumpscares was also excellent, it was completely different every time and the director somehow made one house be capable of way more scariness and Jumpscares than it should of done, I was simply amazed at how well they did with the Jumpscares which got even more scary as the movie went on.My next few positives would be the representation, unique character perspective and themes making the concept of the movie really interesting, as well as the character background and depth. I thought the movies representation was fantastic, to have a largely black cast was excellent and considering the themes of refugees and escaping your country it was really interesting to see the different cultures displayed within the film, and having the characters escaping their country due to having no other choice due to gangs was so interesting and unique for me, and they cleverly linked these themes with not being able to let go, these were both balanced and tackled really well and were cleverly intertwined throughout. I also really appreciated the character background added, spreading out what life was like for the main characters across the whole movie really helped with understanding what they were going through, there was also so much character depth, both main characters were fighting over not letting go of their country and troubled past with their daughter but also having to fit in a country that shuns them or where they don't feel welcomed so this was powerfully done and added multiple layers to the characters involved.My final few positives would be the performances, script, equal amount of time spent on both characters, plot twists and amazing ending. The performances from both Sope Dirisu and Wunmi Musaku were truly incredible, they showed such depth and nuance to their performances, they managed to make their characters so believable and real it was incredible to watch, their performances and subtle facial expressions were also terrifying and contributed towards how scary the movie was. The script was also very powerful, the social commentary the movie conveyed about a lot of the populations views on refugees and even black people was powerful and would be really impactful for a lot of people and it still was for me, and the script and dialogue in general was masterfully constructed and put together. The movie also did a good job at spending an equal amount of time on both main characters, the movie did an excellent job at balancing both of the characters out, I understood and connected with both characters an equal amount, and the movie spent a lot of time developing both and it was never one way or the other. And finally the movies plot twists and final act was just fantastic, I genuinely didn't see the plot twists coming and they really changed how I saw the movie and its characters but in a good way, it really concluded both their character arcs excellently and very cleverly and ended the movie on a high.Overall His house is a creative, unique, powerful and terrifying movie that is an incredible debut feature for Remi Weekes, who judging by this movie has a bright future ahead of him.",His House

The only downside is that the ending throws the symbolism overboard, when the filmmakers chose to make the demon real instead of symbolic.

69,harrylosborne,Horror beneath the horror,7,27 April 2021,"Soaked in a reddish-orange colour palette, this horror story of two refugees trying to settle in a British council estate is bleak, bitter and brutal.Powered by the leading duo of Sope Dirisu and Wunmi Mosaku, their battle to control both their sanity and their freedom is tough watching, particularly when compounded by the threat of their own haunted house.Their motives to cross the sea from South Sudan to Europe are clear, sacrificing more than everything to avoid a civil war. However, the immediate problems of acclimatising to an alien nation are all too obvious, putting the couple between a rock and a hard place.The film develops into a psychological horror as much as one reliant on jump scares, broken up by the harsher realities of England, and the dryly appropriate social housing worker, played by Matt Smith.The set design is immaculate, using the full extent of the house (and artistic license where appropriate) to build a brilliantly atmospheric setting.This is a tragic watch no doubt, but not your conventional horror film - by playing classic scare tropes against the sombre background story, ""His House"" is a poetic and underrated tale of loss.",His House

The question of the supernatural can be interpreted in several ways, and this is a good thing.The migration issue is present since the beginning until the very end, but I do not believe that it is another film about this problem, but rather a story about people, their fears, their beliefs and their survival instinct.All actions have consequences, and bad ones have their ghosts always present.",His House

Hardly ten minutes into the movie and you feel a sense of dread, the creepiness factor at a hundred, but the storytelling doesn't falter. With a nonlinear unfolding of events, expect some twists and turns and a heart-wrenching exhibition of grief, struggles, emotional dilemmas, and of course fear. All of this praise aside, the movie has moments of slowness that seem to never end, but fortunately only come 2min at a time, and can be overlooked to appreciate the big picture.

74,kjjames81,A solid watch.,5,15 November 2020,"Been thinking about watching this film since it came on Netflix and last night against my better judgement I did and really enjoyed the movie.
First off as a horror film it is a slow burn but makes very good use of it for the most part. The acting was top notch. The story was okay and not to political which you think it's going to be but thankfully it didn't stay on that subject to much which I personally think would have spoilt the film.
Some of the genuine horror scenes didn't work for me as I found that when there was one person scaring the main character it worked really well but when there were many scary characters it didn't work and the tension went out of the movie.
Does it deserve the 8, 9 & 10 star scores no it doesn't. Having those kinds of scores means is is flawless and it wasn't. A solid five or six star review is teal.
Some people are wanting this film to represent something it's not and that is why they have given a false rating.

""His House"" weaves these shifts expertly.

At first I wasn't sure wether the haunting was connected to the people or the house.This is a dark tale that forces us to confront some uncomfortable truths. It's a very clever piece of writing that's beautifully acted and utter terrifying at the same time.It's a story that stuck in my mind for several days after I watched it, be aware, you are not in for an easy ride.

77,MovieBuff11732,A New Horror Film That Was Actually Good!,9,13 November 2020,"I bet you might not know what this film is but it is the breakout film from Remi Weekes and it is a pretty good breakout film.His House is about two black refuges named Bole (Sope Dirisu) and Rial (Wunmi Mosaku) get released from a war in South Sudan. They end up in a house that has a evil presence waiting for them.His House was a film that completely surprised me. I had no idea that this film was coming out but it was definitely worth my time. It is a film that is a little hard to find now. Must films are just gory and forget about the scary part of the film. This film remembered to be scary. I am not saying that films should never have any bit of blood in them but I am just saying, if you make a horror film, make it scary. This film did just that. The story was the key aspect of this film as is most. Th background that they created for the characters really helped you feel for the characters. They also did this thing were you didn't always know if the the scene that they were showing you was a dream or if it was real. That really helped make the film pretty freaky. That was also the films disadvantage. The end of the film had way too many of those scenes and it messed with your brain the way it shouldn't. It was confusing at the end not knowing if it was really happening. That was the only flaw of His House. Otherwise the story was wonderfully crafted.The acting was the best of the year. The two main characters were executed marvelously. Sope Dirisu hasn't been in anything else I have seen but he gave a fantastic performance in this film. Wunmi Mosaku has been in some big films like Batman Vs. Superman and Fantastic Beasts. She didn't really have much to do in those films but she was in them. She sort of gave a little bit of a creepy performance. Both of the leads did fantastic jobs. Matt Smith was also in this film as as a guy who was checking on them every week or so to see how they were doing in the new house. He didn't have much to do and did good when he was on screen. Overall, the acting was pretty good.This film used practical effects a lot. It was a genius idea that worked to the films advantage. It looked 100 percent better than just putting glossy computer generated images in there. Some of the practical effects reminded me of the Pans Labyrinth. Especially at the end.I would really love to see more films like His House in the next couple of years. The only problem with the film is a little bit of a shaky ending. Besides that I would recommend this film to any movie fan.",His House

81,el7,There's a twist.,7,31 October 2020,"His House is a beautifully acted movie about a Sudanese refugee couple who are moved into a rundown house in England. The house turns out to be haunted, and there are a number of questions left up to the viewer to decide by the end. The movie does a neat trick of making it clear exactly why the couple can't just leave this house once the haunting starts. They have strict rules in place to maintain their asylum status, and one of those rules is they don't leave that house before they're told that they can. There's conflict between the husband and wife, as he is eager to assimilate while she wants to hold onto their culture. The ominous mood is set up early, as the house they are given is large enough for two families but they are being given it to themselves and the rehousing agent (Matt Smith) acts shifty about it and won't explain why they have this house to themselves. The house has been used as a trash dumping ground by the neighborhood kids, so it has fallen into an abandoned state and they wind up having to fix up parts of it just to have livable conditions. There are holes in the walls from which come whispering sounds. And from the very first night, there are jump scares and WTF moments, and some pretty good ones too. The wife, Rial, becomes convinced that a ghost from their past has followed them to England. The husband, Bol, doesn't want to hear it at first. They have a big secret between them, a major source of guilt. Whatever is in their house is feeding on it. The thing is, if the ghost followed them there, why do other people who have lived in the neighborhood longer treat their house like it's haunted? The movie hints that there might be something much older occupying that space but never explains it fully. However, the movie does manage to come to a mostly satisfying resolution.",His House

At one point, I didn't know who the bad guy was because this wasn't an intentional mistake. But I wish the end could have been better handled.

93,BeanieCore,Simply should've been more.,6,10 February 2021,"The refugee experience is a fresh topic for a horror film to tackle. One that's rich with socio-political subtext to be used, and a strong emotional undercurrent to balance the genre elements. Sadly, that's not the route this film decided to take, and the one which it does take is far less interesting. Rather than focus on the immense pressure and discrimination that refugees face in the UK, director Raimi Meeks used those themes as a backdrop to tell a rather simple, cliched ghost story. Perhaps it's my own fault for expecting something different, but when a film such as this decides to focus on a more original topic, I expect more than jump-scares and morality plays that horror fans have seen 1,000 times before. That's not to say the film is bad. Far from it, in fact. The direction is fluid and the acting is quite good. Wummi Mosaku is especially good as the leading man, and displays a solid range.The scares are mostly visual, and those visuals are in fact, quite effective. But almost every scare is accompanied by a loud audio cue that turns each quieter moment into a predictable jump. I'd be lying if I said some of them weren't effective, but ""loud noise, something jumps"" is the only trick the film seems to have up it's sleeve. Meanwhile, as mentioned previously, the plot turns out to be nothing more than a morality play we've seen time and time again, simply told through a different cultural lens. The characters simply are not engaging or developed enough for us to connect that much with the emotional aspects of the ending. And the film always becomes more engaging when dealing with the difficulties the couple experience in assimilating to British culture. So, while what we're left with is a highly unoriginal story, it's one that's filmed and produced adequately enough to be a decent supernatural horror flick, nothing more. The shame is that this could've been something more, something much more timely and meaningful.",His House
94,mbhgkmsgg,His House,6,17 November 2020,"His House starts great and it also ends strongly. However, that beginning and that ending feel like they are from two different movies. It's quite unfortunate that it made me feel that way because I do think that there is a lot of things that this movie gets right.Let's start with the first half of the movie. What I would consider the horror half. This film began very quickly and left very little time for the viewer to get situated. The first 45 minutes were indeed very scary, and I was drawn to the screen. But what made that first half so great, was that it didn't just rely on the usual horror tropes.
His House explored themes of racism and all the other challenges that refugees face. These issues were explored in a way that caused tension even outside of the house that works as the centrepiece of the story. Another aspect that created its own horror was distrust and challenges of marriage. This film managed to create an atmosphere of constant terror and tension, and I, for one, really liked it.The second half, however, moves into a completely different direction. What started as a pure horror film, shifts more and more into a drama as the run time moves towards its end. The horror changes from the typical haunted house style more into creature horror. That's also where the movie stopped being scary for me. I have never found creature horror to be particularly scary and this film didn't change that. I do realize that that is a personal problem, and most people will probably find the second half to be nearly as scary as the first one.
But it's not just the normal horror stuff that changes. The two aforementioned aspects of immigration and marriage are almost completely forgotten about. And it is quite unfortunate that this is the case. I felt that they added so much to this movie and made it more than just another haunted house film.With that being said, I did like the second half nearly as much as I liked the first one. His House end up becoming a rather touching drama by the time it finishes. And if it forgot about the challenges of immigration and marriage, it replaced it with the conundrum of whether to leave ones home country in the first place. Although a new home promises a better life, is that always going to be the reality?There is a lot to like about His House. I think that it fantastically approached horror by making it about more than just jump scares and a scary atmosphere. I also liked that it was a haunted house film that didn't take place in an abandoned mansion. And, I also liked the second half with everything it had to offer. The thing that lessened my excitement was the fact that I felt like I ended up watching two different films.

98,RMurray847,Like nothing I've seen before,7,16 March 2021,"HIS HOUSE is certainly a horror story, with weird, supernatural goings-on and more than one or two effective jump scares. Taken as just a horror story, though, it is fairly ordinary. The setting is unusual, but ""a couple moves into a new dwelling only to find 'something' is already there and isn't happy to share the space"" is hardly the stuff to get a horror fan excited.HOWEVER, take a look at the broader picture. A couple, who have fled civil war-torn Sudan via a harrowing journey that comes with a great loss, are now refugees in England, and have a tiny chance to win asylum. In the meantime, they must live in a rundown slum apartment and behave themselves while the government gets it all sorted out. This couple doesn't really have the option to move out when the weird things start happening. They have a choice between tolerating their shabby and scary living conditions, or going back to Sudan to the daily fear of being gunned down in the street.This makes HIS HOUSE much more interesting. The stakes seem much higher than in a typical ""family in danger"" horror film. But, I would argue, what really makes it interesting is the reaction of the couple to the supernatural. They come from a culture where witchcraft and other elements of the supernatural are part of life. Maybe not part of daily life, but they are accepted and to some extent, believed. So the couple quickly pivot to trying to figure out WHY they're being haunted, and not IF. They accept it, and react to it from that perspective.Yet, for me, the best parts of this movie were the flashbacks to Sudan and the journey to escape. (I wanted to say ""journey to freedom"", but that isn't really what they encounter.) We learn about them, and we learn a very key secret that could be the answer to their haunting. I won't say more, except to say that this secret elevates the film from interesting setting but generic plot to something much more resonant. And the ending, while perhaps abruptly presented, is a nearly perfect conclusion to their story. Sope Dirisu and Wunmi Mosaku are the two stars, and they are excellent. They are a couple made close by their shared experience, but their reactions to what happened on their journey and what's happening to their house show the divides between them, and make their ""happy"" marriage seem much more complex. The film also excels in showing us just how alone they are in their new country. When Mosaku gets lost in her neighborhood, she asks some black teenage boys for directions, thinking she might receive a friendly reception. When they laugh at her, give her wrong directions and then derisively tell her to ""go back to Africa"", it's a shocking moment that has nothing to do with the supernatural. These ""real"" moments are what elevates the film.I wish the movie had taken a bit more time. Because it's chiefly a horror film, I think director/write Remi Weekes (in a great debut) tried to keep things moving along briskly. They do, but there are moments in this film crying out for more time. The ""secret"" that is revealed is shown hastily (probably in part because budget limitations might have made giving us more detail challenging). And the ending, as apt as it is, could have been presented in a way to linger more in our memories.It's still a pretty amazing little film. I likely won't go back to it, but I'm certainly glad I DID spend time with it.",His House
99,madanmarwah,Rehabilitated but the house is spooky,6,15 July 2021,"The first 20 minutes were interesting as we saw that a refugee couple are forced to leave Sudan due to war linked disturbances and land up in London, UK with great difficulty. They seek and get asylum and are given a house to stay which is in bad shape. As advised they try to adapt to the local culture .The film however has a paranormal and horror link as their house seems haunted and this causes them and the audience great stress.The film is slow and boring. The scaring scenes are creepy no doubt and will please lovers of horror films. The couple have a troubled past where they had lost their daughter and the incident keeps haunting them in their new abode. This is shown through reasonably effective special effects. If you like slow, sad, distressful films with creepy scenes of horror then this is the film for you ,otherwise stay away.I have always maintained that if the director is not able to keep the audience glued to the screen, then he has failed to do a good job. This film is a case in point. The only good point of the film however is the superb acting of Wumni Mosaku who is able to successfully show her pain and misery at the developments.

The plot is something very different from other horror movies and actually delves into some serious real life issues and adapts them into a great little horror movie! The acting is fantastic and the two leads characters really put their all into this movie and their roles. The emotional scenes really hit different and that's all down to the great performances. They're pretty much the only two characters in this and most of the film is set in the same house with only a few bits in other areas and I think it's done really well and the movie never feels bogged down by being in the same place for too long. The scares were inventive and never predictable, the effects were pretty good and consistent and the designs of the characters were really good aswell.

After being housed, being moved to their home through the night, like cattle, they begin to try and integrate into their new world. Unfortunately ghosts of the past have travelled with them and begin to destroy any hope they had of a new life.I found this to be engaging from the very beginning, the cast are wonderful and the story is intriguing and unpredictable. The raw portrayal of what Sudan refugees flee from is pure horror and how this is shown in contrast with the UK and the treatment they receive in the UK, as if they are criminals themselves, is pretty eye-opening to say the least.The husband does something desperate to get themselves on the transport to come to the UK and this act of desperation haunts the couple in their home.Great performances here and an original, fresh story which held my interest through to the end.",His House

That doesn't mean it is bad necessarily but can impact a viewer's expectations and experience. There were some really refreshing qualities in this film like the setting and artistic transitions between reality, dreams, and memories, however the pacing was lacking and made it feel longer than it was because of unnecessary or simply slower parts in the middle.

I did not find this film to be a politically motivated film, however, it does pull from that streamline with refugees being the focal point. I felt the story to be absolutely compelling. The undertone for me showed that adjusting to a new place, a new land can be difficult, and strenuous. This film pulls from that and then adds a cultural lore that adds to the intensity. The evil of ""His House"" is slowly pieced together with shadows, whispers, and patience. Eventually everything is brought to a front that comes to a death-defying end, but eventually brings about it, some peace as well.The two leads were strong together and in their own ways. They brought the intensity and calmness of each situation to a story, as I said above, was already strong.Lastly, the cinematography was spot on. Everything was fluid, from steady camerawork to near perfect effects, this film was fun to watch.Overall:
If you haven't had the chance to watch this film. I would definitely recommend it. Especially if you enjoy thriller films that offer a hearty meal instead of cheapness to just get a scare.Enjoy the show!",His House

Its a different story to a degree but a surreal haunted house story is what it really is. Several jumpscare moments are mildly scary but although the atmosphere is fairly well done it doesn't quite lure you into the creepy mode of dread that is essential in good horrors.
Some may find some of the scare moments mildly silly in other words you are seeing too much which takes away the supernatural scare factor and shift it towards a zombie flick.

Especially for Africans, Asians and Latin Americans. Difficulty of decent housing, ill will, scarce resources, impossibility of social interaction, adaptation, prohibitions of all kinds are ghosts that make the dream of immigration almost a nightmare.And at the very end there is a scene that delivers this reading easily.

The plot was obvious (to me) and the mistrust of the newcomers by the locals as expected if you read or watch the media. The last twenty minutes makes up for I thought as it explains visually what a crap life some people (maybe most ) have.

Refugees are housed in very good accommodation and in very good areas . They are usually housed in privately owned houses that are rented to the councils. These houses and apartments have to meet a high standard of accommodation , which must be maintained by the owner of the property .The acting was very good in this movie .

124,captainpass,Inbetween Days in the Council Flats,9,23 August 2021,"Where is home? There is a point in the movie where ""Rial"" (Wunmi Mosaku) relates to a medical tech that, in her former home community, two tribes were always at war, killing each other. For reasons only hinted at, she bears the ritual beauty marks of both tribes on her body. As a result, she found a home in neither tribe. She was a woman who lived in-between both worlds.This ""in-betweenness"" is one of the main themes in the film: Rial and her partner ""Bol"" (Some Dirisu) have fled North Africa. Once in England, they are granted ""probation,"" which means they are given a residence in one of London's council flats and must adhere to strict rules. The flat is barely inhabitable - a yellowed box of peeling wallpaper, bad fixtures and worn furniture.Bol, thankful for the second chance, decides they will ""look forward,"" and do everything they can to fit into their new environment, including embracing British pub culture and eating with utensils. Rial, on the other hand, cannot help but look back at what they have lost, including an immediate family member lost on the trip to England. And it is the antipathy of local English-born black folk to Rial (""Go back to Africa"") that convince her there is no ""forward"" to be found.As a result, when both Bol and Rial begin to hear, see and experience the intrusions of nightmarish beings in their flat, it is Rial who is quick to link the intrusions to an unpaid ""debt"" back in Sudan and the presence of a Sudanese night witch who has followed them to England. They must return, she states.Bol is having none of it. This is ""my house,"" he yells at one point. He declares he will drive out the intruders. Yet to do so, he resorts to tearing off wall paper and banging holes in the walls. (There is one wonderful moment where Rial undermines Bol by revealing to bewildered white social workers why, exactly, Bol has made the holes.)This is a very rare gem in an overused genre. The haunted house horror film has tended to be an overwhelmingly ""white"" cinematic genre: young (generally) couples acquiring a property to sort out troubles, begin a fresh start, have (or restart) a family etc. Here, that familiar premise has been used to a different end: to show the ways in which the spirits of an Old World have come to infect the New - for a refugee couple. The beauty of the movie is that it does not condescend to any of its characters: yes, the well-intentioned white folk are often clueless and smug. But the monotonous world of the council flats envelop all who live and work there: black and white. And Rial and Bol also betray their own prejudices and foibles at many points. This a world of complex characters and motivations. No-one is fully a victim, a hero, a monster. That is fitting, given the serious and important nature of the subject matter.

The house seems haunted at first, but maybe it's the ghosts of those they've lost back home and maybe a demon has followed them?

African asylum seekers in Britain get housed in a haunted social housing property. The leads are just brilliant and utterly convincing as a married couple who have literally been to hell and back. Remi Weekes, the director, has a very sure hand with horror and breathes some fresh life into the haunted house/demonic posession/witchcraft genre. A very small cast, a disconcerting and claustrophobic atmosphere and winning leads make an original and fresh movie. It starts very creepily and builds the tension throughout although the end was a little heavy on the virtue signalling.",His House
138,believeinflight,Movie is wonderfully written,10,1 November 2020,It's probably an 8.7 for me. But the idiots reviewing it are giving it low ratings so I'm definitely going with a 10. The writing is superb. The metaphors and the meanings behind every little detail put into it make it amazing if you are smart enough to make the connections. This movie DOES NOT bash you over the head with anything and it is NOT pandering. Very good and very scary.

The director tells the story of the dark side of the human mind using the horrors of war. Although it is in the 'Haunted House' genre, but it has many exceptions and unique features.In this movie, the pain of losing or the painful memory is captured in the form of a ghost. Even those ghosts have their own pain. These ghosts are not gaseous; Ghosts made of flesh and blood.The movie has an extreme reflection of the coping mechanism. I like Unmi's performance. Although a haunted house, a new visualization was found through this movie. The cinematography is great. Some of the scenes are eye-catching. In a word, a strangely beautiful horror movie. Horror and Dark lovers are a must-see.",His House

148,Yvie81,"Not what I expected, but still compelling!",7,7 March 2021,"This wasn't what I expected, but it was good nevertheless. This was more about the inner horrors that refugees have to deal with once they are in that 'safe place' they fled to, than a traditional haunted house movie. It wasn't really scary in terms of horror elements and jumpscares (at least not to me), but it is compelling in different ways. I worked with refugees during my internship when I studied social work. I recognised some of these procedures all too well. Except in my country people usually get a caseworker from the foundation I did my internship at, to help them start up and to make sure they get the proper help they need. In my country only the 'severe cases' get assigned to a house when they are still in the procedure of going from asylumseeker to the status of refugee. The others have to wait during this procedure in an asylum center. I worked with a few of such families, but all of them were in psychological therapy. I once met a couple from Azerbaijan, the woman was so traumatised she was totally drugged up with medication. She looked like a zombie, no life in her eyes. I read their story and I still cannot believe this actually happened. Some of these stories will probably stay with me forever.. At the same time I also recognise from this movie how desperate most of them are willing to move on and start a new life even though they are haunted by their past.",His House
149,bazzer-57663,Sombre - with a killer twist,9,12 November 2020,"It starts exactly how we expect. Wretched refugees fleeing war and death in Sudan. Tragedy on the long journey to England. The hostile, uncaring asylum system. Miserable accomodation among bigoted locals. A friendly official (Matt Smith), his hands tied by red tape, but trying not to be a jobsworth.So far so seen it all before. Worthy. A tale that must be told. But original? Not a bit.And then the haunting begins: a malevolent entity, a Night Witch from Africa with a point to make. But what is that point?The shocking twist (which we do not see coming) reveals all. We see our downtrodden refugees in an entirely different (and very unflattering) light.
From here on it becomes a morality tale about monstrous guilt, about acceptance of deeds which cannot be undone, and about redemption and rebuilding.Is the Night Witch supernatural or allegorical? In the end it doesn't really matter in this sombre tale which ultimately is about facing the ghosts of the past and learning to live with them.",His House
150,Gorillaboi,Credit for its originality & unpredictability,7,1 November 2020,"This movie could have gone from good, to very good if it wasn't for one thing (which I'll touch up on, without spoilers, in the final paragraph)What I liked about the film were the following things:quite unique in the message it tells within the horror genreActing was fantastic - especially the ladyWasn't predictable at all. The plot device that this movie centres on, was beautifully executed.Some of the cinematography and props was good for a low budget movie. The practical affects gave it an aura of authenticity.Paced very well. Starts of slow and suspenseful, but it picks up at the right time(s) and coincides well with its story tellingDoesn't attempt to over complicate itself. It's a relative straightforward horror movie that excels in its simplicity.Despite all of the above, I did have one big criticism. And this was a decision the writers made in the dying moments of the movie. It could have opted for a more daring choice that would have suited the theme of this movie. One that would have raised the stakes. But instead, I felt it copped out and went for a something safe which, in my opinion, erased the good work it does with some of its reveals.But nonetheless, it's worthy of a watch. So give it a try, and appreciate it for its attempts to be original and not cliched.",His House

It would be awesome if they put the lead actor in the role as the New Black Panther if they don't go with Michael B Jordan's Killmonger taking up the mantle. Sope Dirisu has the voice and billed for it as well as the acting chops! I hope he goes big places after this as well as the leading female actress, Wunmi Mosaku.

It tells the story of two asylum seekers and the struggles they face to settle in a new country BUT something has come along with them!!

I really cared for these characters and what happened to them, their story.

But I was wrong, and I am so glad I was.Another reviewer said that this is ""woke"" and a commentary on immigration, it isn't, not at all. This is not a film about race or the differences in race or the difficulties of adjusting to living in a new country, it's not trying to say anything about the immigration system it's just telling a story that happens to involve new immigrants to a country, saying this is a commentary on immigration is like saying Jaws is a commentary on water safety or Die Hard 2 is a commentary on airport security.This film is a supernatural horror about the desperate things that people will do to survive and the consequences of those actions, and it's one of the most entertaining horrors I've seen for a while with some genuinely unsettling scenes, I can only hope people don't dismiss it because of a few ignorant reviewers who see imaginary agendas whenever there are black characters leading a film.8/10",His House

The movie expresses some of their tragedies and inner conflict in a pseudo-horror plotActing is excellent, story is nice, but there are some major issues. The movie sets a tone in the first quarter that it fails to pace. It introduces a few jump scares with some attempts to create a gloomy atmosphere. But instead of investing the initial tension to build up more and more towards the climax, it slows down depleting all of that into killer boredom!Another major drawback is that it seems like the director was trying to create a Stephen King'ish style movie just for the sake of it! He introduces some scenes and elements with total disregard to serving the actual story arc, such as the labyrinthish neighborhood and the old neighbor ladyAlso, the horror elements in the second half are too silly to a turning off extent, unlike the first half which seem like it came from another movie as one reviewer saidThat being said, I like how it ended. My overall impression is that it's a nice yet very flawed drama movie, with a few moments of horror.

178,HERMANO_MANSON_DIXIT,Smart terror,7,8 November 2020,"Already in the trailer she looked sinister and did not disappoint. Full of terror, on the one hand the story of a haunted house or rather ghosts, since that concept is used of saying that ghosts do not inhabit the house but that they inhabit us, on the other the drama of the refugees, which is also horror.
A Sudanese couple escapes from the war in their country and lose their daughter in the process of fleeing to England, after a time ""detained"" they are transferred to a dilapidated but spacious house where they can rebuild their lives. It will not take long to realize that they are haunted by terrifying presences, a masked child brandishing a knife and a witch (according to the cast but in the translation he is named as a witch) who asks for a blood sacrifice to bring back to the life to the minor.
Terribly gloomy, it appeals to the atmospheric heaviness and the social and family drama that adds to the share of terror, plus successful moments that make the hairs on the back of the neck stand up (be it the cliché of the genre or what refers to the tragedy of the refugees).
Compact, original and as ominous as it is simple, they have in the performances of the Nigerian Wunmi Mosaku (Fantastic Beasts, Batmans vs Superman, Luther) and the British Sope Dirisu (The Hunter and the Ice Queen, Humans) one of the high points of the film. Also appears Matt Smith (Dr Who, Charlie says) and when not playing amorphous bicharraco the Spanish Javier Botet (It, Mara, Polaroid, Slender Man, Insidius 4, The mummy, Alien Covenant).

One of the best movies I've ever seen, period. Survivors' guilt and trauma meshing with ancient hoodoo and black magic. The paranoia, the effects, the ending, the beauty, the bad ass black women, and the twists, oh my! Includes spoilers:
-
His House (2020) Pros: From the first scene I was hooked and interested to see what was about to happen. I loved how at the beginning you can see the two main character, Rial and Bol, find comfort in each other. The way they looked at each other and lighthearted jokes. And my oh my is Wunmi Mosaku a fine ass piece of Heaven. ""You think I can be afraid of ghosts?"" The scene where Bol is at the kitchen table and the sea is around him, shook. And the slow creeping of introducing the presence in the house is unsettling and well done. That first scare got me both times I watched this, shorty laying in the floor behind him. And both of them slowly going mad and ripping up the house was bananas. & Them twists!! Who saw that coming? Not I said the cat. Not me either, it made it even more heartbreaking and powerful. When the evil being finally presents itself in the real world the design was so creepy looking, and when shorty slit its throat I was so surprised and happy that this film gave me all of the things I love about horror movies.-
If I have to label a con, I can think of at least 5 other titles which would better fit the film's tone and magic. Never Promised Land, Price of Freedom, When The Dark Speaks, even Our Home/House something like that. When I tell people to watch His House and describe the plot the title is just not specific or accurate enough.-
I rate this a 10/10, it has rewatch value even with the twists and turns. I watched it first when it came out last year and watched it today remembering the main plot but excited to see the steps we took to get there and was still surprised by each scare.",His House

The haunting in this instance being symbolic for survivors guilt and ptsd suffered. Living in the UK where the media and the conservatives devote a lot of time and energy to denigrating & dehumanising these people, it's Refreshing to see a film really humanise them and give them a voice.

This is in fact a heart breaking, well played, meaningful drama that reaches deep and make you empathize with the main characters. Solid performances from Wunmi Mosaku and Sope Dirisu. Great cinematography. The movie succeeds in not being a documentary like/plead for the refugees in general.

So I quickly skimmed some user ratings and review score on Rotten Tomatoes while carefully not reading anything about it. I knew it was about refugees. In England. And there was a ghost. That's it.Like Babadook and Get Out this is about something else other than a creepy thing out to get you. It's their demons and how their demons are revealed. And how their trauma is revealed.Puzzling Things:
Why was the husband always alone in the room? Why was the wife always alone? Why would they never ONCE see the ghost at the same time?Loved:
The disorientation feeling of a new unfamiliar land.Loved the production design, acting, directing, most of the screenplay and the cinematography.Loved the torment this couple is dealing with and how it's handled.Felt their fear of going back. (It would have helped to establish the horrors where they came from earlier. That wasn't clear enough until much later in the film)
Loved the Black kids treating the wife as the other. Why? Because sometimes new immigrants are treated poorly by old immigrants as an unconscious way to distance themselves.Felt their fear. Felt they were trapped. How could you possibly complain to anyone about anything? Where would they go? The thing with most ""ghost, demon, in the house movies"" is they never answer the question: ""WHY DON'T YOU JUST GET OUT OF THE FREAKING HOUSE?"" Here they do. They literally have nowhere else to go. There is nothing they can do. AND finally it makes sense why they would stay.I'm really beginning to love horror that is about something else other than the horror of whatever the thing or creature is. There are worse horrors and worse traumas.It's about deep guilt, shame, and regret and it eats away at their souls.I'm going to be watching this director. Who knows. Kudos.",His House

201,some-like-it-hot,English? Really?,3,10 November 2020,"One thing that I was instantly annoyed by, or rather surprised, is the fact the two characters speak perfect English. Even when the female character asks for directions while mispronouncing words, she speaks perfect English the entire film.The stero typical racial differences are also very distracting from the political message they want to send (more on that later). It seems that they desperately wanted our sympathy, but didn't want to put in the work to build up their character.The political message they try to convey is simply unclear and very poorly visualized. They move from one time and place to another and it's unclear how it alles fits together.The sound effects are heavily overused; there is often more sound than image and it often used in overkill to keep the viewer interested. That being said, the overuse of jump scares is also a very desperate attempt to get the viewer in their grip. This should not be the kind of movie that should have to rely on these easy ways to scare the viewer.The visual effects were OK, but also overused and you could definitely witness the early days of a young visual effects creator, using everything he has in his tool belt to how off his recent skills. The director should have known the time and place for this better.My most important observation was the idea that this film borrowed a LOT of elements from other horror films, but copied them without any real original tone of voice. They just wanted a quick way to bootstrap their movie and sell a decent trailer, which is simply disappointing.The ending, which I will not reveal, because there is not much to spoil, is just blurry, plain and not quite as thought provoking as the film leads up to. You turn off the tv with an awful font for the end credits and think to yourself ""well, that's one and a half movie that I won't get back..."".The acting of most characters was OK. I hope this film may lead to more roles, but I think their talents were underused; they could have easily carried his film more, instead of relying on cheap computer effects.In summary, this movie seems like a long short, one that was stretched to an hour and a half in order to be used by Netflix and add to their large stack of average-quality films.",His House

211,Grimbleton,My mother used to tell me a story.,7,17 November 2021,"I've been on a horror binge lately and I've opened my eyes to films that don't have hundreds of sequels or have a production date of the Stone Age; that ended up bringing me to His House, a unique film with a low budget that doesn't skimp on any scares and core development.Exploring new facets of the horror genre is something I wish more filmmakers would embrace, as most films resort to the typical ""serial killer gone loose"" theme with a slightly different spin that ends up being niche. As Remi Weekes explored Sudanese terrors, I found myself scribbling down yet another mythology that scared me to death (well, at least not yet) - it was something that hadn't been done, and Weekes' risk paid off. A disheartening story with a Sudanese couple seeking refuge in England at the core, the horror develops as the characters do, the scares getting more terrifying as we learn about Bol and Rial, what they've had to endure to get where they are now. But the most interesting aspect of the film is how the horror isn't simply a ghost or a demon - it's something deeper, rooted more in primal human characteristics and development (can't define it without spoiling).His House doesn't simply through jump scares at you - it's not a cheap thrill. This film is set on a bunsen burner and heats up slowly, the buildup presenting itself as our characters unravel. Most horror films don't have impact, but this one does and it makes you take a closer look and human behaviour and how horror isn't just a tall-tale - it's something we're all capable of.",His House

217,clairekalsto,An Ok Horror Film but a Great Movie,8,20 November 2020,"Now if you're waiting for you're typical, surface level horror film to pass the time, you might be disapointed. From what I saw, most bad reviews were about the movie being ""boring"", which will probably be the case if you're only looking for jumpscare instead of looking into the story.However looking deeper into it, you'll get a great social commentary about colonisation, immigration and all the consequences, or rather ""ghosts"", that inevitably come with it. Here's my personal interpretation, but to each their own (SPOILERS obviously):Story (just ignore this paragraph if you already saw/understood it): We follow a couple, Bol and Ryal, running from their country in a attempt to make their way to the ""greater land"" and start a new life. However the house given for their ""trial period"" as UK citizen turns out to have obscures presences hiding behind its walls.
We eventually discover that in order to make his way to london, Bol stole a little girl from her mother in an attempt to get himself and his wife seats in the bus that will lead them to the boat to England. Ryal, filled with remorse sweared to protect the little but the latter ended up dying in the sea as they were floatting to the Occident. The presences tormenting them are ones of a demon, Nygyak, and the many ghosts he appropriated the souls from, including the little girl's. He offers (or rather demands) to get Bol's soul in exange of the little girl's, as a sign of reparation. Eventually, the demon is killed and and Bol and Ryad accept the price that comes with freeing the little girl from Nygyak and the thousand ghost that were under his influence.Now you could see this as a simple story about this couple of immigrants being hunt by demons after comitting a crime, but in my opinion, this movie is a commentary about colonization as a whole. Bol represent the colonizer: he takes from people to make his path to more success and belonging, at the expanse of other people's life. Then once his ""ghosts"" (the immigrants) comes to reclaim their part of the cakes, he plays the denial card: you can see him trying to get rid of everything linking him to his past life, and naïvely hide the scratchs of his damaged house in a attempt to make himself at home. The same way a lot of Occident countries, after so much years of slavery, colonizing and stealing ressources, likes to paint those event as ""part of the past"" while fully keeping the economic advantages that came (and still comes) with it. I'd say Ryal represent your actual immigrant, scarred by war and full of remorse (just as Bol, she made her way to UK at the cost of someone else's life) and nostalgic of her home, not quite able to fit in as she's lost in a world that isn't hers and where people mock and reject her. But now she's also here in this house, which imo represent the land, within which colonizer and colonized have to cohabit anyway. Bol wants to make the house his, while Ryal wants them to acknowledge the ghosts and leave. I'd say Nygyak is a metaphore for war and death, as he slowly draw the two characters against one an other in order to get his blood sacrifice, presenting it as an ""easy way"" to fix their tornment. Once the demon is defeated, Bol and Ryal finally both understands they have no choice but moving forward while bearing the consequences that come with leaving on a ground obtained at expanse of so many lives, and fix their mistakes (aka fix the house).I like this interpretation as it doesn't paint a white and black picture, simply aknowledge that as long as this circle of stealing and repaying continues, more lives will be lost.This movie is great, the performances are outstanding and doesn't fail to keep things interresting despite a limited budget. However I think if you're looking for more traditional horror, this probably ain't it. Still, congratulation to Remy Weekes, looking forward his next projects.",His House

226,amandajeanstone,The road to hell is paved with good intentions!,8,16 November 2020,"Being South African, I am used to African culture and the terrifying superstitions that go along with it. A deep seated respect for the elders, the ancestors and a genuine fear of witchcraft spell out African culture and often dictate how lives are lived here. This movie perfectly captures those fears and beliefs, but there is more to this. I believe this encapsulates survivors guilt. The intention to save another from a terrible fate, going awry and ending in tragedy must surely leave a deep wound on the mind that is self destructive and requires an honest introspection and eventually acceptance of the role one may have played in the loss of that life. It amounts to wrestling with one's own demons and a process of self forgiveness and acceptance that that pain and guilt will always live on inside you. Very interesting movie. I loved it and I so enjoyed the creepy moments. When Rial tells Bol the story from her mother, I felt once again as if I was camping out in the pitch dark of the African veld and listening to a wise, old African woman telling me a moralistic tale with a terrifying, supernatural consequence, and nothing but open veld and darkness surrounding me. It's pretty creepy. Unless one comes from a deeply superstitious culture, you may not appreciate that feeling, however the movie captures it perfectly. Totally worth a watch. I loved it.

I'm usually not affected by ""scary movies"" but for me, it was everything I think a horror movie should be. It showcased real-life horrors and through the medium of a classic ""haunted house"" setting, explored more sophisticated themes and a real sense of terror, unlike other movies that you feel like you can separate yourself from more easily. This one pulled you in from the opening scene and didn't let go. It had peaks and valleys, but even those valleys didn't bring you much comfort, you just felt like you're waiting for the other shoe to drop. It wasn't relaxed at any point in this move and that made the experience that much better.It also used a very grounded, ever-growing sense of loneliness, hopelessness and loss to compound the fear and anxiety to heighten the more supernatural aspects.The acting was superb, the editing and disorientation it creates was used brilliantly and the unreliable narration helped move this into a thriller as well as horror.It was just great, I am going to go out of my way to watch this directors work- brilliant.",His House

Following an African refugee couple who have fled turmoil in their homeland only to find an all new horror that awaits them within their temporary accommodation.His House has a slight art-house feel with good tone setting that reminded me of The Babadook. But it moves too quickly to the revelation, physically, of what torments (or will torment) the lead couple. It didn't build any real suspense and because of that the scares fall flat. A shame because it could've been truly terrifying.And this is the issue with the whole movie. The pacing is off. Too slow where it could move more swiftly, which ultimately diminished the scenes where suspense could be utilised to ramp up fear.I was rooting for His House and I can see why some have opted for the higher ratings. But for me it felt like a great opportunity missed. A genuinely compelling concept let down by below par execution.The twist is not so much a twist.

The storyline is simply pretentious supernatural claptrap. I am not at all sure what the significance of the main characters being Sudanese refugees in the UK is? If there is any special allegorical meaning I am afraid I missed it. The story seemed to suggest that the refugees had brought their supernatural demons with them - so what does the UK have to do with it?The supernatural parts are really quite laughable and similar to what you might find in a very low budget horror film that would normally score about 3 on IMDB - so it beats me why this is getting the high ratings.",His House

265,v-macri,Unexpected. Frightening. Touching.,10,3 November 2020,"I think the scariest horrors for me are the ones rooted in real human suffering. And this is. A story of two refugees, displaced, traumatised, scared, alone and in a system they don't understand.Arriving in some nondescript suburb in England, they had finally escaped and the terror was now thousands of miles away. But now that they were in a physically safe place, the dark and the quiet and stillness swallows them and gave life to their memories.For me, it wasn't about a witch. It was about their traumas and their own demons, the wrong they had done to survive. The evil and suffering they had witnessed. Where else was all the pain from their memories going to go? It manifested in their walls and in the dark corners.In the end it was about learning to live with the ghosts. Acceptance and maybe even healing. A brilliant film, truly frightening to watch, unexpected twists in the storyline and packed full of ideas to dwell on.This is a horror with meat. The things that stick with me as the credits roll is the sorrow for all the faces of the countless ghosts who didn't get to live because of conflict in their home. The continued suffering of those that survive and attempt to start again.",His House

270,lucas-benvenuti,Waste of time,3,28 December 2020,"If you haven't watched it yet, don't fall for these ""critics"". Netflix definitely doesn't know how to make horror movies. I'm giving 3 to lower the grade, because it certainly isn't worth the current 6.5. The actors are good, but everything else is bad, they sell you one thing in the trailer, and the movie is another. Scenes that force the ""I want to be cult"" side of the thing too much and a meaningless plot and ending, wanting to make something bad, exciting.",His House
271,cvmann,Brilliant and devastating.,9,1 November 2020,"An ambitious film that seeks to cast off the shackles of the haunted house genre in order to create something more impactful than your typical horror flick. This film has impressive visuals and tremendous acting especially from Wunmi Mosaku who plays Rial. What is truly remarkable about this film is the way it toys with the viewer's relationship to different aspects of the film including characters and the horror itself. This film packs so much emotional depth in only 93 mins. My only negatives are that at certain points the movie becomes a little ungrounded with the extent of the hallucinatory/dreamy imagery. Also, I'm not exactly sure how I feel about some of the horror imagery being traditional African body art. I'm certainly not sufficiently knowledgeable of the subject to judge whether there is narrative significance to the art or if the filmmaker just thought it looked spooky.",His House

277,imes_jacob,Excellent fresh take on a tired haunted house genre,9,5 November 2020,"His House is simply excellent! It's really hard to categorize as simply just a horror film as well because this film has so much going on under the surface. All in all, it plays out as more of a psychological drama than it does a horror film.Shedding light on a unique underrepresented perspective of refugees seeking asylum, this film has it all, great acting, a well constructed plot that coincides with the philosophical message it conveys, a subtle social commentary on immigrants and discrimination, and of course horror elements that take an interestingly artsy and stylistic approach to the predictable pattern we've come to expect from the haunted house genre. With sequences that place our protagonist in dreamlike fantasies stemmed from tragic events of his past, this film refuses to be confined to traditional ideas in terms of its haunts. There is also something to be said about the candor the film has about its own plot, the characters seem to know exactly what is happening to them and why, this is echoed through a couple of my favorite of Riel's conversations, one with her husband and one with Mark their case worker. The mystery for the audience becomes about the tragedies of their past rather than what is haunting them. This is a bold move because in doing this I will say the second half of the story looses a bit of its suspense but at the same time remains completely unpredictable.The second act that reveals the source of the couples harbored angst, although placed in reality, is arguably more horrifying than all the scares that lead up to it. It is sure to be the scene that sticks with you long after the creepy ones fade. Although the atrocities are still there, after this turn in the film there is a shift in mood away from traditional horror which is why I would recommend this movie to anyone not just fans of the genre. My one criticism would be that the end scene was a bit anticlimactic in my opinion but it doesn't take away from the story overall and that should not deter anyone from seeing this film. It honestly has to be my favorite horror film of the year probably because like I said before it packs in many themes and such a deep message. It's a story about coming to terms with guilt, shame and loss that is told more through a horror lens than it is horror at its core. This is sure to be a future classic.",His House
278,imjim-60985,Really worth the watch!,8,20 November 2020,After sitting down and watching this eerie film I can easily say I thoroughly enjoyed it! It's definitely worth the watch. It kept me interested the whole way through while also maintaining a good thrill level to it. It's a little bit mind boggling at times but the psychological sections are so entertaining. I think it really touched upon some real emotions like *SPOILER ALERT* the hardships of having to try and survive within a war-torn country. I felt worried about what could happen to the two main protagonists while also being kept on my toes whenever the spirit was involved. I also felt emotional towards the finale. I won't ruin much more... leave the rest up to you! I'm a huge horror fan and this one is so simplistic and stylistic it really makes it that little bit more enjoyable.

Power comes in pairs, and it's a lesson viewers come to define as they watch the two toil through the muck and the piss to keep each other in close arms.""His House"" rather chooses to express the mentality of guilt and sorrow over subtle flashes of horrific figures, clips filmed in total darkness, and simple but effective music that works to keep you at the edge of your seat. Not too many jumpscares with this one, and it's just the perfect movie for a cryptic Saturday night. You'll feel an ease with the theme and be invited to explore the world of struggling refugees after harsh times learning to adapt in modern society with European fellows. Overcome the horrid dredges of Fear and submit to Love, but keep in mind that you cannot hide your true self from another's peering gaze.THE GOOD: Wonderful theme that mixes well with our plot and mingles exceptionally within the cast.
THE BAD: N/A
THE UGLY: Movie falls apart in the last 8 minutes. A terrible ""Hollywood-esque"" ending serves to resolve conflict.",His House

323,dasconrad,A well developed story that is elevated by horror genre conventions,9,17 November 2020,"Spoilers: His House is a story a married South Sudanese refugee couple who have been granted asylum in England. The couple struggle with the concept of what it means to be ""one of the good ones."" For the husband, it means assimilating smoothly into English life and establishing themselves as a family in that image. He cheers for their local soccer team, attempts to dress like the images of English families, and disregards the lifestyle practices they used to have in South Sudan. For the wife, it is about coming to terms with their past and the loss of their daughter. Their struggle manifests as a demon in the walls of the house they are granted asylum in. The demon appears in many forms: as their dead daughter, as the dead passengers of the sunk ship they survived crossing the mediterranean, and in its true form. Long exposure shots, eerie non-diegetic sound, and the use of shadows are all horror conventions used to create frightening ambiance for the demon and create scenes where the fears of the couple are realized.The demon forces the couple to confront the repressed, a critical turn in the film: their daughter was never theirs in the first place. They took the child so they could board a bus which only was helping families with children escape. The daughter dies in the sinking ship crossing the mediterranean; the couple being some of the only survivors. They struggle with what it means to be ""one of the good ones"" and cannot come to terms with the passing of the child that they abducted for their escape. Their time in England is met with skepticism for their existence as refugees, but the film is really a commentary on the dilemmas of survival that refugees face. The film for me could only be a horror film. The demon lets the viewers feel the fear and repression for the appearances required of the refugees in order to make it through the system of asylum approval. It reveals the horrors that they are trying to escape and how even in safe country, it can continue to haunt them.Even if the content isn't interesting to you, the movie is a must watch for horror/thriller lovers. The acting, directing, and plot development is superb.#cens201",His House
324,joelrice-89539,Where did this gem come from??,8,19 November 2020,"I was almost expecting a comedy thriller/horror from the trailer, but damn. This was a smooth blend of passion, heartache and the shear willingness of the human soul/mind to forgive and forget. There were tiny scenes of comedy which were soon overshadowed by the realism of the horrors that plagued the couples minds, thoughts and memories. The more poingnent scenes of the film where almost heartbreaking and really made it clear that this film meant business and wasn't messing about. Would love conquear all and bring peace to an otherwise distorted relationship, or would desperation take it's grip over the hearts desire to re-claim what was seemingly lost forever? Please watch, i emplore you.",His House
325,alexmccormick-21586,predictably awful,1,21 November 2020,"Dreadful. The fact that this is considered high art in today's society demonstrates how terrible most art is. This film is predicated on one hollow metaphor about the family's misdeeds in their efforts to escape their home country. Simultaneously, it makes some sort of half-baked effort at social commentary by way of reference to the 'hostile environment' culture and so on and so forth. The result can probably be best characterised as a fart: a series of images depicted by a series of individuals that only the mind of a social media addled, soap-opera addicted, 21st century fool could think was remotely inventive, intellectual, or poignant. As I said at the beginning, dreadful.",His House
326,galaihmi,WATCH WITHOUT PREJUDICE,10,3 December 2020,This is such an amazing film I absolutely cannot believe anyone who's rated it lower than an 8 yeah it's got jump scares and it's horror which is cool and all BUT OH MY GOD DOES THIS FILM HAVE SUCH A MESSAGE. Strong metaphors woven into this movie it's gripping from the start when you watch it it might seem like your average horror movie but stick with it it's absolutely amazing and heart aching at the same time. There's a lot to learn from this movie and if ignorant people can look past the black acting leads and director they will be open to a touching story which we all need to be aware is happening in this world.

329,delwinmartin,"Not your average horror film, hits home on much deeper fears and realities",10,15 February 2021,"His House is a horrifying and thoughtful film with ample scares for the avid horror movie goer but has a deeper and emotional level that will give viewers pause to the struggles of immigration. The film is about a Sudanese couple that are seeking asylum in London, England and as it progresses we see inner demons at work and how they overcome them forms the crux of the story.
Being a horror movie buff, I really enjoyed the movie on this premise alone but I believe the movie is a much deeper metaphor about the difficulties that immigrants/refuges face when relocating to a new country. To the better life they were promised to leaving their old country and lives behind, one can rarely imagine how difficult this is without having done it themselves. The Promised Land often turns out quite different then the dreams and reality soon sinks in. Early on we see the couple, Bol and Rial finally being placed into their new home which is quite disturbing. The house is completely rundown and is complete with no electricity and some old furniture. Yet they are told that it is large and they are lucky to have it. Bol is eager to remain positive and start a new life as quickly as possible where as Rial sees the house for what it really is and believes that they deserve better.
Early on we see that Bol and Rial are at odds with each other and Bol sees visions of their dead daughter; she had drowned on a part of the journey to England.
The balance of assimilating to the new culture and keeping their own culture and beliefs alive is a fine line. We see an example of this when Bol decides to burn remnants of their own lives under the guise of the demon that is haunting them but Rial is quite opposed to this as she wants to cling to their culture. Bol believes that assimilating aggressively and forgetting their past is the best approach to a new life.
We see examples of discrimination that immigrants often face when Rial ventures out in the community for the first time and is ridiculed for her accent and cultural outfit by local black kids when she asks for help. It was quite sad to see black people make fun of their own just because they were born in London and she was not.
We see that Bol is haunted by a demonic presence that quickly erodes all his sanity and forces him to destroy the house quarrel with Rial. We soon learn the back story to Rial and Bol and the circumstances that forced them to leave Sudan. War and conflict engulfs their city and the viewers are subject to merciless massacre. Rial is a school teacher who avoids certain death by hiding in the classroom while her fellow students and teachers are murdered. She soon reunites with Bol and they come at a crossroads when the last bus is leaving the town while a crowd of people struggle to get on. Bol tries to negotiate their passage on the bus but when all else fails he kidnaps a young girl and claims her to be his daughter while the mother is seen crying as the men with guns start shooting. The truth sinks in, Nyagak was not their real daughter as they were forced to commit a terrible crime to escape certain demise.
Now we understand why there are at odds with each other. Rial is quite disturbed that Bol does not want to accept the truth of what he did and why it was wrong. When the demon that haunts Bol tries to kill him we see Rial step in and save her husband. She realizes that what he did was a matter of life and death Glimpses of their old friends are soon seen and the demon haunts them no more. They are content now to rebuilding their lives together in London.
This movie hit hard for me because I'm a son of an immigrant that escaped her country and to seek asylum in Canada. She gave up her dreams to give her children a better life in this new country and works a minimum wage job at a local McDonalds. Growing up she instilled the importance of education and hard work as a key driver to financial freedom. As I grew up, I achieved certain success and see myself quite simply as a local and not a son of a visible minority immigrant. It's easy to forget about your parent's struggles and sacrifices they made to raise you especially during the grind of your own daily life. In the past I've even talked down to her and made fun of her accent albeit in a teasing way. This film presented a deep glimpse into my own life and how I can improve it and pay my gratitude to my mom. I now often find myself being extra polite to the stranger serving me coffee at Tim Hortons or delivering me food on Uber. Their journeys to Canada may never well be told but I can only imagine that they fight their own inner demons every day and make sacrifices in promise of a better life for themselves and their children.",His House

340,downstage_right,Brilliant on several levels. We need more of this and less junk in the horror genre.,8,30 October 2020,"There are so many terrible films, particularly in the horror genre, on Netflix at the moment. This is not one of them. All the horrors I've watched recently are either far too dumb, or too far the other way - relying on being artsy or having powerful imagery but sacrificing a satisfying story. This one gets it just right. It is genuinely intriguing but leaves you with a resolution. There are layers of interpretation, but also a nice clear cut story.I found for a good part of the film I thought it was just a theme of asylum seeking; a couple fleeing something bad and arriving at a not-beautiful side of Britain, with the man trying to adjust to a new culture and then woman conversely holding onto her roots, all through the narrative of an apparently haunted house. The pair being explicitly warned that they might be sent ""back"" if they made any trouble, or didn't integrate properly, emphasised this theme. But it turned out to be about something quite different - something I can't really say without giving away the plot substantially. It could have been based on anyone with a past, and the fact that the main characters were refugees worked well for the narrative but was not the entire theme.It was well cast and very well acted, which is not actually all that typical in many films being streamed at the moment. Matt Smith is in it but as a side character: they don't try to force him into it beyond his welcome just to exploit the well known name; also refreshing. He is good in his part, but the two leads are allowed to shine.I'm not much of an artistic critic but I felt they built and maintained the atmosphere brilliantly. I can't even tell you if it was visuals or score or lighting or whatever because I'm not the type of audience to dissect that - I just know it gripped me and took me with it emotionally. The tension is good and there were jump scares that work well. Personally I can't stand a film that's just reliant on jumpy moments or gore and lacks any actual substance. This, to me, gives the best of all worlds. And when it ended I felt genuinely glad I'd watched it, and watched it to the end.Honestly this little film buried far below the (poorer quality) netflix recommendations was a very positive surprise for me and I would definitely recommend watching.",His House

If you're expecting Paranormal Activity or another run of the mill horror from those studios, with cheap scares and lame characters, forget it.

347,novmih,No quarter in the present,10,21 November 2020,"It's a great metaphor for the need to existentially integrate the three temporal dimensions of one's life: past, present and future. One cannot take shelter in any of them separately, by dislocating it from the other two. More to the point, one cannot identify oneself exclusively with one's present, respectively erase one's past, for then he/she becomes haunted and hunted by the latter (as it initially was the case with Bol). However traumatic, only by facing and seeking to constructively deal with one's own past, can one find the means to 'start anew' and ensure a future. Time, the great unfolder of Being, can cure everything, but only if allowed to flow between the three dimensions. Of course, once disturbed, (re)bridging the gap between them is not without peril or potential sacrifice. Charon must have his obol, after all.",His House
