0,MartinHafer,A nice time-passer worth your time,8,10 June 2007,"Okay, it's a fact that not every Disney full-length cartoon can be as magical and transcendent as BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, BAMBI or LITTLE MERMAID. So because some other full-length Disney films such as LILO AND STITCH and THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE are a bit of a let-down isn't a bad thing nor does it mean they are bad films--it's just that these other films are so perfect that you can't help but make comparisons. Fortunately, the intended audience for this film (kids) don't usually make this comparison and I was just happy that the movie didn't make the history teacher within me scream like it did when I saw POCAHONTAS! The movie is about a selfish Incan leader. While anachronisms and historical inaccuracies might have been a problem, Disney wisely made the time period very vague and it's pure fantasy. Sure, witches like the one played by Eartha Kitt did not exist in ancient Peru, but it was obvious to everyone watching that this was not meant to be a history lesson--just silly fun with a decent central message. Just sit back and enjoy this cute little time-passer.",The Emperor's New Groove
1,TheLittleSongbird,Funny and highly original film.,9,14 May 2009,"I really enjoyed this movie. After some almost disastrous attempts at direct to video sequels, I was hugely surprised to see for once a wonderfully funny and highly original film. The animation is spot on, with beautiful backgrounds and well-drawn characters that are also likable. They are also very funny, especially Kronk, who looked similar to Gaston in Beauty and the Beast. The music by John Debney and Sting was hip and memorable. Usually in direct to video sequels(which of course this is not) the songs are just awful, and sound like they were improvised in five minutes. A good example is Cinderella 2. The songs here have funny lyrics, are well sung and sound as though the composers took some extreme lengths to make it perfect. The voice talents are exceptional. David Spade's acting ability is somewhat limited but for this type of character, a selfish emperor called Kuzco who is turned into a llama by his adviser, it works wonderfully. John Goodman was very earnest as Pacha, and the villainess Yzma, who I would pick over the really bland Morgana from the Little Mermaid sequel any day, was played to perfection by Eartha Kitt. The script is funny and touching, and while sometimes it isn't as laugh-out-loud funny as some animated films, it has a huge impact on the well told story. I have no real criticism for this movie, other than it is probably too short. Anyway 9/10. Bethany Cox.",The Emperor's New Groove
2,SnoopyStyle,short and fun,7,11 June 2016,Kuzco (David Spade) is an arrogant dictatorial Inca emperor. Pacha (John Goodman) is told that his village is being destroyed in favor for the emperor's new summer home. Yzma (Eartha Kitt) wants to rule instead. She and her dim-witted boy toy Kronk (Patrick Warburton) tries to poison Kuzco but it transforms him into a llama.David Spade's sarcastic comedy comes through. It's a pretty simple Disney cartoon. Its short length and thin story makes this more like an episode than a feature. It's fun but not that substantive. The main character learns to be good and the villain gets her comeuppance. The animation is not always that cinematic but the heights do give a bit of vertigo. This is a short and fun ride.,The Emperor's New Groove
3,jboothmillard,The Emperor's New Groove,8,13 July 2005,"For a Walt Disney Pictures film, this is much more hipper, groovy and fun than many others. David Spade voices and narrates as Emperor Kuzco, he is the selfish young emperor who has everything he wants. He plans to build a new summer pool on a village hilltop where peasant Pacha (John Goodman) lives. Yzma (Eartha Kitt), the villain turns Kuzco into a llama and, eventually, both him and Pacha are lost in the wilderness. They travel towards the palace, and Pacha thinks that within four days Kuzco will change his mind about the pool on his hilltop. Meanwhile Yzma is searching with her dopey sidekick Kronk (Patrick Warburton) for Kuzco when she finds out he is not dead. With a really good Oscar and Golden Globe nominated song by Sting, ""My Funny Friend and Me"", and Sir Tom Jones singing as Kuzco's Theme Song Guy, this is great fun for all the family. Very good!",The Emperor's New Groove
4,ccthemovieman-1,High Praise For This 'Kids' Film,9,12 March 2006,"You've often heard the sales pitch, ""adults will love it, too!"" almost always referring to a kids' movie and in particularly, an animated movie for children. Well, in this case I agree. Even as a middle-aged adult, I enjoyed this.The dialog is adult-friendly but at the same time not coarse or crude with no sexual innuendos, no profanity or even a hint of it. Yet, it's hip with some very clever lines.The story is interesting and offers a few unique twists. David Spade does a fabulous job narrating, has a very pleasing voice, one that's fun to hear. I actually do think adults would like this more than children.",The Emperor's New Groove
5,Quinoa1984,One of the best feel good comedies of the year,8,9 December 2000,"Disney's The Emperor's New Groove is one of those family films that anyone can walk in, see it, and feel good afterwards.  Mainly because it's funny, and mostly entertaining.  Story follows a spoiled emperor (David Spade vocals and gives some great charm to the character) who gets his life twisted around when a revenging advisor (Eartha Kitt voices) turns him into a lama (though by accident).  Then the fun begins.  Like The Road to El Dorado (another animated feel good comedy from this years batch), this is a family animated/comedy that isn't in perfection, but it doesn't matter much when it's this enjoyable.  Good natured songs by Sting give this film a boost.  A-",The Emperor's New Groove
6,studioAT,An underrated Disney classic,6,4 June 2013,"When you think of Disney's animated classics (and some of the ones that are touted as 'classics' but really aren't) this film rarely comes up but I think it's well worth looking out for because in my opinion it's one of the funniest Disney films.Stripping back a lot of the usual Disney conventions like lots of songs and cute fluffy animals that will sell a lot of toys, this film is more about slapstick and verbal comedy which means it appeals to a wider age range than just kids. I know nowadays this is more common place but back in 2000 this was a big deal.It's bright, it's got a lot of charm and some decent vocal performances (though I can't hear John Goodman's voice these days and not think of Sulley from Monsters Inc) so once your kids have tired of Snow White and co I think The Emperor's New Groove would be worth a watch.",The Emperor's New Groove
7,Boba_Fett1138,"Boom, baby!",9,16 January 2005,"""The Emperor's New Groove"" is a rare hilarious Disney movie.It's very different from any other Disney movie so this movie might also be very watchable to you Disney haters out there. The movie pace is incredibly high and the music by John Debney and Sting are a real surprise. The movie really is a non-stop hilarious comedy with some unique humor. Also the style, both visual and story-wise is different from any other previous Disney movie, which in this case is a positive thing.The characters are great. Kuzco and Pacha are a perfect team. Yzma is a remarkable villain and her sidekick Kronk is hilarious. Yep, Laughs are guaranteed in this very hip and hilarious movie!The story really is of no importance and most of it never makes sense but that's also why this movie is both unique and hilarious to watch over and over again.Highly recommendable to everyone!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Emperor's New Groove
8,anaconda-40658,The Emperor's New Film.,8,10 March 2016,"The Emperor's New Groove (2000): Dir: Mark Dindal / Voices: David Spade, John Goodman, Eartha Kitt, Patrick Warburton, Wendie Malick: Hilarious animation suggesting the new groove as personality and perspective delivered from the influence of pride and greed. We meet the selfish Emperor who decides to build a summer home where a peaceful village already exists. A kindhearted peasant travels to the palace in hopes of reasoning with him and convincing him to build elsewhere but he is ignored. Central plot regards a scheme by the Emperor's adviser that has him transformed into a llama. From there the deformed Emperor must rely on the peasant for help. Although the plot is simple, the delivery results in one of the funniest animations ever made. Well directed by Mark Dindal who previously made another animation called Cats Don't Dance. David Spade is hilarious voicing the whiny voice of the Emperor. John Goodman voices the patient peasant. We know where this is headed and that the Emperor will be transformed back and terms will be met peacefully with the peasant. Eartha Kitt voices the cranky plotting adviser, while Patrick Warburton is side-splitting funny as her henchmen Kronk. Other roles are more simplistic or a variety that have been presented in one form or another in other animations. This will dazzle families who will marvel at its new groove. Score: 8 ½ / 10",The Emperor's New Groove
9,Mr-Fusion,Fun movie; really sneaks up on you,7,7 June 2014,"What's really surprising about ""The Emperor's New Groove"" is how likable David Spade is. One wrong move and that voice can be abusive to the ear holes. But he works here, and fits in wit some good performances that elevate this movie above its mid-tier Disney material (Eartha Kitt's a good villain, and John Goodman provides all the movie's heart). I dig this flick's sense of humor, and the animation is top-notch (you don't see Incan architecture every day, and the animators do it justice).But it's Patrick Warburton who handily walks away with the entire thing, and it's one of my favorite Warburton performances (outside of ""The Tick""). He's got all the best lines and he's endearing as all hell, making Kronk one of the best Disney characters.7/10",The Emperor's New Groove
10,StevePulaski,Puts many newcomers to shame,8,26 May 2012,"It is truly amazing what stemmed from The Emperor's New Groove, which at one point seemed like a doomed project. Originally titled Emperor in the Sun, the film was going to focus on a selfish emperor who optimistically switched positions with a peasant look-a-like who would later become the target of an evil witch's plan. She was going to summon a dark spirit to block out the sun to prevent her from aging, almost like a retelling of Dorian Gray.The film developed an untold amount of stress for everyone involved. Producer Randy Fullmer was aggravated that production was moving at a snail's pace and was consistently rushing director, at that time, Roger Allers to speed along, offering him no extensions. The project had to be done as fast as possible in order to meet the strict summer 2000 deadline. Out of options, Disney hired the director Mark Dindal, who had worked on the musical Cats Don't Dance, one of the few animated films not to boast the Disney label, and both him and Allers developed very different story lines for the same film, one focusing on comedy (Dindal's) and one heavy drama and morals (Allers).At the end of the day, Fullmer denied Allers an extension and he abandoned the project, leaving all the weight on Dindal's shoulders. The project did not make the summer 2000 deadline, but went on to be released during the wintertime of that same year, something one must applaud considering the treacherous state it was in for so long. What Dindal managed to do to a project that looked to be a lost cause from there on out is truly astonishing, proving that even the dustiest pieces of work can be polished off to look good. The Emperor's New Groove is a delightful film, occupying a concise runtime, unstoppable action scenes, and fierce and interesting characters rarely striking a wrong note.The story focuses on Emperor Kuzco (voiced by David Spade), the selfish, manipulating emperor of the Inca Empire. After firing his adviser, Yzma (Kitt), her and her dim-witted assistant Kronk (Patrick Warburton, who also voices Joe Swanson from Family Guy) concoct a scheme to kill the Emperor by making him drink a poisonous potion. During a staged dinner, the potion gets switched and Kuzco is turned into an unattractive llama. Hidden inside the bag of Pacha (Goodman), one of the Emperor's peasants, the two realize they must work together, despite being on opposite ends of the food chain, to try and get Kuzco his position back.It is pretty clear that the ""he was a selfish man"" story has been well-played out. It was just six years after this that the Pixar film Cars modified the formula and injected it with a nostalgic rush to put it to use. The story is moved along by its refusal to provide a heavy-handed moral or become bogged down with complications from such a simplistic story. This is a genial exercise in smooth, involving animated filmmaking, moved along by its action and its instantly lovable characters.Also, there is something nice about returning to the wholesomeness of an animated picture from the early 2000's. Ever since the creation of full length CGI pictures, which all started with Toy Story in 1995, it appears hand drawn animation and claymation have been unfortunately pushed to the side, while the easier way is taken out. I love CGI animated features, especially the ones from Pixar, but really, how much of the candy-coated colors and the overly cheery atmosphere can you healthily stomach? The early 2000's animation is one of the few successful hybrids, perfectly blending the simplicity of animation with the digitized color enhanced textures.This is also an elegant reminder to parents and teens who enjoy nostalgia that 3D is a tainted gimmick. Here, the characters pretty much gleefully jump off the screen as if boundaries have been shredded, and they are so lively even without the dim colors or the extra dimension. This is the kind of animated feature Disney should be striving for, and they would be much closer to their competition at Pixar.The Emperor's New Groove is animated slapstick, and functions inside such a rare formula so well. It is elegantly voice acted, expertly animated, and it is nothing but surprising that a picture that one seemed doomed has now gone on to be such a remarkable picture.Voiced by: David Spade, John Goodman, Eartha Kitt, and Patrick Warburton. Directed by: Mark Dindal.",The Emperor's New Groove

I don't know how they got David spade to do a Disney movie, but he definately made it good. If it wasn't for him it would still be good, but not as good as it is with him. This movie has hilarious jokes, and it's not just for kids. I would recommend it to everyone.-PLOT- Greedy self centered emperor Kuzco(David Spade) gets turned into a Llama by his evil advisor Yzma(Eartha Kitt).

12,OllieSuave-007,A Disney movie overblown with silly comedy.,4,25 July 2015,"This is Disney's 40th full-length animated feature, a story about the cold-hearted Emperor Kuzco who wants to destroy a quiet village in order to built his summer home. After he fires his administrator, Yzma, she uses her magic to turn him into a llama, rendering him powerless so she could rule the kingdom in his place. He needs the help of llama herder Pacha to regain his throne, who is the one with the village he plans to destroy.This movie is soaked with slapstick comedy and modern-day clichés, from the hip-sounding Kuzco to Pacha's typical Hollywood-acting family, and from David Spade's narration to Kronk's (Yzma's sidekick) big oaf personality. Everywhere you turn, there are gags, modern-day dialog and more humor, which can be distracting in a movie that is supposedly set in ancient times. The plot is simple with few twists and turns, as it mostly concentrates on Pacha trying to help Kuzco get back his throne, with Yzma and Kronk in pursuit. But, I have to say that the film did crack me up a few times, especially during the scenes with the hilarious Yzma. The animation is also very colorful and vibrant.Overall, it's a very silly movie with overblown jokes, limited character development and plot substance.Grade D",The Emperor's New Groove
13,FeastMode,my notes,6,24 July 2019,Really funny and slightly more advanced humor than you expect in an old disney cartoon. this may have been the first really funny one. (about 3 viewings),The Emperor's New Groove
14,ElMaruecan82,"This Emperor Has Clothes, and Moves, and Style...",9,22 December 2017,"When you've been reviewing movies for a little while, you start to develop a few verbal symptoms, one of them is to adopt a sort of historian pose. I'll refrain from my usual impulses but just for a bit of contextualization, let's drop some information you're probably aware of. We know the ""Disney Renaissance"" is said to have started in 1989 with ""Little Mermaid"" and ended ten years later with ""Tarzan"". 1999 was also the year of the last Pixar acclaimed movie: ""Toy Story 2"" before Disney would strike again in 2003 with ""Finding Nemo"".What we've got in between is a forgettable trend of direct-to-VHS (or DVD) sequels that spoiled the 'classic' status of movies we tended for classics, and a few movies that have sunk into oblivion in the sense that they are not as celebrated as others involving a cute clown-fish, a cooking rat and a flying house. Speaking for myself, I started to be a student in 2000 and I didn't really care about the new Disney movies, I didn't care for ""Dinosaurs"", ""Atlantis"" and I certainly didn't care for ""Emperor's New Groove"" and it's not like the film didn't have publicity. After 17 years, I can only say ""Mea Culpa"". I was misinformed.I finally saw the film and I must say I've never laughed as much as I did since I saw the ""South Park"" movie, the movie made me laugh to tears, and I mean tears. ""Kuzco"" is one hilarious movie that should be more known on the sole basis of this achievement. But that's why I needed to contextualize the film, it was perhaps made at the worst possible timing, where a new generation of animators was still trying to find the right path, a revolutionary time that saw the change from VHS to DVD, from hand-drawn to computer-generated imagery. More than that, it was a time where Disney had probably used up all the classic fairy tale material, that forged its legend for seventy decades.And in ""Kuzco"", there's no room for grandstanding themes, underdog heroes and heroines, Aesopian arcs and honorable quests, the hero or let's just call him a protagonist is a wise-cracking emperor so wrapped up in the confidence over his power that he ends up being transformed into a llama. But even that pitch might give you the wrong idea, I could also tell you that the Incan emperor has an ego the size of his gigantic palace and would never tolerate anyone ruining his projects and that his journey will allow him to discover the 'good' side of his personality, but even that would be too moralizing for a movie that is mostly made for laughs, and that's why I loved it.I won't spoil the gags but this is a guy who throws an old man from the window because he ""ruined his groove"" or is about to kick a man with two kids and a pregnant village just to build a residential home, named Kuzcotopia. He's not even good by 'antiheroic' standards. And when the ""evil"" counselor Izma is fired because she's abusing from her position, you're still wondering why you should deem her as the villain. But you know what, let's take all these trademark concepts, these ""hero"", ""villain"", ""quest"", ""journey"", ""sidekick"" and throw them in the trashcan of our preconceived notions. This is a bowl of fresh air, finally an animated Disney movie designed as nothing else but a cartoon, it's exactly like ""Aladdin"" and ""Hercules"" without the fancy looking, sappy and romantic elements.To tell you how much I enjoyed the film, let's say that I had the feeling I was watching my good old Cartoon Network programs, ""Cow and Chicken"", ""Johnny Bravo"", even the old Looney Tunes and Tex Avery cartoons. In fact, there are even moments where the film channel some Chuck Jones vibes and the sights remind of the Road Runner. By being the less Disney-esque of all the Disney films, ""Kuzco"" is an oddity that elevates itself above all the other movies, and that might include the classics. Indirectly, it even mirrors the boring pompousness of other well-polished, well- designed, well-crafted movies, that made it at the Top 10 box office at the the end of the year. ""Kuzco"" didn't (""Dinosaurs"" did) but it makes its discovery all the more enjoyable.And I liked it, I loved it. It's a harmless, lighthearted, fun movie, I could say ""little"" but no, it's a masterpiece of laughs. And it's full of great and fun characters, four were enough to make the film, Kuzco the Emperor turned-llama and wise-ass-turned-good- guy, voiced by David Spade, the big and good-hearted Pacha who helps him in exchange of his promise to spare the village, but who actually can't prevent himself from doing a good thing, he's a Good Man played by the namesake John, and by the size, it was guessable. There's finally Yzma who's like a zanier version of Cruella De Vil (EarthaKitt) and her sidekick Kronk (Patrick Warburton) a mountain of a man but with a soft side, I mean can you make more gentle than someone who cooking and can speak the squirrel?I love a movie where you don't expect a villain to fall to death (well, there's a falling but it's an excuse for a hilarious twist), where action is more than an excuse for a succession of gags and laughs, where the 'serious' moments don't last too long, the film is a package of gags with the right running time, less than eighty minutes, but enough to leave you with a smile in your face. This is a film I would recommend to anybody, it's great and deserves more recognition.And take it from someone who hates to use the word ""underrated' but to call it underrated is an overstatement. It's groovy, but more than anything, it's funny.",The Emperor's New Groove

16,lesleyharris30,"One of Disney's Cleverest and Most Unique Films,",8,4 April 2015,"The Emperor's New Groove is a fantastic movie with a really well written storyline and a terrific voice cast. It is a very smart and unexpected turn from Disney, every time I watch it I just can't believe they ever allowed it be made, it's constant use of breaking the fourth wall and adult innuendos surprise me each time. The use of breaking the fourth wall is definitely my favourite part of the movie and is what makes it so fun and unique, it is mostly done by the main character Kuzco, who questions the films premise constantly and pauses it throughout because he is confused whenever he isn't on the screen, this type of thing can be annoying at times in movies, but it works out perfectly here and I never got annoyed. All the characters in this movie are great and likable in their own way, my favourite is Kronk, every line of dialogue by him is memorable and he had me in stitches most of the time. Very funny, smart and a huge risk from Disney that worked out well, the Emperor's New Groove is very enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a film for the whole family to enjoy. After a king is transformed in to a llama by an evil woman looking to take his place on the throne, he must get the help of a friendly village man in order to turn back to normal.",The Emperor's New Groove
17,CuriosityKilledShawn,Kingdom of the Fun,10,12 March 2001,"Apparently there was this thing that happened in 1994 called ""The Disney Renaissance"". The Lion King brought back ""Classic Disney"" or some such nonsense. The implication is that mega-hits like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin were not good enough. Nope, it was the Lion King which restored dignity to the studio. Dignity which they then squandered on garbage like Hunchback of Notre Dame and Hercules. On top of this Dreamworks Animation was gearing up to be a serious competitor while Pixar was hogging all of the glory.Such was the success of the Lion King that director Roger Allers was given permission to indulge himself in a vanity piece called Kingdom of the Sun. It was to be an epic, mystical spin on the Prince and the Pauper set in Peru during the time of the Incas as well as a romantic comedy musical with serious weight to the mythology.Honestly, this sounds like the kind of movie that I would have hated. The Disney suits felt the same way, though were even less kind when it came to communicating that opinion to the creative team. The development and production of Kingdom of the Sun dragged on for years with innumerable clashes, arguments, and differences between Allers and Disney. None of the moneymen liked where the film was going. A half-finished version was screened and rejected. Production was shut down. Allers was off the project and Mark Dindal was brought in to replace him. In the process Dinal completely overhauled the movie and changed it into something quite different. And thus Kingdom of the Sun gave birth to The Emperor's New Groove. A serious, mystical epic became an archaic slapstick comedy more in the vein of Looney Tunes than Lion King. And it's all the better for it.Throughout this shambolic development only three people remained constant: David Spade as the spoiled emperor Kuzco, Eartha Kitt as the conniving Yzma, and Sting, who would provide the soundtrack. The latter ended up only doing a single song ""My Funny Friend and Me"", but it did get an Academy Award nomination (which it lost to Bob Dylan). Sting's wife Trudi Styler was even commissioned to make a documentary on the production of Kingdom of the Sun and covered every torturous twist during those terrible times. What was supposed to be just an ordinary ""making-of"" became a rather notorious stand-alone documentary called ""The Sweatbox"" which was such a damning and difficult portrait of the House of Mouse that they have never allowed it to be officially released (and barely acknowledge its existence). Make no mistake, The Emperor's New Groove did not have an easy journey from concept to screen. Far, far from it.When the trailer screened in early 2001 in the UK I was immediately dismissive. I had become tired and jaded of the setting and tone. With The Prince of Egypt and The Road to El Dorado in the recent past I was not in the mood for more of the same. I was loudly vocal about how awful the trailer looked. But then something very odd happened...Kuzco turned into a Llama and it became surreal and hyper. I remember squinting and saying ""Uh...what IS this?"" I'd much rather take a chance on an odd curiosity than a self-proclaimed epic.The final story sees Emperor Kuzco betrayed by his assistant Yzma who plots to kill him in revenge for being fired. Her lunkhead servant Kronk (perfectly voiced by Patrick Warburton) mixes up the poison potion and instead transforms Kuzco into a Llama. Discarded into the nearby jungle Kuzco teams up with good-natured peasant Pacha, whom he earlier condemned to homelessness. They make a deal - help Kuzco turn back to human and Pacha can keep his community. Together they fight their way through the wilderness back to the palace with Yzma and Kronk close behind, determined to finish the job.TENG moves so fast it will make your head spin. This movie barely takes a breath, so much so that I don't think that the opening and closing titles even lasted a single second. It's just one wonderfully overblown set-piece followed by another. You'll be grinning so hard your face will be in agony. I can't call it anything other than my absolute favorite Disney animation (Big Hero 6 coming in at a close second) but I'm sort of annoyed that it gets such a bad reputation and that its often forgotten.Released in the US in late 2000 the movie received little fanfare and had a horrible dated marketing campaign that was stuck in the mid- 90s. While most Disney movies are shoved in our face and pretty much demand that we go see them this one seems to end up merely being discovered by growing cult of fans. I guess that makes a unique and controversial movie all the more special.",The Emperor's New Groove

19,tomgillespie2002,"Mildly amusing Disney but lacking inspiration, originality and innovation",4,18 August 2012,"Kuzco (David Space), is a spoilt and heartless 18-year old ruler of the Inca Empire, who is planning to build himself a giant holiday home. He summons Pacha (John Goodman) to tell him that he, his family, and the rest of the village must make way for his lavish plans and find somewhere else to live. Kuzco also fires Yzma (Eartha Kitt), his adviser, and in her fury she plans to poison him and ruling in his absence. Yzma's dim-witted but lovable henchman Kronk (Patrick Warburton) gives Kuzco the wrong poison, and instead turns him into a llama. She trusts Kronk to finish the job, but he doesn't have the heart to let Kuzco die and eventually loses him amongst the villagers. Stranded in the jungle with his new llama body, he entrusts Pacha to protect him and return him to his palace, without having any intentions of changing his holiday home plans.After a hugely troubled production (the title was originally Kingdom in the Sun and the plot involved a peasant look-a-like and a llama herder love-interest), The Emperor's New Groove arrived in 2000 to enjoy slim box-office success, something that Disney would have to get used to. The decision to swap the old-fashioned love story and moral preachings for a more silly and modern buddy-movie was a wise one, and film benefits especially from the work of Patrick Warburton, the man with possibly the best voice in comedy (he also does the voice of paraplegic Joe in Family Guy). Yet the tale is still an overly-familiar one, with the enlightenment of an ignorant rich kid amongst mixing with the lower- classes failing to find anything original to say.The character of Kuzco is especially loathsome, but where usually the actor/voice artist would be talented enough to make the character endearing, in the hands of David Space, an actor of such a startling lack of talent, is annoying, and remains annoying throughout. There were times where I felt like shouting at Pacha to just kick him off a cliff. I found the whole experience quite charmless, and in an age of high- definition CGI animation, it is nice to see Disney take a traditional approach. Yet where their early films such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and Bambi (1942) were drawn with expert beauty and love, Groove just looks lazy and heartless. It's not a total failure, the film is sporadically funny with the aforementioned Kronk getting most of the laughs, and Earth Kitt does some fine work as the twisted Yzma. But it's no wonder Disney would buy Pixar, as judging from this they were lacking from anything resembling inspiration or innovation.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",The Emperor's New Groove

22,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Disney's cult classic animated movie,7,31 December 2016,"""The Emperor's New Groove"" was the beginning of the end of an era for Disney's hand-drawn animated features and still, in many ways, represents the tug of war between the studio's past and present.Once titled ""Kingdom of the Sun"" and planned as yet another in a long line of Disney musicals (featuring music by Sting and a story along the lines of ""The Prince and Pauper"") the film underwent a calamitous production. After test audiences responded poorly, it lost a co-director and was eventually overhauled and salvaged into ""New Groove."" The movie has all the trappings of a classic Disney fairytale, but only one opening song.The story of selfish young Emperor Kuzco's (David Spade) ego check feels as though it should be a much more dramatic and emotional tale. We only get a brief introduction into how little empathy he has before his spurned adviser, Yzma (Eartha Kitt) and her marble-headed henchman Kronk (Patrick Warburton) accidentally transform him into a llama and send him out into the country. His only source of help is a family man named Pacha (John Goodman), whose village Kuzco said he would bulldoze to make room for his new summer vacation swimming palace.From there the story follows predictable patterns of friendship and betrayal and friendship before a stirring climax that tests to see whether our hero has turned the corner. That's nothing new, but what does feel a bit new is Disney's carefree attitude.Perhaps it was out of necessity to turn around a new and better film out of the one they'd already started, but director Mark Dindal keeps things very stripped-down and to the point, with an emphasis on humor above all else (the title is certainly an indication). The movie feels like the shortest of its ilk. In the late '90s, this was a pretty left-field approach for a Disney animated feature, but also a kind of brilliant one. Instead of wasting time on what were — at the time — stale fairytale tropes, the focus shifts to being silly and audacious. Screenwriter David Reynolds undercooks the whole thing and just loads up on all the fun stuff from '90s Disney movies like the references that go over kids' heads.The finished product comes off as pure fun. Spade is perfect as Kuzco, loading up on catch- phrases and making his character unlikable in a lovable way, while Kitt and Warburton's Yzma and Kronk duo are simply unlike any villainous dynamic seen on screen. They've have a hysterical, almost campy way about them, and they're not menacing or scary at all. They're more like adult Loony Toons characters than anything like the most notable '90s Disney villains. Although the stupid henchman thing had been done countless times, there's a refreshing charm to Kronk.The best way to phrase it — ""The Emperor's New Groove"" is like the cult hit of the hand-drawn animated age. Disney essentially released a send up of a Disney movie and at such a vivacious pace, it completely works. The fairytale qualities of the story evoke classic Disney films, but the wit and physical comedy are on a whole other kitschy level, which kind of hinted at the style of future animated family films. Part of the kind in me wants to be swept away by another music- filled magical animated feature, and for that reason the films that preceded it will always be better, but it does something fun and off-beat in a good way.~Steven CThanks for reading!

23,Vartiainen,Very fast and funny situational comedy,7,14 December 2015,"Originally this movie was supposed to be released under the name of Kingdom of the Sun, director by Mark Dindal and Roger Allers, the latter being a co-director of The Lion King. It was going to be a more traditional Disney adventure musical. Unfortunately the studio and Allers didn't see eye to eye, and eventually the whole idea was scrubbed and the existing material was turned into a buddy comedy.And as far as saving jobs go, they could have done a lot worse. You can definitely see that they had to cut a lot of corners to get the film out on schedule, but the movie has a lot of style, great sense of humour and very likable characters. It's one of the funniest Disney films I've ever seen - if not THE funniest - and stands out from the rest of the canon.The basic premise is that an Incan emperor named Kuzco gets turned into a llama after he fires his royal adviser, Yzma, who happens to be a sorceress of some talent - aren't they all. And now Kuzco has to get back into his palace in order to turn back into a man. The only problem is that the only man who can help him is also the chief of the village he intends to raze to the ground in order to build a summer home for himself. Not a very complicated plot as far as Disney films go, but it's the comedy that brings people back to this film. And that works beautifully. All four of the main characters have very good voice actors and they all have great chemistry together. The film also takes full advantage of its animated nature, giving us some really imaginative scenarios and gags.The only real problem I have is that the plot is very predictable and that the animation, while working very well in terms of comedic value, does look kind of cheap by Disney standards. Plus, while I enjoy the fact that Kuzco starts out very unorthodox for a Disney lead, his eventual character development is about as clichéd as you can get.Still, I do like the film a lot and it's an easy recommendation for anyone that enjoys Disney and for anyone that appreciates light-hearted comedies.",The Emperor's New Groove
24,FiendishDramaturgy,Some of Spade's best work.,8,4 October 2003,"My whole family LOVES this movie!David Spade and John Goodman's characters were hilarious. The whole production was excellent Disney fare; highly entertaining and, of course, containing the typical Disney lesson. This one teaches you not to be too big for your breeches, that the world does NOT revolve around that Center of the Universe that is YOU, and that not everyone you think are your friends can be trusted.Emperor Kuzco has been spoiled since birth. Having been raised to be Emperor, his every whim was immediately granted, causing him to become a spoiled rotten, greedy little tyrant around whom the universe revolves.In his aggravated state over his regent dealing with the kingdom anytime his back is turned, he forgets (or perhaps has yet to learn) that not everyone is going to bow to his every whim. He fires Yzma (his regent), and in his self-absorbed state of mind, does not stop to consider that there may be repercussions. Ah, but there are.Yzma has her assistant Kronk (Richard Warburton of ""Scream 3"") poison and KILL Kuzco, but instead, he goofs and turns the petty little schmuck into a llama. The rest of the movie deals with Kuzco learning his lessons and trying to find his way back home to the palace. Not an easy feat when he's never been in the jungles of his kingdom, in his life.After treating the ""whiny peasant"" Pacha like a red-headed step-child, he actually expects his help. Pacha, being a warm-hearted person, reluctantly gives it, but not without conditions. Conditions Kuzco breaks and breaks and breaks, of course, because he's still a SCHMUCK!This Disney production is quite amusing mainly because David Spade is such a complete and total @ss and he definitely gets what's coming to him. Nice to see that happen sometimes. You know? NO ONE likes a person who is THAT uncaring of others' feelings. Good movie, great story, decent animation and a lovely ending. The only thing I did not like about this movie was the animation. Disney's quality has gone down considerably in the last few years. They pay little or no attention to detail anymore. I hate that. For me, the visuals and the background details, can make a huge difference, and Disney doesn't seem to care much about that anymore.This should go straight into the Disney Classics collection.It gets an 8/10 from...the Fiend :.",The Emperor's New Groove
25,CubsandCulture,One of Disney's best animated films,10,9 December 2020,"I think the film wasn't initially well received because it is so different from much of the Disney canon. It's much closer to the classic Looney Toons in its zaniness than say Sleepy Beauty. It is very bright and kooky in its animation style; it's a comedy in which the plot is basically incidental to the proceedings. Films like this live and die on their performances; the four principals of Goodman, Spade, Kitt, Warburton are all *perfect* in this film. Every time I watch it it is just as engaging and delightful as the first time I saw it. The film ended up being the first in a series of animated films-the Shrek films, others come to mind-making meta-jokes or commentary on their forms to produce much more comedic offerings. Returning to it after 20 years or so just makes it stand out as the trend setter it ended up being.",The Emperor's New Groove
26,r96sk,Just sit back and enjoy,7,10 July 2020,"Amusing film.'The Emperor's New Groove' doesn't, in my opinion, feature a great plot, amazing music or incredible animation. All of that is all fine, though it's the humour that makes this film tick. It isn't belly laugh worthy but from start-to-finish I was amused by the funny nature of it.The premise is very silly, which works in its favour, with a load of things that don't quite add up, it even references that itself in the third act. That just adds to the fun, they know it's a mindless 78 minutes and make it work.The reason it comes out so well is thanks to David Spade and John Goodman. Spade is terrific as Kuzco, bringing the perfect wit to the self-serving emperor. Goodman is the overall star though, I thoroughly enjoyed him in the role of Pacha. Patrick Warburton is also decent as Kronk.It all makes for chilled out viewing, you'll have a good time if you just sit back and enjoy it - as I did.",The Emperor's New Groove
27,MissSimonetta,One of Disney's trinity of cult animated movies,9,2 May 2017,"Along with 1985's The Black Cauldron and 2001's Atlantis: The Lost Empire, The Emperor's New Groove (2000) is the closest thing Disney has ever come to making a cult movie. It is unlike any other film they've ever made: it's an outright comedy. Their Aladdin was as well; however, unlike Aladdin, TENG is wackier, faster, and features a hero who is borderline unlikable in his vanity and selfishness. The style is angular and bold, a bit of a departure from the usually rounded Disney style, one that would be brought to its greatest extreme in Disney's Atlantis.In tone, the movie feels a lot like a classic Looney Tunes short, but it does not forget the heart so common to Disney's work. It gets much better every time I rewatch it; it is one of those rare movies where I know the dialogue by heart. I think about anyone in my generation can quote it.

28,davispittman,Extremely underrated,10,21 March 2017,"The emperor's new groove is truly an underrated Disney film. It is highly entertaining, well written and funny. The voice actors are perfect fits for their animated characters, especially Yzma. I would to take a minute to talk about the character of Yzma, she is just an awesome character, very well written, well designed, and extremely well voiced. Could there have been a better actor to voice Kronk?? Patrick Warburton is so perfect to voice Yzma's hopelessly ignorant assistant. David Spade is very fitting for the self obsessed, selfish, spoiled rotten emperor Kuzco. The story is fun, well paced, funny, and heart warming towards the end. This is one movie the whole family will surely adore. It also is a very healthy movie for children to view since it shows the before and after of Kuzco, going from being extremely selfish and materialistic to actually caring for others and becoming a nice, decent human being. I especially love the scenes that involve Yzma and kronk interacting, their characters have hilarious chemistry. I encourage everyone no matter young or old to rent or buy this the next time you see it available. ""Pull the lever Kronk. WRONG LEVER!!!!!"" 10/10!",The Emperor's New Groove

30,Spleen,Hurrah! Perfection.,10,29 March 2001,"Hard to see why it wasn't a wildly popular mega-hit - I have two theories, one charitable, one not.  The charitable theory is that people were put off by the title.  MY heart certainly sank when I heard it.  I mean, just say it out loud - ""The Emperor's New Groove"" - now how could a good movie POSSIBLY have a title like that?Yet now, I rather like the title.  It fits the story; it doesn't care if it's fashionable or not; it's just so pleasingly RIGHT - but in an almost indescribable way you'll have to watch the film to find out.  Maybe it WAS a marketing mistake.  Who cares?  I never took seriously the charge that Disney's artistic decisions were made by its marketing department, anyway.That was the charitable explanation for why it made considerably less, inflation adjusted, than every other one of Disney's animated features from ""Beauty and the Beast"" on, and failed to even get nominated for a ""Best Picture"" Oscar in a year in which they had difficulty coming up with half-plausible candidates.  The uncharitable explanation is probably closer to the truth.  People are idiots.  This is a classic - but it's also animated - by pencil on paper rather than finger on keyboard - so who will ever notice?Doubt me?  You won't once you've seen it.  Everyone to speak of who did reports that it's very, very funny, and they're right - and trust me, nothing is ever THIS funny unless it's clever and witty as well.  It goes without saying that their character animation is unmatched in its brilliance and ... I've already used the words ""humour"" and ""wit""?  Well, I'll use them again.  In addition there's a charming dottiness that a merely hip film could never quite capture.  Art direction is perfectly judged and consistent throughout, with a pleasing absence of because-we-can computer effects.Here's just ONE example of what I'm talking about.  One side of the emperor's palace consists of this HUGE golden face, and we find out in a funny scene (but they're all funny) that all excess water is drained out through the nostrils.  But that's not all we see.  We see characters crawling out of the nostrils, we see someone dangling like a big booger on a rope out of one of the nostrils - one snot gag after another - yet no explicit camerawork ever draws our attention to them.  Not only do the characters deliver their lines perfectly deadpan, the camera delivers its images perfectly deadpan.  It's just perfect.Two more things I should mention.  Unlike Disney's other recent features, it never, not even for a second, feels as though the story has been unduly compressed - and at 78 minutes it's a trifle shorter than most.Also, despite the constant hilarity, it's rather touching.No movie I've seen in the past six months has filled me with such joy. Well, perhaps there have been a few others, but they were all made long ago.",The Emperor's New Groove

Skinny people are treacherous. Attractive caucasoid people are virtuous. Ethnic or ugly people are villainous) which Disney distastefully falls back on over and over.

No princess! There's (in other words) no decisions made by the same committee that choked the life out of their last ten movies. If you want that, just rent any other Disney movie.

35,Terryfan,A fun Disney Film,8,2 August 2015,"This is one of those rare Disney films that isn't a musical but manage to hold up on it's own against other movies from Disney.The Emperor's New Groove is a comedy animation movie that tells the story of Emperor Kuzco (Voiced by David Spade) after he is turned into a llama by Yzma (Voiced by Eartha Kitt) with her henchman Kronk (Voiced by Patrick Warburton) must seek help from Pacha (Voiced by John Goodman). What makes the film different from other films of Disney is the fact the film breaks the fourth wall now that is not something you have seen too many times in their films but for the plot it actually works and makes it more funny to. The animation in this film is very well done and the hand drawn animation is very impressive as they timed each scene just right and the character designs are very good in this film as well as superb backgrounds. Also the humor really works for this film and some of the most creative lines ever written came into this movie; The music in the movie set the tone for the film which helps deserve it very well. The voice acting is excellent, Surprising that David hasn't done many animation films because he did a very good job in this film, John Goodman does a excellent job in this film and help makes his character believable. Eartha's performance was just right for Yzma the main antagonist of the film she really deliver here. Patrick was pretty good as Kronk and he made the character very likable and funny throughout the film. It's a smart choice that they didn't make this into a musical style because it might not had work but nevertheless the film does well on it own. The film has some of the most entertaining scenes ever and will make you laugh. Also the film focus more character development and the relationship with the characters you actually can appreciate them and they make the film work very well.

40,vip_ebriega,Boom Baby!,7,18 October 2008,"My Take: A wacky good time for the whole family. By the time the studio neared their heyday (before they start turning real bad), Disney made this hilarious and fast-aced adventure comedy and even took time to parody their own works. THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE is not the best Disney movie, and maybe not even for a long time, but that's alright. It's funny, energetic, colorful and, in some spots, it's actually clever. What more could I ask for? I guess, nothing more. THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE may have not brought out the best Disney can offer, but it still clearly shows their capabilities.One of the best pleasures of GROOVE is the ensemble comedic voice acting. The voice cast, which includes David Spade, Eartha Kitt, Patrick Warburton and John Goodman to list the names at the top-billing, are excellent and never lacking in joy and sharp comedic timing. Their comedic performances are more than enough to sustain adult attention, but not without letting the young 'uns down. If you don't find even one of their hilarious mischief at least amusing then you must have your funny bone ripped out of you body and the pain is excruciating. the entire film may not have been a comedic gold mine, but it comes close to rival any non-animated movie above a G-rating. In fact, I say it might put a few others to shame.Spade lends his outrageous voice talents to the spoiled Emperor Kuzco, who is used to his life of royalty (in Kuzco's term, ""Everyone is under my command"") since birth (in one hilarious scene, Baby Kuzco accidentally beheads his stuffed toy and soon a large number of hands reach out to him, each with a stuffed toy to give away). See, Kuzco wants to destroy a peasant village set upon a scenic hilltop so he can build his summer getaway home (Complete with water slide!). Despite the lead peasant Pacha's (voiced by John Goodman) attempt to halt construction, Kuzco does get everything he wants, right? So he thinks. After being fired by spoiled brat of an emperor, his ""loyal"" adviser Yzma (voiced with great presence by Eartha Kitt), which I may describe as a cross between Cruella DeVille and... well, Eartha Kitt, wants to get even with him. While hitting stone head replicas of him doesn't satisfy, Yzma plots instead to poison the emperor. But her plans failed, mainly due to the complete incompetence of her bumbling right-hand man Kronk (the hilarious Patrick Warburton lends his voice). Instead of a dead emperor, they just have one badly turned into a talking llama. Assisted by Pacha, Kuzco (the llama) tries to get back to the palace and change him back to human.True, some jokes falter and the story isn't first-class Disney story-telling, but I wasn't exactly looking for a smart straightforward Disney effort when the first frame appears before my face. The movie had me from the first frame and again, and again, and again later on. One of the main reasons this movie worked for me was that it packs one frame after another with enough juice to make us wait for the other. The movie is one funny moment followed by another, that's both for the young and old audiences. While kids will enjoy the silly humor and energy-packed madness, adults will find the talented voice cast and the smarter humor a real pleasure. Either way, THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE delivers what's coming to you.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",The Emperor's New Groove
41,educallejero,One of the funnier Disney movies,10,26 November 2019,"The start is a bit strange, with a really unlikeable protagonist (with the magnificient David Spade interpretation), a particularly original visual design and the inclusion of flashbacks, with the lead remembering how he ended up in the situation that he starts with, also unusual. But the movie gets progressively better and funnier, and when it gets to the half (or start of the third act), everything break loose into a wild, ridiculous and more than anything, impossibly fun half/ending. The jokes are for kids, for adults, fourth wall breaking, and meanwhile we get more and more heartfelt moments, creating an uplifting good story without the need of forced monologues or melodramatics musicals.One last thing: Besides the great Spade, Patrick Warburton as Kronk and Eartha Kitt as Yzma gave a lot of soul to their comedic lines with their acting and voices.

42,phubbs,The Emperor's New Groove,8,3 February 2014,"Based very very loosely on the Hans Christian Andersen tale (by the title only really, almost), this Disney flick came outta nowhere at the start of the new decade. At first appearances it didn't look or sound too good either truth be told. A weird title, David Spade in a Disney animation? offbeat looking animation and a wacky spoof-like approach, not exactly the stuffy classical Disney you'd expect.So yes this is a bold move away from the traditional cuddly Disney we all know of. The first thing you notice is the lack of musical numbers (thank God!), there are none I do believe, none whatsoever, and its quite refreshing giving more time for fun and story. The other thing that hits you is the change in pace animation and artistic style wise, no more Disney eyes folks. This film has a very vibrant zany blend of styles which sees a bit of old style Disney in characters, countryside and native dwellings, mixed with some cool straight symmetrically geometric shaped artwork for the royal Peruvian temples within the royal city. The visuals are glorious as usual with the Peruvian countryside and jungles looking lush and green with rolling hills, deep valleys and blue waters. On the flip side the royal palaces and temples are adorned with beautiful symmetric carvings in the walls, massive angular sculptures and lots of uniform guards. The palace tends to be more golds reds and yellows at first but when 'Yzma' takes over everything goes purple and blue. I especially liked the neon flurry of purples, pinks and blues down in the laboratory, that was a bizarre inclusion out of the blue (no pun intended).As said I couldn't see satirical smartass David Spade in a Disney animation, not by a long shot, but blow me down he actually does a good job with his whiny voice. He is perfect as the spoilt Emperor 'Kuzco' (word play on Cusco in Peru) and actually fits the llama character even better. All the main voice actors in the main roles are really good actually, my favourite easily being Warburton as 'Kronk', that guys voice is just funny...it just is!, his character is brilliantly matched to him also. Same can be said for Kitt as Yzma who was clearly designed around her. Believe it or not but there are only four main characters in the entire film! yep just four, but you don't even notice it.The film is pretty quick to the chase really, not overly long and not overly complicated, but it is quite original in a way. The action can be crazy and over the top feeling more like a weekend cartoon rather than an uncle Walt flick but its thoroughly enjoyable at every turn. My only quibble would be the fact it feels stretched out quite badly, the plot clearly isn't enough to cover a proper run time and you can tell. The whole film could of ended after about 30mins really, both of the two main characters never really feel as if they're that far from the royal city/palace. Oh and 'Pacha's' sweet adoring family make you wanna gag...but that's about it.Certainly a shocker this one, didn't think it would be any good and yet it turns out to be one of the best Disney adventures I've seen for a long long time. The colourful visuals, quirky unconventional (for Disney) artistic style, brisk pace and amusing llama characterisation by Spade are all winners in my book, plus there isn't too much schmaltz. But boy you better believe by the end Kuzco has learnt his lesson in humility and how to be a nice guy and not just thinking about himself all the time. Yeah there's always a good moral in every Disney flick, can't escape em.8/10",The Emperor's New Groove
43,jluis1984,Terrific comedy!,8,21 July 2006,"""The Emperor's New Groove"" is a bit different to what Disney had accustomed us so far; well, to tell it is a lot different to that, in fact, it could be said that this animated film is closer to the crazy and brilliant minds of Tex Avery and Chuck Jones than to the classic Disney animated features. Long gone are the musical numbers and the fairy tales, gone are the beautiful heroines and the malevolent villains; this little film is a breath of fresh air that takes Disney to the unexplored terrain of satire, parody and irreverent comedy. And the trip is well worth.The movie is about the young and arrogant Kuzco (David Spade), the Emperor of an Incan nation who enjoys his life of pleasure and comfort without caring too much for his people. Until one night, his second in command, Yzma (Eartha Kitt) betrays him and tries to poison him. Fortunately, the formula only converts Kuzco into a talking llama, however, with him in that form Yzma is able to usurp the power and gets rid of Kuzco. Now, the young Emperor will have to learn to live in a world harsher than what he knew and try to recover his throne.Well, while the plot outline sounds like another one of Disney's dramatic epic adventures, this movie has indeed a new groove. History says, that the film was actually going to go that way but director Mark Dindal and writers Chris Williams and David Reynolds took the story in a completely new direction, making a feature unlike any of the rest of Disney's classics. The film is packed with a very clever sense of humor that can be understood in many levels; it is not only mere slapstick, it goes beyond and as written above, has more in common with the Warner Bros. animations of Chuck Jones' days. The characters are perfectly well-designed and are definitely the soul of the film.However, the departure in content does not mean that the rest has changed. Despite all the apparent irreverence, the movie is suitable for kids and the morals and the message are still there, it's just that the package is now more entertaining than before. The animation technique still has Disney's top notch quality and the beautiful Inca-inspired designs give the film a fresh new look. The tone and mood of the story allows the film to explore many things that Disney had never tried and overall is a new modernization to their style.The cast is amazing and responsible of most of the success of the film. David Spade is brilliant as Kuzco and his domain of the character is total. It's hard to imagine someone else doing the voice. John Goodman plays Pacha, the only man who believes the talking llama is actually Kuzco, and his performance is very good. However, Eartha Kitt as Yzma and Patrick Warburton as her sidekick Kronk steal the show. If Spade and Goodman are brilliant then Kitt and Warburton are simply perfect.The film is definitely among the funniest films ever done by Disney and it is almost flawless. Even when it uses some pop culture references the film doesn't feel dated or silly thanks to the very subtle way that kind of humor is used. Still, the movie has been attacked for deviating from the classic Disney film and while the criticism has some good points (the film's simplicity for example), it still is a memorable and effective film that delivers lots of laughs and pure entertainment.""The Emperor's New Groove"" may not be a landmark of animation such as ""Beauty and the Beast"", but personally I think it represents a breath of fresh air for Disney and one of the most funny animated films ever done. While it is understandable that not everyone will catch the film's humor, this personal favorite is a very recommended film. 9/10",The Emperor's New Groove
44,stamper,Worst animated Disney feature since A bug's Life,7,18 November 2001,"I was strangely enough not too impressed by Disney's hit A Bug's Life and I must honestly say I preferred watching AntZ by DreamWorks. With this film Disney has his new rock bottom' for me, after such great animated flicks as Tarzan, Toy Story 2 and Dinosaur. Of course I do not mean rock bottom in a Mission of Mars kind of way. I just mean to say that this film shows that there are certain Disney movies that seem to be inferior to the rest. Like A Bug's Life, this is one of the few animated theatrical releases by Disney in the years since Aladdin, that doesn't breathe fun and excitement. I think that is mainly, because one has to try very hard liking the main character and because the story is not too good (emotion, action, comedy or romantic wise) as were all the other Disney animated features. I mean Hercules was not as epic as I wished but Pain & Panic surely made up for that, but in this film I just missed that kind of characters. This does not mean though, that The Emperor's New Groove stunk. It was just not Disney GOOD.

45,Animany94,"Maybe not a Disney classic, but a hilarious original worth your time.",8,1 November 2017,"The Emperor's New Groove is enjoyable with plenty of laughs provided mainly by our villainess, Yzma, and her dim-witted sidekick, Kronk. The comedy is also the movie's biggest strength along with its vocal cast. David Spade as emperor Kuzco gives this self-absorbed and bratty character a weird likability which is admirable. John Goodman as the peasant Pacha is pretty much your average John Goodman role, but he does that well. They are also good for some great laughs when they are together. As I mentioned at first, Yzma and Kronk are simply hilarious. I slapped my thigh several times watching them. Eartha Kid and Patrick Warburton both do excellent voice-work. Aside from the comedic proficiency I find it pretty average. The animation looks a lot like a Saturday afternoon show, but still better than the later 2D abomination of ""Home On The Range"" (2004). The setting of the story is pretty original, but the story itself is kind of recycled, not bad, just an average ""egotistical-asshole- learns-how-to-be-nice-to-others"" story. But what the hell.

46,vostf,Action and weak characters,5,29 April 2001,"I'm not a fan of Disney's and I do not think this one is a major picture. Emperor Kuzco switches from selfish disdain to a more friendly position in a wink. Pacha is a dull peasant standing for morals as the perfect American father (and quite henpecked too). Yzma is ugly but not so powerful a villain. Thinking that Disney's are for under 12, I can't see the point for children in watching a picture where good and evil are so weakly depicted. Anyway the storyline is stronger for everything coming to action. But it's an usual trap to focus on action and hang loose on characterization.

It features an all-star voice cast including David Spade, John Goodman, Patrick Warburton, and the late Eartha Kitt.

This launched enough audience interest to convince Disney to make a direct- to-DVD sequel and a television show.There's some great humor found in ""The Emperor's New Groove."" Of course, we get David Spade's sarcasm and wit. Patrick Warburton keeps audiences laughing in delight as he plays the ""no brains - all brawn"" henchman of Yzma named Kronk. It also helps that the movie isn't a musical. There's some musical numbers, but the character's don't stop dead in their tracks and start bellowing out a song every five minutes like many of the classic Disney films.""The Emperor's New Groove"" is a great tool to help teach children the importance of thinking about how your actions affect others.

53,elicopperman,Arguably Disney's Funniest Movie Ever Made,9,3 July 2018,"This film remains one of Disney's biggest cult films to date, mainly for its fast paced slapstick humor, exaggerated animation, and lovable characters. Yet as celebrated as this movie is, there's also somewhat of a dark side to it, mainly due to its infamous troubled production. It was originally entitled Kingdom of the Sun, and it had an almost completely different narrative in mind. It was supposed to be an Incan retelling of The Prince & the Pauper and it even had a different crew on board, but due to countless of story problems and executive meddling, the original director Roger Allers and many others left the project and it was retooled by Mark Dindal and an almost completely new crew in less than two years. You'd think a movie out of such a nightmarish production would end up mediocre at best, but this particular movie is far from that, as it could make even the most tired person energetic and excited for how zany it is.Still set in the Incan era, an arrogant young emperor named Kuzco is transformed into a llama by his former advisor Yzma, who also gets rid of him. Upon encountering a village leader named Pacha, Kuzco trusts him to take him back to the palace and change him back into a human. From a narrative standpoint, the story is rather predictable, as it's the typical road trip buddy movie where the two main leads go through many trials and tribulations before trusting each other. However, what makes up for the weak storyline is the humor, characters and even the heart. Considering that Mark Dindal had previously directed Cats Don't Dance, the film pays a huge homage to the original Looney Tunes and the cartoons by Tex Avery. There's lots of fourth wall breaks, slapstick stunts, witty banter, fast-paced visual gags, exaggerated facial expressions, funny line deliveries, and even some jokes that will fly over kid's heads. It's no wonder you still hear people quoting lines like, ""demon llama"" or ""RIIIIIIIIGHT"".In addition, the characters are also enjoyable enough to warrant a watch. While Kuzco does start off rather callous, he does gravitate more towards Pacha and the people below him upon realizing that the world is much more than his arrogant self could have ever imagined. Although even at that, his selfish attitude is so delightfully narcissistic that he's hard not to giggle at, as he's like that kind of self centered dork you just love to hate. As for Pacha, he's the kind hearted and compassionate village man who despite going through Kuzco's ego, still sees the good in him and the tender moments he shares with the young emperor really display a lot of genuine heart, making it impossible to dislike him. However, the true standouts are Yzma and her bumbling assistant Kronk, as they provide the best laughs in the whole film and Eartha Kitt and Patrick Warburton really bring the two to life with their charisma and contrasting personalities. I won't talk about the rest as they're not as important to the narrative, aside from Pacha's subtly eccentric family, but all of the characters are humorous nonetheless.Finally, as stated before, the influence on Looney Tunes and Tom & Jerry is shown right on screen, especially with the character animation. While not all the characters move in a very dynamic and magnified fashion, the ones that do could make one crack up even with the tiniest of gestures. The character designs even emulate the Disney style to more of a Tex Avery format, especially when it comes to the visual gags that move at a cheetah's pace without feeling overbearing. One particular visual joke when Yzma and Kronk are chasing after Kuzco and Pacha to the palace is so subversive that it's hard to believe such a gag could ever come from the House of Mouse. While the backgrounds are fine but nothing too noteworthy, the effects animation is quite colorful (although not overly saturated) and filled with highly creative lights and shadows that really make them pop on screen. While Aladdin and Hercules may be the two other animated Disney ventures that come closest to matching the tone and style of classic cartoons, I think this film takes the cake and swallows it whole.Needless to say, The Emperor's New Groove practically re-writes the rules of what Disney animated films should do, mainly by being a highly entertaining slapstick buddy comedy rather than a classic story being adapted into a massive musical. Around this time, the studio would end up having its fair share of hits and misses, but this is one of the hits in terms of the company leading itself into experimental directions. They say animated movies should only aim for more challenging themes and epic scopes, but that doesn't mean we can't have a zany cartoony comedy like this every now and then. It's almost been 20 years since this film came out, and while it's hard to determine whether or not Kingdom of the Sun would have been better or not, at least we got something fresh and unique out of the Disney cannon that will still be beloved for many years to come.",The Emperor's New Groove
54,Rickting,Light hearted Disney fun,7,19 July 2015,"In The Emperor's New Groove, an emperor is turned into a llama by his evil ex administrator and works with a llama herder to get his throne back. Certainly not the most ambitious or sophisticated of animated films, TENG is a light heated buddy comedy which runs on comic gags and energetic jokes. In terms of entertainment level it hits the mark. The animation looks good and visually the film works well, but what makes it work is the humour. The film often resembles an automatic joke dispenser as the inventive, witty and biting gags never stop flowing and the film maintains a very good pace throughout. 90 minutes was definitely the right length for the movie and it manages not to run out of steam. Another fun thing about the film is how it is timeless since it's set in the past but features many modern elements. The script oozes with laughs and is amusingly meta, with the emperor providing some amusing narration throughout the film.There are problems with TENG though. The buddy relationship at the centre of the film is cliché, predictable and rushed, while the emperor himself is a pretty unlikable character. There are dips here and there, the consistently zany and funny atmosphere means tension falls by the wayside. Ultimately, this is never more than light entertainment although that isn't ultimately a problem even if it means you're unlikely to remember the film as much as some other Disney movies. With it's entertainingly over the top set pieces and fittingly silly tone, this will entertain many kids and some but not all of the adults. Disney just strip the story down to the comedy and entertainment here and it mostly works. An entertaining movie for the whole family to watch together, TENG hits the comedy notes with skill and is a good time. It's not a lot more than that but it is a jolly good time.7/10",The Emperor's New Groove

And as I watched kids tugging their parents' arms -- parents whose attitudes seemed not too detache",8,20 June 2002,"Another Disney movie, another cartoon... just how good was this going to be? While I enjoyed The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin, the idea of a completely made-up story starring a hit-or-miss David Spade didn't appeal too much to me. But as it turns out -- and MUCH to my delight -- I think I may have found, if nothing else, one of the single funniest movies out there -- no joke! Read ahead, and I'll explain the method to my madness. Emperor Kuzco (Spade) is a spoiled-rotten, overgrown brat of a dictator who has everything he could ever want and everyone at his beck and call. But there are those bent on thwarting his lap-o'-luxury lifestyle -- in particular, Yzma and her no-brain-all-brawn servant, Kronk. Yzma and Kronk conspire to poison Kuzco and take over the empire, but their plan slightly backfires when the diluted poison merely changes Kuzco into a llama (not exactly ""dead"", but then I don't know how being a llama feels). Kuzco is thrown out of the city, befriends a not-too-trusting peasant named Pacha (John Goodman) -- himself a victim of the former Emperor Kuzco's plans for a summer house (complete with waterslide) where Pacha's home stands -- and with a little help, attempts to change himself back into human form and regain his throne. New Groove, I'm convinced, is only a Disney movie in name. It comes off, more times than not, like an extended episode of the WB's Animaniacs -- but this is a good thing. Spade, drenched with sarcasm, delivers an oft-times hysterical performance; Kitt should have done this voice-over gig a long, long time ago in a role that I doubt few could have fulfilled as perfectly as she did; Goodman is much more subdued as Pacha, but it makes for a nice balance with Spade; even Wendie Malick as Pacha's wife, Chicha, gets into the fun with a few zingers herself. But... the real star here, in a part absolutely tailor-made for him, is Warburton. In a role that could have been just another henchman, Warburton transforms Kronk into the ultimate object of clueless likeability (a la David Puddy -- Elaine's on-again-off-again boyfriend on Seinfeld). Some of the funniest scenes -- and I was practically doubled-over at times -- are Kronk's arguments with his alter egos, the classic angel/devil shoulder buddies. Warburton puts a whole new spin on the ""act"". And this is not a plug for Disney, but please do make the effort to see this movie. While it probably won't go down as a ""classic"", it's sure to tickle even the most hard to find funny bones. Oh... and did I mention that the kids will have a lot of fun, too?",The Emperor's New Groove
58,DavidSim240183,Finally! Disney embraces the concept of fun,9,30 January 2007,"I'm in that minority that doesn't really enjoy Disney films. I personally think Disney is a dying studio. Its time has long since passed, and now it should make room for other companies. What does it say about Disney when they paid a massive cash settlement to Pixar, a studio renowned for their excellent work, just to get them to stay with them? Disney knows its days are numbered, and are forced to persuade Pixar, their only real source of income, to remain even though Pixar has the creative strength to flex its muscles and stand on its own two feet.Also I think Disney films have grown too sombre and lifeless, and must resort to false sentimentality to provide easy answers. So it was refreshing to come across a film like The Emperor's New Groove. A film that is sufficiently knowing, bouncy, and overall, just plain fun. Its no classic. Disney have produced some good films in the past like Snow White and Beauty and the Beast. And TENG is not on their level. But it is tremendously entertaining. Not to mention imaginative. As well as the fact its got the snappiest music since The Jungle Book.The Emperor's New Groove's storyline is basic, but surprisingly gets a lot of mileage out of its central conceit. Emperor Kuzco (David Spade) is an extremely shallow leader. He even has his own theme song! He thinks nothing of firing his advisers at the drop of a hat. Or bulldozing other people's properties to make way for swimming pools.His chief adviser Yzma (voiced superbly by Eartha Kitt) is one of these plotting opportunists who want to grab power for themselves (they crop up frequently in Disney films!). When Kuzco gets rid of her because she's too old for his tastes, she hatches a plan with her lackey Kronk to poison him. But a mix up in potions leads to Kuzco being turned into a llama. Forced to fend for himself in the jungle, and with the aid of a gentle llama herder Pacha (John Goodman), Kuzco must return to the castle and find the potion that will turn him back into a human, while avoiding Yzma's attempts to finish him off once and for all.TENG is certainly not an ambitious film. There are no world domination schemes or enchanted princesses and heart wrenching love stories. Everything about the film is simply played for knockabout laughs. And what's wrong with that? David Spade plays Kuzco likably. Throwing out dry insults and wry observations, he even injects some sympathy for his situation as well. The animation is not on the par of Aladdin or The Lion King. In fact there is something almost deliberately 2D to the way the film looks. Almost like a throwback to classic animation. But not earlier Disney efforts. More like the animated shorts of Warner Bros/Looney Tunes cartoons.That may be the reason why I like the film so much. I'm a huge fan of Chuck Jones cartoons. Their eye-popping visual lunacy made for great fun rides. And the same type of energy suffuses The Emperor's New Groove. There are set-pieces that wouldn't have looked out of place in a Road Runner cartoon. There's an hilarious scene when Kuzco and Pacha are wedged back to back between a cliff, and climb up with their feet while being menaced by crocodiles, scorpions and bats all at the same time.A great deal of imagination has gone into the comedy. There's a wonderful slapstick lunacy to it all at times. Even screwball comedy. I love the scene when Kuzco and Yzma are both in an Aztec diner. They both enter and exit the kitchen almost instantaneously, missing each other by seconds. It reminded me of a classic episode of Frasier, called The Innkeepers which had a similar situation in a restaurant.There are even moments of meta-fiction, and breaking down the fourth wall. Kuzco sometimes stops the film when he becomes concerned the action is shifting from him. Or when Kronk deconstructs a chase sequence with diagrams, concerning how Yzma caught up to Kuzco somehow. Even though it makes no logical sense. Deliriously screwball humour, like Kuzco the narrator arguing with Kuzco the character. And a manic number of transformations as Kuzco tries out different potions to get back to normal.The cast really is excellent and gives the film a lot of life. As well as Spade, John Goodman invests a great deal of likability into Pacha's character. Eartha Kitt is superb. A nice change that the villain of the piece is not unspeakably evil. Just vain and witty instead. She plays the part of the bitch well. And her comeuppance is wonderful! Patrick Wharbuton's a scene stealer as Kronk. I love his crises of conscience, where his good and bad sides argue with each other. The only complaint with his character was he should have ended up as a chef now that Yzma's out of the picture. Instead he becomes a boy scout leader. A chef would have been more in character.But overall, The Emperor's New Groove is great fun. I really laughed out loud several times throughout. And that's what animation is all about. It even manages to be thoughtful at times without hammering its message home like most Disney films. Highly recommended!",The Emperor's New Groove

60,willcundallreview,A movie full of swinging and falling but also heart,8,23 July 2015,"Rating-8/10The Emperor's New Groove is a Disney animated movie about Kuzco the little emperor of a vast land and his journey when some certain characters turn against him and well, turn him into a llama. It's full of heart this movie but also importantly fun too, sure Kuzco and David Spade who voices him can get annoying but it's really the other characters in this movie you have to love. This is one of the best received Disney films of the early 2000's and no wonder why, it's unique and feels fresh amongst the crowd of Disney made animations.The film goes along at a nice pace, not too fast but not too slow and for it's running time of only 78 minutes, it manages to get in everything it needs. Kuzco as mentioned is our main man and his adventure is pretty fun, add in the stupidly funny character of Kronk(Patrick Warburton), the power mad Yzma(Eartha Kitt) and the humblest of them all, peasant Pacha(John Goodman) and you have yourself one hell of a story. It starts and ends very nicely and could possibly get better and better as it goes on, just good fun and not just for the kids either.I loved the design and animated location of this movie, set in the old style kingdoms of Incan times it just bursts with colour and contains beautifully created sets and really can at times make you admire it. I think it was a gamble for Disney to go with what they went with though, luckily the story is interesting because if not, the film would be all show and no actual heart to it, but this movie has both in abundance. I said about Kuzco being kind of annoying and I do find David Spade a kind of, little annoyance in this movie, the only member of the cast I disliked really. Although I say what I say, Spade is still not bad and it would be too mean of me to criticise how he sounds, it's Kuzco himself who is big headed but I do think where he lies best is when he is in scenes with Pacha and John Goodman's booming but also kind of calm voice. You'll come to like certain characters but for me Kronk is by far the highlight, very dumb but hilarious and because of it he provides the majority if not nearly all laughs, a well placed move from Disney.Mark Dindal directs OK and David Reynolds writes at the same level, Dindal works best in the more action packed moments full of running and swinging and the such where as Reynolds only really works well in the funniest of moments and especially with good old Kronk. I felt this movie had a surprising amount of depth to it, even at times powerful emotion, Pacha the kind peasant is a beautifully created character and provides the complete opposite kind of outlook than that of Kuzco, again a well played move from the people behind this but also that this film is more than comedy. I think the Emperors New Groove is a fine movie and one I couldn't recommend more, and that's to adults and children as this movie is not so childish and actually can be funny. Sweet short and a lovely little tale, this is one film I can see many who haven't already seen it liking and maybe who knows, loving it.",The Emperor's New Groove

62,diac228,"It's not groundbreaking or fantastic animation like Pixar, but it more than gets the job done",10,5 January 2007,"What film is one part insane, one part extremely fast-paced, and overall a movie that breaks down the fourth wall so many times you are almost involved in the film itself? Well, there are multiple answers, but if there is one film that fits this description, it's The Emperor's New Groove. With stellar voice work, pacing that is faster than most films within the past decade, and also containing a dose of silliness that just doesn't happen in enough films, this Disney animated flick stands as the best amongst the animated Disney films (excluding Pixar) within the past three decades and easily the most underrated. While we see Stitch everywhere, the furious campaign behind Chicken Little, and the attempt to make a worldwide smash out of Dinosaur, Disney seemed to have little support towards this little flick. Nonetheless, this is the little film that could; as it defied lower-budgeted animation, defied a song listing, and delivered some of the funniest moments and one-liners in animated history. It also managed to destroy the long-running Seinfeld curse, as it made Patrick Warburton a solidified voice-acting star. Most amazing, David Spade was actually quite funny without the assistance of Chris Farley. The Emperor's New Groove follows a bratty prince by the name of Kuzco (David Spade) that lives without a care in the world as everyone caters to his every whim without question. When he fires his adviser though, things get interesting as Yzma (Eartha Kitt) and her dumb yet reliable assistant Kronk attempt to kill him, only to instead turn him into a llama. After the mishap, Kuzko needs to actually rely on someone other than himself (Pancha, voiced by John Goodman) to regain his position at the throne and stop Yzma. Easier said than done, as Kuzco must change his ways in order to succeed. Lilo and Stitch is not the black sheep of Disney films like advertised, its this one. With only one song, lack of detailed animation, total rundown of the fourth wall, and also a defiance of a plot without its holes, The Emperor's New Groove relies on quick, witty humor and its lively animation to keep the kids and adults entertained. To add to that, this is the first Disney film in ages to contain some true character development, as we see Kuzco slowly rise from a selfish brat into a likable character as he spends more time becoming a llama. Partly written and directed by Mark Dindal, his fast-paced animation and action techniques were perfected here after the underrated flop Cats Don't Dance years before. The voice acting is what carries this film from decent to beyond superb. From the zany and quick-witted David Spade, to the veteran John Goodman, to the funny and lively talents of Eartha Kitt and Patrick Warburton, those four ran the film with excellent one-liners, funny moments, and a chemistry that is very rare amongst animated films. Easily some of the best voice work in any animated film, as long as one of the four was at the screen talking, the laughs would just continue rolling in. We even have the late veteran John Fiedler lending his voice in a hysterical cameo. Easily quotable movie, and that is always a plus. One can say that this has a sort of Frat Pack comedic-like quality to it, as it doesn't rely on a deep story with morals, but instead on humorous situations and quirky lines to convince the viewer to watch again and again. Bottom Line: Among the best non-Pixar animated films within the past two decades, Emperor's New Groove is a fresh new look at the way Disney films are made. No longer do we have a romance story, no longer do we have a Disney princess in distress, we have a great cast of lovable characters in an environment that even gets the viewers involved. With a zany plot, clever one-liners, a lot of visual humor and a running time that never actually drags, there is really nothing really wrong with this movie. David Spade's last funny movie, the destruction of the Senfeld curse, and also the revival of Eartha Kitt's career can be found here. Watch it, no matter how old you are and what kinds of films you enjoy. Anyone that doesn't get a kick out of this one just doesn't have a sense of humor. 10/10",The Emperor's New Groove

65,SonicStuart,One of the most hilarious Disney movies!,10,12 February 2004,"The Emperor's New GrooveVoices of David Spade, John Goodman, Wendie Malick, Eartha Kitt and Patrick WarburtonGenre: Animation/Family/ComedyRated: GThis is one of my most favorite animated Disney movies yet! The jokes were very funny! The movie is about a young emperor named Kuzco (voiced by David Spade) who is the big time ruler of the land and then one day when he catches Yzma (voiced by Eartha Kitt) sitting in his throne he fires her.So now Yzma is wanting to get revenge on Kuzco, along with Yzma's big and funny sidekick, Kronk (Warburton). So Yzma decides to make a poison for Kuzco and then when they give him the poison, she and Kronk find out it was llama potion! So then Kuzco gets turned into a llama and then later meets up with Pacha (John Goodman), who then helps him back to get back to his palace so he can get changed back. But Pacha and Kuzco didn't really see each other closely at first. Meaning they didn't get of on the right foot.So when Yzma finds out Kuzco is still alive, she and her sidekick, Kronk go of to find them. My most favorite part was when Kuzco gets chased by panthers and then Pacha saves him and then they get wrapped on a tree and then Pacha saids ""Don't worry were safe"", and then the tree breaks and then when they land in the water Kuzco saids ""Don't tell me we are about to go down a big waterfall right?"" ""Yep"" ""Sharp rocks at the bottom?"" ""Most likely"" ""Bring it on!"" The movie has good moral to it. The moral of the story is working together and friendship. This is a movie I would highly recommend!",The Emperor's New Groove
66,TheHonestCritic,Does this movie still manage to put me in a good groove? Check out my review below!,10,28 February 2021,"""The Emperor's New Groove"" (2000), when I was a child, I heard the constant ads and commercials about this film. I debated whether I wanted to go see it in the movie theater or not. In the end, I didn't go into the theater to watch it. Then, during my birthday the following year, one of my friends gave me a video tape of it as a present (oh, the old-school days of VHS and VCR!) I watched it, and I loved it right away! From there, I couldn't stop watching it. Thinking about it during this day, I could kick myself for not going to see it in a theater. This is one of those movies that would have been a lot of fun to watch on the big screen! Still, if it wasn't for my friend, I probably wouldn't have seen how good this film was. It has an exciting and funny storyline, fantastic voice acting, beautiful animation and a phenomenal soundtrack. The plot is, an egotistical emperor named Kuzco, who is the leader of the Inca kingdom, punishes anyone who throws off his groove. He soon drinks a potion (originally meant to be poison) that turns him into a llama! From there, Yzma, his advisor, tries to get rid of him and take over as empress. Now, to some, it sounds like your average everyday adventure story where the greedy one learns life lessons and grows up in the end. Yes, it is that, but it's expressed in such a fun and unique way where it's completely fresh and original. The story keeps you invested all the way from beginning to end, every joke hits bullseye and you have a blast while watching it. This film takes every advantage possible and has fun with each of them. It keeps you invested and laughing all the way through, which is what a perfect animated movie should do. Props to the writers! The voice acting is nothing short of top-notch. David Spade is perfect as Kuzco, John Goodman is fantastic as Pacha, Eartha Kitt is very funny and perfectly sinister as Yzma, Patrick Warburton is hilarious as Kronk, etc. Every performance is hit right out of the ballpark and they really nail their respectable characters! The animation is very well-done and has aged well to this day. I, myself, prefer 2D animated movies and shows over 3D ones any day! Finally, the soundtrack is phenomenal and it sets the perfect tone for the story. It's fun, exciting yet comedic which is what helps tie it all together. Props to you, John Debney. You have composed a brilliant film score! ""The Emperor's New Groove"" is an animated marvel. I can watch this movie over and over again and never be bored with it. Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""The Emperor's New Groove"", what are you waiting for? Go watch it! As much as I enjoyed it as a kid, I think I love it more as an adult. That's right, no matter how old you are, it's a perfect film for all ages. It will definitely improve your groove. Go and see it today, or else Yzma might turn you into a llama!",The Emperor's New Groove

Many times the animation borders on the psychedelic, while returning again to the standard Disney cartoon world.I watched this when I was sick as my cure for most of my friends is to cook them a nice vegetable soup and bring them a Disney cartoon.

70,Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,Great one,7,20 June 2008,"Originally developed as an epic called Kingdom of the Sun, The Emperor's New Groove lost scale and most of Sting's song score (some of which can be heard on the soundtrack) on its way to the screen. The end result is the lightest Disney film in many a moon, a joyous romp akin to Aladdin in its quotient of laughs for kids and adults. The original story centers on the spoiled teenage emperor Kuzco (David Spade), who enjoys getting the best of his Aztecan subjects. When he fires Yzma (Eartha Kitt), his evil sorceress, she seeks revenge and turns Kuzco into a llama with the help of her hunk of the month, a Link named Kronk (Patrick Warburton). Alone in the jungle, the talking llama is befriended by Pacha (John Goodman), who has just been told to vacate his pastoral home by the human Kuzco. What's an ego to do? That's pretty much the story and the characters--simple, direct, fun--a Disney film on a diet. For any fan of the acidic humor of Spade, this is essential viewing. As narrator of his tale, Kuzco uses a sarcastic tone to keep the story jumping with plenty of fun asides (he even ""stops"" the film at one point to make sure you know the story is about him). Even better is character actor Warburton (Elaine's stuck-up boyfriend on Seinfeld), who steals every scene as the dim-witted, but oh-so-likable Kronk. There's even a delicious Tom Jones number that starts the film off with a bang.",The Emperor's New Groove
71,luke-a-mcgowan,"Very kid-friendly and pretty good fun, but its a weak entry from Disney",6,8 April 2015,"Often there are those kids movies you love and when you rewatch when you're a grown up you discover a lot more about why you loved them. Shrek has its Lord Faarquad, Toy Story 2 has Buzz's wings ejecting, and The Emperor's New Groove has...well, a llama voiced by David Spade strutting around being David Spade. Maybe this isn't one of those.But it would be unfair to judge a kid's film on its appeal to adults. The story is still fun, there are a smattering of jokes (definitely ones that will appeal to kids - talking animals, slapstick and goofy Kronk being goofy), and is full of colour. The film's highlights include the voice acting of Patrick Warburton and John Goodman (both voice-acting staples) and also Eartha Kitt's villain, who is memorable even though she could easily pass for Cruella de Ville. Towards the end of the film, there are a couple of fourth wall breaks that make for a good chuckle as well.As for flaws, well Kuzco undergoes a remarkable transformation in a remarkably short and convenient amount of time. David Spade is neurotic and I cannot bear him, even just as a voice actor I know he's there. And ultimately, Emperor's New Groove can't help but feel like a shallow Disney effort.Its still an easy, fun watch, but its a more inferior Disney film and you'll get far more enjoyment from watching the superior aforementioned Shrek and Toy Story 2.",The Emperor's New Groove

In doing away with the ""cuteness"" and message so often found in Disney movies, the creators of ""The Emperor's New Groove"" have made a truly funny and fast-paced little flick, which is fondly reminiscent of the Looney Tunes cartoons of days long past. I'd say it's not so good as Shrek (which of course has superior technology), but it comes pretty close, and that's without having to resort to spoofing others.A pleasant and very likeable movie. *** out of **** stars",The Emperor's New Groove
75,Hallelujah289,Delightful,9,21 September 2018,"Found myself laughing out loud today seeing some of the sight gags of this film including Esme's laughably low boobs. Who did that? It's genious. ""Scary beyond all reason."" Ha! Cracks me up. This movie has such a great character mix and I love the heroes and the villains alike. They're all a bit hapless and each have their moments of treachery which I am very partial to in animated films. I can't stand the overly saccharine and I do love me some salt and spice. However saying this I agree the humor of this movie never veered into the tasteless or flat. I think beyond all the jokes the main story was endearing, and this was never overshadowed or cheapened by crudity even though there were places where it could have been. To get to the main story, yes the relationship between King Cusco the talking llama (David Spade) and his accidental farmer guide (John Goodman) was believable in the way they bonded and weaved between trusting and untrusting behaviors. I rather could see several of my own relationships in the kind of arc that this one went through in this film, and I could recognize several points of commonality, from the distance to the reluctant acceptance to the loss and rebuilding of promise and trust. Rather remarkable really. I don't doubt you might find something of yourself in these characters too. I'm a fan. You might be able to tell by my high rating: 9/10. This isn't a mistake-I think there are really few films that can make you want to be a little more sociable and neighborly like this one does. King Cusco is clearly selfish but the movie goes to great lengths not to depict him as bad or heartless. He very much earns both his monikers: the movie demonstrates his acts of selfishness and his acts of perhaps something else we might consider good. Even Esme (is that her name) is recognizable in her flamboyance and penchant for ""cruel ironies."" More enjoyable is the farmer guy not averse to a bit of misdirection to save his home. This guy was getting a bit overly sweet for me but I'm glad the filmmakers recognized the deviousness he possessed. It was well done when his expression changed from increasingly frustrated to forcibly calm in an instant. I like the shades of character they could paint him in. I consider this film a gem-it does actually convince me that the seemingly heartless may not be so. And that's valuable. I couldn't really ask for more in a film.",The Emperor's New Groove
76,Shiva-11,"Hands down, the best family movie this year!",8,18 December 2000,"The Emperor's New Groove: Disney (not counting their Touchstone division) produces two kinds of movies: live family oriented films like ""102 Dalmations"" (although the quality is generally better) and animated musicals a la ""Tarzan"" or ""Aladdin"".  Their most recent offering, though patterned on the latter, lacks the trademark songs and forays into morality, opting instead for an old fashioned cartoon.  A gutsy move indeed.Kuzco is a self centered spoiled brat, but when you're the 18 year old ruler of a South American country, that's not a stretch.  When Kuzco fires Yzma, his ""trusted"" advisor and her behemoth helper Kronk, they decide to do away with him.  Although they bungle the attempt on his life, they do succeed in turning him into a Llama.  More troubling than being turned into a beast of burden is Kuzco's knowledge that he is at the mercy of the very peasant whose land he was about to appropriate for a summer home.  Who ever said life is easy?One of the qualities that I enjoyed most about ""Iron Giant"" was that the characters didn't keep breaking out into song - it's not that I don't enjoy musicals, but they can grow tiresome.  I didn't know what to expect from this movie mainly because I knew they had changed the content several times, probably fearing a repeat of ""Road to El Dorado's"" bad box office. Radically altering the course of a film midstream generally leads to problems (does anyone remember ""Supernova""?), and at the very least, I doubt Sting will ever offer to score another Disney film after they scrapped the bulk of his songs.  Fortunately this break with the Disney convention works.
Although I'm not a huge David Spade fan, the combination of his skewed sarcastic humor and excellent animation is exactly what the emperor-turned- Llama calls for, making Kuzco a character we like, in spite of the fact that he is a shameless cad.  On the other end of the spectrum is Pacha, voiced by Jon Goodman, the kind and caring peasant who is willing to help Kuzco although it may be to his detriment.  Yzma, Kuzco's scheming right hand woman, is brought to life by Eartha Kitt's raspy voice and spot on animation (before you even hear her voice you know who the ""actor"" is), and is positively scary, but in a nice way.  Finally,  Kronk (Puddy from ""Seinfeld"" who incidentally will be starring in a live-action version of ""The Tick"" on FOX) the sidekick wanna-be, is hilarious as the double-digit-IQ-walking-slab-of-muscle more concerned with cooking than killing.The combination of the sixties style animation, solid characters and slapstick style result in a movie that is pure, simple and unmitigated fun.

Oh, yes. I did. Guilty.This is Disney's proof that they can still make an amazingly good movie. I am very surprised, though. I understand that the studio has two animation teams, which work on different Disney projects. One of them is far more powerful than the other, with more resources. If that is true, then Disney should promote the team that created ""Emperor"", because, even tough it looks very cheaply made (when compared to Disney's high standards) it is a very entertaining, very good, very groovy film.It's all about Spade, actually. Reprising his role in ""Tommy Boy"", we see the acidic, sarcastic character. He likes to torture everyone around him. He finds in Pacha his ""Tommy"" (if you haven't seen that film, it is highly recommended), a guy who is noble, likeable and sweet (as a matter of fact, both films are very similar, being ""road trips"" in some sort of sense). He, as you might expect, subjects his partner to all kinds of humiliations, until he learns his moral lesson. Pretty simple stuff, but it is handled with heavy doses of humor everywhere. This film succeeds because everything is funny, lighthearted and uncomplicated. Forget Tarzan's luscious scenery, or Hunchback's feeble attempts at humour launched at a mostly depressing scenario. This film is fast, furious and lighthearted. And musical interludes are kept to a minimum, and when used they are very effective. Yes!I loved it. I can only hope Atlantis will be as good as this one.

Emperor Kuzco (voiced by David Spade, excellent) is a selfish ruler turned into a llama by a former employee after firing her. That's a funny enough concept on its own, but its simply the over-the-top, ridiculous characters that make this as hilarious as it is. Kuzco's overly selfish nature, such as him scribbling out characters on the screen so we can focus on him, is simply hilarious. Yzma (Eartha Kitt) and her assistant Kronk, simply hysterical as a childlike supporting character that steals every scene he is in, are both great. There are just too many laughs in this film to describe in a review, and not a single one of them deserves to be spoiled here. I'll just tell you to see it now.

In The Emperor's New Groove, Disney goes for laughs pretty much on every frame and achieves its goal. This is a fast paced and funny film with a unique animation style and lots and lots of laughs.David Spade pays Kuzco, a bratty spoiled Emperor who thinks he is beloved, but is hated by just about everyone. John Goodman co-stars as Pacha, the lovable peasant who discovers that the Emperor is plotting to destroy his home to build a summer Villa. Kzco is being plotted against by Izma (Eartha Kitt is a bit of genius casting) and her dim-witted sidekick Gronk, whose attempt to poison him turns the Emperor into a Llama.From there, the movie is a buddy adventure as the unlikely pair of Pacha and Kuzco try to find there way back to the palace and restore Kuzco to the throne.The laughs abound. In the movie's best scene, the four leads are all in a restaurant ordering lunch and going unnoticed to eachother. It displays perfect comic timing, and even a very subtle tribute to Five Easy Pieces.
The best thing about this movie is the voice-over work of Patrick Warburton as Gronk. As the loyal and dense side-kick, he plays that standard Disney role of the villain with a conscience, this time, quite literally. Gronk wants to be a servant and a chef, but we also find out he can dance, clean and speak fluent squirrel.This is not Disney's most artistic accomplishment, nor its greatest feat of creativity.

This movie is 78 minutes and has 9 writers. (I'd say the average is 4 to 5 writers.) You can see just how much was cut and recut and changed and removed from what the original story was. But that's a little thing to care about. This movie is fresh, daring, and at times brilliant. (Map lines, I'm looking at you.)I've heard that some people hate the voice casting, but I couldn't love it more. What other movie could have Walter from ""The Big Lebowkski"" and Piglet together in the same scene? David Spade was perfectly snarky and egocentric for Kuzco, Eartha Kitt and Patrick Warburton played off each other marvelously, and even the small roles like the two kids were great. The movie is refreshingly adventurous with its fourth wall breaks and self-referencing.

It did well with most critics and performed sufficiently at the box office. But after seeing it once, I see why this is officially put in the Post-Renaissance period for Disney, which could be argued as a Second Dark Age for Disney at the same time that Pixar was exploding. The animation is nice if not as appealing as Renaissance films, some of the characters can be expected to be likable or the other way around, and it does feature a subtle lesson against selfishness, which still didn't convince me since this is a movie meant for Playhouse Disney (nowadays Disney Junior). I can commend Disney for not going in the crude humor direction like with The Lion King (or Brother Bear and Home on the Range from what I've heard), but none of the jokes were ones that I, a 15 year old, found funny, not even Yzma's attempt at wit (she's supposed to be one of the more comical Disney villains).

At the time I thought Disney was cheap, childish hogwash, but I now realize otherwise.  With Disney's recent stunning works such as Dinosaur, Atlantis, and yes, The Emperor's New Groove, I have a new outlook.David Spade is the perfect voice for Kuzco.  Like Kuzco, the man is pompous and arrogant.  In most of his movies he plays a role such as this.  Kuzco is no different.  The character has a mind of his own, and throughout most of the movie the viewer will be surprised and entertained by his comical witticisms and his I'm-So-Much-Better-Than-You wisecracks.We meet Kuzco, ""King of the World"", according to the Theme Song Guy, as he is at the peak of his kingly career.  Just how he loses that career, is transmogrified into a llama, and put at the bottom of the social structure, is hilariously magnificent.  The conflict is ever so funny, and the climax builds to hysterical, uncontrollable laughing.The movie also contains several different subplots, such as Kronk and his two little supernatural friends and Pacha and Kuzco.  The audience is thrown from conflict to conflict, each containing their own hilarious twists.Disney has put together yet another superbly animated film, and dubbed it with a name like no other and enlisted a cast so brilliant that it's hard to find any flaws with this movie.",The Emperor's New Groove

100,sngbrd39,A new direction for Disney,8,22 June 2001,"Lately, Disney movies have been on a downward path. Personally, I've found the vast majority enjoyable (with the glaring exception of ""Pocahontas""), but there is still a marked decrease in quality between, say, ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""Tarzan"". You could see the movies falling into the same old rut over and over and over again. However, ""Emperor's New Groove"" changed all that. Instead of a contrived love story, there's a buddy comedy featuring the hilarious duo of David Spade and John Goodman. Instead of sappy morals (particularly the sappy morals of being yourself and of finding inner beauty), we get hilarious one-liners and laugh-out-loud situations. And instead of the cute comic sidekick, we get doe-eyed characters (particularly the children and the squirrel) with a significant bite. Needless to say, this one had me in stitches. One part of ""Emperor"" as well as the new Disney trend in general that somewhat saddens me, though, is the move away from the musical format. I know I'm somewhat part of a minority, but I've always loved the songs from Disney movies, even if they do seem intrusive. (Actually, I never thought of them as intrusive, really, but I know many people think that.) Disney hasn't put out an honest to goodness musical in quite a while. Although I do agree that not all Disney movies should be musicals, I also hope that they decide not to abandon the format entirely. Disney movies have recently been pretty much the only place for musicals on the big screen, so I would hope that they would continue to give us the great musical moments we've come to expect. But enough of my editorial. ""Emperor's New Groove"" is one of my favorite Disney movies ever and has surpassed ""Aladdin"" as the funniest Disney movie in my mind. So sit back, relax, and forget anything else Disney's ever done. This, I hope, is a sample of the future.",The Emperor's New Groove

106,Denver53,A grudgingly enjoyable experience,6,27 December 2000,"I gotta say upfront that I despise Disney. Oh, not the Disney of my childhood (20-25 years ago), which brought me fascinating, sometimes cutting edge animation movies such as Jungle Book. No, I mean Michael Eisner's Disney, the soulless marketing machine that has leeched away its creativity in its quest to boost the stock price.So my wife and I attended ""New Groove"" reluctantly, and only because it was the sole movie at the 24-theatre multiplex that was on at the right time and wasn't sold out. I rated it a 6, and have no problem stating that ""New Groove"" is the most original movie from Disney since, perhaps, pre-Little Mermaid days.Good things: Voices (David Spade was perfectly whiney, the guy who played Puddy on Seinfeld was great as the oaf assistant, and Eartha Kitt was a purrrrrfectly evil villian), NO INSIPID SONGS, no cutesy sidekick characters for alleged comic relief, and maybe best of all, NEW GROUND was broken. For once we watched a movie headed into who knows what direction (of sure, the overall plot was predictable, but the details were interesting), and we saw things that were oddly inexplicable but endearing (this emperor like to dance, hence The Groove).Bad things: The inexplicable but endearing stuff was never fully utilized (what, no raves at the palace?), the movie dragged at times during the llama emperor's journey, and, ultimately, you didn't really care about any of these characters. You just wanted to have fun.So a grudging tip of the hat to Disney. Judging from the lack of commercial and marketing support you guys don't know exactly how to present ""New Groove,"" and maybe that is why it is your best animated film in a decade.",The Emperor's New Groove
107,Jeremy Bristol,"One of Disney's worst, or at least the least ambitious.",5,14 June 2001,"Note to Eisner: I, for one, would have liked to have seen a more ambitious animated feature about Incas.  Instead, you give us. . . David Spade?I'm still not sure how you can call this movie a version of The Emperor's New Clothes.  But of course, you wouldn't have the guts to do a true version of that story--some mother somewhere would complain about its immorality and its indecency, and you'd be the laughing stock of the animation world.Wait a minute.  You are already.  (End note).Begin review: One of my biggest problems with this movie is that I can't stand David Spade.  Dana Carvey, a little, but Spade is just so grating to me in everything he does: SNL, Just Shoot Me, his movies with Chris Farley. His delivery is always obvious, usually slapping us over the head with them as if he was wielding a giant tuna.  Here, he's even more obnoxious and flat as a bratty Emperor (where's the royal family?) who wants to build a swimming pool on top of a peasant's (John Goodman) hill but ends up being turned into a llama by a conniving advisor.  Yeah.  A swimming pool on top of a hill in south America hundreds of years ago and a conniving, skull-faced advisor (think Jafar or Skar, only a woman).Spoiler: Spade/Emperor also narrates the story throughout most of the movie, but the narration turns out to be bogus when the llama-fied Emperor suddenly tells the narrator that we (the audience) know what the real story was--the understatement of the millennium, I assure you, since Spade's one-note (over-the-top) narration is obvious before you even see his character as a human.  So all that annoying jibber-jabber turned out to be necessary for that one joke in which the character breaks character to talk to the narrator, who is apparently not the real Emperor or he would've known what the other Emperor was already thinking . . . oh, forget it.  It's a little funny simply because it's not expected, but it's not really original--I think Woody Allen did it a few times, and I know stuff like that happened in Looney Tunes on a regular basis.That's another problem.  The movie seems like an extended Looney Tune, something even Warner Brothers had trouble doing.  Simply put, there are more (and better) jokes in just about any one of the better Bugs Bunny shorts (e.g. What's Opera Doc?, Rabbit of Seville) than there is in Emperor's New Groove.  In fact, the only jokes I laughed out loud with were the repeated ""shoulder angel"" scenes and the reaction the villain and the Emperor have to Cronk talking to his shoulders (but even that was merely a one-step-farther parody of an over-used Looney Tunes gag).This is an annoying change in direction that I hope Disney will not continue--Disney has been far too interested in comedy lately instead of character and story.  Even the old Disney shorts (such as the Sorcerer's Apprentice piece from Fantasia) usually had a certain character depth that Warner Bros. cartoons often lacked (they relied on neat sight gags and movie parodies).Worst of all, the animation is only so-so.  There is absolutely no depth to the world they have created--no interesting ""camera angles"" or neat little touches like animals or insects or shafts of light or anything.  The backgrounds are just there, instead of the characters reacting to the backgrounds as if they're in that world (for examples of location depth, take a look at My Neighbor Totoro, Princess Mononoke, or Bambi).  If I remember right, only a few scenes even shaded the characters according to the background (i.e. darker in forests or in buildings, much brighter when in the sun, spots of light that come in between leaves, etc.).  The characters are animated very smoothly, but occasionally suffer from the previously mentioned Looney Tunes syndrome.Eisner, I've made this plea before: please making important chases/ decisions/growth spurts/training sequences into quick-cut musical montages. There is nothing that takes me out of a movie quicker, and there's no excuse for doing so in animation.Seriously, man, this is sillier than Oliver and Company.",The Emperor's New Groove
108,MadReviewer,Monty Python Meets Walt Disney,8,17 May 2001,"The recent spate of animated films from Disney, beginning with `The Little Mermaid', have become the modern-day versions of the Hollywood musical. These Disney films, while sweet, are more or less formulaic in nature - they feature a plucky young hero (usually a heroine), a love interest, a wacky sidekick, and a good half-dozen or so schmaltzy songs from the likes of Elton John or Phil Collins.  While there's nothing wrong to this - `Beauty and the Beast' is a phenomenal film, as is `The Lion King' and `Aladdin' - it is a formula, nonetheless, and as such it leads to certain expectations when watching an animated Disney feature.`The Emperor's New Groove' lives up to none of these expectations.  As it turns out, this is a very, very good thing.  Despite lacking the traditional Disney film structure, `The Emperor's New Groove' is equal parts zany, silly, funny, clever, funny, and witty.  (Did I mention funny?) Apparently, while trying to channel the spirit of Walt Disney for `The Emperor's New Groove', director Mark Dindal and his animation team accidentally channeled the spirit of Tex Avery instead.  The film has a wonderfully absurd sensibility to it, where instead of watering down a simple story to entertain small children, it remains razor sharp, appealing on one level to kids . . . and on a totally different level to adults.  `The Emperor's New Groove', in its own way, is a homage to all those great Warner Brothers of yore created by Michael Maltese and Chuck Jones - as bizarre as it may seem, the classic `Rabbit Season! Duck Season!' cartoon would not be out of place in a film like this.  (Also, there is a squirrel in this film that seems to have literally wandered in from a Droopy Dog cartoon; it certainly possesses the wicked self-awareness of a Tex Avery character).Eschewing the idea that a hero must be likable, `The Emperor's New Groove' focuses, quite naturally, on the Emperor Kuzco (voiced by David Spade), the supreme ruler over a long-ago kingdom (presumably part of the Incan Empire, although that's never clearly stated).  Kuzco, who, much like Spade himself, is sarcasm incarnate, succeeds in annoying two important characters in the first few minutes of the film.  The first is the peasant Pacha (voiced by John Goodman), who is informed by Kuzco that his family's small house is to be demolished so that a pleasure palace called `Kuzcotopia' call be built in its place.  The second is Kuzco's treacherous advisor/sorceress Yzma (voiced by Eartha Kitt), who is pleasantly informed by Kuzco that the kingdom is `downsizing' and that her services are no longer needed.   Pacha takes his bad news with stoic, humble grace; but the evil Yzma decides that in order to save her job and become de facto ruler of the kingdom, she must kill Kuzco.  This being a Disney cartoon, she fails miserably in her assassination attempt, but does manage to magically transform Kuzco into a talking llama.  Kuzco the llama, still sarcastic but no longer omnipotent, finds himself cast out into the wilderness of his kingdom . . . and through a strange series of events, suddenly finds himself relying on the kindhearted, humble Pacha for help.The story's simple, but that's okay, since it's merely an excuse to string together a veritable calvacade of jokes, ranging from broad slapstick to rapier-sharp verbal wit.  The film never overtly tries to tug at the heartstrings of the audience - instead, it usually goes for the quick wisecrack or the funny sight gag, and if a few heartstrings are pulled in the process, well, that's just fine. ""The Emperor's New Groove"" is almost Disney with an attitude, except the attitude is hip, not smug.The jokes - and the film - are amazingly funny, and a large part of this success should be credited to the characters, and to the talented actors who voice them.  By far, the best character in the film is Yzma's dimwitted henchman Kronk (voiced by Patrick Warburton), an affable thug who simply seems too stupid to be evil.  In his first few scenes, Kronk starts out as the typical Disney muscle-bound villain - thickheaded and prone to violence - but the villainy of Kronk slowly fades away as the film progresses, revealing a bizarrely hilarious character with Monty Python sensibilities. Kronk still dutifully follows the wicked Yzma's orders - to a point - but often performs such orders after setting his own priorities in order, such as baking spinach cheese balls or playing double dutch with kids.  It's loopy, but it works, and Kronk really is the lynchpin to this film's humor. John Goodman is also good as Pacha - he lends the film a certain amount of dignity, which is sorely needed, since the Emperor Kuzco isn't exactly a heroic figure.  He also gives the film a subtler layer of humor, as he quietly delivers some funny lines that can go unnoticed if you aren't paying strict attention to the film.  Eartha Kitt is absolutely delicious as the sorceress Yzma.  He plays her part as the ultimate spoiled diva; her character is a tightly wound emotional wreck, reacting to everything in such a sheer over-the-top fashion that it's pure comedy genius.  Ironically, the weakest character may be the Emperor himself - as Kuzco, David Spade and his acid wit are very funny at times, but the character remains abrasive for far too long.  He's almost too much to take at times, especially for kids - and face it; kids will be watching this film.  Toning Spade down a notch or two might have helped to smooth out the film and to make it better overall.Smart, hip, and daring to push the Disney envelope, `The Emperor's New Groove' is an outstanding film.  Adults will love it.  Kids might not get all the jokes, but they'll love it too - after all, `The Emperor's New Groove' is really just part of a zany cartoon tradition that kids have loved for a long, long time.  Just think of Bugs Bunny instead of Mickey Mouse as you put the tape in your VCR, and you and your family should be just fine. It's a very well done film.  Grade: A-",The Emperor's New Groove
109,SebMoz,Comedic gold,9,12 October 2020,"This movie is a comedic classic, there's no other way to say it. Almost very scene is sprouting with energy and humour, even the more quiet ones are still hilarious in their own way. Under the surface however, there's quite a bit of depth present, almost a surprising amount. Kuzco is once of my favorite characters of all time, and he goes through an almost perfectly written arc, from basically a villain to super likable. This is of course achieved through his interactions with Pacha, which are very down to earth and realistic. And of course, we can't talk about this movie without Kronk and Yzma, quite possibly some of the best side characters in any Disney film. Kronk is such a likable guy and super funny, while Yzma has a very entertaining obsession with getting rid of Kuzco. Ultimately, what makes this movie such a treat is the energy it has, and the chaotic nature of each individual scene. My only minor complaint is that the emotional scenes doesn't feel as real as they could, but it doesn't ruin the film in the slightest, as this is an entertaining and well made classic, suitable for everyone.",The Emperor's New Groove

I don't hear many people talk about it, and it didn't gross as much money as the earlier movies did. Why? I don't get it! This movie is a gem! You wouldn't expect a movie like this from Disney, but maybe that's part of the reason it's good!ANIMATION: I enjoy how it looks here. First of all, this doesn't look like the films we had just seen from Disney a decade ago. Unlike ""Hercules,"" though, where the animation didn't look very good, here it contributes to the tone of the movie. The movements are fast, so as to compliment the comedic moments and expressions. I guess my only complaint about the animation is Kronk and Pacha look very much alike. Their clothes help us tell one from the other, but their designs look nearly identical.SONGS/MUSIC: The theme song was cool, I guess...Uh, yeah. Next.ROMANCE: ...A Disney movie without a romance?! Really? The film even set up a scenario for a romance in the beginning. He's presented young women who he can take as a wife, and the film doesn't move forward with it. We never see it again. Wow, that's rare...CHARACTERS: Here we go! These characters make this film! I cannot think of a character I don't like. Pacha isn't as entertaining as the rest, but his kindness and pleasantness are enjoyed in comparison to the other main characters who aren't as kind or pleasant. Kuzco is rude and pompous, but he's the type of rude and pompous that's enjoyable. I like watching him. He's funny and entertaining, but he still has a story arc in which he realizes the error of his ways. Of course we all love Yzma and Kronk! These guys are some awesome villains! I know almost nothing they plan ever works, but you don't really want their plans to work because you have such a good time laughing at them! They are a fantastic duo! They work so well together! Pacha's kids can be a little annoying, but I like them overall, and I enjoy the wife too...Dude, did you hear her snort when Pacha got back home? That was funny!STORY: The story is OK, I suppose. When you really analyze it, it's like any other Disney movie or buddy comedy: two people who don't like each other have to take this voyage together as a villain is causing chaos; the two learn something about each other, a misunderstanding takes place that drives the two away from each other, they come back together, they stop the villain, and they live awesomely. It's not that special, but, like I said, what really drives it are the characters and the jokes. If it weren't for them, this would easily be a dull movie.CONCLUSION: This movie is amazing; I don't think I've seen a Disney movie that was fantastic solely because of the characters. The jokes are hilarious, the animation is impressive, and, again, the characters are fan-frickin-tastic! If you haven't seen it, check it out! You'll love it! God bless you.

Hey, you don't want your kid ends up like Kuzco, do you?Whether or not your a fan of David Spade's or Disney's, this movie is worth seeing!",The Emperor's New Groove
114,Figaro-8,A hilarious buddy film that just HAPPENS to be animated.,10,17 December 2000,"Now that ""Emperor's New Groove"" has arrived, I will forgive Disney for that bad film (IMO) that was ""102 Dalmatians.""I thought this is one of Disney's best films in YEARS.For starters, the voice cast is EXCELLENT.  David Spade is sensational as Kuzco, the emperor-turned-llama.  (Kuzco is a rarity for a Disney film:  a main character that we're actually NOT supposed to like!)  John Goodman is in Dan Conner mode (his character from TV's ""Roseanne"") as Pacha, the kind-hearted llama herder.  Eartha Kitt is great as Yzma, and Patrick Warbuton steals the show as Kronk, Yzma's dimwitted henchman. Spade and Goodman are wonderful together, and they make a great buddy team. And that's essentially what the film is:  a buddy film.It should be said that there is no groundbreaking animation or Broadway showtunes in this film.  And you know what?  GREAT!!!  Contrary to what some may believe, there is no Golden Rule that says all movies shalt have those two things in order to be entertaining.  The animation is clean, vibrant and colorful; the opening song performed by Tom Jones is very catchy; and the story WORKS.  But that is just what I was expecting from a movie directed by Mark Dindal, who also directed the wonderful, overlooked ""Cats Don't Dance."" Dindal injects ""Groove"" with the same energy level he did ""Cats,"" and the results pop off the screen.If you want groundbreaking animation and Broadway tunes, go put ""Aladdin"" back in the VCR.  But if you want an entertaining film that will make adults laugh as much as--if not more than--kids, then shake your ""Groove"" thing over to see the ""Emperor.""",The Emperor's New Groove

116,Lamia7609,Breath of fresh air,10,19 March 2001,"All I can say is I avoided this film because I am so tired of the same Disney formula. I was more than pleasantly surprised when I finally viewed it.  I went with my boyfriend and his 4 year old son. It may have been above the 4 year old's head, but the point is it was clean and he watched it. I am not quite sure why everyone thinks that every Disney film or film that's geared toward kids has to be solely for children. Let's face it kids stop to stare at commercials.  Everything is new and somewhat confusing to them. It's part of growing up learning to puzzle these things out. Kids need things that are suitable for them true, but adults need things that they can be entertained by and occupy their child as well. Anyone who has kids or are around them know that you will spend a lot of time watching the same Disney movie or cartoon over and over and over and over.  Kids don't get bored with it because it's all new to them. So giving The Emperor's New Groove a poor rating based on the fact that your 4 year old didn't get every joke is inane, asinine, absurd..etc.     I gave this movie a 10 based on the fact that I was highly entertained. Critics need to try rating something based on what it is rather than what it isn't. Movies should either entertain, provoke thought, elicit an emotional response, be awe inspiring, or in some way advance movie making be it through technical machinations or plot devices etc. *see Citizen Kane*. There are few films that have been successful in executing most of that criteria.     Will you laugh and giggle while watching this?...Yes...quite a bit. David Spade, John Goodman, Eartha Kitt, and Seinfeld's Puddy do a wonderful job. If you haven't this yet please do. If you loved Alladin you will appreciate this film. 10/10",The Emperor's New Groove
117,StartingAllOver14,Disney's are showing some groove,8,28 August 2007,"""The Emperor's New Groove"" is an unusual Disney feature, but that's the refreshing thing about it. Originally (for those who didn't knew) it was planned to be a epic drama, with Roger Allers (""Lion King"") as the director. That were one of the reasons that I looked forward too ""The emperor's new Groove"", who was originally called ""Kingdom of the sun"". But then the project took another direction, with it's understandable in some ways (and it's a looong story, trust me). If they made the right decision is another discussion for now, but when you see ""The Emperor's New Groove"", you can't be disappointed.This film is more bizarre than you expect from Disney. It's not a typical Disney feature like for example ""Cinderella"" and ""Tarzan"", but it still is a fresh and enjoyable cartoon. It has more irony and sarcasm and it's nice to see a Disney cartoon that is pure comedy. While the plot is simple, the script is well-written and hilarious. The score from John Debney is most of the time boisterous, but it actually fits the tone of the movie.The characters are likable/hate-able (here comes something that could be considered as a spoiler): Kuzco and Yzma are both the same kind; self-pity, but still funny. Kronk is one of the funniest characters in the film, the same with the squirrel and Pacha's kids. Pacha's wife is very cute and charming. While Pacha himself is not so funny like the rest of the cast, he's a nice and gentle character that is likable. SPOILERS over. Besides, the voice actors are doing a great job!The animation it self looks more than a Warner Bros cartoon than the regular Disney-style, but it fits the movie. ""The Emperor's New Groove"" is a Disney-feature that you can safely watch many times without getting easily sick of it. Groove on! He he.",The Emperor's New Groove
118,pmcollectorboy,Nuts to the critics and public,10,20 February 2001,"Most critics and ordinary moviegoers alike don't know what they're dismissing in The Emperor's New Groove. This movie was top notch Disney and a true modern masterpiece that has more of old Walt's spirit than any of Disney's other so called masterpieces since Aladdin. Only a few critics actually seemed to get it, and even those that praised it still missed the point by actually believing it was all about the comedy. All the rest trivialized it by pointing to a whole bunch of meaningless ""mistakes"". Its emphasis on story rather than tired formula and cliches wasn't seen, and its lack of silly, overblown musical numbers tying up the story was booed, not praised. Its old school animation was mistaken as weak, and its vibrant, original, and colorful characters were written off as unmemorable. None of this could be further from the truth. The Emperor's New Groove was stylish and sassy. It was a breath of fresh air that proved Disney was for once willing to flex their creative muscles and think outside the box. The characters were the most original and most memorable I had ever seen in a Disney movie. Not since the days of Lady and the Tramp had a movie like this come along. The Emperor's New Groove spoke to ""kids"" of all ages. It allowed everybody to laugh at it without going over kids' heads. And it spoke to kids without talking down to them, preaching, moralizing, or beating them over the head. The simple message was that selfishness was evil, and the movie brought that across politely through the use of story, without bursting into song. This was a message kids could actually use and learn from. And kudos to Disney for portraying a happy, normal, biologically sound family. No dead parents here, and I know there won't be any squirming kids because this is one of Disney's least violent movies. So kudos to Disney for what this is, a grand animated masterpiece in the tradition of the old school, and for what this isn't, more overstuffed moralizing grandeur following stale formula. And if I were a parent, I for one won't be afraid to let my kid watch this. Anybody else that didn't see this movie's beauty, well that's your opinion, but it's really a shame. I gave this movie a full 10, a score I haven't given an animated movie since Bambi. I would give it an 11 if I could.",The Emperor's New Groove

i just loved it so much.. ""Pacha"" And the ""Kosko"" were just the perfect team and it was nice to see a friendship develop between them.. i cant say enough about this movie.. its perfect for a pick me up if your kind of feeling down.. there are a few sad parts.. but as ususal there is the happy ending... it was so cute .. i just Loved it !!!",The Emperor's New Groove

Not much of a movie. This is probably the best vocal ensemble a Disney animated movie has seen in a long time. They bring the movie to a level rarely achieved with their expert vocal talents. Spade makes these noises that become perfect for the llama Kuzco. Goodman is solid (when is he ever not solid?). Kitt makes her voice downright nasty, perfect for her character. But perhaps the unsung hero of this movie is Warburton as Kronk. Everything the guy says is hysterical, making him easily one of my favorite Disney characters. Other great things about the movie include the animation, done in a angular style that looks really sharp. Also, its not stuffed full of random moments of song. And saving the best for last, there are moments where the movie is not even taking itself seriously that contribute to its humor. All said and done, this is an excellent piece of Disney animation.",The Emperor's New Groove

But instead turn him into a llama and must team up with the peasant, who believes that the emperor is becoming a better person.

Every minute that you spend watching this you will burst out laughing.  I have seen this movie like 10 times or so and I laugh every time because the lines are so funny.  ""Emperor Kuzco"", the snotty and spoiled emperor is so funny.  He acts as any spoiled person would with the way he talks.  The animation is remarkable too.  I really think that this is a great movie that people of any age will like.  Whether your 6 or 60, you'll laugh at least 10 times guaranteed. If you buy the DVD, all of the special features are great too.  This movie really finds a way to make you laugh.  Although the plot may be a little silly in some spots, it is still a great movie.  All of the people that have seen this movie know what I mean.""Patcha"", the poor peasant that is one of the main characters acts just like someone trying to deal with someone like Kuzco.  ""Yzma"" the wicked person that is trying to kill Kuzco is so funny.  Even though she is supposed to be this really bad and evil killer, she still acts like a regular old lady in some parts and creates some of the laughs in this movie.

There are, though, a couple of issues which have become chronic in recent animated movies, especially Disney's:although the animation is getting better and better, the quality of   the drawings is becoming simply awful. Did they ever see a llama? Did they ever see a human?!? - why center the movie on pre-school kids and then fill it with jokes they cannot possibly understand?So, if you don't mind quirky drawings, you're over 14 and want to see a really great comedy, this is the movie for you.

127,Kreme,One of Disney's WORST movies in years,3,1 May 2001,"This confusing mish-mash of a movie is a real chore to sit through.  The characters are dull, the plot is pointless, the animation is sub-par, and the music feels like it was slashed to ribbons.  You thought Tarzan was dull?  You ain't seen nothing yet.The basic story involves a selfish amoral emperor (David Spade) who is turned into a llama.  The movie is a bit of a quest picture as the emperor tries to get himself restored to human form.At the end of the picture we have a selfish amoral emperor who has, as far as I can tell, done *nothing* worth being restored.  There's certainly no moral lesson here, or at least not a good one.There are a few good jokes, though most of these are well over the average child's head.  The voice talents are good, as both Spade and Goodman deliver their dialog in a believable, in character manner.  Eartha Kitt is quite good as the evil Sorceress Yzma.  In fact, the voice talent, I think, is better than most Disney films of recent memory (with the exception of the Toy Story movies, quite possibly the best).  This is not enough to save a movie that I found to be predictable, silly, overblown, and, in the end, empty.  Somewhat like eating a snow cone.

The movie  is about a stuck up, self-centered young brat named Kuzco(Played by David Spade) who is turned into a lama by his fired Advisor Izma(Ertha Kint sorry for the mispelling of the name) Well from there you will just have to see the film.. This movie is a non stop laugh fest with some of the funniest character since The Little Mermaid.  John Goodman who voices Pacha is so good that he lifts the movie I mean the chemistry between Goodman and Spade is unforgettable ,but I have to say that Cronk  (played by Patrick Wartburn)is so funny I mean there is not one scene in the movie that his Cronk is in that I don't sit there a laugh out loud that's how good Cronks character is. My other favorite character is Izma as a cat it just so funny to sit there and watch this little fur ball trying to beat up Kuzco as a lama and Pacha.

Recommended.",9,11 May 2001,"I had heard that Disney was trying something a bit different with this picture, and knew from Kuzco's ""Bring it on."" waterfall line in the preview that I'd probably like this form of different.  This is the first Disney pic in awhile that doesn't really take itself seriously at all, and it flourishes as a result.There's a plot, but it's not such a big deal as in most Disney fare. Jerkish emperor receives his comeuppance and learns a lesson, yada-yada. The fun's more in the telling, as given here.  The change of heart doesn't come so terribly quickly as to be disconcerting, and feels somewhat earned through the chaos that ensues.  And chaos it is...through a rollercoaster ride of sight gags, verbal wordplay, conventional satire and a semi-talking squirrel.David Spade lends a biting sarcasm to Kuzco that is rare for ""hero-types"" in cartoons, and Patrick Warburton really steals the show with his understated and underneuroned Kronk.  I came to be waiting for every dry aside out of Kronk's mouth, he's so hilarious.  Such a lovely eulogy.I don't understand why some have said this is boring, as it's a pretty snappy ride.  I do understand why some haven't laughed so much-you need a pretty quick and warped mind to catch some of their throwaway lines, which are really some of the funniest.  Kids will like the sight gags, but will miss much of the verbal humor.  Take it out for a spin, you may be pleasantly surprised.  Just, don't diss Kronk's spinach puffs.

133,RueMorgue,"Unexpected Disney fare, but an unexpected delight.",8,8 May 2001,"These comments are based on a viewing of the DVD version of this film.Simply put, this is Disney, but it isn't the Disney we are accustomed to. David Spade is notorious for his sarcasm and snide comments, and they abound in this film.  The storyline here is darker than previous Disney animated films.  One of the special features on the DVD is a deleted scene in which Pacha's village is destroyed, and while it is shown in its unfinished form, it is obvious why it wasn't included.  It is a very dark, violent, and foreboding scene, and it brings new light to the film, especially when watched after viewing the movie in its entirety.  Simply put, this isn't your typical children's movie, and it seems to be aimed at a more mature audience.The story revolves around Emperor Kuzco, an egotistical ruler with a heavy hand, who is turned into a llama by his nemesis Yzma and her faithful sidekick, Kronk.  Kuzco is ends up on Pacha's cart, and is transported back to his village, and various hijinks occur as Pacha tries to help Kuzco return to his palace, and ultimately regain his human form.In my humble opinion, Kronk steals the show here.  Spade & John Goodman do a good job as Emperor Kuzco and Pacha respectively, but Kronk, while something of an idiot, brings comedic moments to this film which are necessary.  Watch his facial expression on the way to the ""secret lab,"" and keep an eye on him during the ""jump-rope"" scene at Pacha's hut later on in the movie.  Simply put, it's hilarious.  Patrick Warburton's flat delivery of lines for this character adds dimension (surprisingly) to the ""typical idiot"" character which appears in almost all Disney films.Rumor has it that this film was originally a lot different, a lot darker, until Disney stepped in and took over.  A viewing of the deleted scene gives some insight into what the film may have been like had it not been changed. I've always been amazed by the fact that Disney can make films geared at kids, but which also appeal to adults. However, more recently, and unfortunately, Disney has used its reputation for having excellent story lines and creating films which teach lessons to enter into the ""direct-to-video"" market, thus taking advantage of children and their parents, and disappointing Disney fans who would rather see films which are good enough for theatrical release. Even though these particular films are released by Disney, they are just like any other ""direct-to-video"" film.  They should be avoided, and aren't anything to write home about.While not as good as Tarzan or The Lion King,   The Emperor's New Groove is a pretty good way to keep the kiddies quiet on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon, and the adults might get something out of it as well.Note:  The DVD version contains, among other goodies, a neat little animated game, a multiple choice Q&A which you can play with the children after they watch the movie.  To keep them extra quiet, tell them to watch close because they are going to be tested!  :)My Rating:  7/10",The Emperor's New Groove

One of my favorite things about this movie was the way that it felt like a really old Warner Brothers cartoon. Some of the cases in point are when Yzma is trying to come up with ways to kill off Kuzco. Kronk's conscience is also thoroughly enjoyable, as Kronk himself. ""Look at him, with his little sissy stringy thing...""""Aaah... How shall I do it? Oh, I know... I'll turn him into a flea. A harmless, little flea. And then, I'll put that flea in a box.

Genius, I say!"" The animation style is really unusual for Disney too - reminescent of, dare I say, the Flintstones. There are a lot of sharp angles in the characters. Kuzco as the llama is not a perfectly drawn llama, more of a whimsical charicature of a llama. Which goes along with the whole tongue in cheek feel of the movie. ""I was turned into a cow. Can I go home?"" ""All right, you're excused. Anyone else?"" ""No, we're good.""There are so many memorable scenes in this movie I can't even begin to tell you anymore of them.

In my opinion, however, The Emperor's New Groove deserves to be in the running as one of the newer Disney classics. The movie follows Emperor Kuzko, a seemingly selfish young ruler who is turned into a llama by one of his former advisers. Though the idea of a selfish ruler learning his place in the world is not an uncommon theme in movies, especially Disney movies, this film does it in a new way, making it seem fresh and original. Add some fabulous and easily quotable lines, the incomparable Eartha Kitt, an always hilarious Patrick Walburton, and David Spade in one of the few roles where he is actually tolerable, and you have the makings of a Disney classic. It's just a shame that this near perfect film doesn't get the recognition it deserves. So, if you've never seen this wonderful little movie, do so immediately. It will be well worth the hour and half, and I think you'll see why I think this movie deserves so much more than it's gotten.

If this movie had a rating of 1 to 5 I would give it a 5, because it is meant for families with children who enjoy watching movies with their parents. There are a lot of funny parts to this movie, there is nothing inappropriate in this movie and is perfect for children. This movie's story is really creative and fun to watch even for me! This movie is nice to watch with family or just yourself. Hope this review helps you chose the next perfect movie for your family.",The Emperor's New Groove

I love how Kronk is just kind of that ""Uh...duh"" kind of guy and Yzma's always like ""What's wrong with you?"" It's so hilarious. And David Spade was amazing! I can totally see him being this character, and John Goodman...what can I say? He's definitely a Pacha. Seriously, if you haven't seen this movie yet, you *have* to because it will make you feel so happy and you'll laugh through the entire thing like I did. You're probably thinking ""Yeah, right.""

The movie is highly quotable and shows a lesson about caring about others. My favorite part is where Yzma turns into a cat with a potion. So very funny. James Gunn must have loved this movie because James Gunn makes funny movies. James Gunn must have used a lot of funny parts inspired from this movie and other movies including Footloose, Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark.

147,Queen_of_Shadows,Great Disney Movie,7,27 June 2005,"Disney movies are known for being highly recommended movies for all ages and the original movies(such as Cinderella,The Little Mermaid, Snow White,Aladdin,etc)are enjoyable classics.Unfortunately,Disney has been running out of ideas and fail to recreate the old Disney magic. This movie however,proved me wrong.This movie is about a self-centered,spoiled and seemingly heartless young Emperor named Kuzco.With the snap of his fingers,he can get anything he wants even if it's a summer home.He only worries about himself and his needs and no one's whatsoever.That all might change with Pacha,a generous,thoughtful,and intelligent everyday peasant.He seems like your average peasant with a middle-class family and some farm animals of his own.He and Kuzco have nothing in common and have a bad start(Kuzco demands that Kuzcotopia,his new summerhouse to be built on top of the hill where Pacha and his family live)but they overcome that throughout the story.Yzma,Kuzco's cunning,stubborn and pessimistic adviser was recently fired and she wants revenge.In return,she decides to poison him with a potion with the help of Kronk,her lovable,dim-witted and humorous right-hand man. Unfortunately,he transforms Kuzco into a llama instead and when he tries to get rid of him,Kronk accidentally drops him on Pacha's cart which Pacha brings all the way to his village without knowing that the emperor is actually in a bag on his cart.With Kuzco far from the palace,leaving Yzma to rule the empire and leaving Kuzco and Pacha to triumph over the obstacles to travel to the palace,what will become of the story?Watch it and view good quality comedy with a pinch of drama and be amazed.I believe this movie is a Disney classic.The magic of Disney returned in this enjoyable story.The characters are well-developed and all three dimensional.Kuzco begins as the spoiled brat who can literally get anything that he wants and throughout the story,he learns the value of friendship and generosity.At first when he turns into a llama,the teenage audience want Kuzco to stay as a llama because of his bad attitude yet later in the story,they're rooting for him to transform back into a human.Pacha may not be the best character but there's no one who can hate him.Pacha already has compassion and generosity from his family life and may seem speechless in some scenes but most of that changes when he meets Kuzco.Pacha is also the one who gets him and Kuzco out of sticky situations in the jungle.In most Disney movies,the villains are serious and seemingly boring but this movie changed that Disney law.Yzma was hilarious as an old and ugly woman who is almost as spoiled as Kuzco.She has clever lines and has impatience which is what makes her humorous.However,Kronk deserves most of the credit for the humor.Kronk is the most lovable character in the whole movie.He delivered his humor with enthusiasm.The squirrel scene cracked me up.I'll rate this movie a 7.9/10 for memorable quotes and a deep friendship built.",The Emperor's New Groove

David Spade's character voice for the Emperor is excellent and could be the main reason why I enjoyed this movie so much.  Anyone who enjoyed David Spade on Saturday Night Live, or Just Shoot Me should definately see this film.Very fun spirited and is definately a different formula than normal disney films.  The characters didn't feel the need to break out in a song every few minutes.  Not that the music in other disney's films is bad, but it sometimes can be overdone.I highly recommend this movie and am looking forward to owning it on video when it is released.",The Emperor's New Groove
150,nintendofanof1993,Loved it.,9,10 February 2011,"The Emperors New Groove is a great family film about an Emperor who has developed some habits along with a very rude personality. It starts of with the Emperor Kuzco voiced by David Spade who invites a simple peasant named Pacha whose voiced by John Goodman into his empire. He then tells Pacha that he must soon move out of his house and make way for Kuzco's new water park. Devastated Pacha soon returns home. Later that night the antagonist of the story Yzma voiced by Earth Kitt, invites Kuzco to dinner as a gesture of no hard feelings for firing her. Their plan however is to poison him, but Kronk voiced by Patrick Warburton grabs the wrong potion changing Kuzco from a human to a llama, and so the adventure begins. This is a great leap from modern day family films in which it chooses a lesser known piece of history dealing with the Mayans and Aztec people. Its a humorous storyline mixed with bits and pieces of action. The cast of characters are great and you also get a feel for them as the plot progresses. Kuzco and Pacha then become the two protagonist as they must put aside their differences and work together to get back to the palace. This teaches children valuable lessons such a team work and friendship and how important they really are. The style and music is great to, The Emperors New Groove really delivers and is a must see for the younger audiences. I give this film a 90% simply because of the originality and the wonderful storyline that this film has.",The Emperor's New Groove

After suffering through tons of ""kiddie"" films, it's nice to find a few that you let the kids watch without having to run to another room so you don't have to hear the endless drivel. ENG has humor on a number of levels, from slapstick for the kids to poking fun at cartoon logic and even a few jokes that made me laugh out loud. The moral won't leave you with a sugar coating on your tongue, the characters had some actual depth and while the art was very atypical for Disney, I enjoyed the look and feel of it. 8 out of 10.",The Emperor's New Groove
152,Webslinger48,This movie grooves like no other!,8,17 January 2001,"""Emperor's New Groove"" is one of the funniest movies I've seen in some time, which is especially surprising considering it seemed impossible for it to be good given the clumsy concept and horrible title.  Disney scrapped the singing animals for once and just went for outright laughs, and they scored big in this tale of an emperor with an attitude that gets taken down a peg when he gets changed into a llama.Casting Patrick Warburton (Puddy from Seinfeld) as the Cronk, the lackey to Ertha Kitt's Yzma was sheer genius...if it was possible to receive an academy award for voice work in an animated feature, he'd have it locked up.  Though truly all of the voices are perfect in this movie, and it really does add so much to it.  I know that it hasn't been as successful at the box office as some of the other recent Disney films, and that's a shame, because it deserves more recognition.  I wish more movies like this were made.By the way, for those of you who gave it a ""1""...what a bunch of grouches!  Someone should turn you into llamas!",The Emperor's New Groove
153,KWiNK,Disney - tongue in cheek,9,14 June 2003,"Who would have thought the writers at Disney would ever come up with  enough courage to do a whole movie that takes the genre and smashes it over the heads of everybody who expected to see an old-fashioned musical?This film is about as funny as a Douglas Adams novel - it's full of self-irony and you get the suspicion that some of it is a bit mean-spirited, but enjoying it means laughing your belly out and you just have to show it to all your friends. It's stuffed with tongue-in-cheek dialogue (I  L O V E the scene, in which Yzma and Kronk discuss whether to get rid of Kuzco before or after dinner - look for it in the quotes on this site!) and incredibly fast and funny animation with a sense of irreverence that not even Disney's ""Hercules"" was ready to deliver. Seems to have been written by some talented teenagers on an overdose of Monty Python, Jim Carrey and ""Futurama"". Thanks of course go to Robin Williams for leading the way with his unforgettable portrayal of a certain blue genie. He should probably be awarded a special Oscar for every new film Disney chunks out in memory of that performance with a great cast like this!And one last thing: Kronk definitely is the greatest stupid henchman in recent memory. He's so unknowingly dead-pan, you have to wonder if he's not actually the most mature of the characters on screen. 9/10",The Emperor's New Groove
154,discoroux,Disney lost it.,1,20 October 2001,"Let's face it people, Disney completely lost it on this one. The movie was very poorly written. The contemporary atmosphere in a historical setting was too much of a rip-off of any time travel film. Some of it's ""jokes"" were so lame I could barf. Then the writers took two shots at gay people. It's people like that I can't stand at all. And this was a family film, so they were trying to preach hate to children. May I ask why? Just because they have a different sexuality than the writers? Think about it sometime. Anywho, the animation wasn't too good either.

The animation style is not typical Disney (perhaps closest to the boring Pocahonta), but it suits the Aztec-theme. The pace and the humour is tremendous and the characters are hilarious, especially the self centred Emperor Kuzco and the evil Yzma's sidekick, Kronk.Kids may enjoy it because of the tempo and the action scenes, but I would say that this is a movie aimed at adults, with several absolutely perfect scenes such as ""the one at the no-llama diner"", the grand finale and not least the ""tied to the log scene"":Pacha: Uh oh.Kuzco: Don't tell me: We're about to go over a huge waterfall.Pacha: Yep.Kuzco: Sharp rocks at the bottom?Pacha: Most likely.Kuzco: Bring it on.It does not come much better than this.",The Emperor's New Groove
156,hasekamp,Not good enough for Disney,5,13 March 2002,"Let me say first that I am a Disney fan. No doubt about that. I own most of his ""Classics"" on DVD. But this one simply is not good enough for a Disney movie. The story is far too thin for a movie, the humor is not as good as we normally see from Disney, there is no really bad villain. The music is good, however. That is one positive point. While watching this movie I wondered more and more why Disney made it at all and after that why he decided to release it. It would better have stayed on the shelves, for later revision or for eventual placement into the dustbin. Recently I read that the script had been re-written several times and that most of the movie was re-made because Disney was not happy with it. So what what we see now is the second or third trial, that for one reason or another was released. The main problem with this movie is -as said- that there simply is no strong story line. It is a collection of events, some of which are funny but most not funny at all. Nowadays Disney makes two or three movies a year, whereas in the past he made one in every two or three years. Maybe that is the main problem. The show must go on and on, with more and more output. So see it, if you are a Disney fan, but don't buy it. Luckily Disney can do better, as recent movies like ""Tarzan"" and ""Atlantis"" show!",The Emperor's New Groove

Ever since they went 3D with ""Tangled"" (2010) and ""Wreck-It Ralph"" (2012), their movies simply aren't as clever or funny. I love how all this insanity happened because Kronk pointed out that Yzma was taking out her anger on objects, especially because most people blame it on her wanting to save on postage. She was going to turn him into a flea, a harmless little flea, then she was going to put it in a box, and then put that box in another box, and then she'll mail that box to herself, and when it arrives, she will unleash a hammer that probably weighs as much as she does!

This story is about a wretched character who really doesn't change that much in what is supposed to be his life changing crises.  He is immoral at the beginning and immoral at the end.

159,rominaferraro,"Fun, fun, fun!",10,7 March 2004,"Well, I've just watched my brand new DVD of ""The emperor's new groove"" and, as all the other thousand times I watched it, I loved it. I've always thought (as many other people) that a great children movie is a movie for everybody, and this is the case. This film has every quality to be considered not just a cartoon, but an excellent comedy.This is my favorite Disney movie, mainly because it is so atypical for Disney. First of all, there aren't only stereotypical bad guys and good guys, you can see all degrees of good and bad. Also, you can see that people (or llamas :) ) are able to change. Secondly, there's irony, a characteristic not very common to be depicted in a children movie. There's even a very subtle sexual undertone in some scenes (Yzma changing assistants for younger ones; Yzma lifting her skirt), subtle enough not to disturb children but to amuse grown-ups. Thirdly, there are plenty of details and gags! In this sense, it reminds of old classical movies and series, always with a twist. But the most important thing is absurd: I saw this film lots of times and I keep finding out-of-place, out-of-time elements that make the setting unique and funny in itself (that reminded me a lot of ""Top secret!""). You can laugh for hours just by noting these little things.
The characters are round and quite complex, as I said before. It is also refreshing to see a movie about friendship, not romantic as many other previous ones. And I love that tough, clumsy, very guy-ish kind of friendship, without many words or gestures of affection. The plot is simple but rich, with a nice message for kids and a good depiction of the process of change.I'd like to add, for English-speaking readers, that I've watched the movie in Spanish too and it's exactly as enjoyable as the original. The Spanish script and voices were very carefully created, and I always appreciated this feature in those Disney movies I saw in both languages.Basically, and mainly, it's a happy movie, and that's why I love seeing it so often: because it makes me happy every time.",The Emperor's New Groove

Then at the age of 8 it went on TV and I thought of giving it a chance...and that was a great idea. The story itself is nice and easy enough to follow and had a great dose of great Disney comedy (before Disney went complete *beep* with it's terrible sitcoms). The characters are not just characters, they have great personalities even if Kuzco is a bit of a dick in the beginning. The characters are also excellently voiced.This movie became an instant classic to me when I saw it even though it is still one of the shorter Disney movies (77 minutes).

Our villain Hmm sorry... Our main character ""Kuzco"" is a selfish, greedy and heartless emperor.
The character was written in a funny way, he was a bad person in a way that I'd break my screen to kick his ass for his actions.
In contrast, ""Pacha"" was a good person and for me he was a poor character and his actions weren't reasonable at all, he was written to be the pretty, kind and forgiving example for the kids.-The narration style was pretty awesome, hilarious sometimes and creative for an animated movie (I think it's the first movie that followed that style
And ""Kuzco"" as a narrator was so funny as he mostly narrates the story making himself the victim.-The movie suffered from lazy writing, they used ""Deus ex machina"" technique a lot.. like literally in the last 10 minutes they used it 4 times.-Answering the first question, for me the movie didn't make him a hated person as he wasn't hated from any character except ""Yzma"", ""Pacha"" hated him for a little bit but that wasn't enough he literally saved his ass from death more than once.",The Emperor's New Groove

It'd be easier for the villager if the emperor weren't planning to raze the village to make room for a summer home.I don't know what David Spade is like in real life, but voicing the character of Kusko seems to flow very naturally for him.  There's good chemistry between him and John Goodman (Pacha), though at points neither seems terribly involved emotionally.  Whoever thought of casting Eartha Kitt as Yzma was inspired...her voice is absolutely perfect for the evil chemist.  Patrick Warburton also deserves a mention as Yzma's minion, Kronk, one of the most lovable bad guys I've seen in a while.

NOW!,10,30 August 2002,"Absolutely unequivocably the funniest thing ever to have come out of Disney ever ever ever, and this is coming from someone who finds the whole ""Um, like yeah, y'know, like totally"" culture to be repulsively odious.This film is absolutely packed with laughs from almost the very beginning to the very end, Disney are being so much braver with what they do, dropping the ""realism"" of the normal films leading to some beautiful surreal humour, like the whole Kuzco: ""How did you get here first?????"" Yzma: *shrugs* bit. And Krunk has to be one of the best characters ever, especially if you include his shoulder angels too.One thing... I wasn't actually so fond of the Pacho character, although he was voiced well he was a bit... I don't know, just at some points he seemed to deviate from his character.Anyway, absolutely stunning film, wonderfully smooth animation, and plenty of new and original things for Disney culminating in not only one of the funniest Disneys, but quite possibly one of the funniest films ever.

Patrick Warburton steals every scene he's in as Kronk, the incompetent sidekick.  This movie had me in stitches from the very opening all the way to the end.  Unlike most comedies nowadays, this one is appropriate for the entire family. Disney has returned to their old form with this one.  While it lacks the musical prowess of such Disney heavyweights like ""Aladdin"" and ""The Lion King"" the writing in it is top notch, and the actors do a splendid job at portraying these incredibly funny characters.

Kuzco underwent a transformation for the better when Pacho was his friend despite Kuzco's arrogance, and was still there for him when Kuzco hit bottom.

184,kaiserjohnson,Boom Baby!,8,7 January 2002,"I was skeptical of this movie for a long time before seeing it. I found it interesting how Disney came out with a movie starring an ancient mesoamerican society at the same time that Dreamworks was scoring big with ""The Road to El Dorado"" which is about the Aztecs. I also found it interesting how the animation style was not typical Disney, but matched closer the style used by Dreamworks. Very interesting. Full-length animated movie politics aside, however, I loved the movie. It was really nothing like the Road to El Dorado. I can't really think of a reason why Disney used the Incas as the characters in their movie (except that Dreamworks had used Aztecs) other than they needed an almost omnipotent emperor, and they thought they could use an Incan one.  I found this movie one of the funniest and most enjoyable I've ever seen. The dialogue was excellent, and the humor so much quicker and better than is par for Disney, that it had me in stitches. The cleverness was amazing and doesn't disappoint. An all around terrific movie.",The Emperor's New Groove

It's a classic example of how a good story is the most essential element of any movie, whether animated or otherwise. All of the characters have been carefully chosen for their vocal abilities and have pulled off their respective roles perfectly. What is notable is that this movie did not rely on computer animation tricks, but instead used old-fashioned Disney animation. Music and songs are kept to a minimum, and mushy, over-the-top sentimentality is nowhere to be seen. It is just a clean, entertaining story packed with visual and auditory jokes that demand a repeated viewing (actually our family has probably watched it upwards of 20 times now, as it is a favorite of our daughter's).Anyone who claims that this is the worst movie made by Disney (or any of the actors associated with it) just did not listen closely enough to what the characters say.

This tired tale of enlightenment might be excusable if there was anything fresh or entertaining along the way.  The art is quite different from typical Disney fare, probably due to an accelerated production schedule.  In any case it's a step down in that department as well.

I went to see it on impulse after my final exam of the fall semester and it was the greatest thing, I had a blast.  Dragged all my friends the very next day to see it and when I got back home for break I made every one there go see it. This is almost more fun than should be legal for $5 a pop.

The sharp, angular animation, the hilarious writing and voice talents, the clever references, and the editing and direction make this movie an unappreciated gem.  Hopefully, in time, more people will come to appreciate this as cartoon film-making of the highest caliber.  There was no obvious selling out by dragging dopey, ""we-wrote-this-song-to-capture-an-overrated-Academy-Award-for-Best-Song"" pabulum to be force-fed upon an audience that just wants to see the old Disney magic doing what it does best.  This movie strikes the fine balance of appealing to people of all ages without sacrificing the quality of the writing and dialogue - not an easy task.  Seeing this movie has instilled a sense of faith in me that Disney CAN still deliver the goods without relying on selling soundtracks.  While David Spade (as Kuzco) and John Goodman (as Pacha) deliver hilarious and warming performances, Patrick Warburton (as Kronk) and Eartha Kitt (as Yzma) are two of the most enjoyable villains in Disney's pantheon of characters.  Kronk is probably the most lovable henchman Disney has ever produced.

Some characterizations are truly well done (the dull guy), some others very stereotyped (the witch). The only real bad is the first few minutes thanks to the very avoidable music sequence in full 70's style ""Disco Fever"" but it's just that.

The comedy is just top drawer. The evil protagonist is a hilarious Phyllis Diller type, with a hunky brainless boy toy, and the duo are hysterical. The supremely vain and uncaring emperor Cuzco is wonderful, personifying the phrase ""let them eat cake."" John Goodman is a great everyman in Pacha, the simple villager who is a tool of forces way beyond his comprehension, and while the assumption that someone like Cuzco could have been de-Grinchified by an adventure like this is a real stretch, it finally doesn't matter. The movie is so much fun that you just go with it, like a roller coaster. My complaint is that everyone speaks as though they are from 20th century Los Angeles. Nowhere do we get the impression that these are people from another time and place. If it weren't for the costumes, we would have no idea when or where it is. Turn your back and listen to the dialogue without watching the screen, and see very dramatically what I mean.

204,offspring-29737,Probably among Disney's most overlooked animated films or films in general,7,11 September 2018,"The decade after the Renaissance era was one of Disney Animation's peaks and valleys to say the least. The studio was transitioning from Broadway-style adaptations of classic fables, myths, and fairytales toward appealing to modern sensibilities. Sometimes they paid off (Lilo & Stitch, Meet the Robinsons and Bolt), sometimes they didn't (Chicken Little). Thankfully, The Emperor's New Groove breaks the Disney mold in the sense that it doesn't retain certain tropes of its predecessors.The best word to describe the film is vaudevillian. There's emphasis on Looney Tunes/Tom & Jerry/Pink Panther-esque slapstick, yet the writers know when to keep a good heart.Kuzco is Daffy Duck if he were a teenager: narcissistic, but genuinely has moments when he realizes the repercussions of his attitude. He warms up to Pacha, who's down-to-earth nature helps to keep them grounded without driving each other insane.Yzma and Kronk are a polar opposite villain duo. As opposed to Kronk not always being the brightest bulb in the lamp, yet has a certain likability to him, Yzma is probably one of Disney's most comedic villains with her psychotic personality bouncing off the walls.My sole major criticism for the film is that it's under a tight 76 minute runtime, therefore wishing the viewer could ask for more. Some may argue that the film plays the comedy straight and that's it. While I somewhat agree, I still admire and credit Disney for taking a stab at a form of storytelling outside of the genre they usually shine in, even if it wasn't quite as financially rewarding as one would've hoped.All in all, Emperor's New Groove is a Disney gem worth checking out!",The Emperor's New Groove
205,thepowerofhat,One of the few Disney films anyone can enjoy.,10,23 August 2006,"What makes this film so great is that I didn't even see it until I was 15 years old, and yet it instantly became one of my favourite Disney movies of all time. It's not a musical like most Disney cartoons before it, which makes it much easier to take in (since you don't have to worry about those ""cringe"" moments that happen so often in other Disney musicals). The writing was great, but what really made it better than great was the voice acting. I can full-heartedly say that this movie had the best voice cast I've ever seen come out of Disney. Eartha Kitt, John Goodman, David Spade, and (my personal favourite character in the film) Patrick Warburton all created terrific characters. The animation was very original - a style I hadn't seen yet in a Disney cartoon. The plot as a whole was probably the weakest part of the film, but its simplicity is part of what makes everything else that's so great about the movie stand out. Watching it over and over again, I keep finding new lines of dialogue that I'm happy to quote (especially from Kronk, who, as I said, was my favourite character). What makes the movie truly great, however, is that it never stops being entertaining. There are only a couple very brief ""Disney"" moments - by which I mean those moments that attempt to evoke some serious emotion - but they're short enough to avoid requiring the viewer to cringe, and still manage to entertain thanks to what usually ends up being a cleverly-written line at the end of it.

They contain the obligatory song segments, a couple of comic relief characters, the same style, similar plot devices, and usually one featured song in the middle of it all that plays in toto while some animated music video plays across the screen.  Toy Story was a departure from this formula (and it was great) and The Emperor's New Groove is different too.  The humor is of a different ilk than previous Disney films, that I would characterize as slightly bizzare.  And partly for this reason I really enjoyed this movie.  I liked the characters Pacha, voiced by John Goodman, and Kronk, who though he plays on the team of the villain is very likeable.

I would have liked a good fifteen minutes or so added on, but C'est la vie!I would say that aside from Toy Story and Toy Story 2, this is my favorite feature length cartoon of all time.Anyway, it is a movie that anyone can enjoy, no matter their age and I would recommend it be a part of everyone's collection, even if they don't normally go for cartoons.",The Emperor's New Groove

210,tellusorbit,Cliche-ridden Nonsense,3,17 July 2001,"This movie was a big disappointment.  From the choice of David Spade as the starring voice to the cliche-ridden, anachronistic dialogue, I found myself groaning at every turn and was grateful when the final credits rolled. Some have likened the film to Aladdin, but I saw very little resemblance between these two movies.I have to say up front that I can't stand David Spade, so the movie got off to a very bad start for me.  His narration in a whiny voice didn't interest me in his character, and I found myself wishing that Yzma and Kronk would succeed in finishing him off--not the kind of ending one wants for a children's movie.  Spade's failure was reinforced by the worst screenplay I've seen in a very long time.  Tired cliches stood in for good dialogue, modern-day speech and expressions simply have no place in a movie set during the Inca heyday in South America, and the sight gags were nothing more than recycled vaudeville routines that work well in live-action, but fall flat here.While I was glad that Disney got away from the usual song-and-dance routine as well as the stupid comic-relief characters that are stock features of its animated films, I wouldn't recommend the direction that 'New Groove' took. The storyline had great promise, and the voices of John Goodman and Eartha Kitt worked very well, but David Spade and the writing team combined to ruin a good idea.

215,Emmanuel-2,"""Mazel Tov""",10,18 December 2000,"It looks like Disney finally gave up the pretentious tone of their last films. ""The circle of life"" might indeed sound a bit over the top. This time, despite a slightly moralising theme, the crazy plot is nothing more than a great pretext for wacky situations. Unlike the last films where all the sets were almost screaming ""look how artsy this is! look how great our stuff is! look at what I can do!"" here, some great looking sets are present with a discretion that goes to their honour. When Pacha leaves the palace at the beginning of the film and walks back to his village, his route is delightful to the eye, without annoying violins ruining it by desperately trying to point it out.Disney also seems to have given up the ""song every seven minutes"" policy. There's only one song in the film, and that's quite enough. More would brake the groove. The voices are excellent. David Spade has the fake crying and whining that makes him so delightfully annoying in Just Shoot Me. And Patrick Warburton has his serious and brainless tone of voice in the most inappropriate moments. (""He left without paying his check."") This is just to name a couple.Much like Scream, or Austin Powers, in a completely different theme though, the film makes fun of itself. The characters don't expect us to believe the absurd Hollywood-like coincidences of their adventure, and seem to be quite aware of the fact they're only characters of a film. And, in any case, how serious can a Jewish New York diner in the middle of a pre-Columbian South American jungle be? Especially when the waitress expresses her happiness with a ""blasé"" ""Mazel Tov""? How come, in the end of every action film, the ""bad guys"" so often seem to get in the way of the ""good guys"" in the most unlikely of ways? ""Who cares?"" seems to be the general attitude of The Emperor's New Groove.The four main characters follow a seemingly endless series of misadventures, all more unlikely and more hilarious than the other. They spoof other films and parody a lot of situations. There are no tasteless jokes, as there were in The Lion King. They play with stereotypes and attitudes. They achieve a lot by not taking themselves too seriously.That's just the kind of humour I like. I couldn't stop laughing.

There were so many good lines in that movie, I can't even remember them all. David Spade was perfectly cast, as was everyone else in that film. It almost reminded me of a monty python movie, only in cartoon form. I highly recommend it!",The Emperor's New Groove
219,denis.corbett,The most laughs I've had in years.,9,13 December 2000,"After watching the trailers for months leading up to the Sneak Preview I can tell you that I wasn't looking forward to it with much enthusiasm. After seeing it Saturday I can't wait to view it again!  It was undoubtedly the funniest movie, either live or animated, that I've seen for a long time and believe me, I've seen a lot of movies.  A comment by a young girl to her mother upon exiting the theatre says it all - ""Mommy, I've never heard you laugh so much"".",The Emperor's New Groove
220,grumfellow,"Brilliantly, consistently hilarious throughout!",10,28 July 2001,"Very funny all the way through, full of clever gags, lines, and action sequences.  The animation is not particularly spectacular, though the character animation is quite funny, but the script and performances are fantastic.  With the exception of John Goodman as the straight-man peasant Pasha, all of the leads are comically brilliant.  There are so many really funny things in this film that I laugh out loud every few minutes every time I watch it.  It's free enough of objectionable material to be suitable for the kids to watch over and over, but it's parents that will really love it. Kudos to Disney on a very well made flick!",The Emperor's New Groove
221,niccill,"Funny, but still had it's slow parts.",10,20 December 2000,"I went there expecting a few jokes, mostly written for 5 year-olds. I was wrong!  I found my friend and I (14 years old, and 13 years old) were laughing louder then the 8 year-olds; sometimes being the few people only laughing.  So, this movie isn't just for kids I believe some adults will enjoy it, also.Their were a few slow parts.  But, it wasn't too long before they brought you back to a joke, luckily!  The one thing, I disliked was that they gave away a few jokes in the trailer, that would have been a lot funnier if they were left in the context.  Since there was only a few given away, it didn't have a large impact on the movie. Also, I must say, it was perfectly cast!I highly recommend seeing it; no matter what age. It is hilarious!  Even though, their is those few slow parts, it's nothing that should keep you from seeing this movie.",The Emperor's New Groove

When we returned to my parents' house, he called his 40-something sister, urged her to see the movie, and confessed that he nearly cried from laughing so hard.The humor works better if you are familiar with the brands of humor exhibited by David Spade (Kuzco) -- think Tommy Boy or Just Shoot Me -- and Patrick Warburton (Kronk) -- Seinfeld but more conscientious.The Emporer's New Groove is the kind of movie experience that an entire family can enjoy.",The Emperor's New Groove

With heaps of crude jokes and hilarious site-gags, without the usual sappy songs that accompany a Disney cartoon, The Emperor's New Groove immediately became one of my favourite ""kids"" films.While the animated style leads you to believe that this is a children's movie, your reasoning is quickly corrected with the initial introduction to the self-obsessed Emperor.  It is Kronk, however, the idiotic assistant to the evil Yzma who steals the show with his spinach-puffs, theme song and chats with squeaky the squirrel.If you loved Aladdin then this a must-see!",The Emperor's New Groove

It looked cute, but I didn't think I would have really loved it. I was soooo wrong! ""The Emperor's New Groove"" is the funniest Disney movie I have ever seen. Every time I watch it I burst out laughing at some of David Spade's and Eartha Kitt's lines. Other Disney movies seem to be made for only children, but the ""Emperor's New Groove"" will make people of all ages laugh and love the movie. SEE IT NOW! 10/10",The Emperor's New Groove
225,bobbins494,A Win for the Whole Family,9,9 January 2008,"I think it's hard to review a kids movie because, ultimately, it's the opinion of the reviewer (adult) that is expressed.I have three children and whenever we pull out our movie library for them to choose from, this one is ALWAYS among their top five choices. It never ceases to hold their attention. My kids still, after all this time, laugh out loud (and for good reason). The writing is great and they are never talked down to once.The emperor (Kuzko) is spoiled and self-centered. Through the course of the movie he learns some great lessons about friendship, honesty, and doing the right thing and is ultimately transformed.Yes, there are some adult themes. Murder, for example. Unlike ""The Lion King"" where this is handled rather ""in-your-face"" and darkly, the makers of this movie glide over this deftly and with a lot of humor. After all, Elmer Fudd was trying to kill Bugs Bunny, right? It is very much in this style and tradition, from dialogue to animation to music.As for me, I love this movie. The children in the movie (Pacha's children) aren't ""victims"" as they are in many Disney films; they're not stupid, defenseless or in some kind of peril. They are smart, funny, and resourceful. Kuzko and Pacha are great together, but it is Yzma and Kronk that steal the show. I submit to you that these may be the funniest Disney villains of all time.Another thing I like, that is out of character for Disney, is that this movie isn't trying to sell my children a Kuzko doll. There is very little marketing value to this movie; it's simply left to stand on its own, seemingly produced for no other purpose than to entertain.Why only 9 stars out of 10? The movie closes w/a song performed by Sting (""My Funny Friend and Me""). The song is fine, but could not be farther out of context with the movie if they had chosen to play the Oscar Meyer wiener song. I'm at a complete loss as to why, after this fast-paced fun movie, they would want to transport the viewer immediately to an elevator or highbrow coffee shop. Kind of strange.",The Emperor's New Groove
226,tskeldon,What a hoot!,10,28 December 2002,My kids watch this movie all the time and I never get tired of it either. It is quirky and funny and a pleasure to watch.  The dry sarcasm of Emperor Kusco never gets old and Kronk (Putty from Seinfeld) is the surprise star in the movie.  This is one of Disney's best!,The Emperor's New Groove
227,whackertje,very good,9,5 June 2003,This movie is one of the best animations I've ever seen. It really stands a chance in comparison with Shrek and Monsters Inc. although this one is a disney movie.

228,espionage_at_home,Criminally Underrated,10,11 October 2003,"""The Emperor's New Groove"" is, simply, one of the most underrated movies in cinema history. It is certainly the most underrated Disney 'toon, and I find that impossible to understand; it's bright, colourful, witty and, most importantly, completely hilarious!The story is a kind of demented fairytale: spoilt young emperor is accidentally turned into a llama by his bitter advisor and teams up with a local peasant to undo this crime and return him to his human form. What that summary completely fails to convey is the sheer brilliance of this tale; not only is it blessed with simple but great animation, a cracking pace, a witty script, original jokes and quirky asides, but the whole thing seems to be a lot greater than the sum of its parts. The characters are wonderfully drawn and are some of the most memorable in Disney history; Kronk is hilariously naive and simple (Patrick Warburton does a brilliant voice-job here), David Spade is on top form as the cruelly sarcastic Kuzco (Disney's most despicable ""hero"") and Eartha Kitt's Yzma is a gloriously over-the-top riot - a Disney villainess who tries so hard to be bad and scary that she ends up simply looking a fool who can't even impress a squirrel (if you watch the movie, you'll know what I mean).While the awful - and, crucially, unfunny - ""Shrek"" wowed the masses and got labelled one of the best comedies ever made, ""The Emperor's New Groove"", despite glowing reviews, only has something of a cult following, and anyone who didn't ignore it upon its release is glad of it. If you're looking for something to make you laugh out loud, join that tiny cult now and give ""The Emperor's New Groove"" the chance it deserves to give you an immensely entertaining night in.RATING: ***** (out of five)",The Emperor's New Groove
229,claireems,beyond funny,9,14 September 2005,"The Emperor's New Groove has to be one of my favourite films. I am not a child, and I am not obsessed with Disney. Maybe The Groove isn't entirely conventional, but it's without the usual princess and the pauper theme of falling madly in love. It's not a credible film really, but it is funny, and the characters are comic genius! It is wacky, and is the type of film which you can really quote from. I love it, and I'm glad to see others do too. If you haven't seen it then rent it immediately! I love Kronk, the dim sidekick of Yzma, and I especially love his shoulder angel and shoulder devil. This film does have slapstick humour, but it pokes fun at everything and everyone, without going too far.",The Emperor's New Groove
230,kurtr,More fun for adults than kids,9,18 December 2000,"Not that the children won't love it, but much, if not most, of the humor is going to go right over their heads.  The movie has a less Disney feel to it, as if halfway through production Disney didn't like how it was going and told them to just finish what they had.  No big musical numbers, no state-of-the-art animation techniques, some of the backgrounds almost look as if they were using the roughs, and many scenes are left out . . . but that was probably the best part of the film.Between all the out-of-character takes, bordering-on-spoof humor, and fill-in-the-blanks missing scenes (one of which even plays an integral part of the plot) it works very well on two levels.  You might even want to catch a late showing by yourself and leave the kids at home.",The Emperor's New Groove
231,dogmac,Not up to Disney's standard,3,14 October 2001,"It is difficult for me to believe that the same company, Disney, could have produced both the Emperor's New Groove and the Lion King.  How can the ho hum animation of E.N.G. compare to the breath-taking visual experience of the Lion King or the Little Mermaid?  It saddens me to see that Disney chooses to churn out mediocre pap when I know they are capable of much, much more.  What happened to the magic in the Magic Kingdom?",The Emperor's New Groove
232,ddrevik-2,"Not just an average Disney effort, but something more",7,5 January 2001,"I went in with my two children expecting a modestly funny Disney effort. I was pleasantly surprised. The plot was pretty straightforward, but the humor was a great mix of slapstick, sly references, puns and sarcastic laughs.

235,mmdormer,A really pleasant surprise from Disney,9,18 June 2001,"Having reluctantly been dragged along to see this, it was one of those rare occasions as an adult when I was glad I had been. This is a real surprise from Disney - not the usual twee nonsense, but an intelligent movie that is also fun. I thought there was even a bit of satire in there - now how long is it since there's been satire in a Disney movie. What about the kid? Well, my son enjoyed it, I think, - there is just enough action and razamatazz to keep the kids entertained - but this is really one for you long-suffering adults. If you have the chance, do try it! Honest, it's a real eye-opener. PS. I realise that after what I've said, this film will of course fade to obscurity. Does anyone out there care anymore about intelligent movies, especially animated ones? I doubt it.",The Emperor's New Groove

Basically, there is this emperor, Kuzco,  who thinks that he's the only one on the planet that matters and makes sure that everyone else knows this. David Spade is the voice of Kuzco, and I don't think anyone could have done as good a job as he did. John Goodman plays the humble, helpful Pacha whose house might be destroyed because of Cuzco's plans for an attraction called ""Kuzcotopia"". The events that follow are extremely entertaining; even I, who am known to fall asleep during action films, paid close attention.I encourage everyone to go see this film, it is definitely worth the money.",The Emperor's New Groove
237,wackyspoonfork,Disney's much needed New Groove!,10,15 January 2001,"""New Groove"" was the best Disney movie I've seen since the Lion King, yet lacked everything that The Lion King had!  The Lion King had all the makings of the stereotypical Disney Animated feature, music, characters bursting into song every 10 minutes, lessons to be learned, insanely evil villains who inevitably are killed at the end by the tragic hero, Love interests, wacky side kicks to add in a little humour along with the drama, and shiney eye candy animation. Yet, along with all this, Lion King had the love put into it that made it the wonderful movie that it was.  All the Disneys after it had all the components but the Love!Not that ""New Groove"" didn't have some of the qualities aforementioned, it had music (But not sung by the characters), it had a lesson to be learned, and it had eye candy animation (But who says that's a bad thing if the heart is in the right place?)... everything else had a groove of it's own. Disney certainly got a  New Groove going when they came up with this movie!  It's unlike any other Disney I've seen. It was a laugh a minute for me.  I must have missed every other joke in it because I was laughing so hard at the joke before it!  David Spade was absolutely hilarious!Though it's plot was thin and predictable, the movie still possessed the charm and lovable characters that we've not seen in a long time.  It rings of The Great Mouse Detective, with it's charming and lovable characters and alot of slap stick comedy to leave you laughing, not sobbing (Lion King, remeber Mufasa's death?)!I am very surprised to see how many people didn't like this movie as much as I did.  I feel that Disney's New Groove is promising for future animated features, and I hope to see more movies like this in the future.Oh, and if you're wondering WHY it was called ""New Groove"" and there's not much singing in it... well, it's because the Emperor's Old Groove was that of his selfish and spoiled self, and after he met Pacha... well, it changed it Groove.

If you think this is just a movie for kids, give it a chance. If you don't like the plot, you'll definitely at least laugh.

As usual the Disney animation is of the highest quality and the script is brilliantly clever and witty. The combination of the great animation and talented actors make the comic timing perfect, and there are jokes which can be understood on many different levels. The premise of this film is quirkily individual if nothing else, i mean, how many films do you know that have a llama as a main character?!. The sound track is limited, but Tom Jones gives the movie its catchy theme.

I like how he is voiced by Joe from family guy. It's nice to see Patrick Warburton doing another voice for an animated character because it feels like he NEVER does that. My favorite part is when Kronk is trying to dispose of the body of the supposed recently deceased Kuzco because his boss wants him to (who hasn't been there right guys? ROFL) but he does the stereotypical angel devil shoulder thing. I also like that John Goodman is in it because who doesn't love John Goodman? He's a national treasure (tm).

Yzma's plot was to kill Kuzco and become ruler, but her plan failed miserably when Krock, her right-hand man who has the brain capacity of a flea, gives Kuzco the wrong potion. In his quest to return to human form, he runs into a friendly peasant named Pacha. Pacha and Kuzco start heading back to the castle, where Yzma is getting a little too comfortable in Kuzco's throne.

I laughed most of the way through, and only wished it was longer.The crowd that I saw it with also seemed to enjoy the movie very much and clapped afterward.  As was mentioned in the other user's comments, adults will likely enjoy this film as much as children.  I enjoyed the humor very much, and a lot of it seemed to be targeted at adults.  David Spade was excellent as the Emperor, and the other voices were great as well.I think this is one of the better recent Disney movies, as both kids and parents will enjoy it together.  Hopefully word-of-mouth gets out that this is worth seeing.  I think it will be very successful, especially since many families have already seen ""The Grinch"" and will be looking for a new family movie to watch over the holidays.I give this a 9 out of 10 (the only thing keeping it from getting a 10 was the lack of a true ""memorable"" song).  Check this one out if you get a chance.  I'll probably go and see it again, as it is worth seeing more than once.",The Emperor's New Groove

260,jamesmid,Disney Knows how to Groove!,10,5 December 2000,"I was lucky enough to attend a preview screening in London at the weekend. It gave me the feeling The Emperor's New Groove will be one of the most understated Disney movies released in recent years. Of course, I'm saying this before the film's US opening and before the hype train pulls into Britain in February. I only hope that it gets what it deserves: A lot of credit.The story of a spoilt Emperor who is turned into a Lama by his scheming adviser is the stuff that Disney movies are made of. But this is not a philosophical  or moral piece with moments of comedy. This is a roller-coaster of laughs that I haven't seen since the likes of Aladdin. The animation is sharp and colourful. Definitely up to scratch.When the movie's over, as the kiddies munch into their Emperor's New Groove Happy Meal with wind up Lama, Mum and Dad will feel like they've got their money's worth. There is so much in this for adults. David Spade and John Goodman prove once again that Disney producers have an ear for voice talent. They make a great comedy duo.  The fact that their lines were probably recorded weeks apart shows how good these performers (and editors) are. With so many one-liners and quips, I wonder how many were improvised.  I'm sure a lot of it will go over younger children's heads, but the eye candy will keep them entertained. So many sight gags are involved, this does need a second viewing.It's great to see a Disney movie so tongue in cheek! Very refreshing, very enjoyable. A modern classic!

Although not promoted as one of their major christmas motion pictures, it clearly has everything a good animated movie needs and more. It features non of the typical Disney elements (i.e. 'soft' humor, lots of singing, cute and funny supporting figures etc.) but instead gives us great puns, a lot of self-irony and a plotline that keeps the raised forefinger of moral a bit in the background. Both the style of drawing and the humor reminded me more of recent cartoons like '2 Stupid Dogs' or 'The Simpsons', the gags hit straight in the face and the characters are so exaggerated that they are simply cool. I recommend this film to anyone, great and small, who likes funny movies with intelligent humor.",The Emperor's New Groove
263,mirko-1,One of Disney's best so far!,10,9 May 2001,Left me speechless. The timing between hilarious slapstick and moments to catch breath is flawless. The dialogues reach from silly (in a funny way) to extremely sarcastic satire. One of the few Disney - heroes who isn't a shining knight but from day one a person to hate! New fresh directorial ideas.  Great score by John Debney. All in all one of my favourite Disney-pictures of all times (so far)!,The Emperor's New Groove
264,barejonbear,"fun, fast, witty, utterly hillarious",10,19 September 2001,"this was a great movie, much better than shrek.  one of the best parts was that it wasn't a musical like we've grown to expect from disney.  it had a very fast pace so that you didn't get bored. which was nice. david spade is hilarious and the character in the movie fits him. all around and excellent movie, it's too bad shrek is in the top 250 and this movie isn't",The Emperor's New Groove
265,tbret-1,Very good - This one will survive,10,26 August 2006,"As the 46 year old father of three, I just love this movie. Not only are the voice talents just right in this one, but the SCRIPT is clever! By that I don't mean that the *premise* is clever (which it nevertheless is), but the script writing, the turn of a phrase. . . shoot, the USE of a phrase here and there, it's really funny. I chalk this up to allowing the characters to BE characters instead of caricatures of characters.The actors and actresses timing is *perfect* and even when the whole thing gets silly (which it does, in a good way), the characterizations hold-up.As I write this, years after the movie's release, my kids and I can (and do) still occasionally find reasons to quote some of the lines.This is one of those ""go-to"" movies when everyone's bored and you just need something fun to watch. It doesn't get ultra-sappy, it won't make you laugh until you cry, nobody has to fall in love with anyone and nobody has to die a horrible, unjust death. There isn't even a tragic death we sing about. So it's funny,clever, moves-along pretty well, has a villain who is . . . more believable than they were meant to be I'm afraid. . . has clever dialogue and is well-voice-acted.Kids like it and adults like it. EVEN some teenagers like it. (try that with most animated fair) And for the old guys like me, I get to listen to Tom Jones (entertaining theme) and Sting to boot (the soundtrack has some good stuff on it, not necessarily from the movie).If you won't *listen* and pay attention, then forget everything I've written; but buy or rent it for those you love who will. I'd say it's suitable for everyone.",The Emperor's New Groove

This movie is fun for all ages, and would be acceptable for anyone to watch. I enjoyed this movie very much, and will watch it throughout my lifetime. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good, funny movie. Anyone who likes funny movies needs to watch this movie, and its acceptable for all audiences.If I could recommend this movie to anyone, I would not. I would actally recommend this movie to everyone who is anyone.This movie is one of a kind, except for the sequel, so I guess its really two of a kind.This movie just plain rocks.",The Emperor's New Groove
267,tedh3962,Funniest Disney Film in YEARS! It's hysterical!,10,6 September 2002,"I still can't figure out why Disney didn't market this movie better. The script is fantastic and the performances by Eartha Kitt and Patrick Warburton as Yzma and her ""evil"" henchman are hilarious! I never tire of watching this film; Patti Deutsch (remember her on Match Game?) as the waitress is a knockout!Rent or buy this film! You won't regret it.",The Emperor's New Groove
268,pdxchris,Genius wrapped in a goofy-looking box,10,26 December 2008,"""The Emperor's New Groove"" obviously falls into one of two categories for most people: ""I Loved It"", or ""I Hated It"". There's a large segment of society that loves the simplicity and innocence of the Disney formula: Beautiful visuals, moralistic value-reaffirmation, and escapism. The millions of people that flock to their movies and to their theme parks are craving this type of entertainment.To these people, ""Emperor's New Groove"" didn't fit the mold. It was, bluntly, a Looney Tunes/Tom and Jerry/Woody Woodpecker full-length comedy movie dressed up from the outside like a Disney film. The trailers were hacked-up from the movie's previous incarnation as the epic drama ""Kingdom Of The Sun"", so they could be forgiven for not knowing that they would be seeing a 78 minute movie with the same level of entertainment as Wile E. Coyote getting an Anvil dropped on his head, or Daffy Duck being shot until his beak falls off by Elmer Fudd. They left the theaters somewhat justified in their disappointment and dislike of the film.But some of us... those of us that grew up on Television, on Saturday Morning Cartoons, on Fred Flintstone, Yogi Bear, Bugs Bunny, The Road Runner, JabberJaw, The Banana Splits... this was the movie from Disney that we'd all been waiting for. This was FUNNY. Not ""hmmmm, that was humorous and a good lesson to boot!"", but ""HAW HAW HAW KUZCO GOT A MOUTH FULL OF BEES!!!"". Humor for humor's sake. Laughter for laughter's sake. The characters were just that... CHARACTERS. We weren't expected to identify with any of them, we were just expected to laugh at (and with) them.How this movie made it past Disney Corporate in it's final form, I'll never know. I know that Disney had already sunk millions into ""Kingdom"", and wanted to get something, ANYTHING from their investment, and turned to Mark Dindal, who made the criminally underrated ""Cats Don't Dance"". The end result is unlike any other non-Pixar Disney movie ever: irreverent, hilarious, engaging.",The Emperor's New Groove
269,traian20,The best ever!!!,10,26 January 2003,"This movie is by far the best representation of the tragic-comic situation of real life change in the individual behaviour due to some divine inducted circumstances.This subtile ideea is presented in a glowie ,cartoon type, light,and makes you laugh every time you watch it.I watched this movie fourteen times and I never seem to get enough of it.Why is that?Because first time I've seen it I identified myself with Kuzco...A great emperor punished to become a lama ,due to his lack of heart and ignorance,and after he had seen the real life,to become once again that emperor,but now a wiser and more careing emperor. It's a great methafore of human condition.",The Emperor's New Groove
270,tamarapaas,A great watch if you need some comic relief,7,17 November 2019,"This isn't the best film Disney has ever made, but it is a great film if you need to wind down at the end of the day and you want to watch something light hearted. It's funny, the graphics are great and the voice acting is on point.",The Emperor's New Groove
271,gods-girl-487,My Favourite Ever!!,10,6 August 2011,"I absolutely love this movie! Go see it if you have not!!I don't know what people are talking about, saying it has no character, saying that it's not funny, and that the jokes are really lame. (Seriously, do you not have your sense of humour?) Some people are saying that only people under '6' will enjoy it. (HELLO! I am way over 6 and I absolutely adore this movie!) I especially love the Shoulder Angel/Devil guys. (""Oh, come off it."" ""YOU come off it!"" ""You."" ""You!"" ""You."" ""You infinity."" ""Grr..."")I really love this movie and I really hope you did too. If not, you are entitled to your own opinion, but I really think you should go to the doctor and get your humour checked. (If you didn't get that joke, you have absolutely NO sense of humour. Which is sad.)",The Emperor's New Groove
272,eastcoastlive,Strikes a good family balance.,10,11 April 2004,"This movie is a Disney staple in our home. Spades Kuzco provides the appropriate amount of trademark sarcasm and wit, along with the rest of the characters appeal to make a movie that hasn't gotten old yet. Most of the jokes are funny enough to make an adult laugh, but not too over the top to miss the kids. As was said in the behind the scenes on the DVD, most jokes are only funny the first time they are told, but many of the key scenes in this movie are funny every time ie: Waterfall scene, trotting out the ladies, and the diner scene. My impression is that there are many who wished that the ""Empire of the Sun"" version were made instead, desiring a more ""deep and meaningful or artistic"" movie, but for many, having only seen a few of what appear to be foreboding and dark themed cels, we are glad that it evolved into ENG instead. It is disappointing that Disney feels that it should shun this movie, in word and deed. Considering some of the junk that Disney had put out in the same time frame, the lack of available merchandising or exposure only serves to accent Disney's inexplicable self-directed sense of failure for this film.",The Emperor's New Groove

274,ladybug_klm,Llama's Rule!,10,10 July 2005,"Get ready for some knee-slapping, hilarious fun, because it's The Emperor's New Groove! This movie is awesome! Really, it is. What better animal to do a movie about than a cool, talking llama? I love everything about it. From the theme song, to the old guy who's pushed out of the window, to Kronk, Eesma and other funny things in it. I've seen this movie at least ten times, and enjoyed every minute of it every time. You'll love this movie and will want to see it over and over again, just like I have. Trust me, anyone will like it. Not just kids. I give a big 10 out of 10 stars, So take my word for it and go rent it!",The Emperor's New Groove
275,alaynamatthews,Great Movie for Family Night!,7,13 October 2015,"The Emporer's New Groove is a great movie to watch with your kids on a Friday night! It is about an emperor (Kuzco) who is accidentally turned into a llama by his jealous ex-adviser. Kuzco is left out in the wild trapped in a llama's body. As the movie goes on, his only hope to recapture his throne is with the help of one of the head villagers. He encounters many adventures. Kuzco must return to his palace before his adviser and her assistant kill him. This movie is filled with adventure and comedy. Although, Kuzco encounters many hardships, he overcomes them with hardwork, determination, and humbleness. The Emporers's New Groove is an awesome movie to show your young children to teach them important life lesson. I highly recommend this movie!",The Emperor's New Groove

277,adl291284,Disney's Quirkiest Film to Date,10,24 November 2005,"Think of Disney, what spring to mind. Sentimentality. All Dancing. All Singing. Talking Animals and Happily Ever After. Disreguard all those if you walk past Emperor's New Groove in the local Video store.Disney has gone completely against the grain in the funniest, quirkiest animated film I've seen.The story is about an egotistical Emperor (Kuzco) who's life turns upside down when his evil ex-assistant (Yzma) plots to kill him and take over his empire. Nothing is that simple of course, cue, the hilarious and frantic beginning, middle and end of a non stop roller-coaster ride. On this ride is also Pacha, a kind-hearted peasant who gets caught up in the misunderstanding.This is a film the entire family will enjoy due to the humour being more ""Simpsons"" like than the traditional Disney giggles.With a film that includes Smart-ass kiddies, twisted Squirrels and a docile yet lovable henchman, this film pushes all the buttons without having a sick bucket love story thrown in.And with 'Kronks New Groove' due out this December, I'll be the first in line to get a copy.",The Emperor's New Groove
278,vallejo086,One of Disney's greatest... and most underrated.,10,19 April 2006,"I first came in touch by chance. It was laying around my aunt's house and in my boredom I started watching it. By looking at th box I wasn't very amused (it was a story about a llama, how good could that be...) After the first 10 minutes of the movie I was laughing so hard that all my family joined me shocked by my reaction to a kid's movie. Well it isn't a kid's movie. It has a very fine and mature sense of humor in its dialog, some of which most children won't be able to grasp, yet for teens and adults its hilarious. Spade's ironic voice just fits perfectly in the roll. I first watched it when I was 16, know I am 20 and I still crack up ever time I watch that movie. If really want to see one of Disney's funniest, wittiest, cleverest and most underrated movies of all times, then here is your chance.",The Emperor's New Groove
