0,MartinHafer,Like what you'd expect if you had a group of teenage nerds make a sci-fi sex film.,3,21 May 2012,"""Barbarella"" is clearly not a very good film. The dialog and writing are dumb and much of the acting is dopey. However, I am sure it has a group of loyal followers, as there is a cheesy badness and sexiness that is pretty infectious. It looks in many ways like a sci-fi sex film made by a group of 13 year-olds--13 year-olds with an incredible sense of set design! It's so strange and silly that it's worth seeing at least once--but you might not want others to know you watched it, as their opinions about your taste might be seriously compromised! The film begins with the opening credits--and A LOT of Barbarella, as she appears to float naked in her space ship. For 2012, it's relatively tame but for 1968, it was a VERY hot scene--as are many throughout the film. Today, it might not even be seen as mild porn--more like a mild R-rated film. But, in 1968, it was mega-hot--but still quite silly!Barbarella is instructed by the President of Earth to look for Duran-Duran (also called 'Durand-Durand') and return him to Earth. Along the way, Barbarella has lots of adventures--most of which result in her losing her clothes and/or having sex. Some of the adventures do not--such as the group of crazed kids with flesh-eating dolls--but most everyone (men and women) else seems to want Barbarella and her body. A few of the weird things to look for are the blue bunnies, seeing Marcel Marceau in a SPEAKING role, killer budgies and a killer sex machine! As I said...the sort of stuff teenagers would probably find funny and stimulating! The ending is pretty dumb, but the way--and very anti-climactic. Overall, it's an amazingly stupid film that you can't help but watch because it's so silly and has such super-awesome bizarre sets and costumes (sort of like the products of the top designers of the day if they were on LSD). You just have to see this to believe it...and you still probably won't!",Barbarella
1,Leofwine_draca,"A film that tries too hard to be a cult classic, and fails spectacularly",3,16 October 2015,"I'm usually a fan of dated, camp science fiction movies but only when the camp is unintentional and not put on. Unfortunately with BARBARELLA, loads of effort has gone into making the film a camp comedy, one of those films you just know that the producers hope will be termed a ""cult classic"", and there's nothing I hate worse than a film which tries to be funny like that. This is the reason that BARBARELLA leaves me cold; it's a slow-paced, dated and extremely silly affair from beginning to end, more of a 60's fashion show than a real movie.I had been looking forward to watching this film for a while (Italian science fiction has always been an entertaining genre for me) but sadly the end result is a highly disappointing outing in '60s kitsch with little or no redeeming values for a modern audience. The best thing about the film are the imaginative and colourful sets, but these are countered by some appallingly dated special effects (the back projection in particular is awful) and a music score that really grates on the nerves with one or two dreadful songs.The plot is pushed so far into the background that it becomes non-existent, the film instead concentrating on the weird and wonderful characters that Barbarella (herself included) encounters on her journey. Most of the adventures are of the sexual variety, with Barbarella herself a highly sexual space creature - already in the opening credits we see her stripping naked from her spacesuit and then losing most of her clothes as the film gradually progresses along.Jane Fonda is plain annoying as Barbarella, although I'm positive that her style of acting was just what the doctor ordered, and her attempts at being sexy just do not work. Elsewhere, Euro-stalwart John Philip Law embarrasses himself as a blind angel - yes you heard me right. Meanwhile, we have French actors overacting, Milo O'Shea striving for the award for worst overacting as the baddie, and David Hemmings wasted as he stands around on the sidelines looking handsome. I had expected a lot more from director Roger Vadim than this silly, arty-farty look-at-me sci-fi comedy provides, and although I'm sure the film has an audience who enjoy this sort of thing, I know that I never can.",Barbarella
2,SnoopyStyle,sexy and campy,8,30 December 2014,"In the distant loving peaceful future, Earth astronaut Barbarella (Jane Fonda) is asked by the President to find Doctor Durand Durand who is lost in the Tau Ceti region. He is trying to create a weapon called the Positronic Ray. She cannot understand why anybody wants a weapon. She crashlands on a mysterious planet, taken by girls with sharp-teethed dolls and rescued by catchman Mark Hand (Ugo Tognazzi). He insists on having sex the old fashion way. Her ship malfunctions and burrows into the ground. She comes out next to a labyrinth and found by blind angel Pygar. His friend Professor Ping promises to repair her ship. Pygar tells her that Sogo is ruled by a tyrant. They have sex and he regains the will to fly. He flies her to Sogo. After some rough encounters with locals, they are captured by the Concierge who explains that the city is on top of a lake of Mathmos which runs on evil. She meets the Great Tyrant who actually saved her earlier. Resistant leader Dildano rescues her. She is captured by the Concierge who puts her into the Excessive Machine which drives victims to death by excessive sexual pleasure.This is a unique film of true deliberate campiness. It is over-the-top ridiculous. One cannot take this movie seriously. It can't be taken serious even as a comedy. It is filled with psychedelic silliness but the comedy is mostly done without good timing. This is simply a movie of pure sexual camp. The style is amazing. There is a heady mix of softcore porn and wacky psychedelic drug-induced fantasy.",Barbarella
3,claudio_carvalho,How Can I Reward You?,8,2 November 2013,"In a distant future, there is no more war or weapons on Earth, just love. The astronavigator Barbarella (Jane Fonda) is assigned by the President of Earth (Claude Dauphin) to seek out the scientist Durand- Durand (Milo O'Shea), who has invented the powerful weapon Positronic Ray, and vanished in the Tau Ceti area. Barbarella crashes in an icy planet and is saved by the catchman Mark Hand (Ugo Tognazzi) from an attack of dangerous dolls with razor teeth. Barbarella rewards him with sex and Mark tells that Durand-Durand should be in the city of Sogo. Now Barbarella begins a dangerous journey to save Earth from the dangerous Durand-Durand.""Barbarella"" is an erotic trash that is cult for people of my generation. Roger Vadim seems to be possessed by Ed Wood in this silly but funny movie, with Jane Fonda in the top of her beauty. Barbarella asking how she can reward those that help her is hilarious. The band Duran Duran was inspired by the villain Durand-Durand to give the name of the group. The last time I had seen ""Barbarella"" was on 01 May 2002 and today I have had lots of fun watching this movie again with my daughter. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Barbarella""Note: On 03 Oct 2017 I saw this film again.",Barbarella
4,classicsoncall,"""My energy box is completely dead"".",3,8 April 2016,"Now that I've finally seen it I'm kind of embarrassed to admit it. This film along with ""One Million Years B.C"" with Raquel Welch were a couple of the more highly publicized films of the mid-Sixties, neither one relying on much of a story to showcase it's lead actress. Watching today, I now know what I missed by not dropping acid during my college years. For myself, the only redeeming factor in checking out this flick was in directing me to learn how the British new wave band Duran Duran came up with it's name. I looked it up so you can to. Otherwise, the picture is more or less an hour and a half of soft porn interrupted by not much else. I did get a kick out of the scene when Barbarella got overwhelmed by all those parakeets and finches, a subliminal way that Jane Fonda's then husband and director Roger Vadim teased the male audience who might have wondered how she'd handle all those little peckers.",Barbarella
5,gavin6942,A Very Bizarre 1960s Science Fiction Adventure,6,1 April 2013,"In the far future, a highly sexual woman (Jane Fonda) is tasked with finding and stopping the evil Durand-Durand. Along the way she encounters various unusual people.What to say about this film? The only thing it can really be compared to is the ""Flash Gordon"" movie that came out much later. So, I guess if you like that film you have to give some level of respect to this one.I hardly know what to say... it is camp, it is kitsch, it is all that made the 1960s what it was. Some of it is just strange or bordering on exploitation. Other parts are a bit more clever. The idea of the music massage machine is rather clever, even if it went in a strange direction of part-sexuality and part-torture.",Barbarella
6,lee_eisenberg,They filmed it...they really filmed it.,5,15 January 2006,"By 5/10, I mean 10/10 if you like trashy, psychedelic skin flicks, 0/10 if you don't. As far as I can tell, ""Barbarella"" has no purpose other than to show off Jane Fonda's body. It's hard to believe that they filmed this, but somehow they did. She and John Philip Law had co-starred in ""Hurry Sundown"" the previous year; it's anyone's guess whether they want to be remembered for co-starring in that one or this one. But I think that it's pretty obvious that Milo O'Shea would prefer to be remembered for playing Friar Laurence in ""Romeo and Juliet"", and not for playing Duran Duran here. I'm sure that overall, Jane Fonda is embarrassed by this movie, especially since she became one of America's prime political activists over the next few years. Weird.",Barbarella
7,jboothmillard,Barbarella,5,21 November 2010,"I had seen a few clips of this film that made the leading actress an instant star, so I had to see the full thing, from producer Dino De Laurentiis (Flash Gordon, Hannibal) and director Roger Vadim (And God Created Woman). Basically it is the 41st Century, the year is 40,000, and after an in-flight anti-gravity striptease, astronaut Barbarella (Jane Fonda) is assigned by the President of Earth (Claude Dauphin) to find Doctor Durand-Durand (Milo O'Shea). The Doctor is the inventor of the Positronic Ray weapon which could threaten Earth and universal peace, so she goes to Tau Ceti and the city of Sogo, where sins are invented every hour. Over time and changing outfit after outfit, Barbarella encounters cannibalistic dolls, has penetrative sex with men instead of with Exaultation Transference Pills as a thank you for saving her life, and meets and starts falling for blind angel Pygar (John Phillip Law). There is a point when she meets the mysterious Concierge, not realising that he is Durand-Durand, who is in cahoots with The Great Tyrant, the Black Queen (Anita Pallenberg, dubbed by Joan Greenwood), a lesbian ruler who can make her fantasies come to life. After escaping both the Excessive Machine (sometimes mistakenly called the Orgasmatron), an organ instrument machine that kills you by giving you the pleasure of an orgasm, and a dream chamber, Barbarella still has to save the world. In the end, Barbarella activates a machine that destroys both Durand-Durand and the world they are standing on, but not without being saved by Pygar, along with the Tyrant, turned good. Also starring Blowup's David Hemmings as Dildano, Marcel Marceau as Professor Ping, Catherine Chevallier as Stomoxys, Serge Marquand as Captain Sun and Véronique Vendell as Captain Moon. It should be mentioned, in case you didn't already know, that this is indeed the film that inspired the name for the successful British New Wave band, Duran Duran. Fonda is pretty much the only reason to see this, she looks sexy in her skimpy costumes, and she is good at being the bimbo but you can't help but feel sorry that she turned down Bonnie and Clyde and Rosemary's Baby to be in it, it could have been Raquel Welch. It is a silly film that will appeal to space nerds and fans of the comic book, but on the other hand, it is gloriously psychedelic with its naff special effects, bizarre set pieces, and overall it an alright camp pantomime style cult science-fiction fantasy. Jane Fonda was number 98 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, the film was number 24 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments. Worth watching!",Barbarella
8,Woodyanders,A gleefully silly and sexy psychedelic 60's sci-fi camp delight,8,28 January 2007,"In the year 40,000 delectable hottie space nymph Barbarella (flawlessly embodied by the beautiful Jane Fonda at her most cheerful, yummy and desirable) goes to the planet of Lythion in search of missing renegade Earth scientist Duran Duran (a marvelously hammy Milo O'Shea) and his lethal ray gun. During her search Barbarella encounters rugged hirsute primitive Mark Hand (the charming Ugo Tognazzi), kindly blind angel Pygar (the excellent John Phillip Law of ""Danger: Diabolik""), vicious fanged killer dolls, daffy Professor Ping (an amusingly quirky Marcel Marceau), cute, but deadly little birds, the predatory lesbian Black Queen (a deliciously wicked Anita Pallenberg), and inept revolutionary leader Dildano (an extremely funny David Hemmings). Director Roger Vadim, working from a witty script co-written by Terry Southern, concocts a delightfully silly, lightweight and playful piece of total sci-fi kitsch, maintaining a bubbly, carefree and infectiously sprightly tone of complete frivolity throughout. Jane Fonda portrays Barbarella with a fresh, dewy, wide-eyed naiveté and sweet innocence which makes the character that much more sensuous, alluring and irresistible. Claude Renoir's lavish, vibrant, strikingly garish cinematography, the wonderfully catchy'n'fizzy soundtrack of groovy 60's rock tunes, Fonda's eye-popping opening credits anti-gravity striptease, the outlandishly colorful sets (Barbarella's spaceship has plush shagrug carpeting!), and a fantastic sequence with Barbarella shorting out Duran Duran's pleasure organ machine all add immensely to the blithely inane merriment. A real hoot.",Barbarella
9,Tweekums,A rather dated camp classic,6,10 July 2011,"If you watched the 1980 version of Flash Gordon and thought it was a bit too camp then Barbarella is not the film for you as it makes Flash Gordon look positively restrained! Set in the far future our eponymous heroine is sent on a mission by the President of Earth to find the scientist Durand Durand. He has invented the positronic ray; a weapon that threatens the peace that now exists throughout most of the universe. She heads to the planet where he was last seen but crash-lands. She soon learns that this is a far from safe place although there are some people who are willing to help her on her mission including an angel! Her mission will take her to a city ruled over by an evil tyrant who would happily have Barbarella killed but if she wants to complete her mission she will have to confront her.While this film is a camp classic it has plenty of flaws; much of the acting isn't great, the story is okay at best and the special effects have dated badly. Luckily Jane Fonda is delightful in the title roll managing to bring the necessary innocence to her roll even though she is almost always wearing fairly revealing clothes apart from in the famous opening sequence when she strips down from wearing a space suit to wearing nothing at all! Even that is fairly innocent by today's standards with the credits protecting her modesty most but not quite all of the time. If you like your sci-fi camp then this is a must see otherwise it is more of a curiosity from a more innocent age; sex is referred to but happens off camera, there is no swearing and nudity is limited to a very brief glimpse of Jane Fonda's breasts and backside so it shouldn't offend too many adult viewers.",Barbarella
10,ma-cortes,"Colorful Sci-Fi with psychedelic photography , bemusing situations and fun scenes",6,25 March 2013,"Comic Strip brought appropriately to life . Tremendous fun, amusing scenes , psychedelic frames and many other things . In the far future, the year is 40,000. The protagonist is a highly sexual woman named Barbarella (Jane Fonda , Sophia Loren turned down the title role) is tasked with finding and stopping the evil Durand-Durand (character famously inspired the band name of 1980s pop stars Duran Duran), a missing scientist (Milo O'Shea). Along the quite sexy way she encounters various unusual people . As Barbarella (whose costume was inspired by designer Paco Rabanne) travels to the evil city called SoGo, it is a reference to Biblical cities Sodom and Gomorrah. On her dangerous trip she teams with blind angel Pygar (John Philip Law), and fights the Great Tyrant (Anita Pallenberg) along with numerous sexual torture devices , but she has to save the world .Naif Sci-Fi plenty of colors , thrills , brilliant cinematography by Claude Renoir and fantastic images ; surprisingly, for such a diverse melange, it actually works. Knowingly Camp version of comic-book sci-Fi classic written by Jean Claude Forest . In the original comic, Barbarella was not a secret agent but an outlaw, and the movie omits some of the adventures she had on Lythion, including an encounter with an earlier villainess called the Gorgon, whose face changed into a duplicate of the face of anyone who looked at her. Unlike the other space movies of the time, this film emphasized sets and costumes rather than visual effects, and as a result its overall look dates less than many space operas of the late seventies/early eighties .Jane Fonda is simply unbelievable as gorgeous heroine , she plays a feisty Barbarella , a futuristic girl from Earth . The scenes during the opening credits where Barbarella seems to float around her spaceship were filmed by having Jane Fonda lie on a huge piece of plexiglas with a picture of the spaceship underneath her. It was then filmed from above, creating the illusion that she is in zero gravity. Performance-wise, everyone seems to be camping it up like an end-of-term pantomime, though Milo O'Shea somehow seems to give his villain a deliciously style . Barbarella was the first science fiction hero from the comics to be adapted into a feature film as opposed to a serial , Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers, her male predecessors, had only appeared in serials up to this point. A bit later on , there was realized by Mike Hodges ¨Flash Gordon¨ (1980) in similar aesthetic and a TV series titled ¨Buck Rogers¨ . Jolly and catching musical score , including commercial songs , by Charles Fox, who co-wrote the songs for this film, also wrote the theme song for another Sci/Fi flick of 1968, The Green Slime, and future Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour was one of the session musicians who performed the film's original score. The motion picture was originally directed by Roger Vadim who married Brigitte Bardot , in fact , the original author Jean-Claude Forest based the character of Barbarella on Brigitte Bardot - who ironically was director Roger Vadim's previous wife ; Vadim subsequently married Jane Fonda . However this film is listed among The 100 Most Amusingly Bad Movies Ever Made in Golden Raspberry Award .",Barbarella
11,BA_Harrison,Space out with Jane Fonda.,8,10 April 2020,"Before she got herself a bad haircut and angered many with her political activism, Jane Fonda was a 'sex kitten', appearing in her then-husband Roger Vadim's sci-fi fantasy adaptation of saucy French comic-book Barbarella. Opening with a revealing zero-gravity striptease, and sporting a variety of alluring outfits throughout, Fonda endures a series of silly psychedelic sexcapades as the titular space-babe, in a kitschy adventure that delivers loads of groovy visuals and plenty of titillation.Tasked with preventing evil scientist Durand-Durand (Milo O'Shea) from conquering Earth with his deadly positronic ray, Barbarella pilots her fur-lined spacecraft to Tau Ceti, the scientist's last known location. Upon leaving her ship, she is attacked by a gang of child twins and their mechanical, silver-fanged dolls. Fortunately, the 'Catchman' Mark Hand (Ugo Tognazzi) comes to her rescue, the lovely lady showing her gratitude by having sex with the lucky guy (who takes off his Wookie costume to reveal that he is just as hairy underneath).Barbarella then makes her way to the labyrinth that surrounds the city of Sogo, which is ruled over by The Great Tyrant (Anita Pallenberg). There she meets a blind 'angel' called Pygar (John Philip Law), who flies her to Sogo (after having sex with her in his nest), the city that taste forgot, where she has a run in with the tyrant, is almost killed by budgerigars, meets revolutionary Dildano (David Hemmings), who she has sex with, and finally meets Durand-Durand, who tries to kill her with pleasure by strapping her into his 'Orgasmatron'. Of course, the machine can't handle Barabarella's libido and catches fire. As Sogo burns, Barbarella escapes with Pygar and the Tyrant, leaving the mad scientist to face the Matmos, the lake of slime beneath the city that thrives on evil.This free-wheeling plot is pure nonsense, serving only to move our heroine from one erotic encounter to another, but the film's impressively gaudy visuals and Fonda's appeal - an irresistible combination of wide-eyed innocence and scorching sexuality - makes the film a tacky, tantalising delight to behold.",Barbarella
12,moonspinner55,"""She's a five-star, double-rated Astronavigatrix whose specialty is love!""",7,3 October 2005,"Assigned to locate errant scientist Durand-Durand on the decadent planet SoGo, futuristic Earth girl Barbarella encounters sexual deviants and the Black Queen's army, all eager to do her in. Sexual psychedelia based on the French comic (later translated and brought to America), this adult fantasy is very much in keeping with its source material--right down to the dialogue and set-designs. Too bad director Roger Vadim has a lethargic sense of pacing and practically no sense of humor. Scenes that should work don't, such as the evil chomping dolls or Barbarella's first meeting with Dildano (David Hemmings). There's groovy beauty in the design of this thing however, and Jane Fonda's deadpan comic performance as Barbarella is very special; although too brainy for a featherweight farce, Fonda is incredibly game and she gets in some amusing lines. Ugo Tognazzi (as the hairy hunk Mark Hand) is obviously dubbed--he sounds like a robot at Disneyland--but John Phillip Law is rather sweet as the blind angel Pygar and his flying/battle sequence with Jane in his arms is wonderful. There are few (if any) movies that look or sound like ""Barbarella""; it is truly one-of-a-kind, for better or worse. *** from ****",Barbarella
13,Quinoa1984,Vadim's giant celluloid erection for low-grade sci-fi comics and Jane Fonda,6,13 July 2008,"Barbarella is a movie so stuck in its times that a little man ala Mortal Kombat should've popped out in the lower right hand corner of the screen from time to time yelling ""SIXTIES!"" While it partially is like the father to the kind of far-out, crazy sci-fi that one would see in Heavy Metal comics, it's overall an article in bad moviedom that is by turns eye-catching, outrageous, fun, and f***ing weird. Roger Vadim, along with his cadre of screenwriters (one of them, who from time to time shows his imprint on the material, Terry Southern), has a giant starring vehicle for Jane Fonda to play as the title character, who's only motivation in the movie is to get aroused by different men and look for a madman named Duran Duran (no, not the band, that was later).Everything else involving a story is as shallow as a kiddie pool during a heatwave. There's some adventure with Pygar, an angel who's reminiscent of one of the boy-toys from Fellini's Satyricon, and some peril that Barbarella gets into, be it from walking dolls with metal shark teeth or from colorful birds ala Hitchcock in a cage, not to mention various scenes meant to titillate anyone who finds Fonda remotely attractive (and let it be said, she is absolutely stunning here, maybe too much so as she goes between various more-or-less revealing clothes and gets aroused either the ""old-fashioned"" way or through hand-to-hand touch with David Hemmings). For Fonda, it's a gay old time with her husband-cum-director coaching her on to be bigger-than-life, but always with a twinkle in her eye and a leg to spare.As for the film itself... damn if it isn't usually bad or dull or a combination of both. Yet it's a kind of absorbing, strange and 'did-they-just-do-that' badness that is somewhat reminiscent of the later 70s Zardoz, yet at least here nowhere near incoherent or muddled. Vadim does have some sort of vision, though it's surrounded by loads of very dated special effects that end up being a lot more enjoyable than they should be. An exuberance is put into the production, as well as the freaky production design, and certain visuals that make one wonder if Tim Leary visited the set as a consult (by the way, check for David Gilmour as guitarist in the score). It's a true product of its time, wacky and stupid and like a big wad of acid-flavored jolly ranchers found in a lighthearted porno shop: hence, of course, its cult status.",Barbarella
14,BandSAboutMovies,I saw this way too early,4,22 April 2020,"Shot directly after Mario Bava's Danger: Diabolik, this Roger Vadim-directed movie is based on the comic book of the same name by Jean-Claude Forest. The film stars Vadim's then-wife Jane Fonda as Barbarella, a United Earth agent sent to find scientist Durand Durand, who has created a weapon that could destroy humanity.Vadim was hired to direct this film after producer Dino De Laurentiis purchased the rights. This led to Vadim looking to cast several actresses in the title role, including Virna Lisi, Brigitte Bardot (that's who the character was originally based on) and Sophia Loren before ending up picking his wife.In case you're wondering why this movie is such a mess, Charles B. Griffith was the last writer to work on it, saying that he had done uncredited work on the script after fifteen other writers - including Terry Southern - worked on the movie.This film is packed with fashion, amazing sets - you can credit Bava's film for some of that, and great characters, like John Phillip Law as Pygar the angel, Anita Pallenberg (Performance) as the Black Queen, Milo O'Shea as Durand-Durand, Marcel Marceau in a rare speaking role as Professor Ping, David Hemmings (Deep Red) as Dildano and even cameos from Fabio Testi and Antonio Sabato (who was originally to play the role that Hemmings ended up doing).So yeah. This is a gorgeous film that makes no sense whatsoever. Is that such a bad thing?A sequel was planned with producer Robert Evans called Barbarella Goes Down, but it never happened. Nor did a 1990 remake, a Robert Rodriguez idea or a potential project with Nicolas Winding Refn, who moved on to other projects, saying, ""certain things are better left untouched. You don't need to remake everything.""",Barbarella
15,Coventry,All hail the queen of the Galaxy!!,8,6 May 2005,"Barbarella is quintessential cult-kitsch from cinema's finest decade  the psychedelic 60's  that still looks fresh and amusing, nearly forty years later. Roger Vadim's interpretation of the comic-book heroine's adventures is a feast for the eyes as the colorful designs and costumes still look splendid and exhilarating. Supposedly set around 40.000 years A.D., Barbarella is sent to the planet SoGo by no less then the President of the Republic Earth in order to bring back a brilliant (but naughty) astronaut, named Duran Duran. Before our lovely and minuscule dressed space-hottie gets there, she encounters many strange individuals and bizarre local traditions. She's assaulted by fiendish children who freak her out with vampire-dolls (by the way, this sequence gets my vote for the best part of the entire movie!), she re-discovers the act of physical love (and finds out how convenient it is when you need to get something done), falls in love with a blind angel, meets the underground revolutionary leader and eventually she's fancied by a lesbian Queen-Tyrant! Now I ask you: how can you not love all this?!? This film is very comical and light-headed. The music is fantastic and no woman ever looked so sexy as Jane Fonda does here (except maybe for Raquel Welsh in ""One Million Years B.C."" or Britt Ekland in ""The Wickerman""). The opening sequence, in which Fonda carelessly floats around her spaceship while stripping, is one of my favorite moments in cinema ever....for obvious reasons. The supportive cast is excellent as well, with a very 'cherubic' John Philip Law and David Hemmings as the confused revolutionary leader. A special word of praise goes out to Anita Pallenberg because she manages to look equally as yummy as Jane Fonda. Alongside Mario Bava's ""Danger: Diabolik"", this is probably the coolest film of the sixties. So, in case you haven't seen it yet, don't hesitate any further.",Barbarella
16,Theo Robertson,Some People Are Missing The Point,6,15 October 2003,"People who hate this movie seem to be missing the point . BARBARELLA is very much a product of the fantasy genre of the late 1960s . STAR TREK was still being produced while the most successful British import show THE AVENGERS was being shown on prime time American networks , to date the only British TV show to hold this distinction . Colourful fantasy was the order of the day .BARBARELLA is the personification of 60s content over style . The screenplay isn`t much to write home about as it`s just a series of cliff hangers strung together of the title heroine being menaced , a sort of PERILS OF PAULINE set in space . Yeah okay the acting isn`t Oscar winning material and the Euro-pap soundtrack can be slightly irritating but both the set design and costumes are memorable and what sort of red blooded man can resist a scantily dressed Jane Fonda ?Let`s just enjoy this movie as a piece of 1960s pop culture",Barbarella
17,Hey_Sweden,"An angel doesn't ""make love"". An angel IS love.",7,4 November 2018,"In the year 40,000, a stunningly attractive adventurer named Barbarella (Jane Fonda) is assigned by the President of the Republic of Earth (Claude Dauphin) to track down an evil scientist. This scientist has invented a weapon in an era of pacifism in this intergalactic society, and has disappeared into an area dubbed Tau Seti. Barbarella will have many interesting experiences, and encounter a rich variety of characters, such as winged man Pygar (John Phillip Law), a nasty but sultry villainess (Anita Pallenberg), and a sadistic Concierge (Milo O'Shea).The opening striptease by Jane (with the opening credits moved around to help obscure her nudity) may play a pivotal part in why this is so beloved as a cult classic 50 years later. But in truth, this off the wall science fiction tale is plenty goofy, enough so that the movie does have a real sense of fun going for it. It amps up its sex appeal and its psychedelic qualities to the nth degree, and its production design (by Mario Garbuglia) and cinematography (by Claude Renoir) are first-rate. Along with amusing special effects, this results in a non-stop assortment of futuristic and exotic eye candy. Based on a best-seller by Jean-Claude Forest, the script (bearing contributions by EIGHT credited individuals) contains some endearingly literate but silly dialogue.Jane is appealing, playing a character who is not all that heroic; she needs saving more than once, and often must rely on the help of others. Her wide-eyed innocence (and that of the likeable hunk Law) is contrasted by the lascivious qualities of the production and the delicious villainy of the characters played by Pallenberg and O'Shea. (Trivia note: a certain 80s rock band took its name from the name of O'Sheas' character.) Memorable contributions are also made by Marcel Marceau, David Hemmings (very funny as a comedy-relief revolutionary), and Ugo Tognazzi.Complete with a catchy, groovy score and songs (by Charles Fox and Bob Crewe), and Roger Vadim (Janes' husband at the time) directs with great style.Overall, quite engaging, although clearly not something to be taken seriously.Seven out of 10.",Barbarella
18,preppy-3,"""Decrucify the angel!""",6,21 January 2008,"Takes place in the year 4000. Barbarella (Jane Fonda) goes to a distant planet to find a scientist named Durand Durand and his ultimate weapon--the Positronic Ray. There she meets the blind, VERY hunky flying angel Pygar (John Phillip Law) and fights with the evil Black Queen (Anita Pallenburg) and her helper (Milo O'Shea).VERY much a movie of its time. Full of psychedelic ""special"" effects, ""mod"" clothes and truly astounding set designs. The plot here is not critical--it's just used as an excuse to see Fonda wandering into all these strange situations and people. The dialogue is (to put it mildly) pretty campy. Also Fonda is nude quite a lot (how this has a PG rating is beyond me) and there's a strong emphasis on sex. Her character is sexually active and she's not punished and doesn't apologize for it--that's a pretty refreshing attitude. Fonda still says to this day that she's proud of this and thinks it's a fun movie. Also Law is GREAT as the angel--all pumped up and just beautiful to look at. Gotta give the guy credit for pulling off a role where he has giant wings attached to him! There's some really lousy songs here too and the special effects are quite amusing.Is this a good movie? Not really, but it's just fun to look at and the dialogue has plenty of just hysterical lines. Turn off your mind and enjoy. A 6. By the way, the band Duran Duran got their name from this movie!",Barbarella

This French/Italian Production is a Post-Hays-Code Production that went with that New Found Artistic Freedom and never looked back. It looks Fantastic. No amount of Imagination or Color was spared and the Movie just Vibrates with Fun and Frolic.Jane Fonda became an International Icon with Her Role as a Sexy Aviatrix from Future Earth where War has been Eradicated and the Official Greeting from the Shapely Astronaut to the President of the Republic of Earth is, arm extended...palm out...""Love"". There is much to Love in this Psychedelic Picture and every Scene had an Artistic Aesthetic that is Founded in Mind Altering Drugs and Lava Lamps. The Costumes are so Bizarre that description Fails on just about any Level. There is Action and Violence, done with a Wink but there still remains a distinctive Bite.There are Flying Winged Angels that don't make Love, they ARE Love and have no memory. There is an Underground Revolutionary Group that Exists in a Secret Lair, with Secret Passages, Secret Radios, Secret Keys, Secret Codes, and most of all Secrets.It is just one Mind-Mesmerizing Scene after another and it is so Playfully Artistic that it cannot be anything but Gaudi, Trashy, and Tantalizing. The Movie is Funny and Sexy. A Cult Item to be sure.

20,poolandrews,"Garish & hideously dated Sci-Fi adventure, not without a certain charm though.",5,5 May 2005,"Barbarella starts with perhaps it's most well know scene. The scene where astronaut (it's actually never revealed what she is) Barbarella (Jane Fonda) performs a zero gravity strip tease in her fur lined spaceship. After this scene, which by todays standards seems very tame & unconvincing, Barbarella receives a call from the President of Earth (Claude Dauphin) who informs her that a scientist named Duran Duran (Milo O'Shea, really funny to hear a character called Duran Duran & apparently it's where the band got it's name from) has created a 'positronic ray' & that he has mysteriously disappeared, somewhere. The President enlists Barbarella to find Duran Duran & stop the 'positronic ray' from falling into the wrong hands. I should also point out at this point that Barbarella is set in the 40th century give or take a few years, sex has been abolished on Earth & replaced with pills & weaponry no longer exists. So, you see, because Duran Duran has created a gun he has put the entire universe in danger, or something like that. Barbarella is on the case & together with her talking spaceship sets off for 'Planet 16'. However Barbarella's spaceship is caught up in a magnetic storm & crashes, luckily on the correct planet. There she sees blue rabbits hopping around in snow & meets two twin sisters Stomoxys (Catherine Chevallier) & Glossina (Marie Therese Chevallier) who look about eight years old, one of the little monsters throws a loaded snowball at Barbarella's face which knocks her out. They tie Barbarella up & let their killer dolls with sharp metal teeth attack & bite her. Barbarella is saved by a guy named Mark Hand (Ugo Tognazzi) who teaches Barbarella how to make love the old fashioned way, he also helps her on her way & gives her a few useful bits of information. Next on her travels Barbarella meets a blind angel named Pygar (John Phillip Law) who lives in a nest in a place called the Labyrinth, there Barbarella also meets Professor Ping (Marcel Marceau) who says to find Duran Duran she has to speak with the 'Great Tyrant' (Anita Pallenberg) also known as the Black Queen who lives in the evil city of SoGo. As her journey nears it's conclusion Barbarella encounters all sorts of strange situations & people including becoming part of a revolutionary group lead by Dildano (David Hemmings), finding invisible keys & execution by being put in a cage with a load of vicious Budgies!Co-written & directed by Roger Vadim who was married to Fonda at the time, this French/Italian co-production hasn't stood the test of time that well & looks horribly dated. I'm not sure Vadim knows the meaning of the word subtle! The script had an amazing number of people credited as working on it, Vadim, Terry Southern, Vittorio Bonicelli, Clement Biddle Wood, Brian Degas, Tudor Gates & finally Jean Claude Forest, phew! That's seven screenwriters & Barbarella is in fact based on a French comic book. Maybe that's one of the reasons it's a bit of a mess, the comic elements more often than not fall flat on their face & don't work. The characters are sketchy at best, the dialogue is ridiculous at times & as a whole the story doesn't make a whole lot of sense. The required 'comedy relief' character is annoying. The film is an excuse for a scantily clad Jane Fonda to jump from one strange set piece to another. Having said that, Barbarella tells a somewhat simple story competently enough & provides a certain entertainment value. The production design credited to Mario Garbuglia needs to be seen to be believed, the sets, costumes & props are so garish, over-the-top & just plain hideous looking it's untrue. The special effects are among the worst I've ever seen & what makes it ten times worse is that virtually every scene has an effect in it, I don't mind bad effects usually but by the end it was extremely distracting & was getting on my nerves, a lot. Oh, & Budgies aren't scary or a particularly effective way to execute someone, you have to see this sequence to believe it! I hated the loud 60's music as well. The acting is nothing to shout about, frankly I'm surprised the actors involved were able to keep a straight face. Fonda looks pretty sexy in her ever changing outfits, don't expect a lot of nudity though. I can't quite decide weather I like it or not, on the one hand it looks terrible throughout & is extremely silly but on the other hand it's fairly entertaining to watch for those very reasons. At least it's not too boring or too long & it definitely has a certain camp charm about it, overall I'd say it's worth a watch as just a bit of mindless late 60's psychedelic fun!",Barbarella
21,CinemaSerf,Her name is Rio and she dances on the sand....,5,12 April 2020,"I can't help but wonder what Jane Fonda might think if she were to look back on this sexy sci-fi nonsense from 50 years ago. It is not alone in being terrible - there were plenty of drug-induced/enhanced films made in the late 60s so as to render this particular effort indeterminable from many others; but the fact that Fonda took on this role as an intergalactic space cadet on the search for ""Durand Durand"" and his (euphemistic ?) ""Positronic Ray"" is what is astonishing. The script is dreadful, the props buyer obviously didn't have the budget to stretch beyond paper mâché and bubble-wrap and the synthesised music is only marginally more interesting than that you might have heard in a Soviet lift around the same time. John Philip Law was already in his 30's when he agreed to dress in a large nappy and don some huge angelic wings as ""Pygar"" and Anita Pallenberg ""The Great Tyrant"" was pretty much never seen on screen again. It has acquired cult status, but as is usual with most similarly described films - nobody is ever truly sure why...",Barbarella

Jane Fonda's looks and nonchalant-yet-effervescent performance help too.I imagine it worked even better when it was released. The movie was made at the height of psychedelia and it has the right ingredients to capture that zeitgeist: bright-colour-filled, fantastical, trippy sets and plot and free love.

This was a really big deal to 15-year-old me, because naked boobs were in pretty short supply. Plus I wasn't old enough to get in, but I pretended and it turned out OK. Turns out I loved the film anyway. I wasn't familiar with Forest's comic (en Francais, n'est pas?) as the source material until later, and I've still not seen more of the original than the odd page here and there, although I understand that some of it is due into reprint sometime soon. What did I love? The damn silliness of the whole thing. The sinister biting dolls sequence. The fact that Professor Ping was a dialogue part for celebrated French mime artist Marcel Marceau who was otherwise famously mute, although I believe his dialogue was dubbed. The visual design - some great visual concepts in there. John Philip Law's blind Pygar. The Matmos - an excellent idea. Milo O'Shea's Duran Duran - not featured in the credits, and I've never known why. The vile labyrinth. The sex scene with David Hemmings' Dildano (a name I didn't fully appreciate at the time). Anita Pallenberg's wicked Queen (again, dubbed I suspect). Above everything else, the music. After I'd got over my delight at Jane Fonda's opening credits strip, I bought the album (Stateside records over in the UK). I played that record until I wore the grooves off it, and I was delighted to be able to replace it with a CD a year or so ago. Music by Charles Fox and Bob Crewe (backstage boys with the Four Seasons), it has a wonderfully eclectic and atmospheric collection of tracks, ranging from cod classic to jazz/rock, with some of the fastest sustained drumming I've ever heard in the Sex Machine piece. And two or three great songs, of which An Angel is Love is probably the best. Very much a product of its time, there is still a great deal in the movie to enjoy.

However, before she is able to get there her spacecraft encounters a magnetic storm and crash lands on an unnamed planet where she is almost killed by a small group of children who inhabit that particular area. It's then that she is rescued by a man named ""Mark Hand"" (Ugo Tognazzi) whose profession consists in capturing these children and bringing them back to civilization. Grateful for his help, she then provides sexual favors to him before setting out for the city of Sogo where Durand Durand is rumored to live. Unfortunately, she subsequently encounters even more assorted problems along the way. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an unusual science-fiction movie which suffered greatly from its uneven nature. For starters, Jane Fonda was quite sensational both clothed and semi-nude. On the other hand, however, the dialogue and erratic plot could have used substantial improvement.

But, Barbarella is really one of Roger Vadim's excuses to exploit his then-wife, Jane Fonda, in a ton of sexual situations and skimpy outfits.Joined by John Phillip Law, Anita Pallenberg, Milo O'Shea, Marcel Marceau, and Claude Dauphin, Jane Fonda traipses around outer space and various planets in ridiculous, if not adorable, costumes and shows the audience that the future is one giant sex party. She strips down in the opening credits, just to warn off squeamish viewers, and battles bad guys who literally use sex to kill people. Obviously, unless you're a thirteen-year-old boy, you're not going to take this movie seriously. It's incredibly stupid, but depending on your point of view, you might get a few laughs out of it.I didn't really like the movie—it was just a little too ridiculous for my taste—but if you want to see Jane Fonda prance around in go-go boots and a leotard, you can rent it.

27,Aaron1375,Almost worth the watch for the orgasmatron scene alone.,5,10 March 2010,"This was not a great science fiction epic by any stretch of the imagination. It was kind of goofy, the story kind of preachy at times, but some scenes worked rather well and they did a rather good job on set designs and such too. The end result a movie that borders on soft core porn at times. From the opening sequence of Jane Fonda flying around weightless and naked, to the encounter with the fur guy and angel, and finally her wonderful scene as she must face down the machine of pleasure it is rather interesting to watch this film try to pass itself as anything other than a soft core porn film that does not show much in the way of skin after the first scene. The plot is some inane drivel that has Barberella going after a scientist named Duran, whose name would later be used by the British rock band twice. She must traverse a lot of obstacles with the machine the oragasmatron being the most memorable. Though there is a rather good scene where she runs into some creepy children that set their dolls with nasty teeth on her and this scene is better than most horror movies where dolls are the culprit as these things look sufficiently creepy. The movie could have been a bit more risqué, I mean as far as they went you might as well had more nudity and just went all out. The plot goes here and there at times too. Still, it has some good scenes within. I see they are making a remake, but watch them make a PG-13 yawn fest that does not excite and titillate, but instead bores us and makes for good insomnia medicine.",Barbarella

Still, her sex-kitten naiveté is rather charming, and does provide mileage worth of amusement.

Insignificant, of course, and yet it is good to have some souvenir from that period of the sixties when all became so psychedelic and LSD influenced. For a couple of years everything seemed to have an hypnotic swirl of crazy colours and we now look back with wonder at some of the dresses, shoes and advertising. Well, here it all is, non stop plus that free love element, a moment when beautiful young girls could be beautiful young girls and nobody (well, hardly anyone) complained. The now 'responsible' and prissy seeming Jane Fonda just has to glance back at this now and again and be so pleased that someone caught her so beautifully in her heyday.",Barbarella
30,JamesHitchcock,Just What Were They On?,6,6 December 2010,"Just what were they on? ""Barbarella"" is one of those sixties films (the Beatles vehicle ""Help!"" is another) which, although it makes no explicit references to the decade's drug culture, nevertheless leaves the indelible impression that the director, the scriptwriter, the set designer, the costume designer, the cameramen and most of the cast were under the influence of mind-expanding drugs throughout the entire shooting period.I first saw the film at university in the early eighties when a student film society organised a screening. Interest in it at that time may have been aroused by the release in 1980 of ""Flash Gordon"", another ultra-camp science fiction film which was undoubtedly influenced by it, and by the fact that one of the leading British pop groups of the era had called themselves Duran Duran in homage to their origins in a now-defunct Birmingham nightclub called Barbarella's.The film is based on a French series of comic books, which I must admit I have never read. (Unlike, say, the ""Asterix"" or ""Tintin"" series, the Barbarella comics have never had much of a following in Britain). The action takes place in the 40th century. Barbarella, a beautiful young female astronaut, is ordered by the President of Earth to travel to the planet Tau Ceti to find a scientist named Durand Durand, from whom the band took their misspelled name. Durand is the inventor of a weapon known as the Positronic Ray, which the President fears may fall into the wrong hands.The rest of the film is taken up with Barbarella's increasingly bizarre adventures on Tau Ceti. She goes ice-skiing across the planet's frozen surface, pulled along by an octopus-like creature, is menaced by flesh-eating dolls with razor-sharp teeth, seduces a blind angel (or ""ornithanthrope""), meets the predatory lesbian Queen of a decadent city and survives an attempted execution by means of an ""orgasmatron"", a machine designed to kill by an excess of sexual pleasure. (Barbarella's capacity for sexual pleasure is so great that she blows its circuits). We are not, of course, meant to take any of this seriously; the whole thing is intended as a sort of tongue-in-cheek exercise in high camp surrealism, Salvador Dali meets Edna Everage. The surreal nature of the film is emphasised by the use of psychedelic lighting effects. (The opening song even includes the rhyme ""Barbarella Psychedella"").Barbarella is played by Jane Fonda, who at the time was married to the director Roger Vadim, clearly a man with the knack of attracting beautiful women. (He had previously been married to Brigitte Bardot and had been the lover of Catherine Deneuve). I wonder if, when Fonda was taking her wedding vows, she realised that Vadim's interpretation of ""for better or for worse"" included casting his wife in eccentric films like this one. Her devotion to her wifely duties seems to have been at the expense of her career; she later revealed that her commitment to ""Barbarella"" meant having to turn down the leading roles in two more serious films, ""Bonnie and Clyde"" and ""Rosemary's Baby"". Moreover, many of the heroine's adventures seem to have been designed with the express purpose of showing off Fonda's figure in a series of provocative outfits, leaving her with a lasting ""sex kitten"" image. This was something she was never comfortable with, especially when she was trying to reinvent herself as a feminist and left-wing activist a few years later.This is far from being Fonda's best film, yet she is about the only cast member who emerges with any credit from it, playing the heroine as a sort of wide-eyed innocent abroad. John Phillip Law, who plays the ornithanthrope Pygar, is so wooden that I wondered if he was under instructions to play his role with a deliberately deadpan lack of emotion. David Hemmings as the resistance leader Dildano shows us just why his career never really took off in the way it was expected to after his early breakthrough in ""Blowup"". (Hemmings's costume, looking like a pair of leather Y-fronts, is just as bizarre as anything worn by Fonda). Marcel Marceau shows that his talents as a mime did not extend to acting in spoken roles. Anita Pallenberg, better known for her relationships with several members of the Rolling Stones, was cast as the wicked Queen, but Vadim did not trust her to speak her own lines; the Queen speaks with the unmistakable contralto tones of Joan Greenwood.""Barbarella"" was a failure on its release, both at the box office and with the critics, yet despite the dodgy acting and the nonsensical plot it has since 1968 acquired the status of a cult movie. (Even back in my student days it was regarded as sort of historic artifact). Cults, whether religious or cinematic, can be baffling to everyone except ardent devotees, yet I must confess that I have a soft spot for this surreal relic of the hippie era. It is an ideal film to watch when returning from the pub late at night. Particularly if one is drunk. 6/10",Barbarella

BARBARELLA, a French-Italian co-production, directed by Frenchman Roger Vadim and starring his then-wife Jane Fonda as the titular heroine, presented in an unspecified future, it is as outlandishly lavish of its setting, as goofily puerile of its bare-bones story. The opening gambit introduces Barbarella, an earth astronaut, strips herself from her space suit inside under the zero-gravity environment, against Seurat's famous pointillistic painting, a pastiche of high art and low pleasure to pander to audience's sensorium rams home immediately. Barbarella is sent to a galaxy far far away to look for an earthling named Durand Durand, an inventor of a deadly weapon which the President of Earth (Dauphin) thinks might fall into wrong hands. Her adventure consists of a nexus of chance encounters with various characters on the 16th planet of Tau Ceti, as a hapless and somewhat dimwit, but perennially spirited damsel-in-distress, saving from the assault of creepy dolls with razor-sharp teeth controlled by evil kids by the hirsute Catchman Mark Hand (Tognazzi), she consents to Mark's love-making proposal, not the pill- inducing high-tech consummation, but the old-fashioned way, which turns out to be quite toothsome, please, suspend your disbelief! Further on, she meets a blind angel Pygar (Law) who has lost the will to fly, Professor Ping (French mime icon, Marcel Marceau), an outcast living in a slipshod labyrinth, the leader of the resistance Dildano (Hemmings), the Great Tyrant and Black Queen of Sogo (Pallenberg), and her devilish concierge (O'Shea), Barbarella uses sex as a means to express her gratitude, Mark aside, she cannot keep her hands off the Adonis-like Pygar and through sex, she endows him the renewed strength of flying, and with Dildano, their coiffure-remodeling palm sex is so otherworldly steamy that it stuns an awkward bystander. The only savior she doesn't reciprocate in putting out is the one-eyed wench, the Great Tyrant in disguise, although lesbianism is explicitly hinted (the Tyrant keeps referring her as ""Pretty Pretty"") to tease out the male gaze. In the main, sex is Barbarella's strongest suit, in a crashingly bawdy episode, her unquenchable sexual drive can even render the infamous orgasm killing machine overload, in a way, sex becomes her lethal weapon eventually, which prefigures a forthcoming era of sex liberation. Mario Garbuglia's production design is as outré as one can imagine, along with Fonda's wardrobe showcase, while the film's rough-hewn special effect inevitably looks like a child's play, but together they confer a retro, varicolored splendor to today's spectators in the face of the props' overtly tacky tangibility. The plot is the film's underbelly, a rushed ending is atrociously wheeled out, but Fonda, in her most gratuitously sexed-up endeavor, delivers an open-faced seriousness and immediacy, she really cares to find out Durand Durand! However barmy it seems, at any rate, BARBARELLA doesn't shortchange its source material, a low-brow cartoon wallows in its high kitschy style with admirable candor, aka, the spirit of space camp!",Barbarella
34,Red-Barracuda,"Classic, shamelessly entertaining sci-fi adventure",10,25 November 2010,"I used to not be able to fully decide what to make of Barbarella. I couldn't decide decide if it was a delirious camp classic or a shambolic mess. But over the years and after umpteen viewings I have come to the conclusion that it is, frankly, absolutely brilliant.To describe Barbarella as a trash classic would be neither disrespectful nor untrue. Its aesthetics are all cheap and tacky, and it has no hidden depths whatsoever. It revels in its superficiality. The story is about an intergalactic government agent called Barbarella who is sent to a distant planet to locate a character called Durand-Durand who has gone AWOL with plans for a destructive super-weapon. She is helped along the way by a series of men whom she rewards with sex. She doesn't really do much other than get captured, rip her clothes, have sex and get captured again.Jane Fonda plays the central vixen and she is smoking hot. The opening strip-tease is probably what the film is most famous for and it is a gloriously cheeky way to get things going. Throughout the story Fonda's clothes get ripped and she has to constantly slip into new revealing outfits. I'm obviously not going to complain about any of this, the playful erotica is the film's chief strength. Fonda is pretty funny in the role and her excellent wide-eyed and knowing portrayal makes the character simultaneously more innocent and more sexy. She was one of the top screen beauties of the 60's and this film illustrates this point pretty clearly if any proof was needed. David Hemmings is also noteworthy in a role where he displays great comic acting in his portrayal of a revolutionary leader. Lastly there is also a very memorable turn from Anita Pallenberg as The Great Tyrant. She adds a contrasting style to Fonda, with her dangerous goth-like assertive bad girl being a nice alternative.The soundtrack to the film ranges from great lounge grooves such as the title track, to psychedelic rock. As I mentioned earlier, the sets are cheap and ridiculous, and the special effects are of the lava lamp variety but overall there is at least a consistency of feel that means that it all works within itself. After all, like all sci-fi, Barbarella is only a version of the time it was made. It's really a version of the late 60's with its psychedelic leanings. Because of this it'll never really ever grow old, instead it'll always be of it's time. Quite honestly...this is awesome fun.",Barbarella
35,sddavis63,Quintessentially 60's,4,26 December 2017,"I have to say that this is watchable from pretty much beginning to end. As a matter of fact the opening title sequences - which may be the sexiest title sequences ever made as Jane Fonda floats around half-naked in some sort of zero gravity environment - ensure that you're probably not going to take your eyes off this (at least if you're a straight male) for the rest of the way. Yes, it's a movie in which there are many young and attractive female characters in the background (and Jane Fonda front and centre) who spend much of their time in various states of undress. Admittedly it's pretty tame by today's standards (really nothing more than toplessness) but definitely aesthetically appealing! (And for the straight women out there there's also half naked angel Pygar!) There is a story to this. Fonda is Barbarella, sent by Earth to find mad scientist Durand Durand (and yes, the rock group Duran Duran took their name from the character Durand Durand in this movie!) and experiencing various adventures along the way. It's not an especially good story, the special effects are quite primitive - even laughable - and the script leaves a lot to be desired. But it's quintessentially 1960's stuff in so many ways.It seems to pay tribute to various entertainment genres that were all the rage at the time. Sci-fi had started to hit big time with shows like Star Trek. There was the secret agent out to save the world (or in this case maybe the whole universe) like James Bond. The was the campiness seen in TV shows like Batman - and Barbarella's turn in the Pleasure Chamber seemed like a soft core version of the various traps Batman and Robin would be subjected to. Some scenes are the epitome of pyschedelic, and there's a few scenes featuring a few apparently high characters smoking - well - something.Apparently a number of actresses (including Brigitte Bardot and Sophia Loren) had been considered for the title role, but Fonda was well cast. She was well known but not quite as famous as Bardot or Loren, who probably wouldn't have agreed to some of the more ""revealing"" scenes Fonda did. And Fonda played the whole thing with this sort of wide eyed innocence that really made the film all the more enjoyable. It's not a good movie by any means. But it is an interesting movie - or, at least, it's a movie of interest that certainly isn't unpleasant to watch, even if it is hopelessly a product of its time. (4/10)",Barbarella
36,lost-in-limbo,"Bold, trashy and psychedelic entertainment!",8,12 June 2005,"In the year 40,000 a beautiful young astronaut named Barbarella is given a mission from the president of earth to find a young scientist called Duran Duran who has created a dangerous weapon and to use all her talents to bring him back and stop the weapon falling into wrong hands. This means by getting the job done by any type of means. She crash lands on the planet Lythion and comes across strange beings, some good and others evil.A real Cult Classic!!!! This guilty pleasure of mine is a real campy, charming and outlandish Sci-fi adventure that's based from a comic strip. It truly reminisces the spirited era of the 60's with kitsch, eroticism and psychedelic overload. It might be rather tame and dated by today's standards, but the premise is clearly charged with zest, beauty, humour and an awe of imagination that somehow draws you into this marvellously vivid fantasy. The mellow film is nothing incredibly grand or special, but the campy feel of it seems to work on so many levels. The stunning opening sequence captures the essences of the film beautifully and shows what we are going to see throughout the running time. It simply flows with originality.There are some creative designs and gizmo's that pop up in the film. From weird sexual pleasure devices, her spaceship with fur interior and inventive technology. Cheap and hokey special effects are potent in the mood and charm of it, as the unusual backdrop and story probably comes across as one big LSD trip. Good imagination went into set designs and props. It's terrifically shot and colourful to the extreme, with sequences of swirling colours just like in a lava lamp. The planet where the film takes place on is atmospherically glossy and visually impressive, from the ice fields, the Labyrinth and the City. Each time the scenario changed so did the backdrop of the world, ranging from vibrantly fresh and richly layered scenery that was fairly eye catching. The groovy soundtrack goes well with the set up. The score when in effect was upbeat and very psychedelic in depicting the mood and flair of the situation. The costume designs had a lot of weird and rather out their fashion statements, where a lot of skin is shown, especially Fonda's wardrobe as she basically changes into many different skimpy outfits.The performances from the cast were adequate enough, because the hammy and rather mundane performances went in hand to hand with the context of the film. The ludicrous characters were interesting from their distinguishing personalities and features. Now the luscious Jane Fonda was perfect in the role and was rather fetching eye candy as Barbarella. Her character oozes with sex appeal and beauty. The supporting roles were solid enough. John Phillip Law is good as the blind angel Pygar. Anita Pallenberg shines as The Great Tryant. Milo O'Shea is impressive as the earth scientist Duran Duran. David hemming is amusing as Dildano and Marcel Marceau as the helpful Professor Ping. Cheesy, witty and quotable dialogue fills every scene. Sometimes is does come across as a lot of mumbo jumbo or pointless dribble. But still it has strong appeal to it all. Barbarella gets all the best lines.While there is a lot of style, there is no real substance behind the story. The flawed plot is nothing much, as there is not much of one. The film moves from one sequence to another without any real cohesion or urgency and that achieves some tedious spots of too much talk and dwelling on nothing of importance. Some of these moments were favoured over the sorely underused and eye catching background features. You can say there was more talk than lively action. There were only small patches of it and some action towards the end, but for me that didn't take away from the film. It was hardly repetitious and rather unforeseeable storytelling. Add in some fun and amusing scenes involving malevolent kids with evil dolls, bizarre space beings, an angel, killer budgies and a lot of erotic pleasure and fixations. How could you not have fun watching this camp? Well, what can I say it's so bad that it's good cheesy and sleazy fun that will raise a smirk here and there. Just don't expect any logic to it all.",Barbarella
37,bowmanblue,One of the cheesiest films ever made,7,4 January 2015,"To enjoy 'Barbarella' you probably better put the 'feminists' arguments' against this film to one side and simply enjoy it for what it is... something totally silly. Does it degrade and/or exploit women? I don't know. I can see both sides of the story; I just choose not to think of it.Basically, if you don't know, it's a science fiction film with more than a few shades of 'soft p*rn' added for... well, good measure? Our heroine is the scantily-clad titular Barbarella – a member of Earth's space police who is given the task of hunting down a rogue scientist on a desolate planet. Along the way she encounters all manner of weird and wonderful characters, all of which are dressed equally provocatively as our fair maiden.If you're going to be totally realistic then you have to admit that Barbarella is a pretty awful film. The dialogue is terrible, the plot is wafer-thin and the special effects aren't that special (not including the costumes – as most guys may consider the costumers pretty special). But then it knows it's not a great film. It doesn't try to be. And, the reason it's still talked about today is because there will always be an audience who can appreciate 'bad' films and take delight in them.Don't go into this expecting anything other than a daft, slightly saucy, space adventure (and I'm told that the real 'hard scenes' were left on the cutting room floor). As long as you know what you're in for you should enjoy this film. It's not meant to be viewed as a great, intellectual work of art.Also, kudos for the genuinely creepy 'doll scene' – it's pretty nasty.",Barbarella
38,gbill-74877,"Campy, wild, and disappointing",6,2 September 2021,"As the opening credits roll, Jane Fonda does a striptease while floating in space, and that tells you a lot about what Barbarella is about. We'll see her in various skimpy outfits over the course of the film, with a nipple here, a sideboob there, bending over, on all fours, etc. Her character will be blissfully introduced to sex the ""old fashioned way,"" sucks on a hookah containing ""man's essence,"" and gets strapped in to an orgasmic ""excessive pleasure"" machine meant to execute her (which she naturally short-circuits). It's mostly adolescent male fantasy set to wildly campy visuals that seem inspired by an acid trip, which isn't too surprising given it originated from a comic book in the 1960's.One of the troubles for me is Fonda just doesn't look all that comfortable playing this part. There's a spark of joy missing, maybe because she knew it was exploitation and frankly beneath her, or maybe because of her relationship problems with husband/director Roger Vadim. There's an awkwardness here, with Fonda and the rest of the cast caught in some strange limbo between really playing up the sexual aspects, the silly comedy, and the science fiction story, which resulted in uniformly poor performances and a film that ended up rather weak in all respects. The awkwardness is undoubtedly part of the cult appeal the film has, along with how it captures so much of a trippy era, and it did hold my interest over its runtime. I wondered what more they would have Fonda do while watching it, marveled over the creativity in the sets, and laughed out loud and how bad it was, ultimately finding it as disappointing as it was fascinating.",Barbarella
39,The-Sarkologist,Psychedelic Silliness,5,28 January 2020,"There seems to be some movies that end up defining actors, some of them good, some of them bad. Well, unfortunately for Jane Fonda it seems as if she landed up in one of those bad roles. In fact, it sounds as if she had the unfortunate experience of not only making this movie, but being unavailable for some other films. Though I probably shouldn't say that it necessarily harmed her career since she did go on to win some Academy Awards. Yet, this film certainly isn't one that I suspect that she is all that proud of.Look, if you are looking for some science-fiction masterpiece then this is certainly not it, not even in the realm of the films at the time. However, if you are looking for some psychedelic experience, one of those films that just seems to be incredibly way out and strange, then I'm sure that you are going to appreciate this one. Like, seriously, this film has an angel as a main character (though it is only Barbarella who refers to him as such). Then there are scenes where she is placed in a machine that is designed to induce so much pleasure in her that she will die, but ends up destroying the machine instead.I do believe that there is some cult status attached to this film, and in a way I'm not all that surprised. In fact, it is one of those films that occassionally appears in cinemas that tend to appeal to those who appreciate the cult classics. It certainly does have that really pyschedelic, counter-cultural sixities feel about it, especially with Barbarella's mission to stop an evil scientist that seeks to bring war back to the galaxy.Yet there are certainly some strange things about it, such as the Lesbian tyrant, the fact that Earth has done away with sex, and only uses pills to generate such pleasure, and of course Barbarella gets to experiences the physical act, which also sort of suggests the changing nature of society (I get the feeling the whole claim of psychological connections is a hint towards the concept that sex should only occur in marriage, not that this was really the case, even in the 50s).Look, it certainly isn't one of those films that I'd be watching again in a hurry, though it does has some interesting aspects about it. Also, it is definitely quite dated, though in a way it still has some cult attachment to it. Yet, considering the response to others it really does appear as if people either don't quite get it, or if they do, they just, well, can't be bothered with it.",Barbarella
40,johnnyboyz,"""Genius is mysterious"" so says a character at one point; Vadim's 1968 film is most certainly mysterious, but it is a long way from being anything better than plain awful.",4,17 May 2011,"Director Roger Vadim's disastrous; quite agonising and really rather terrible on several different levels 1968 film Barbarella is a shaggy, pathetic and wholly bad in ways one must see to believe piece; a piece exploring that of a lead whom is about as much use as a secret agent as a chocolate orange is to somebody on a diet of fruit. The film is stuck between being a cheap, scuzzy, sleazy, nudey picture with sadomasochistic overtones wanting to go down the exploitation route and a space adventure romp in the vein of, with hindsight, something like Star Wars or whatnot arriving with collections of fruitful beings; creative characters not of this world and that extensive sense of adventure and risk. To say it fails on both fronts is to do it a service by holding back the criticisms; Vadim's film a quite shocking, inept display of everything at once combining to form nothing – a film whose greatest sin you might say is just how dreadfully dull it is given its premise as well as the sorts of content that transpire throughout.We begin with what is effectively a striptease, the titular character disrobing several garments whilst floating nice and neatly in a small space craft up somewhere in the atmosphere. The music quite literally sighs as this person removes what she no longer needs to wear, the titles that come up on the screen in this, the opening credits sequence, appear to stumble and float about as if themselves aware of this beautiful creature before them and as a result react awestruck. The character is that of Jane Fonda's titular, and it does not take Vadim much time to establish what it is we're dealing with in the form of Fonda; the providing us with shots of practically every part of her body ranging from feet to hands to hair during this opening firmly establishing a sense fetishism at work. At the time of shooting, Fonda was Vadim's wife; that rather grotesque sensation of men shooting their wives on film in that objectified and rather arrogant manner, essentially advertising what it is they have that nobody else does, whilst in the process playing up to the actresses' off screen star power in their beauty. The whole practise calls to mind some more contemporary instances; principally in the form of Len Wiseman's enfettering of his wife Kate Beckinsale in the Underworld movies, or, judging by the promotional shots of a few years ago, Alex De Rakoff's inclusion of wife Monet Mazur in 2009 film Dead Man Running.The opening credits end and the film kicks into gear; we're in an ugly little space ship locale grossly juxtaposed with the photogenic individual we have on screen, mess and nonsense all over the walls of this, a set with minimal effort put into it to mask the surroundings making it difficult to know what to focus on amidst the disparate array of predominantly orange hues and woolly sheets going with what looks like tin foil. On a large screen in this pod appears The President of Earth, no less; the film wasting no time in getting to the crux of the matter in delivering a terrible process of exposition detailing that in this, the era of no weaponry and no wars, somebody has been clever enough to go out and invent one - one powerful enough to do some serious damage but has consequently crashed landed and gone missing with it on their person: we wouldn't want the weapon falling into the wrong hands now, would we? Info in mind, Barbarella zooms off to the planet of Tau Ceti to try and track the weapon's inventor and foil any nastiness that might arise.At the heart of this pretty standard adventure story, where all one needs is a pretty standard but strong protagonist to drive things onward and reassure us in their ability; what we get is a mere buffoon. Barbarella's first job, upon landing on Tau Ceti, is to essentially be overwhelmed and then tricked by some mere infants before being near-enough killed by them: death by dollies with razor teeth! A later instance with a rather hairy man initially there to help out sees her easily seduced and then bedded, neither doing much to assure us in her overall ability to essentially save the known universe. Her adventures eventually come to see the film agonisingly weave her into situations that, on occasion, demand she change her entire wardrobe; the film compensating to allow Fonda to practically step into each new scene, and each time a poorly trussed up set, wearing a fresh outfit designed to extenuate her figure and looks. It is ironic that, for all the beauty on show, the film is one of those deeply crass and wholly ugly examples of women allowed to drive a project but must suffer punishment in the process by way of wearing attire that brings the study of female empowerment right back down to its pseudo roots: see the aforementioned Underworld as another example.Things unfold, the odd instance leads onto something else and none of it at all particularly interesting, the film's overall palette mixing it up to create an ugly aesthetic of primary colours whereas Fonda does what she has to do in merely standing there playing dress up and allowing the chaos to unfold around her, some of her more complicated lines occurring whilst she's off screen and then clearly dubbed back onto cutaways to mask an inability to deliver sentences. Scenes go on and on and on and depart again with absolutely nothing achieved, as characters spout woeful dialogue amidst people being tied up; wrapped up in nets and tormented by ""leathermen"" whom come with arms looking suspiciously like cat-of-nine-tails whips. The film is a shallow, inept and catastrophic attempt on mostly every front; a morbidly boring effort with some questionable core politics, that I deeply detested.",Barbarella

It starts out with full five minutes of Jane Fonda simply slithering out of her spacesuit as the opening credits roll. And it just goes from there as she lands on planet Lythion, in search of the evil Duran Duran.It's cute, it's sexy, it's definitely intriguing. It's also insane, awkward, full of cheesy special effects and purrrrfect dialogue. And no, that last point cannot be expressed any other way. In a word, it's a chore to sit through, but in a good way. It's constantly surprising, constantly changing gears and it definitely won't bore you.Yet I cannot in good conscience call it a good movie, because frankly it's just too random. And not in the good way that a Monty Python movie is random, for example, but in the sense that the film makers simply threw everything and their grandmothers at the screen to see what would stick. Sure, it's based on a comic, which might explain some of the weirder additions, but it's still too much.Barbarella is definitely worth a watch for all fans of science fiction.

44,RodrigAndrisan,"Too ""positronic"" !",5,15 August 2017,"9 millions dollars, in 1968, they meant A LOT of money. That's how much they spent on this... fantasy. The whole story is childlike, except for some soft sex and sexual innuendo. Jane Fonda was very appealing, without being vulgar. Her breasts and her ass are like a visual poem, she has something very angelic. It was natural, because she does it with an angel too (John Phillip Law - an unpleasing role for him). 3 years before Barbarella was made, in 1965, in Romania (where, unfortunately, I was also born...), a very talented director named Ion Popescu-Gopo, made a film called ""De-as fi... Harap Alb""(I would be... Prince Charming). I do not know if Roger Vadim saw that film and he was inspired by it, but Barbarella is, in my opinion, very similar. Anita Pallenberg has her own charm in the role of The Great Tyrant, and the character of Milo O'Shea would get us, much later, the name of a famous band. In a smaller but important role - he is the first to make love with Jane Fonda - is the great Italian actor Ugo Tognazzi. David Hemmings (who, by an unfortunate coincidence, would die in Romania and would receive the most important role of his life from another Italian, Michelangelo Antonioni), has an interesting small role too. A few other future celebrities have also been involved in the production: Paco Rabanne, Carlo Rambaldi, David Gilmour, Fabio Testi, Antonio Sabato.",Barbarella

Harry Dent Jr. mentioned that radical and conservative generation alternates every 20 years. In contrast to the radical era of '60s and the '70s, its sad to see how predictable, conservative, and cagey the society has become. Barbarella is important culturally in that it's a testament that a society was open minded enough to allow cultural view to be expressed in a cinema to this degree, and it's done in an intellectual ( but not taking things too seriously ) and lavish style that supposedly more modern society of today hasn't been able to recapture. In terms of open mindedness probably the year 1968 when this picture was produced was the pinnacle of our civilization, and our minds have been moving towards structure and pragmatism since then. In that sense, this movie is worth a look by everyone. However you may form opinions about it, it's guaranteed to be a mind expanding experience. I'm with the opinion that they should have made part 2 and maybe part 3 in succession. The saga or trilogy would have made this an even more important landmark of the '60s culture. Costume designs are first class too. They are beautiful, and elegant. Jane Fonda is captured at the height of her beauty in this film by her then husband and director Roger Vadim.",Barbarella

It seems that Durand-Durand has developed a Positronic Ray, which in the wrong hands, could prove devastating to the entire galaxy unless Barbarella is able to get to Durand-Durand before it's too late...There really is no point in discussing anything to do with the plot or anything that happens within the film (it is practically impossible to take it seriously or make any kind of sense out of it). This doesn't always need to be viewed in a negative concept (sometimes if a film is fun or entertaining then a throwaway plot can become almost inconsequential), but when a film is as dull as Barbarella the weak plot becomes more noticeable rather than working as a distraction.OK perhaps I'm not being entirely fair when I say that there isn't anything here to distract from the weak plot; yes there were times when I found this film 'tit'-illating (sorry), but that's really all that there is to this film. Perhaps that's the point and maybe back in the 60's director Roger Vadim was targeting the post-pub audience who were either wasted or stoned to high hell (which is presumably the only way you can appreciate a film as ridiculous as Barberella). Speaking of ridiculous then you only need to listen to some of the dialogue such as 'How can I recompense you?' 'Well you could make love to me' Really? That would be a cheesy line even in a porn film. What makes it worse is that Barbarella just goes along with it without question? Is she a special agent or a prostitute? Another example of cheesy dialogue was when the queen asks Pygar to make love to her and Pygar replies 'An Angel does not make love an Angel is love.' Seriously? I nearly died from laughter it was so horrendously cheesy. These are just 2 examples I could find of horrid dialogue, but I'm sure that there are several other examples throughout the film.Barberella is one of Jane Fonda's iconic film roles, but in retrospect and in some ways I found her to be slightly miscast. She's supposed to be one of Earth's best agents, but seems to possess no physical abilities, no intellectual abilities and no negotiating skills seem to be evident either; it doesn't help that Fonda seems to be a bit too ditzy and nice to portray the character who I presume she was supposed to portray; a tough sassy character/actress perhaps would have been a better move (apparently Sophia Loren turned the role down and in all honesty I'm not sure what she could have done with the role, but I think someone like Honor Blackman may have been able to do something more to the film - particularly if she'd have infused a bit of Pussy Galore into the role). Fonda's sweet character is endearing at first, but her ineptness and ditziness soon outstays its welcome and starts to become irritating.The acting is relatively poor with only Milo O'Shea injecting any kind of energy into the film (and even this only comes in fits and starts). A lot of the effects (I refuse to use the word special) are dreadful and again some of them are so bad that they're laughable which in some ways is good as it does help get past the many tedious stretches that you will encounter throughout the film.In summary then this may work if you're watching this when you're stoned or drunk (which as I've mentioned surely must be whom Vadim intended as his target audience), but for anyone else there isn't really much here to recommend.",Barbarella

I'd been interested in and buying sci fi books and stories for a few years of course, what else? After just seeing the cinema poster for it on the internet and being unaccountably unable to shift the image from my mind watched the film again maybe for the last time tonight.Spacegirl Jane Fonda pre-feminist and very feminine kicks the film off by kicking off all her clothes in zero gravityand the film manages to maintain that exemplary level throughout. She's ordered by the voyeuristic President of the Republic of Earth to find Mr. Durand Durand and his naughty warlike positronic ray somewhere in the Universe and stop him. On the way through the gossamer plot gossamer reasons are found for her to lose her gossamer clothes on various gossamer sets, and to prove how sexy and sexed up she was. Even the killer budgies were on the side of red-blooded males and lesbians, although I was always surprised the Orgasmatron left so much to the imagination! Having recently seen Lucy I was amused by the many negative comments there were on IMDb about how scientifically unrealistic it was - so just for those who don't realise: this was a entirely fiction film too.Well OK so far, I'm only a guy who can go for this kind of nonsensical exploitation sci fi once in a while – it's the third time in five decades I've sat through Barbarella, based on extrapolation I'll never see it again. So to be charitable it's very much of its time; to name but a few The Avengers, The Prisoner and Department S were all top draw British nonsense action series on TV at that time too. I can still watch them all, and maybe with a greater avidity because of the lack of nudity. The carefree attitude in 40000 reflected the 1960's, when Youth was King and Queen and lack of foresight obligatory; Milo O'Shea was an elderly 42 yo when he made this to Fonda's 30, the target cinema audience then must have been 18 to 22 and kids of 10 nowadays would probably deride it. That lets me out long ago.It should be harmless fun, accepted the social/sexual issues raised will only intensify as Man is further pulled out of the Cave by his hair by Woman. One fine day the human race will be apparently sexless and humourless but until that day comes the human race shouldn't really worry about debatably entertaining rubbish like this.",Barbarella
55,ArtVandelayImporterExporter,B00berella,4,1 June 2019,"Let's face it, there are only four redeeming features here: Fonda's fabulous legs and her fabulous r@ck. If we take into account her great hair that would stretch the film's rating to a 5.
There's really nothing much else to recommend this campy garbage. Certainly not the acting, the plot, the special effects or the set design.
Having said that, Pallenberg's strap-on was a nice touch. I was wondering who she was going to get busy with - Fonda or Law. But she no sooner showed up when Fonda got shot into Hemming's workshop.
Frankly, after the opening credits when we get to see Fonda's upper-level gifts in full undress, this movie is barely watchable.
As a 13-year-old watching it late at night on a B&W TV in the 1970s, it was an eye-opener. As a geezer in the 21st century, it's pointless and dull.",Barbarella
56,lewiskendell,"Sexy, campy, silly, and entertaining.",7,21 December 2010,"""You are so good that you made the Matmos vomit.""I don't even really know where to begin with this one. The space adventures of Jane Fonda's sexy Barbarella are hard to review, because this has to be one of the most WTF movies that I've ever seen in my life. Every scene either had me laughing out loud or scratching my head and wondering what kind of powerful narcotics the writer/director/everyone involved with making this was OD'ing on. The story is ridiculous. Barbarella is some kind of space traveler/astronaut, and she's been charged with finding a missing scientist named Durand Durand. That's right Durand Durand. Along the way, she encounters ravenous dolls, a man in three-fourths of a Chewbacca outfit, a blind angel (one of the more inspired and hilarious parts of the movie), a rousing musical performance that she ends up participating in in a rather intimate fashion, an invisible key to an invisible wall, and about 10 different wardrobe changes. It has to be seen to be believed.The whole movie is campy, from the special effects, to the sets, to the costumes to the music. And the surreal plot and characters are just the icing on the cake. If you're fond of the particular brand of trippy 60's weirdness, then Barbarella is a must-see. It's like Star Wars mixed with Austin Powers, a hot blonde, and some LSD.",Barbarella

58,DeeNine-2,Roger Vadim does Jane,5,20 August 2009,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)For decades I had been meaning to watch this to see if Jane Fonda was as gorgeously displayed by Roger Vadim as advertised (and as reported by my horny friends). Well, yes. But the rest of the movie--high camp? Interesting sci-fi spoof? Satire on the genre? Well, no, but there are some eyebrow-raising and rather bizarre flights of fancy by Vadim including some creepy children in an icy landscape who bean Fonda with a rock, knock her out and tie her up. They have little dolls with piranha teeth that they sic on her luscious tied-up bod, drawing some very red blood to contrast with her white skin. You get the picture.Another interesting idea is that of the labyrinth containing the ""good"" people outside the city of all sins. Vadim reverses Dante's Inferno and puts the angels and other people in hell while the evil doers live in their decadence in the not so fair city. Fonda rides on the back of an angel with wings (John Phillip Law) while shooting down the ""leather"" storm troopers from the city in their flying machines. Ka-boom! Jane doesn't miss but of course she does get captured andwell, scantily clad Jane in chains or rather ropes in the city of evil... You get the picture.Roger Vadim gained international fame as the director of ""Et Dieu... créa la femme"" (1956) starring the amazingly beautiful Bridget Bardot. He seemed to have a way with actresses, especially young, beautiful and aspiring ones. It was quite a coup to somehow capture the heart or perhaps it was the ambition of the young and beautiful Jane Fonda. One can see that part of his technique was to really put the lady on display. Here in Barbarella, Fonda more or less undresses for the camera as the opening credits roll. It's a kind of ""you gotta have a gimmick"" strip tease as she is turned upside down and sideways by the seemingly lack of gravity in her spaceship as she dodges behind the text of the opening credits. This peek-a-boo would be quite titillating were I still 19 years old (or what the heck, 50). Regardless the point is the full (as much as possible) display of Fonda who does indeed look gorgeous. But that would not be enough, not nearly enough for the actress that Jane would become. She exclusively holds the camera for much of the first part of the movie in her space ship as she re-robes, talks with the President of Earth, and moves about and begins her space faring mission looking for ""Duran Duran"" (yes, they got their name from this flick). Her skin is flawless, her limbs elegant, her eyes beautifully made up in the dark sixties style. The camera loves her, Vadim loves her, the audience loves her, Jane loves her.To be candid I did not watch the entire movie. But that is more a problem of age (mine) than it is of the movie which was at least as good as most sci-fi spoofs and a bit more creative. However if you don't find Jane Fonda attractive, you won't even be able to watch as much as I did.",Barbarella
59,Howlin Wolf,Flake takes us to Galaxies of pleasure... (and you thought those chocolate ads were sexy!),6,2 May 2007,"I suppose we have the French to thank for Bridgitte Bardot and kicking into high-gear the early summer of love where promiscuity was positively hip, baby! Drugs helped too, of course, but it was the chic laissez-faire attitude to personal intimacy that really marked out the flower-child era and led everybody to try and hop on board, capitalising with their own cultural touchstones. ""Barbarella"" - as a cross country adaptation - was a part of that, and approached in an appropriately spaced-out mindset it can still provide lots in the way of groovy fun.Fonda was born to play a sex kitten, with her soulful eyes and lithe body, and the costume department is allowed to have fun on this film because the joyfully absurd story manipulates her into a series of revealing outfits. Rest assured she isn't alone in the silly attire stakes; there's even an 'angel' on hand for us to giggle at. Logic isn't heavily relied upon either when developing the narrative, so there are also plenty of bizarre set-pieces tenuously linked to the megalomaniacal villain of the piece - including the now famous chair... (I don't wish to spoil it, but you'll know it if you see it).""Barbarella"" was a lot more fun for me than something like the po-faced ""Logan's Run"", anyway. It works because it doesn't ask you to take seriously what the setting then renders ludicrous. Everything is intentionally camp fun from the outset. Go with it - surrender yourself to bliss!",Barbarella
60,frankde-jong,A camp film by design,5,12 March 2020,"Some time ago I saw the film ""Ed Wood"" (1994, Tim Burton) about the worst director ever. When you see ""Barbarella"" (1968, Roger Vadim) you might almost think that Ed Wood instead of Roger Vadim was the director. The plot of the movie is rather rediculous and the setpieces are amateurish beyond belief. What about a space craft decorated with soft carpets normally used in front of the fireplace? The difference is however that Ed Wood was not capable of making better films, whereas the amateurism in ""Barabarelle"" is partially on purpose to earn a camp status. A goal that was ultimately achieved. A last word about the so called amateurish set pieces, the sculpture of a naked woman in the chamber of dreams has very much in common with the sculptures Stanley Kubrick would later use in ""A clockwork orange"" (1971).Roger Vadim, the director of ""Barbarella"", had made his name with ""Et Dieu ... créa la femme"" (1956) avec Brigitte Bardot. From that moment on female beauty was an essential element in his films. That was also true of ""Metzengerstein"", the contribution of Vadim to ""Histoires extraordinaires"" (1968, Federico Fellini, Louis Malle, Roger Vadim), a film with three story's by Edgar Allen Poe. In ""Metzengerstein"" Vadim also worked together with Jane Fonda, the main character of ""Barbarella"". Jane Fonda was not the first choice for this role however. From origin Barbarella is a cartoon character that was inspired by Brigitte Bardot. So there was a kind of logic in offering Bardot the lead role in the film, but she refused.Already the first scene contains the Roger Vadim trademark. We see a fully dressed astronaut performing a sort of space striptease, resulting in a naked Jane Fonda in the end. A rare combination of science fiction and erotica. Sometimes ""Barbarella"" is called the female James Bond. I have my doubts, because the sexual stimulating images are overwhelmingly meant for male eyes. I would rather call ""Barbarella"" a naughty ""Wizard of Oz"" (1939, Victor Fleming), with Durand Durand as the wizard and Barbarella as Dorothy. Barbarelle comes from 41st century earth, a planet were reproduction no longer needs sex, there are ""more efficient"" ways. On a mission in some backward region of the universe she rediscovers making love, and gets addicted to it. And so the soft carpets in her speceship come in handy at last.",Barbarella
61,Maciste_Brother,Fun film nearly destroyed by lame ending,5,22 March 2008,"BARBARELLA is often cited by many as being one of the worst films ever made. There are as many fans of this film as there are haters. The divide is evenly split in the middle: you either love this film or you just hate. Though I sometimes gravitated on the haters side I've always enjoyed watching it for the sheer psychedelic nonsense of it all. Aside from films by Fellini, there's nothing quite like it out there. After seeing it recently, I finally realized why BARBARELLA feels like a complete failure when in fact it's often brilliant and original: the ending is bad. Really bad. It's so bad that it negates all the kookie brilliance that happened just before it.What's so bad about the ending is that it makes Barbarella the most ineffective hero of all time: Barbarella is sent from earth to find Duran Duran. In her long and eventful quest, she goes through a series of crazy moments which always seems to surpass the one that just occurred before. The film carefully builds-up a myriad of sequences, funny or sexy, which culminates with Barbarella finally meeting Duran Duran and experiencing the Excessive Machine. After this brilliant scene, the film basically ends then and there. What happens after this is bad. The momentum of the rest of the film is quickly dissipated when Barbarella is placed in the room of Dreams with that evil woman. Instead of coming up with a glorious ending to end all of the fun psychedelic action, Barbarella is shown to be completely ineffective. Her role during the ""climax"" is hopelessly passive. She just watches on the evil woman's monitor what's taking place when Duran Duran becomes crazy and destroys the world around them. That's it. Barbarella just doesn't do anything at all. I'm aware that most writers have a hard time writing stories with female action heroes but the ending in BARBARELLA is a complete letdown.Instead of tying up everything with a clever and spirited ending, the story goes nowhere and the film ends abruptly. Without a strong and memorable ending, BARBARELLA ends up feeling like a collection of scenes haphazardly stitched together with no satisfying conclusion to tie them all up. And it's a shame because there's so much amazing stuff in this movie. Jane Fonda gives her most memorable performance. She's sexy, believable in the role and funny. The cast is excellent. The 1960s production design is amazing and eye catching (love those robot/soldiers with whips) with lotsa skin on display. The music is perfectly bombastic. Yes, the effects are dated but it gives the movie a certain charm. I give BARBARELLA a 8 stars from the opening credit up to the Excessive Machine scene.

And just that. Everything else is an empty excuse for this fashion show.But just in case, let me enlighten the casual reader of this review: Barbarella, after getting naked for no particular reason in the opening credits, gets the mission of finding Durand Durand (yes, he afterwards went on to be a member of a famous music band), who is going around with a dangerous weapon. Barbarella's cool red spaceship crashes and... well, she encounters curiously scantly clad characters while going from one place to the other (and getting her clothes destroyed by all kind of accidents).If this sounds campy as hell, well, kudos, because it is. And when it embraces its campiness, and the silliness of it all, the movie is enjoyable. Jane Fonda plays Barbarella with a glee that is contagious and she is helped by characters as the angel Pygar. Sadly, the movie has little else to offer (apart from the fashion stuff and some psychedelic moments). With no plot, no action, character development or... well, anything, ""Barbarella"" seems to be a movie to look at, not to view.",Barbarella
63,gftbiloxi,Sexed-Up and Super-Silly,7,17 August 2005,"If you're looking for a cult classic, they don't come much stranger than sexed-up and super-silly BARBARELLA, the peculiar tale of an intergalactic secret agent (Jane Fonda) sent to a rebel planet to find a mad scientist named Duran Duran (Milo O'Shea.) Directed by Fonda's then-husband Roger Vadim, the film is less concerned with creating a coherent storyline than it is in finding inventive ways to strip Fonda of her already skimpy outfits.In this it is remarkably successful, and Fonda actually has both enough sex appeal and round-eyed innocence to carry the thing off, emerging as something like a Barbie doll; John Philip Law strikes a similar note as the sexy but equally innocent ""angel"" Pygar. The designs are 1960s psychedelic with as many Freudian twists as the film's makers can come up with, and when all is said and done you can't help but roll your eyes in amusement.True enough, BARBARELLA was probably much more entertaining back in the days LSD, and indeed one might read the entire thing as an acid trip time machine. No one in the cast takes the film very seriously, and neither should you; when all is said and done it has all the depth of a pancake, not so much funny as merely amusing and appealing to a very high-camp sensibility.

64,stamper,"What a huge, enormous, preposterous piece of crap",3,29 December 2000,"The beginning of Barbarella, is, to be honest quite strange. A girl in a Space - suit flying around in her room. What comes next is the best part of the movie I saw. She (Barbarella (Jane Fonda)) gets out of the suit and is completely naked. We see her well formed body and are shown a few glimpses of her breasts. Then the president calls her with a picture phone (he can see her and she can see him). She then says something like: 'Hold on a minute I'll put some clothes on.' To which the president reply's (as all men would have done I guess): 'Don't this is urgent.' Barbarella falls for it (no wonder, for she is Blonde) and speaks with the president wearing nothing but pubes I guess. The President informs her that some guy has apparently brought a weapon to some tribe on earth or something and they fear war (note that their greeting is not 'hello' but 'LOVE' which reminded me a bit of the 'be well' in Demolition Man). But war is something that did not occur in the universe for centuries (this movie plays in the year 40.000). Well Barbarella takes the job to safe the world and is off. She goes to a backwards room and changes very rapidly to my wonder or better said not to my wonder, because poor editing shows me the scene was cut. Then Barbarella takes course to those savage people with the arms but she encounters trouble in the solar system (some kind of field or turbulence) which looks like those psychedelic colorful water displays we all know so well from Austin Powers and old 60's clips. The onboard computer then informs hour beautiful heroine that there is something on the gyros - radar (I don't know something with gyros) and I wonder what the hell does Greek food have to do with problems and how the hell do they kill animals for that radar thing if they don't have any sort of weapons. Anyway, the ship starts rocking (the platform starts going upwards and downwards) which seems to be the clue for Fonda to throw herself to the ground in a stupid manner and scream something like 'ouch' which is all done in a poor and cheap way. That was it for me I took the remote and turned off the TV, cause I was not going to waste more than 5/42048000 (which is 5 minutes of my life) on this movie (given the hope that I will live to be 80 years old). Despite that I'm right here, right now, wasting 10/42048000 of my life to advise you, not to see this movie. I advise you to do the same thing after seeing Fonda 'strip' as I did. Be well if you stop the movie after 5 minutes or if you decide to watch it the 60's way but if you are prepared to sit through this movie with your brains turned on and no mind altering drugs, well: BE FU..ED.I'd give this a 1 out of 10 but regarding standards back then and the fact that no film can be worse than Mission to Mars I'll be mild with a final 3 out of 10.",Barbarella

67,FloatingOpera7,Erotic Adventure Classic From 1968,10,20 August 2008,"Barbarella (1968): Jane Fonda, John Phillip Law, Anita Pallenberg, Claude Dauphin, Marcel Marceau, Milo O'Shea, Giancarlo Cobelli, Veronique Vendell, Serge Marquand, Nino Musco, Franco Gula, Catherine Chevalier, Umberto Di Grazia, David Hemmings, Honey Autumn, Diane Bond, Tania De Paolis, Joan Greenwood.....Director Roger Vadim, Screenplay Claude Brule from the French comic book by Jean-Claude Forest.""An angel is love"".....Barbarella became a cult classic not after its initial theatrical release (the hype then was Jane Fonda's ""nudity"" on film) but when it was re-issued as a video cassette, joining such ""midnight"" B movie classics as ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"". Loosely based on the French science fiction comic book by Jean-Claude Forest, it was director by French director Roger Vadim, at the time married to American actress Jane Fonda. Why she did this role we'll never know; it appears to have been made to please her husband, whose views of American and French/European sexuality is clearly stamped into the film while at the same time selling out to American 1960's pop culture. But free love and pop art aren't things that really form part of ""Barbarella"" which is ultimately a silly erotic adventure that classifies as soft-core pornography. Barbarella (Fonda) is an American government agent in the far-out future as only the wild 1960's could conjure up. War has become a thing of the past, and the planets are aligned in peace. Free love reigns. But the ambitious and demented scientist Dr. Durand Durand has left earth with a newly invented planet and escaped into another planet. The ""French"" Earth President (Claude Dauphine) assigns Barbarella to find the missing scientist. Off she goes on her adventure. Throughout the film, she encounters a variety of bizarre, mysterious and exotic characters from a blind angel (John Phillip Law) who, after a sexual encounter, inspires him to fly once more, a Catch-Man who makes love the old-fashioned way, lost souls entrapped in a labyrinth, leather-made, souless soldiers and the Black Queen, a bisexual and wicked tyrant who rules the decadent Soddom-and-Gomorrah type City of Night. Upon her arrival into the city, the angel is crucified and taken prisoner of the Black Queen who uses him for sex, and Barbarella is subject to Durand Durand's ""orgasm"" machine, whose powerful keys can trigger a fatal orgasm.If all these elements sound like the plot to a 1970's porno-theater movie, this is exactly what Barbarella is like, only without the graphic sex scenes. While there is nudity (such as the opening scene in which Barbarella strips in zero gravity) it's done in the softest of soft-core manner, worthy of the images in 1960's Playboy magazines. The sex is implied but never shown, but while Barbarella engages in sex with men to thank them for assisting a government agent, the sex is worthy of soft-core porn set to really good music. The script is as lousy as a porno and attempts to be very comical. The problem is the British, French and Italian actors in the movie are not trained in comedy (neither is Fonda who mostly spews one-liners like ""I'm not tube kind of girl"") so the result is mostly dry comedy without any real ha-ha-ha moments. But the best parts of the film: the 1960's signature. It's a time capsule of late 60's pop culture, from references to ""the pill"" to the easy sexuality and ""free love"" to the total irreverence (i.e. an angel, always associated with holy love and God/religion, succumbs to sex by both Barbarella and the evil Black Queen). The ""Matmos"", a primal force of nature looks like the inside of a lava lamp waiting to break through the glass. While there is not much drug use, there is a scene in which men and women are getting high on ""essence of man"" and resembles smoking pot or weed. It's also a very campy, kitschy, surreal film designed to look like some hippie's drug trip. The colorful sets and imagery is unlike anything audiences had seen before, like some sprawling work of graphic novel art. The music by Michel Magne and James Campbell is absolutely wonderful, dramatic and yet fun, loose, light jazzy melodies, a terrific composition of film music. The cinematography by Claude Renoir is a combination of ""Flash Gordon"" type of sci-fi imagery (bizarre spaceships, rock formations, planets) and the costumes by Jacques Fonteray and Paco Rabane are delicious 1960's camp and very sexy. The film is meant to be a lot of fun, despite the slight longeur and slow pace. Be warned: this film is hardly feminist, despite the female heroine looking like a space warrior. She is the figure of Roger Vadim's fantasies about seductive women using sex as their only form of power over men. Barbarella never once really uses her brains or brawns. It's all sex. The movie influenced ""space warrior girl"" movies found in pornography of later years like the 1980's and 1990's as well as comedies like ""Austin Powers"" (Duran Duran and Dr. Evil are very similar). Barbarella is a movie of it's era.",Barbarella

This leads in many sexual encounters (yes, I know, it sounds like a porn film, and if there would be more tits in it it would go as a soft core porn) with the inhabitants of Tau Ceti.Actually it could be argued, if Barbarella actually is an extremely sexist comedy or a movie about a strong female, who cleverly plays every male character in the film. But then again it would be pointless, as the film itself isn't serious by nature, it almost is a slapstick comedy in a sense.Barbarella was made in 1968 and it shows. Special effects are pretty out dated and sadly most of the locations clearly show, that the whole film was shot in a studio. Music is over all pretty horrible and a bit of distracting.I rarely say it, but this is one movie I would love to see remade.

Of course, Wells's Time Machine travelled 800,000 years into the future, whereas Barbarella is a mere 40,000 ahead of us, and still has a long way to go. But the important message signalled by both of these brilliant anticipations is that the future is terminally tacky. Mankind doesn't evolve, it devolves: and the people populating Sogo and its cosmic neighbourhood are steadily devolving into what will eventually be known as the Eloi. Only 760,000 years away from their ultimately meaningless destiny! Already, however, there is little point to their existence, which is lived out in an atmosphere of almost total virtuality. The purpose and reality of anything surrounding them have nearly been banished, except for the minimal threat presented by Durand Durand, who plans to rule the universe by destroying it with the positronic weapon he has invented. Well, that's a rational plan, and someone has to stop him, though the reasons are obscure, if the beautiful and less beautiful creatures are to continue devolving. The heavy task is assigned to Barbarella, and her methods fit right into the world she inhabits. The mind is boggled by this stunning masterpiece of creative thought, and the lucidity of its exposition makes an indelible impression. Thought-provoking isn't the word.

74,majikstl,Psychedella!,5,28 March 2009,"If you are in the right mood, BARBARELLA can be viewed as an amusing piece of campy silliness. If you aren't in the right mood, in may come off as a stupefyingly insipid piece of soft-core almost-but-not-quite-porn. BARBARELLA was pretty hot stuff for it's time, with a broadly played comic book approach, mixed with a touch of the psychedelic, it rather boldly exploited sex in the spirit, if not the style, of Playboy magazine. Whether its low-budget tackiness is a result of its design or a result of actually having a low budget isn't clear, but certainly its amateurish quality gives it a distinctive style  which is either part of its charm or part of its curse. Depending on your mood. An amusing distraction while watching it might be trying to determine what part of it is the cheesiest: the sex, the special effects, the set design or it's cheerfully chirpy musical score. My vote would go to the costume design; no doubt created to make Barbarella look outrageously sexy, all of Jane Fonda's many changes in wardrobe look as though they had been borrowed from a particularly low-rent/high-tech strip club.The story takes place in the 40th century, where Barbarella is some sort of agent from the Republic of Earth. She is ordered to go to the planet SoGo to find Dr. Durand Durand and to stop him from using some sort of weapon he has invented. That's not much of a plot, but it is enough to get Barbarella started on her real agenda, having sex.Probably the key weakness with the film is the pivotal miscasting of Fonda as the title character. She is just fine with the central demands of the role, the numerous instances of gratuitous nudity; however Fonda has never excelled in comedy and is even less effective at playing wide-eyed innocents. Fonda just can't play dumb and being at least a bit spaced out is a basic characteristic of Barbarella. Other than a few moments here and there where it is clear that Fonda realizes just how ridiculous the material is, she otherwise plays it straight, which is not to the film's benefit. Fonda's star was on the rise at the time, a starlet winning acceptance as a serious actress, and she was just on the verge of becoming a political activist. Having such a prominent star take a role in such a, well... sleazy production must have been quite a coup  though at the time being the wife of the director, Roger Vadim, no doubt, had a great influence on her taking the part. Even so, you get the feeling that Vadim is exploiting his wife to promote his career, rather than showing much concern for hers.BARBARELLA isn't without it's nice touches. For one, there is David Hemmings as a would-be revolutionary who can't hide his embarrassment when his technological gadgets don't work right. And John Phillip Law is blissfully serene as a blind, but rather hunky, angel who captures the sense of innocence that escapes Fonda. On the whole, however, (unlike Miss Fonda herself) BARBARELLA hasn't aged well. It's trippy attitude and wishful views of intergalactic politics was naïve then and just dopey now. Yet BARBARELLA is one of those films that wasn't appreciated in its day (and still isn't very good) but has nonetheless achieved cult status. And admittedly making a film so off beat, that blends fairy tales and politics and sex, even if it fails, does take a certain boldness (and possibly certain illegal substances).",Barbarella

This movie was just as much a sixties masterpiece as the aforementioned film as it not only extrapolated science, but sociology as well.See this picture stoned and/or stinking drunk and it makes as much or even more sense than just about any other science fiction classic.Trivia:  the rock band ""duran, duran"" got its name from the character in the comic strip.",Barbarella

It is so ludicrous that you can't help but laugh, and what makes it even more funny is that the actors try to take it all seriously, although I think without much success. Jane Fonda was roped into playing the lead by her then hubby Vadim, and she comes off as a clueless often naive, and consistently bewildered heroine of the story. John Phillip Law comes off best as the angel, Pygar. He does seem to be entirely dedicated to his character.

I mean all this adventure and science-fiction elements and all this innocence. Yes, it's innocent and pure...or almost.Barbarella is a (very) beautiful lady who must find a guy called Duran Duran. He's a scientist who invented a weapon that can destroy the whole universe. During the journey in search of this man, Barbarella meets many weird places and people. To get the information she wants, she has sex with some of the men she finds. But no sex scene is seen in the film. Actually, the only time we see Jane Fonda without clothes is in the opening of the film. It's during the credits. She's inside her spaceship, a place with no gravity, floating in the air while she undresses and sways to the music. Arts in its entire beauty. The film itself, however, doesn't please me too much. I like the idea of having a good and beautiful actress in an adventure movie, but I think ""Barbarella"" could have a more interesting plot and better elaborated situations. During the film we have a clear sensation we are watching a child story! Pity, with Jane Fonda it could be better, but I still think ""Barbarella"" is worth watching!My rate 6/10",Barbarella

It is a mixed bag, but I think it has a lot going for it.I do not even know how to explain the story of this film. Basically it is about this chick named Barbarella who travels across the universe and has sexual experiences (of different types) with various males.Jane Fonda I think does a good job for the type of role she is given. She looks pretty good,and definitely had sex appeal going for her at the time that this movie was made. Probably the part that stands out the most was the beginning sequence where she has her outfit gradually fall off until she is naked.The story is unusual but somewhere the meaning must be that sexual experiences with other people are better than other means of sex.

Actually, this lovely baby is one cool film! Based up comic book from 1962 and it's really faithful to it, and I am glad because of it. The plot is concentrated on adventures of young sexy heroine Barbarella (Jane Fonda) and her mission to planet Lythion, in the city of Sogo to find a dangerous scientist. I think that Roger Vadim is using a classic luxury from the ""space opera"" for those grotesque and travesty like situations (for example... cannibal dolls! Cool!) There's constantly this erotic charge in Jane Fonda, which is half-naked or in sexy clothes through entire film. But sometimes there's just too much grotesque on expense of SF components. I think that Vadim did it on purpose and he gave us one rare SF comedy in 60s. But, the entire stuff is too silly. Like you are watching ""Rocky Horror Show"". Fonda is a great actress, not just sexy, John Philip Law as Pygar, he was great!

83,blakiepeterson,An Unbearably Mod Science Fiction Disaster,2,2 May 2015,"I suppose my reaction to Barbarella is a simple ""What is this sh*t?"", and whether you love it or you hate it, you'll be saying the same thing too. There are three kinds of ways to react to Barbarella: (1) this is a masterpiece in horribleness, (2) this is horrible, and (3) wow, this is HORRIBLE. Or, you can be like me and feel all three things at completely different times, but never at once. No matter who you are, you'll always know that Barbarella is terrible, but it's bad in so, so, so many ways. See: Atrocious acting. Unironically kitschy set design. Writing that tries too hard to be tongue-in-cheek (but eventually throws all caution into the wind and just stops trying). Awful special effects. Jane Fonda trying as hard as she can to climb out of the cloyingly psychedelic quicksand only to suffocate.But like all camp, there's a point where you have to stop retching in disgust and sit back and absorb the outright shabbiness, to settle down and understand that what you're watching isn't going to be Forbidden Planet or 2001: A Space Odyssey. Roger Vadim, the tawdry French director who has been married to Brigitte Bardot and Barbarella star Jane Fonda, aimed for high camp but got low camp, wanting to play it straight at times when everything else seems to be moving in an uncontrollably zigzag motion. The results are super bungled up (there truly uninspired moments but there are also moments that tickle the wilder parts of our imagination), but unlike other Z-rate sci-fi romps of the time, the film takes itself seriously when it shouldn't and laughs at itself when it shouldn't. The tone (delightfully shitty) never hits a stride; I still can't tell you if Barbarella is so bad it's good or if it's so bad it's just bad.In the distant future, (astronaut? Space-based James Bond? Warrior? Sex kitten put in the wrong place?) Barbarella (Fonda) is assigned by the Earth's president to locate and return Doctor Durand Durand from the uncharted Tau Ceti region. Durand Durand, you see, created a weapon known as the Positronic Ray, which is deadly enough to cause Earthly leaders to fear extinction if it were to fall into the wrong hands. Barbarella crashed lands onto Tau Ceti's 16th planet, and, from there, embarks on an adventure that could only be found in a film like this, romancing a blind angel (John Phillip Law) and facing foes such as razor- toothed dolls, one-eyed nymphos, bloodthirsty canaries, aqueous personifications of evil, and Orgasmitrons.Oddly enough, most of the weird-ass things I've listed are dealt with with a straight face; there's no hint of anyone on the set even realizing that people aren't just going to nod along when Barbarella is almost murdered by a crazed ~ pause ~ Orgasmitron. In one interview, Fonda spoke about her character as if like was going for a particularly thoughtful characterization. Yeah right. With her newscaster voice and famously sexy body, she's the odd man out. If anything, she is the campiest thing in the film. She falls over (I mention this because Barbarella, despite being some kind of warrior, loses her balance a lot) with a slow-motion, I've fallen and I can't get up! deliberation; when she hits the ground, it's like she's climaxing for the camera. She says her lines like she knows they're bad, and sometimes even seems to be pretending that she's Brigitte Bardot and not The Respected Actress Jane F**king Fonda. Who can blame her? What actress can really take things seriously when they have to perform a (not erotic, awkward) zero-gravity striptease in a shag carpeted spaceship (?) in the opening scene alone?I could give Barbarella an A for being awful, but what kind of critic would I be if I rewarded a film for failing at everything it tries? I'll settle for a D+, but it's not a D+ in the same category as other flops. It's an entertaining failure, like a train wreck that is in the process of being stopped by Tobey Maguire in his Spidey suit. And look on the positive side: a very successful '80s band was named after its villain, so it can't all be bad.",Barbarella
84,mgruebel,Sex appeal and steel-teethed dolls,7,30 July 2015,"I know Jane Fonda is not proud of this film. She has become too politically correct with time. And if you are politically correct, you won't like it either.The film is the epitome of the mid 60s, psychedelic, sex-and-rock-and-roll era. It manages to be comedic, sexy, offensive, and have sort of a plot, although it's mostly an excuse to show Fonda in scanty costumes.A film like this can go seriously wrong (like the 5-star ""Casino Royale,"" which David Niven SHOULD better have forgotten). However, this romp never takes itself as seriously as Fonda, when she was forced to do so as an icon of the women's and exercise movements. So if you can handle a lot of tongue-in-cheek and tongue in various other places, this movie is weird and amusing. Just like the 60s. Why go see fake rehash like ""Goldmember"" when you can see the real thing?Where else can you get ideas like an army of steel-teethed dolls that chew the clothes off your body? Or a pipe organ that plays on (yes, you see this one coming) the other kind of pipe-shaped organ? On an angel, no less. Just for this odd collection of ideas, even if held together only tenuously by a plot-like stream of consciousness, this film deserves a ""7."" So: if you want to get a taste of what seemed mildly outrageous in the 60s, and ironically is more outrageous in our prim and politically correct times, grab a few beers and rent it.

She plays some kind of female Buck Rogers type, only that many of her adventures are of a sexual nature. Aside from being embarrassing to Fonda now, its best features are its sets and photography. The colors are striking and the design and gadgets have a psychedelic look that's fascinating to see. Also, it features one of the most improbable group of actors ever collected into a single movie.

Film and comic book however are different media which cannot be adapted 1:1 because of different underlying principles. That's why from my point of view the film is partly an artistic failure- as opposed to Bava's Diabolik which is a much more visual film. The original comic book is very much a product of it's time and certainly not one to enter the Comic Book Hall of Fame. The drawings are minimalistic and the stories (although at the time they had a certain shock value which is hard to believe today) are tedious and confused at best.

Barbarella is the main character in this film, who's on a space mission to locate Durand-Durand, a villain who's trying to take over the world. Barbarella wears outrageously sexy outfits, travels in a wildly decorated spaceship, and meets many strange creatures along the way, that she has to do battle with. Barbarella's sex appeal is off-the-charts, and this film is oozing with a piping-hot erotic ambiance. Interestingly though, Barbarella has sex with other characters, in a most futuristic way. She takes a pill to 'tune-in' to her partner's psyche. And no bodily contact takes place during this sort of 'sex', except hand-clasping. Apparently, orgasm is achieved when the sex partners complete an ecstatic fusion, of their minds and souls. However, Barbarella does enjoy a sexual tryst via the 'old-fashioned way', with a man she meets during her travels.Jane Fonda was brilliantly cast as the heroic, buxom Barbarella. Her on-screen charisma, is vibrant and compelling. Milo O'Shea as the evil Durand-Durand, does a decent job in his role. So does John Phillip Law, as the pure and gentle angel, Pygar. His perfect body and square-jawed, handsome face, made him a devilishly attractive 'angel'. Anita Pallenberg played the Great Tyrant, with femme fatale relish. The lesbian sexual undertones between her and Barbarella, were absolutely sizzling.One of the best things about this movie, is the incredible special effects and gadgetry. Long before the flashy Star Wars series premiered, Barbarella contained some amazingly creative costumes, decorations, and scenery in general. The overall tone of this film, was deeply influenced by the uninhibited adventurous spirit, of the late 60s. Especially with regards to its bold, exciting sexual themes.

In the first two minutes of the film you get to see Jane Fonda's breasts and would see more if the credits didn't ""block"" it. Later, you see another woman's breasts as she's being tortured.

Best of all is the opening scene, when Fonda does a zero-g striptease while removing her spacesuit.

To see the movie 50 years later, the risks that French director Roger Vadim took with the movie, and the scenes he managed to convince then-wife Jane Fonda to do were all extremely controversial at the time. How they managed to release ""Barbarella"" in the USA without an X-rating (the rating system began in 1968, the year ""Barbarella"" came out) is a minor miracle.Vadim never misses an opportunity to appreciate Jane Fonda's impressive figure, often when she is nude or near-nude. And thank goodness for that, as the plot is nothing particularly compelling and actually seems to get worse as the picture develops. This is a very strange movie, but one that was devoured by horny young males of the era (many of whom either already had, or would soon be fighting in the Vietnam war - and some who felt particularly stung when Fonda herself later went on to visit Hanoi in support of the North Vietnamese enemy and was actually photographed behind the controls of a Russian anti-aircraft gun).Anyway, this film is certainly not to be taken seriously, and nor was it ever intended to be.

Alone. A guilty pleasure? Perhaps. But just a hunch on my part. No longer constrained by the social concerns and politics of the sixties, she gazes at her past-self flickering away in the story's future, 40,000A.D., a woman of youth and beauty, and says simply: "" God, you WERE a looker once.""

Barbarella, on the other wing, is ""a wonder...wonder woman."" I'll bet Miss Fonda's last stitch of clothing on that thought. Double swear.",Barbarella
99,padawanmovies,what did I jus watch?!,5,16 August 2017,"Without prior knowledge, one scene of this film lets u know ur watching a 60s movie... I've heard of barbarella for years about how ridiculous and head scratching it was but I had no idea what i was getting myself into. It's so weird seeing Fonda sexed up to the tenth degree, don't get me wrong, she looked great as she still does presently. But it jus seems like this movie's (can't speak for the comic since I don't read them) main point was to exploit women (hate to say it). Is the double standard so deep rooted that only womens' nude bodies can be on display? I mean what's wrong with equal exploitation of the sexes? To those that say this should be remade I strongly disagree, with the internet and social media, there's enough irrevent in ur face sexuality out there. My review basically echoes what many have already wrote *MINOR SPOILERS* I do find it funny how duran duran got their name from this (good piece of pop culture history). The dolls and the ski pulling octopus looking creature were so bad they were hilarious. As was the scene with the massive bong with the man in it! Enough can't be said for the scene with the line ""when we reach the crescendo you'll die of pleasure"", pretty good way to go tho!!",Barbarella
100,xyzkozak,Meet Jane Fonda: Space-Kitten,5,2 January 2015,"When space-kitten, Barbarella (our astronaut-heroine of the 41st century) lands on the planet Lythion and earnestly sets out to track down the diabolically evil villain, Durand Durand, in the city of Sogo (where a new sin is invented every hour) here's what our beautiful space-angel encounters.....The ""Excessive Machine"" (a genuine ""sex"" organ on which an accomplished artist playing its keyboard can literally drive a victim to certain death by pleasure)....A lusting, lesbian queen, wearing an eye-patch, who, in her fantastic dream chamber, can will her most deliciously wicked fantasies to take form.Believe me, Barbarella is one wild, Sci-Fi, sex farce that seems to stand out (in all of its zany audacity) on its very own.One can't help but be tickled pink by the cheesiest special effects imaginable - As well as the various ways that were found to tear off what few clothes our heroine, Barbarella, already had on.",Barbarella
101,Gatorman9,Not a cheesy movie; it makes fun of cheesy movies,8,24 March 2015,"BARBARELLA is very campy satire which focuses mainly on making fun of the way fantasy sex (as well as science fiction, often) was (and often still is) depicted in the movies. BARBARELLA is not at all a cheesy movie; rather, its mission is to make fun of cheesy movies, and does so extremely well. Everybody connected with it was very good at their craft and looked like they knew exactly what they were trying to do and then did it extremely well. Once you realize that, you see why is has become a ""cult classic"". The ""cult"" are the viewers who get the joke; unfortunately, and if the movie has any real weakness, it is that it seems to be too easy for all that to go over a lot of people's heads. (In fact, the first time or two I saw this movie it went over mine, but it turned out for once that the third time was a charm in every sense of the word.) While I have seen some reviews that try to explain in various ways why it is more popular today than it was when it was first released, it may simply be that in a world of Saturday Night Live, South Park, and the Family Guy (to hit but the pinnacle of the iceberg), current audiences are likely more attuned to edgy satire than any other audiences in film history.Having said that, Jane Fonda is brilliant in this movie. She totally gets it that her character is basically designed as an ideal fantasy girl for male audience members, and she plays it to the hilt with her then-characteristic naive innocence routine. The result is that while this movie is basically one big continuous joke from the opening credits to the words ""The End"", she is every bit as sexy as if they had been playing it straight. In this regard, however, there is a marked tendency to hyperbole with the descriptions of her appeal which many reviewers typically offer. In actual fact, her on-camera nudity is confined to just a couple of sequences toward the beginning, and the ""sex scenes"" are so highly euphemised cinematically to where they would likely not even be considered sex scenes by younger and less truly mature audience members. Rather, her sex appeal derives more from her consummate skill in ACTING sexy than from anything else. In this regard, people tend to forget that she was a model as well as an actress, and throughout the movie she simply flows from one perfectly-rendered provocative pose to the next. Her wardrobe complements this, consistently suggesting eroticism through costume design elements rather than merely through the amount of bare skin left showing.Moreover, the rest of departments rose equally to the occasion. The writing was pretty top notch both in dialog as well as overall story; the music was was likewise a campy parody of music in the 60s's you might find in real cheesy movies; and the sets and costumes were all kind of elegant versions of low-budget obvious sound-stage-set efforts. Watching BARBARELLA really makes you realize just how cleverly original people in the movie business can be.I would rate this movie at 7.5 stars on the IMDb system if they would allow fractional stars. I definitely recommend it to anybody with a good sense of humor who has seen sex portrayed in the movies of the period, or even since.",Barbarella

103,rams_lakers,I can think of worse movies,5,7 March 2005,"If you are offended easily, skip this post. I give a strong opinion in comparing this film to some of the lousy stuff that comes out these days. I also go off (definitely not ""get off"")on fake enhancements of today's starlets too.Barbarella won't make my list of top 250 movies, but if I happen to be watching TV and it is on I would still see it again. There are worse ""female exploit"" movies out there (Charlies Angels Full Throttle, Barb Wire, etc) and I will use Barb Wire as the dud I am going to use to give my support to Jane Fonda's film because of similarities in the name and star quality at their time. First I am going to get this off my chest and I know some (fools) may disagree but I think Jane Fonda is much sexier than Pam Anderson. First of all, fake breasts are lame. Big and abnormally round does not get it AT ALL for me. I'd rather see smaller and natural than obvious fake. Today's women who go plastic seem to overdo it most of the time. Tattoos and overdone piercing are also a turnoff for me. Give me a natural babe from the 60s with unmarked skin any day of the week. I think Pam was much sexier in the 80s photos with Chachi where she had less makeup and definitely less chest and lip enhancements. Looking at her today, I see she just won't leave herself alone. It would be sad to see what happened to Michael Jackson, Joan Rivers and Cher happen to her: surgery overkill! In Barbarella some of the acting may appear wooden, though I think Fonda blows Anderson away in acting ability too. At least the males in the film attempt to act seriously. The biggest negative for me is in most of the ""female exploit"" movies I've seen, the directors seems to want men to act like silly idiots around the starlets (Barb Wire, Spice World, etc). This isn't the case in Barbarella. The angel may win the Star Wars Natalie Portman award, but at least he wasn't falling over himself like a moron in front of Fonda. And he was blind! Some old fogies out there may dislike Fonda for standing up against the Vietnam war. I will not use this card to diss this movie or Fonda.Anyway, this is one of those campy fun movies that won't pis$ you off (like many of the awful films of today) so sit back and enjoy. I'm giving it a generous 5 out of 10 stars.",Barbarella

You understand why ""Pygar"" can fly again when he meet her. They are lucky guy in life to make love with wonderful woman like Jane Fonda.Sure was not her better role but she is perfect to play Barberella. She is so sexy and so cute. mmmShe can wake-up dead man believe me !Even if the ""special effect"" have so age, I find them good for 1968 and again original. Music is good, other actor/actress are good too.A guy can sell his soul for ""The Great Tyrant"" (alias Anita Pallenberg) easily.The movie was create in ""Peace in Love"" time and people who know this time was lucky. So cute women there, so sexy. Any shy. No share to make love.This movie is a Classical for me and so give it 8/10 is not exaggerate.

It's not groundbreaking sci fi like 2001 was, but it still accomplishes what it set out to do, and that was to make a fun sci fi movie. Sure the effects are dated and Barbarella herself is very over-sexualized, but it's not very harmful in any major way. The only reason this movie loses points for me is that, one: it's very cheesy, but I kinda like that. And two: the effects are pretty bad for today's standards, but compared to some other movie effects like War of the Robots it's not THAT bad.",Barbarella

107,keith-moyes,Eurotrash,2,9 February 2007,"This is probably the most baffling and frustrating movie I have ever seen.It has all the elements to be a camp classic. The production design is bizarre and original. Terry Southern's screenplay is often witty. Jane Fonda and Anita Pallenberg are wonderful. I ought to love it. Instead, I find it almost intolerable.From the opening credits, which go on too long, and the first bars of that execrable music, you sense something is seriously amiss with this movie. The camera seems to be in the wrong place all the time and the wrong shots are held too long. It often seems as if that they simply shot footage with no idea how it was going to fit together. You suspect that weeks may have passed between shots so that nobody could remember what had come before or what would come after. Faced with this hopeless material, the editor was in despair and just gave up, so nothing cuts together properly. At best, the picture looks like the roughest of rough cuts. At worst, the editing seems to be almost completely random.As a result, there is no pace or rhythm, either in individual scenes, or in the movie as a whole. People wander about from scene to scene with no purpose or point. Soon, all the energy drains out of the picture and you find yourself stranded in a weird limbo in which nothing seems to be happening, even when it is, nothing connects with anything else and time stretches out endlessly before you. At times the boredom is so intense it makes your teeth ache.I have seen and commented on some of the most incompetent movies ever made (Fire Maidens, The Flying Saucer, Mesa of Lost Women) but this movie seems to be inept in ways that transcend even those notorious turkeys. Although Roger Vadim had made at least a dozen pictures before this one, it feels like it was assembled by people that had never even seen a movie before, let alone made one. Of one thing I am sure - it could never have been made in America. It is purest Eurotrash.I have finally posted my response to this unaccountable movie, but I know I will be coming back again and again to edit it, because I realise I haven't even come close to identifying what makes it such a uniquely stultifying experience.",Barbarella
108,morpheusatloppers,Crazy credits...,10,3 July 2009,"First let me say to the three people who have waded through several hundred comments to reach this piece - this is one of my top ten films of all time. Now to those credits...First - Anita Pallenberg. It was obvious even to a 15 year old boy (as I was when first I viewed this masterpiece) that her voice had been dubbed. It sounded to me like Fenella Fielding (see ""Carry On Screaming"") and according to IMDb's ""trivia"", I was RIGHT.However, according to IMDb's ""cast & crew"", it was Joan Greenwood. Now Joan certainly has the same plummy accent as Fenella - but which WAS it?Then there's the music. I have the original soundtrack album, which includes all the songs (although ""An Angel Is Love"" was re-recorded for the album with Bob allegedly taking lead vocals) and pretty much all the music - in pretty much chronological order.But the album cover attributes ALL the work to Bob Crewe, his Glitterhouse singers and Charles Fox. NO mention is made of Michel Magne. Yet the FILM'S credits ONLY mention M Magne.While IMDb's credits attribute ALL these people - plus some guy called James Campbell (who he? I'm not going to Google ""James Campbell"" - Scotland alone must have THOUSANDS of them).So WHY? Why does the album ignore the contribution of M Magne? And why does the film snub Mr Crewe? He was BIG at the time.By the by, some of the incidental music may now be (or was THEN?) in a music library - 'cause I've heard snatches of it in the background music on the recent BBC series, ""Hustle"".And apparently, my soundtrack album may now be rare, since the album advertised on IMDb only lists the songs.Anyway, this brings me to the last crazy credit. Durand-Durand. All the above comments that I read (I didn't read them ALL - I have a LIFE!) spelled Milo O'Shea's character ""Duran-Duran"".This is understandable, since the film was made BEFORE the customary TEN MINUTE credit sequence that lists everyone down to the honey-wagon driver - and does not even have a cast-list.Thus everyone (except IMDb) makes that mistake - including the '80s POP GROUP who appropriated the name!",Barbarella
109,beastwarsfan,Barbarella,10,9 October 2005,"Barbarella is a cult classic, no doubt. The movie is based on Jean-Claude Forest's comics, and if you're familiar with French comics you surely know that they are far more artistic than most of the American ones, full of fantasy and wonder and some pleasing bizarre uniqueness. Produced by Dino De Laurentiis - even just this name is enough to attract my attention, since he's behind quite many of my favourite movies - Flash Gordon, Army of Darkness, Conan The Barbarian, Conan The Destroyer, King Kong... Not to mention the gorgeous Jane Fonda. I just love her in Cat Ballou. And here in Barbarella - oh, she's a real goddess! The perfect combination of innocence and seductiveness! Even after all these years she's still damn hot! We also have aggressive, domineering and voluptuous Black Queen. And for ladies - here goes the blind, nearly naked angel ;) The whole movie itself is full of quite erotic moments. The astronaut suit striptease in the beginning - hell yeah! And Duran Duran's machine... The sets and models are not so impressive from today's point of view, but with a little imagination you can deal with that. And I even find a kind of nostalgic sci-fi beauty in them. There are also scenes with masterfully shot psychedelic pictures of moving colors and fantastic forms - it is worth watching the whole movie even just to see them. The story itself is a little bit naive, but that's a part of the charm of this film - nothing like the good old times. That's why Barbarella really is a Queen of the Galaxy!",Barbarella
110,markdroulston,Doesn't live up to its cult status,4,20 May 2012,"Scouring the video store shelves in search of something interesting I feel like I should see often yields surprising results, but I wasn't quite prepared for the surprise I got from BARBARELLA: QUEEN OF THE GALAXY. I had a vague idea of what it was (kitschy sci-fi cult classic was my understanding), but, to my initial delight (but eventual disappointment), I had more in store, but perhaps also much, much less.BARBARELLA is a bizarre, psychedelic tale of the sexual awakening of the titular (no pun intended) character, played by an startlingly young and alluring Jane Fonda, a woman sent by the Government of the Republic of Earth to search for scientist Durand Durand. Durand, whose spacecraft disappeared somewhere near mysterious planet Tau Ceti, is the creator of the Positronic Ray, a weapon of unspeakable power which the Earth government wish to retrieve before it falls into unfriendly hands. After crash landing on the planet, Barbarella encounters various odd people and creatures, all of whom seem to exist in a primitive world of sexual liberation. 41st century society has moved on from archaic penetrative intercourse it seems, opting instead for a meditative melding of 'psychocardiograms' (think the virtual sex from DEMOLITION MAN, but less exciting), and Barbarella is initially appalled at the idea, yet after around 20 seconds of coercion from a creep in a bear suit, experiences the pleasures of the flesh for the first time. And so begins the erotic adventures of Barbarella, which include making love to a blind angel, being propositioned by a one-eyed dominatrix who may not be what she seems, and having her body literally played like an organ by the nefarious Durand Durand.Unfortunately, it all sounds a little racier than it is. There's plenty of innuendo and double entendre (one of the characters is named Dildano!), but really it's not pushed far enough, and the film is a little tame. There are laughs to be had, and Fonda is fully committed to the campy lunacy of the script but BARBARELLA doesn't really live up to its cult status. The spectacularly low-budget sets and effects, Fonda's ever-changing and increasingly revealing outfits, and the fun and funky psychedelic lounge music throughout stand out as highlight, but it's far from a good movie. Amazingly Fonda turned down both BONNIE AND CLYDE and ROSEMARY'S BABY to make this, so I guess you have to give her credit for the effort, and perhaps some chemical accompaniment would work in BARBARELLA's favour (as I'm certain there was plenty on set). It's the sort of film which you know you're going to like or hate before even starting it, and I'm not surprised that it has its fans. Unfortunately, I'm not one of them.tinribs27.wordpress.com",Barbarella

Well, it was colorful, Fonda was actually quite funny in the title role, and it's interesting to know this is where Duran Duran got its name from.  Also very interesting sets (to say the least).  However the film moves very slowly, it's not funny enough (there were a lot of dull stretches), the ""special effects"" were VERY 60s, and the music was bad enough to make you want to shoot the ""musicians"".  Still, I'm not sorry I saw it.  Definitely an artifact of its time.  As another reviewer says on this db, see it on a big screen if possible.  No way will this work on video.",Barbarella

113,FloodClearwater,One Simply Cannot Not See Barbarella,9,23 September 2015,"One simply cannot comment on any of the following phenomena until they have first screened this tissue soft, searing fever dream of a romping film: Hollywood science fiction, Roger Vadim, Marcel Marceau, the American reply to Brigitte Bardot, Return of the Jedi, George Lucas, the Austin Powers franchise, the Rolling Stones, or any ranking of all-time female American actors on a scale of hotness. Speaking of hotness, you cannot look away from Jane Fonda as she plays the lead role of Barbarella. I'm sorry to discuss the looks of Ms. Fonda, a two-time Oscar-winner and a Hollywood icon, in such cro- magnon terms. But look for yourself; one simply cannot look away from her in this role. Sexual magnetism of the highest strength. Separation is not possible. And because Ms. Fonda is such a powerful actor, her ability to gamely deliver the lines written for a 41st century space adventure protagonist whilst flying a starship lined in shag carpet, and sleeping on Reynolds Wrap beds, and being dragged by a stingray unicorn- powered sled, and facing off with the haute and hot likes of Anita Pallenberg, all while being exquisitely costumed in high late 1960's go-go inspired fashions, results in a display of all out megawatt starpower that would incinerate Darth Vader before he could even get his lightsaber up. I won't share details of the film's plot. The movie is crazy, silly, and cajoling, in the best possible way. Once you see it, you can't imagine the history of the American film industry without its 98 minutes of run time, you won't wan't to live in a parallel reality where the film never existed. And look, I'm not alone in understanding the fact that Barbarella was the first blistering postmodern commentary on the pop-influenced excesses of American gender roles and sexuality. Duran Duran named themselves after one of this film's characters. All manner of directors stole ideas from this film, wholesale. Barbarella is a minor pop cultural miracle. Think of it as an art film, and one that both stands up over time and remains more interesting than anything Matthew Barney has ever made. See Jane conquer all. Notes:1. Not for watching with those under the age of 18. There is creative nudity.2. This film would be fairly easy to remake or update/reimagine.

The special effects are awful even for the time it was made, and the plot, thin as it is, sort of fades out to nothing about three quarters of the way through.Visually it's actually brilliant, but of its time - kitschy, plastic, shiny, bright and very stylised. Some of the sets are impressive, some of them just plain weird. Jane Fonda plays the lead brilliantly - she's stunningly beautiful in this and the costumes she wears don't disguise any of her physical attributes you might say. She delivers her lines in brilliant and hilarious 'innocent' style. The rest of the cast do too - kind of high camp, but also wooden.Unfortunately the film is a lot of style over substance and although the high camp is fun early on, and you do find yourself laughing along with it, towards the end it actually gets a bit boring.

119,accattone74,Space Girls on Film,10,15 November 2010,"The known galaxy has been peaceful for centuries. The word 'weapon' is an archaic expression referring to a time long ago when we still practiced war and ""neurotic irresponsibility"". But of course, the potential to have great power over others still corrupts, and a mad-genius/scientist named Duran Duran develops a killer-ray, a Positronic ray to be precise, capable of great destruction, upsetting the ebb & flow of tranquility which prevails among our stars. Who can save us before Duran Duran and his immoral patron, The Great Tyrant, enslave the entire galaxy? Barbarella, that's who. And she'll do it with love, and only love.Barbarella is the 5-Star Astro-Navigatrix assigned to demoralize the evil-doers, and she's determined not to let anything stop her. She's a space-age hippie version of Emma Peel, though unlike Emma, Barbarella has difficulty not losing part of her outfit all the time oh well, all the better for us. Along with her blind, and amazingly useless companion, the Angel Pygar, she'll fight off lumbering, leather robots, nasty monsters, sex-crazed perverts, lecherous lesbians, homicidal children, and even briefly join a bumbling insurgency, all to save us from becoming a violent society once again. Oh, Barbarella how can we ever thank you enough? (But what part of herself will Barbarella use to save us when the darkest hour is nigh? Hmmmm I'll let you find out.)Produced and released in 1968, the film Barbarella was first an incredibly successful '60s French comic-strip written by Jean-Claude Forest. Like the Barbarella character in the movie, the Barbarella of print is equal parts resourceful and naïve, sexy and unaware, determined and self-doubting, which all make for a wonderful character. And even though Jane Fonda was a replacement for Italian sex-kitten Virna Lisi, she obviously relishes this colorful part. She didn't want to make another film with her then husband, Roger Vadim, having already made two, but she stepped in and saved the day thank you Jane! Over the previous eight years, Jane had done her handful of body-centric performances, and some serious work too, but she wanted to start excluding the sexy stuff and concentrate on serious roles only. Thankfully she squeezed out one more camptastic film before getting all political (her next film after Barbarella was the brilliant, Depression-era downer They Shoot Horses, Don't They?, for which she was awarded her first Oscar nod.)Some say that nakedness was just Jane's natural state though. For there exists a fabulous urban legend that while attending then-ultra-conservative Vassar College, Jane refused to follow the ages-old tradition of having to wear white gloves and pearls in the tearoom on campus. When asked to leave for not doing so, she obliged, but returned a short time later wearing the gloves and pearls, but nothing else. This behavior was said to be the beginning of 25 years of pushing buttons and challenging authority. Even if the story is untrue, you have to admit, it's fierce; it also sounds like something Barbarella would do under the influence of the MatmosRoger Vadim, the Hugh Hefner of cinema if there ever was one, is a much under-appreciated filmmaker. He had been married to or at least romantically linked to not only Jane, but also Brigitte Bardot, and Catherine Denevue. He'd been directing films since 1956, writing films since even before that, and kept making movies up until his death 5 years ago, although his best work is from 1956-72. He followed Barbarella with Pretty Maids All in a Row, an unfortunately forgotten film that you should see, that is if you want to see Rock Hudson be a serial killer mutilating young girls, and I bet you do.Terry Southern, despite writing the immortal films Dr.Strangelove, The Loved One, The Cincinnati Kid, and Easy Rider, may have written some of his wittiest dialogue in Barbarella; the discourse between Barbarella and the President alone is worth your price of admission, as is every word uttered by Anita Pallenberg.How can I forget Miss Pallenberg? For those of you who aren't aware, Anita Pallenberg was the dark, feminine energy behind the chaos that was Swinging London. A then-practicing witch, and supposedly not always from the North, Anita Pallenberg was the muse for some of the most powerful songs and films of the whole last half of the Sixties. She was the lover of Brian Jones, Keith Richards, and for a short spell, Mick Jagger; many Stones songs are about her. She co-wrote Performance with Donald Cammell, and inspired Kenneth Anger to create his opus, Lucifer Rising.So all these people came together and helped to make the film you're about to see. This film truly belongs to Jane Fonda though, as it was meant to I'm sure. I wish there were more films about beautiful, lusty, and brainy dames from outer-space, saving the world from destruction by evil forces. And doing it not with muscle, guns, yelling & screaming, or having to be a man in a man's world, but instead using love, and her insatiable capacity for truly orgasmic sex.Barbarella wants to teach you the way of the future. She wants you to drop your weapons, get naked, roll around on faux-fur, and learn to embrace your mane of disheveled hair. Barbarella thinks war is stupid, and that lucite is the only thing ever worth fighting for, that and maybe a pair of green thigh-highs.",Barbarella
120,nbwritersinbox,60s Extravaganza: Viva Italia.,9,22 April 2011,"The film-makers made two wise decisions when shooting ""Barbarella"". The first was to spend as much time as possible filming Jane Fonda. I'd forgotten just how beautiful she was during the 1960s. At the time of shooting, Jane's at the height of her considerable powers, and breathtakingly gorgeous in every frame.The second wise decision amounts to casting Miss Fonda in the first place. The girl can act. Plenty of ability is required in light comic roles, so Jane's far from just ""window-dressing"", despite the Italian penchant for stylistic excess.The production itself is lavish, exploring 60s Cinema's desire to demonstrate artistic originality. By today's standards, the special effects seem quaint, but I personally adored the non-CGI inventiveness of the wacky machines and unlikely objects Barbarella finds herself examining and using throughout 98 minutes of fun-packed enchantment.Box office takings suggest Barbarella was a commercial flop, but this hardly matters. With the right director and production team, such a wonderful film could be remade as a masterpiece of futuristic splendor. I'm sure modern audiences would agree... (But all film companies beware, you'll need an actress of Jane Fonda's quality to fill Barbarella's boots).Fabulous costumes, quirky settings and thought-inducing ideas are other features of this retro-delight. The rich contrast between Barbarella herself (as ""nice-girl-nextdoor"") and The Great Tyrant played by equally stunning Anita Pallenberg (as a kind of leatherclad rock queen) make for unforgettable viewing.Oh, and remember guys: ""Angels have no memory"".",Barbarella
121,heathblair,The problem with Barbarella is...,4,31 October 2011,"...she doesn't really do anything. Rather than create the ground breaking heroine they could have, Vadim and his all-too-male crew go for the easy option by portraying the character as not much more than a deceptively dull Barbie-doll figure. She moves from one situation to the next like a wide-eyed tourist, barely taking part in the proceedings, let alone actually causing things to happen. I don't think she solves a single problem in the entire movie. Not with her mind anyway.This is a cardinal sin in film making: creating a lead character who is NOT proactive.Female viewers might be disappointed that the promise of a feisty, sexually confident, independently minded action heroine is only partly fulfilled. Yes, the character is sexually confident, but even that is at the service of the male characters in the film. As for the rest, forget it. Pity. The film makers should have looked to Emma Peel/Kathy Gale from The Avengers for a model of how Barbarella could have worked.On the upside, the movie looks great - terrific psychedelic designs and sets. Good fun for the eye. However, while individual static shots are well composed, Vadim doesn't do much with camera movement, so the film isn't as graceful as it could be. He doesn't seem to know much about pacing either - the internal rhythm of the movie is a little bit off which adds to the unsatisfying feel of the whole thing.The cast is fine. Fonda, an otherwise superb actress, does her best with a non-character. She hints at the intelligent, resourceful character Barbarella might have been if the script had been on her side. Milo Oshea is great as the mad scientist, and David Hemmings is fun, if a little wasted, in what amounts to an extended cameo.In summary, a hoot for fans of super-camp kitsch cinema, and a bit of a male sex-fantasy for undiscerning 14 year old boys of all ages, but otherwise, and from the viewpoint of modern grown-up audiences, just an hour and a half of tiresomely sexist trash. Ironically, if Vadim and Co. had retained the sexiness of Barbarella's character but boosted her IQ and resourcefulness then the film might be enjoying a far greater reputation than it currently does. It wouldn't have taken much effort, but they blew it.",Barbarella

Barbaella was released in 1968 by Paramount right before Jane Fonda's emergence as a serious actress in They Shoot Horses, Don't They(1969) as well as an anti-war activist. Directed by Fonda's then husband Roger Vadim, Barbarella is a moderately amusing time killer blending elements of scifi and soft core. It was a huge BO success. Fonda looks great and manages to be both sexy and innocent with her weightless striptease during the opening credits a definite highlight. The plot is never really involving; it's an excuse to get Fonda naked one way or another. Fonda and Hemmings are both good.",Barbarella

However, it follows a basic plot line of a very beautiful hero/heroine goes on a journey to save someone who they do not know. On her journey she meets many different type of aliens and people.

It's obviously not meant to be taken seriously and is a delicious, camp psychadelic space adventure that perfectly encapsulates all the things that make the 1960s look so fun. It's about FUN people and this movie has loads to throw around. Barbarella (Jane Fonda) is sent on a mission through space to find a missing scientist.  On the way she has many amazing adventures and tittilating encounters.  My favourite bits include: 1. Barbarella and blind angel Pygar (John Philip Law who funnily enough doesn't have any wings in the re-release poster) flying toward the dark city and having to shoot down the Black Guard forces of the Queen (the guards are very sinister and are composed entirely of leather armour). 2. The creepy children and their eerie and deadly killer dolls which bite chunks out of our heroine with their metal jaws. 3. Anita Pallenberg (with the voice of Fenella Fielding) as the wicked Queen. 4. The orgasm machine which crazed scientist Duran Duran uses to torture Barbarella (except she's starts to enjoy it)Great cameos for Ugo Tognazzi as Mark Hand and David Hemmings (Blow Up, Eye Of The Devil) as the resistance leader Dildano.  Lots of colourful characters and set pieces.  Lots of great ideas (those poor earth suckers whose idea of sex is to take a pill, ha ha). Never a dull moment in a psychadelic space adventure for lovers of the offbeat and bizarre.  This is what cult movies are all about.  Of course alcohol or drugs can be ideal companions to the movie but if you're a cult movie fan you'll enjoy it just as well without them.",Barbarella
125,ctosangel-2,Sixties enjoyable science-fiction movie,5,23 May 2002,"This is one of the most popular films play in Europe by Jane Fonda during her sixties love affair with French director Roger Vadim. The movie could be a pioneering work of science-fiction films that would came later. In fact, it was in some ways. The original story is based on a galactic Jean-Claude Forest comic, so the idea was really bright, the set was good and expensive -even a bite kitsch-, custume were designed by fashion men Paco Rabanne and the casting results very adequate. Fonda was by this time at her best moment with her body almost adolescent, her baby doll face, knavish model Anita Pallenberg and tall boy John Phillip Law. But Vadim work, pretentious and clumsy for many cinematographic critics, cut down the hope. Watched today this ´Barbarella´ is out of date even still enjoyable, candid and excessively puritan, and that is curious as they tried to got a erotic product as well.",Barbarella
126,lanierhunt,Cinematic purgatory,5,22 February 2016,"Imagine ""Bring Your Son to Work Day"" in the Star Trek writer's room. While the adults are on lunch break after a fruitful morning of pounding out stories, their 14 year-old sons decide to make some changes. Poof: ""Barbarella.""Jane Fonda stars as the titular heroine, some sort of intergalactic ambassador for Earth. She's given a mission by the President of Earth--who insists getting dressed is wholly unnecessary--to collect a man by the name of Durand Durand--sounds familiar--who has built some sort of superweapon. The plot isn't important.The entire conception of the film seems to have been, ""how many strange, creative outfits can we get Jane Fonda to wear, and how many strange, creative ways can we get those outfits off?"" Her clothes are ripped to shreds by everything from metal-mouthed, porcelain dolls to an army of agitated parrots. I can get behind weirdness, and this film has plenty of it. In fact, it's a visual Chinese buffet--in that there's a little bit of everything and it's dirty. However, as goofy and bizarre as the film gets, it's insufferably lifeless--easily the most boring film ever made to include the line, ""De-crucify the angel or I'll melt your face!""While not being the complete and total camp-fest I was hoping for, there's still a lot of smirk-inducing material. The interior of Barbarella's ship looks like the groovy inside of an inside-out buffalo. The climax to the film is, well, just that. And there's a blind angel who has the unique honor of delivering the most mundane last line in film history.Even some of the intentional humor works, including--but not limited to--such as the fact that Barbarella, whenever faced with an alien language, always tries her native English first, then--for some inexplicable reason--French. ""Barbarella"" isn't bad enough to be good or bad enough to be bad; it's trapped in the cinematic purgatory of ""is that the one with the thing?""

It has neat sets and costumes and that groovy sense of challenging conventions that characterizes so many films of the late 60s, but those things don't change the fact the movie is fundamentally stupid.  Characterization and plot are not really the point here, so it's hard to fault its failings in those areas, but when Vadim tries to express any kind of meaning, his ineptness becomes embarrassing. ""An angel is love,"" delivered like the most meaningful line in all of cinema, makes the viewer cringe.  Over-long and overblown, this film is best watched with a forgiving heart.",Barbarella

The story line is ridiculous. The space ship looks like something made by a third grader. I could go on Oh yes, don't forget the music! Personally, I feel the 60s was an era of both tremendously creative and embarrassingly bad music; I'll let you guess which category Barbarella's soundtrack falls into Why did I give this movie three stars?

131,eyeache,40 millenia ahead of its time,10,1 March 2009,"This is one of the most profound visions of the future ever conceived, second only to that of H.G.Wells. Of course, Wells's Time Machine travelled 800,000 years into the future, whereas Barbarella is a mere 40,000 ahead of us, and still has a long way to go. But the important message signalled by both of these brilliant anticipations is that the future is terminally tacky. Mankind doesn't evolve, it devolves: and the people populating Sogo and its cosmic neighbourhood are steadily devolving into what will eventually be known as the Eloi. Only 760,000 years away from their ultimately meaningless destiny! Already, however, there is little point to their existence, which is lived out in an atmosphere of almost total virtuality. The purpose and reality of anything surrounding them have nearly been banished, except for the minimal threat presented by Durand Durand, who plans to rule the universe by destroying it with the positronic weapon he has invented. Well, that's a very logical and sensible plan, and someone has to stop him, though the reasons are obscure, if the beautiful and less beautiful creatures are to continue devolving. The heavy task is assigned to Barbarella, and her methods fit right into the world she inhabits. The mind is boggled by this stunning masterpiece of creative thought, and the lucidity of its exposition makes an indelible impression. Thought-provoking isn't the word. This movie definitely knocks clunky old Kubrick's boring and clumsy 2001 into the nth dimension.",Barbarella
132,ollieoxen27,Sexual and sad,6,1 May 2014,"Barbarella has to be the most overtly sexual movie ever made and it was amazingly made in 1968! Jane Fonda's sexiness was the only reason 49% of the population watched it and aside from the Vadim/Fonda cinematic ambitions little reason why it should have been made. Art it was not! When I lived in a dormitory at the University of Missouri in the 1960s we called Jane Mighty Fine a Vagina. At the time of Barbarella and Cat Ballou she was considered the sexiest woman in Hollywood. In the most truthful terms it can be said that Roger was pimping her. Who does something like that to their loved one? Now to the sad part. Beautiful women in movies and beautiful women in real life live the dubious life of being sex objects. It's been going on for millions of years and it's still going on. Beautiful women with dark souls enjoy it and become Succubus and the decent women who would want to be loved, liked, appreciated, valued, or feel worth two cents just feel frustrated and disappointed. They feel conflict and filthiness when they sense some pig wants to jump their bones. The feminist movement sure didn't help the situation because deranged women always knew there is no power without sexuality. Woman's and men's intellects have little value in our culture.Several years ago Jane was interviewed on Oprah and they both talked about how meaningful her life was. If I had been there I would have asked her if she felt like she had been used by every man she knew and hated by every woman?

133,patrick3201,"Not a book, this is a lava lamp",9,5 December 2001,"Anyone who has enjoyed a Bollywood film or traditional Japanese theatre will know that realism isn't everything. Having a stylised approach can produce something that's very entertaining and (dare I say it) quite beautiful.Some people seem to laugh at this film and call it dire because the effects aren't realistic and the plot isn't coherent. Well, I just think you're missing the point by a long way. The thing that makes something like an Ed Wood movie very funny is that it takes itself so so seriously and tries so so hard while failing so so completely. Barbarella doesn't even try to be serious, and most of the actors (regardless of what Fonda herself might have been thinking) have their tongues planted firmly in their cheeks.The nearest modern equivalents to Barbarella are (strangely!) Peter Greenaway's imagery-based films like ""The Pillow Book"" and ""The Cook, The Thief..."" which also have very fake looking sets and effects, apparently huge plot holes and bouts of overacting, none of which matter because Greenaway isn't trying to make a straightforward dramatic narrative. Of course Barbarella isn't at all serious or as intellectual, but it does have the same visual quality. It's possible that Barbarella's director intended to make a ""proper"" film and failed, in which case the brilliance of the film rests on the designers who came up with such inspired visuals as Barbarella's fur-lined rocket, the computer that flips cards to talk, the mercury tinted spacehelmet (and the entire opening sequence), the mathmos sleeping chamber, the sail-sledge, the ""essence of man"" bubble, Duran Duran's pleasure-torture device, the death sentence of birds, the post-coital perm, the blind angel etc.Not everyone will like this film, because not everyone likes 1960s psychedelia, but if that period is ""your bag"" then this film is for you. Barbarella consists of an amazing series of images that achieve what they set out to do, and that's why this is a genuinely good film, and definitely not a ""so bad it's good"" affair. I'm shocked to hear people say the film is some kind of failed b-movie. The triumph of Barbarella is that every single frame is so pretty or interesting it could be sold as a picture in its own right, and that's why it's been so influential and watched over the years.This film may not be a good yarn, and it might not be a faithful adaptation of the original comic books (Drew Barrymore is apparently to star in a more accurate version), but as a piece of sixties style this is an excellent album of striking and original visuals.(Incidentally, as a tribute to Barbarella's 60s credentials, the company that invented the original lava lamp was so impressed by this film that it renamed itself Mathmos in honour of the glowing gunk which lies under the city.)",Barbarella

I don't care much about the other actors. Law is a stiff actor and no one else really catches my attention. For me this film is having Jane Fonda as eye candy and I loved it. She's gorgeous.

Which, frankly, is Barbarella in a nutshell.Some decent villains would help.

Although I couldn't hear the sound, the visual impression stayed with me ever since. When this movie was released on DVD, I purchased it right away. Adding sound and dialog to my visual memories of Barbarella propelled me into psychedelic bliss. This movie is the epitome of the 1960s social atmosphere. Unabated guilt free sex, psychedelic imagery (ala lava lamp special effects), and mind altering pill popping. Jane Fonda, prior to becoming a pariah in this country, delivers the essence of Barbarella in perfect fashion. A sex kitten with childlike innocence, questionable intelligence, and a body that won't stop pleasing the eye. The opening track from Bob Crewe and Charles Fox is an amazing piece of silliness, complete with goofy lyrics, and seems to take itself all too serious, although I am sure Crewe was laughing as he penned it. It reminds me of the kiddies Fireball XL-5 theme song. Barbarella's terribly aerodynamic deficient spaceship rivals that of 1930s Flash Gordon in hokeyness (sans sparks), and looks like it is made out of plywood. I can go on and on, but I won't.

While viewing this movie one must keep in mind that it was created in 1968 and therefore has a lot of beatnik influences. The story is of course ridiculous and extremely over the top (take her spacecraft with luxurious carpet as an example). All of the characters have little psychological depth and are therefore so-called flat characters. For example Barbarella (Jane Fonda) is just a force of the good and never has any doubts about her mission. Her enemy Duran Duran(Milo O'Shea) is obviously completely evil with the usual intent to conquer the universe. In our time it does strike me as a little weird that Barbarella is from a part of the universe that doesn't know war and where weapons are relics that are kept in a museum. This is of course exactly the beatnik philosophy and this also explains why Barbarella sleeps with various men (including one with obviously fake chesthair, yeww!) during the movie.

Deeper and more complex characters would have been completely out of place (and would have prevented some benevolent satire to emerge).The same goes for the atmosphere and the special effects. With age they become more evocative. Who cares about realism? By the way, is a fur lined spacecraft interior less realistic than people dueling with lightsabers?Come on, IMDb people, give this work of art the rating it deserves.",Barbarella

In this case it also describes what is most important with regard to Barbarella. Jane Fonda. But while Jane has aged magnificently over the years, one can't say the same about Barbarella. Sadly, this is one of those movies, which were exciting then and when you watch it you can still see why that was the case, but nowadays it just isn't that exciting anymore. The visuals are clearly identified as staged, the oversexualization of Fonda seems forced and the story itself is pretty dull. Of course, one can image how this movie played at the time of its initial release. The guys who were in love with Fonda. The stoners and a little bit of counter culture. It has this B-Movie vibe, that would definitely come to life in the right, drugged up circumstances. But that wasn't the case when I watched. it Sober and interested in movie history I wanted to cover this gap. Finishing the movie I was satisfied with doing that, mildly entertained and of course thinking: Oh Jane!",Barbarella

Great characters, a killer lava lamp, fur lined space ship and a villain called Duran Duran.The evil organ of desire scene, and the opening strip tease still manage to be erotic, even though this film is dated.

153,PharmacyJohn,The director of this film was a tripper,9,9 August 2001,"The is one of the best movies to watch when tripping. Everyone has their own trip movie, this one used to be mine. I've probably seen it about 30-40 times. Tripping brings out the cheesy cinematic visuals, and turns them into real delights, not to mention alerts you to things that you weren't away of before.Barbarella crashes on a planet and gets almost killed by kids, gets laid, finds a city that is a maze, gets laid, finds her way into the city, almost gets laid by a woman, finds the underground gorillas , gets laid, finds a scientist, and gets laid. The sex isn't very suttle and isn't crude in any way, but provides something to laugh at. This movie is crazy. It's a great wonderful thing to look at the styles of what was considered futuristic back then; the art direction of the psychedelic sixties, the attitudes of the actors, what was considered sexy, and the colors and visuals and textures and some wicked/demented looking places throughout the film. One of the Best nostalgic futuristic movies EVER!The last time I saw this movie was 4 years ago. I was tripping off of the visuals when suddenly Barbarella turned into Mariah Carey riding on an angel's back. That's what ended the movie for me. Since than, I haven't tripped or seen the movie; the experience of Jane Fonda turning into Mariah Carey isn't something to take nicely, especially it being Mariah Carey. I think that it should be mandatory for whole the culture that takes mind altering substances to watch this movie when tripping.

But, putting Jane aside, one should watch this movie and enjoy the overall fun of this movie. The special effects were very Flash Gorden. The over all comic book effect is fun. Deno De Lourentis produced it and Janes husband (at the time), Rodger Vidam directed it. This was a early film for a lot of great, directors,producers and actors. The special effect/background were very well done. It is quite campy in a lot of ways with a lot of sexual overtones, i.e. the (orgasmitron), a few flights, and other such topics which were not talked about at that time.

158,alaskanlawnmowing,"besides sensual shots of Jane Fonda the film is filled so much with philosophy, you might just miss them, although being mesmerised by Barbarella's beauty might help",10,6 January 2007,"When I first read about this movie, I was interested in it because it had John Philip Law, who played Sinbad(1974) and also because it looked very visually entertaining, especially because of Jane Fonda. It was much different back-round-wise than I thought in that it was basically filmed on some sets, but philosophically wise it blew my mind, with so many little, subtle comments on humanity that I was really overwhelmed. There was a lot of imagery, as well as Jane Fonda, to spark some creative, 60's style thinking within me. The different things in it, like the ""pills"" (with the silly hand thing), the 'but the universe has been pacified for centuries!' the greeting 'love' and such really conveyed a sense of the 60's, with sex, love, and such, really coming through. The author Jena-Claude Forest, is like a lot of French authors known in America, grant the knowing may be small, in that he has a layered work of fiction that besides having a storyline, like all stories do, has so much philosophy intertwined that it could take a while analyse the movie's different philosophies, views on life, social commentary etc. And even though there wasn't much real-world footage in the movie, it served its purpose as a visually entertaining erotic sci-fi, even though its mild compared to a lot of modern stuff. It has lots of commentary in it, that would be better understood by one who watched it for the visuals. The idea that the ""old fashioned way"" is better, is quite humanistic and central to the idea that no matter how technologically advanced humans become, sex will always be there, as an everlasting part of human character. The different kinds of people are portrayed literally though the myriad of characters, who convey different lifestyles, views, etc on life through what they are doing, how they look and dress, etc. Barbarella is the perfect, sexy, innocent, good, and wholesome woman, who is a balanced individual, who is seen to be the most adaptable, which would explain why she is the heroine, while the Ice Man is the simple, good, wholesome, manly, guy, who prefers ""the old fashioned way"". Pygar seems to be this pure being, (as he is an angel), who was ""de-masculinated"" in that he ""lost the will to fly"" even though he is still helps Barbarella. Anita Pallenburg is the at heart truthful, but lesbian like woman who wants meaning and companionship, even though she is outwardly corrupt and seemingly full of debauchery, although by the end, she seems much more normal. Dildano, is the thoughtful, yet innocent rebel, who to me, seems to represent those unsure, or afraid of sex, in that he prefers to do it with the pill after 'waiting five years' for the chance.The scientist Duran Duran to me is the kind of man who seeks the meaning of life and is dissatisfied, leading him to seek more, and devote his life to research and learning for personal philosophical advancement. There is a lot more that could be analysed, but we wouldn't want to die from excessiveness, now would we! This film, like a lot of great films I have watched, left me feeling nostalgic for the beginning of the movie and wanting more. A good movie in my opinion, often is one that is very touching philosophically and maybe in other ways (visually) that leaves the viewer wanting more, wanting a sequel that tragically would be, as the viewer would know, worthless and not as good as the same. Bittersweet and all ending is how Barbarella felt from the light, innocent, breezy, sexy opening to the deep, nostalgic yearning for more, and thought inducing end. -George",Barbarella
159,Fles,Niche,6,24 February 2008,"Very much a film of its age, this film is relentless, unmitigable shite from beginning to end, and yet it is a delight to watch.It will particularly appeal to anyone who thought the special effects in the original Flash Gordon TV series were over the top.The plot-holes are gargantuan, the continuity errors are abysmal, most of the story is absolute nonsense and yet this film is an absolute pleasure to watch. The fantastic excuses used to divest Jane Fonda of various pieces of her costume will have you choking into your popcorn.The seventies' view of a future of decadence is a breath of fresh air and the idea of absolute, insane evil is camped up to the max.

Barbarella a 34 years old film is so bad made that's really funny (just the opposite to Lucas one. Too well made that's boring). All special effects are hand made, one can see the background screen used on some scenes (i.e. when the angel flights), the gravitation effect at the beginning is filmed over a glass (reflection can be seen easily), the starship is made in ""porexpan"" and paper. If you like serious sci-fic films (i.e. Blade Runner) just forget about Barbarella, but if you want to laugh and enjoy for the standard 94 minutes, just rent the film and open your mind. Sexuality is a main key part of the film. Some images are quite surprising for a 1968 film, even for today (see when some women are smoking ""man scent""). Highly funny is also see the sex machine playing against Barbarella (guess who wins...)",Barbarella

The only problem is that her world is made up of Christmas lights, cellophane and balsa wood, and it's all held together with scotch tape.However what some might consider schlock entertainment, I saw it as pure camp all the way, with some hysterical situations and outrageous costumes draped over not-so-difficult-to-look-at actors (especially our babe-o-naught Ms. Fonda), and to top off the cake we have an icing of infectious music by comedic composer Charles Fox (9 to 5, Foul Play) and singer/songwriter Bob Crewe.This is pure candy all the way so don't expect any nutrition here, but if you let it happen instead of looking for more, you may find yourself inspired to watch it again and again, when you don't feel like using any brain cells in this dimension.",Barbarella

I would love to know what the budget was for this, considering the special effects are terrible, even for the time at which this was made. The original King Kong looked better than this trash, and the writing was far better too. Even George Lucas can write better than this and he's one of the worst screenwriters ever.

The set is extremely cute with it's Plexiglas chutes and ingenuous torturing machines such as a cage full of bloodthirsty budgerigars or organ of pleasure which pleases you to death. Another very charming thing about this movie is it's soundtrack full of very sweet and funny slightly psychedelic rock tunes. The funniest song is at the beginning of the movie where Barbarela undress her space suit until she is completely naked. Actually she is not completely naked because the credits cover her most vulnerable parts the whole time which makes it even better to watch . Barbarela is a comedy and a good one. If you accept it's apparent and complete silliness (in the best sense) you will love it. Just relax and laugh. Just to ensure you that this movie is really loved I want to point out a movie by Roman Coppola called CQ which pays tribute to Barbarela and if you like Barbarela and are at least a little bit romantic person you should see CQ as well.,Barbarella

Ok, the plot is very simple (save the world from the bad guy) but come on! What's wrong with that? how many movies doesn't have that basic plot anyway??!Jane Fonda is fantastic in this film! She plays the role of the innocent hero excellent, and her acting fits the character & the film perfect. She also looks her absolute best!After seeing Barbarella I searched the net, and I read somewhere that the film has been censored a lot. Strange, I mean Fonda is naked in the opening sequence so what has been cut out? Does anyone know? and is there an 'uncut' version out? usually I find uncut versions to be less good than the original release (there's a reason why a specific scene was left out) but since I really liked this movie it might just be worth watching anyway. if it exists of course!Anyhow, this is a must see movie. it's great and I'm even prepared to call it a cult movie.

So, I'll just ask a question or two:Are you a fan of 'B' movies?How about campy or farcical movies?If your answer to either of those questions is ""no"", then rent, buy, or watch something else.This is not 'On Golden Pond' (which I own and love). This is just a 'sit back and enjoy' cult classic. Throw out any preconceived notions of Oscar winning performances. This is just a fun movie.People, this is not a movie to be taken serious, nor was it written with that intent. As far as one reviewers' comment about everyone having a skeleton in their closet, Fonda is not ashamed of this film. This film keeps her on a different level than her usual sometimes stuffy roles, not to say those roles are bad by any means. I'm just saying, this is just one of those 'let your hair down, go nuts, and don't give a d*mn' moments that hopefully everyone is lucky enough to have in their lives to look back on and say ""I'm glad I did that"".Unlike some great stars, such as:Harrison Ford, who doesn't like to recognize 'Star Wars' as his great launch into stardom.Or, how about...Tom Hanks, who doesn't like to recognize 'Bosom Buddies', or 'Bachelor Party' at all! Two entertaining moments in his career. Both of which helped propel him into the spotlight in which he enjoys today.Long story short (too late), this is just a campy, silly movie. It's not for everyone. But if you're not going to like it, at least dis-like it for the right reasons. This was not a ploy for an Oscar. So don't try and philosophy a movie like this. Dis-like it because of the bad acting, err, uhm, no. Dis-like it for the bad effects, uhhm, strike that. Hey, how 'bout the bad plot? No wait, these are the pros, not the cons. I don't know.

The acting, plot, and dialog are all cheesy and superficial, but behind that is something legitimately engaging, worthy, even wondrous. Barabarella *is* creative and has an abundance of striking images that--by virtue of weirdness, ridiculousness, creepiness, or sexiness--will stick with you if you are paying attention.The effects are massively low budget by today's standards: it's more like you're watching a stage play than a film. But this stage play has scenery, costumes, and props that are often really gorgeous and interesting. You'll see hedonists smoking ""essence of man"" in the City of Night, the priests and architecture of that city, bizarre and disconcerting carnivorous dolls, the Excessive Machine and its hall scattered with the remains of ladies, and the psychedelic Chamber of Dreams.The movie has plenty of interesting concepts too, for which the comic is largely to thank. They are cheesily executed but still thought- provoking. The future has replaced physical sex with some weird psychic act. The galaxy is so peaceful that the only way to combat a terrorist is to dust off weapons found in an old museum. And we see a switcheroo on heaven and hell where the evil are exalted in the beautiful city and the good are exiled to wander around a bleary labyrinth.All of these things are wondrous to see. You just need a coping mechanism to deal with the fact that the dialogue is ridiculous and the acting is often lame--even Marcel Marceau. I found that I could just suspend judgement and go along for the ride. Maybe you can, zen-like, just ignore the embarrassment of it of it all. It's worth it.Did I mention that it's cheesy as hell?

The main rationale behind the film seems to be to get Jane Fonda to not wear very much (which may not be an ignoble ambition in itself, but will only carry the movie for the sad and desperate). Spoiler: yes, you get to see her breasts. Otherwise, this is notable mainly because the mad scientist she's hunting, Duran Duran, gave the English 80s pop band (who are still going I believe) their name, and because famous mime Marcel Marceau is in it. Spoiler: he speaks. I think it's aiming at comedy, but I can't believe the script is by the same guy who wrote the peerless Dr. Strangelove, because the humour simply falls flat most of the time. There's the odd scene or line that raises a grin, as when Fonda causes the machine which is supposed to kill her with pleasure to explode because she can take more than it can dish out, but mostly, this is only worth watching to see just how nonsensical it can get.",Barbarella

It's Franco-Italian design all the way through, a celebration of petroleum products and the best of the lava lamp aesthetic. Hard to tell if it's a parody of sci-fi or a parody of porn, or same difference is probably the point. There are some very stylized, sadomasochistic uses of Jane Fonda's long legs, at the same time that Fonda delivers the wittiest lines, in a very witty screenplay by Terry Southern (of Doctor Strangelove fame): ""Decrucify my angel immediately!"" (Kids, see if you can spot the Chucky in this 1968 precursor.) Skeptics should stay the course to learn what Duran Duran has to do with Barbarella. And Barbarella with the Black Queen. And the Black Queen with the Rolling Stones. And if you don't know what camp is, then you have to see Barbarella: even if the film is more sublime than camp, a kind of psychedelic Brechtian fantasia.

The plot is cheesy, the dialogue ranges from goofy to corny, the special effects are pre-George Lucas, and the tag line of ""an angel IS love"" is testimony to the worst remnants of goof ball 1960's culture. However, the set and costume designs are unbelievable, and the opportunity to observe Jane Fonda and Anita Pallenberg gallivanting about attired in fabulously sexy outfits is worth the price of admission. Yes, Jane is a leftist wing-nut, but she was a stone fox in 1968, and I'm happy somebody made the effort to document this for posterity.
