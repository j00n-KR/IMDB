0,Leofwine_draca,Madcap baby kidnap saga,8,7 October 2011,"The Coen Brothers are two of the wildest and most innovative talents working in Hollywood. For nigh on thirty years, they've been making movies which refuse to follow convention, often confounding expectations and delivering huge dashes of crazy humour along the way. ""Quirky"" doesn't do their films justice as a description, but RAISING ARIZONA, their second film, is one of their quirkiest.Nicolas Cage stars as a small-time con with crazy hair and a penchant for failed convenience store robberies. He falls in love with cute cop Holly Hunter, and along the way the two decide to kidnap a baby belonging to a rich couple (the baby being the 'Arizona' of the title). From then on in, the film is largely a chase flick, with lots of weird characters coming out of the woodwork to pursue the bumbling twosome. Much of the humour comes from the slow southern dialogue of the participants and the outlandish situations in which they find themselves.John Goodman and William Forsythe make a good comic pairing as two convicts who seem even more accident-prone than Cage and Hunter. The larger-than-life Randall 'Tex' Cobb (UNCOMMON VALOR) plays a figure straight out of a fantasy flick – an apocalyptic angel of death haunting Cage's every step. My favourite scene is the chase, in which Cage finds himself pursued by cops, a large pack of dogs, you name it (if you thought HOT FUZZ was the first film to set OTT action in a mundane shopping scenario, think again). Add in some references to Sam Raimi and a lightning-fast pace and you have a film that can only be described as a wild ride!",Raising Arizona
1,SnoopyStyle,Unique Coen Quirkiness,8,8 October 2013,"H.I. McDunnough (Nicolas Cage) is a non-violent repeat offender who keeps robbing convenience stores with an unloaded gun. He falls hard for Ed (Holly Hunter) the police officer who takes his mugshots. When he starts a life with Ed, he ends his criminal ways. Ed loves to have a child but finds that she's barren. They can't adopt because of his criminal past. The answer comes with news that unpainted cabinets magnet Nathan Arizona (Trey Wilson) gets blessed with quintuplets. They wouldn't miss one, would they? This is Coen brothers' unique cinematic vision. The music, the style are all Coen trademarks. The narration gives this its fanciful charm. It starts off with impressive robust humor. Cage is a likable charming petty criminal. He does his best puppy face. Hunter is amazing deadpanning her police persona. Then she changes gears completely as the manic mommy character. They are a funny couple. The story does get too crazy. At some point the manic energy overwhelms the movie. Maybe too much of a good thing isn't so great.",Raising Arizona
2,classicsoncall,"""Don't you come back here without a baby.""",7,23 March 2014,"This was a mildly amusing second effort from the Coen Brothers, not as good for my money as ""Barton Fink"", ""Fargo"" or ""The Big Lebowski"", but I guess you have to start somewhere. The title itself is a bit curious, you really have to see the picture to understand it. I could explain it here but you'd forget all about it. The story winds up with somewhat of an anti-climactic ending because the principals, H.I. (Nicolas Cage) and Ed (Holly Hunter) simply return the baby they kidnapped from the Arizona Family. John Goodman and William Forsythe provide some understated humor as ex-con pals of H.I. who overstay their welcome; their jailbreak scene would have made more sense if Goodman wasn't shouting at the top of his lungs just outside the prison walls. Similarly, the drama surrounding baby Nathan's kidnapping would have been more profound if Nathan Arizona (Trey Wilson) knew which one of his sons was missing, and if Mrs. Arizona didn't wind up missing in action during the second half of the story. Tex Cobb provides some entertaining interludes as the lone biker of the Apocalypse, on the trail of the missing tyke and mindlessly blowing away anything in his path. Personally, I couldn't figure out how Harry, Barry, Larry, Garry and Nathan Jr. knew their place in the crib.",Raising Arizona
3,gavin6942,"Not the Coens' Best, But Still Worth a Watching",7,9 September 2006,"The Coen Brothers have a long and distinguished career of making quirky, off-center films with fun characters and some sort of meaning-of-life background. This earlier film of theirs really kicks off what was to be an eventful 1990s for the Brothers Coen.A career criminal and his ex-cop wife kidnap a baby fro ma rich man, not for ransom... but to raise it as their own. The plot thickens when two old prison buddies of the main character break out and need somewhere to stay.What I really enjoyed was the variety of Raimi shots, especially the really long zoom-in one. One of the Coens (I forget which) was involved in ""Evil Dead"", so the Coen-Raimi connection runs deep. (Future films, like ""Hudsucker Proxy"", have the collaborating.... and cross-references happen on occasion, even in this film where ""Crime Wave"" is referenced. The grocery store scene even had some similar aspects that ""Intruder"" had.) Nicolas Cage is the star of this film (along with the lesser-known Holly Hunter and John Goodman). Cage is like Elvis. Some like the thin Elvis, some like the fat Elvis. There is a younger and an older Cage. This one is the younger (seen also in ""Trapped in Paradise""). While I enjoyed his performance in this movie, he seemed to still be a weak and uncomfortable actor. I prefer the older Cage (""Adapatation"", ""Lord of War"", ""Weather Man"").But by far the greatest character in this film was the biker of the apocalypse. At first only a brief dream, his role becomes bigger and bigger as the film goes on until he becomes more central to the plot. I don't know how to describe him other than to say he is literally Hell on Wheels and a force to be reckoned with.The down side? Besides being a less tight Coen Brothers film, and a weak Nicolas Cage, the only thing I can really say against this movie is something about the painted backgrounds. I found the scenery to be really fake. But, heck, maybe that was on purpose.Watch ""The Big Lebowski"", ""Hudsucker Proxy"" and ""Fargo"" first... but then come back for this Coen classic.",Raising Arizona
4,lee_eisenberg,Makes you respect the Southwest.,9,5 March 2006,"OK. So we know that the Coen brothers are the masters of the weird (think ""Barton Fink"", ""The Hudsucker Proxy"", ""Fargo"", ""The Big Lebowski"", ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?""). Well, if you want to know just how whacked-out they can get, look no further than ""Raising Arizona"". This movie also shows Nicolas Cage's comic abilities (he should have stuck to comedy and avoided action). He plays ex-con Herbert ""H.I."" McDunnough, married to his former jailer Edwina (Holly Hunter). When they discover that she can't have children, he comes up with the craziest plan: kidnap the son of a furniture salesman who has five babies.So they do this, and...well, I'm not sure how much I can tell you without giving away all the really funny parts. But I will say that you're sure to love this movie. It may even make you want to take a trip to the Southwestern US just to see if you can experience all this. Also starring Trey Wilson, John Goodman, William Forsythe, Frances McDormand, and Randall ""Tex"" Cobb.",Raising Arizona
5,jboothmillard,Raising Arizona,7,16 January 2007,"I think it was in Film Studies I heard about this film, considered by many a classic, my classmate was basing their auteur presentation on the work of filmmaking brothers Ethan and Joel Coen (Fargo, O Brother, Where Art Thou?, No Country for Old Men), so I was most interested. Basically (Herbert) H.I. 'Hi' McDunnough (Nicolas Cage) is the loser constantly in and out of jail for robbery, and he is always booked by female police officer Edwina 'Ed' (The Piano's Holly Hunter), and in the short time they spend together he flirts. When he is released for what he says will be the last time, he finds Ed and proposes marriage, which she accepts, and after the wedding they start a new life together in the Arizona desert in a trailer home. They are however very upset when it turns out that Ed cannot conceive, and with Hi's criminal record they are not allowed to adopt a baby, but then they see furniture store magnate Nathan Arizona (Trey Wilson) on TV. He has been blessed with five babies, i.e. quintuplets, and he jokingly says that they are ""more than they can handle"", so the couple plan to take one of the babies to raise it for their own. After letting all the babies out of the crib, Hi has an amusing series of crawling and catching to do, but he does eventually take one of the babies, supposedly Nathan Jr. Meanwhile, Hi's prison chums the Snoats brothers, Gale (John Goodman) and Evelle (William Forsythe) have tunnelled their way out to escape, and they find Hi hoping to stay and hide out, Ed isn't happy but agrees as they are his friends. Nathan of course wants his baby son back, he is offering a $25,000 reward to whoever finds him, he gets a visit from the fearful dark biker Leonard Smalls (Randall 'Tex' Cobb) demanding double, and when he refuses he plans to take the baby and sell it off. Hi ends up getting fired from his not great job drilling holes into sheets of metal when he punches his supervisor Glen (Sam McMurray) in the face, after he suggested his wife Dot (Fargo's Frances McDormand) and Ed should wife-swap. That same night Hi goes out late night to get some nappies for the baby, but he reverts to his old ways making his shopping trip a robbery, with an unloaded gun, and he and Ed end up being chased by the police. Next morning, Gale and Evelle have found out the real identity of the baby, and they decide to take it for the reward money, stopping for a bank robbery on the way, and Hi and Ed go after them. When the Snoats end up accidentally leaving the baby behind, the scary biker picks him up, and there is a showdown between him and a badly beaten Hi, but he is blown up by one of his own grenades. In the end, Hi and Ed return the baby to the crib and his father, Nathan says he won't do anything, and Hi has a realistic dream of possible future events, with the Snoats going back to prison, Nathan Jr. growing up, and them getting their own family. Also starring T.J. Kuhn as Nathan Arizona Jr., Lynne Dumin Kitei as Florence Arizona and Wild Wild West's M. Emmet Walsh as Machine Shop Ear-Bender. Cage and Hunter together and in their separate moments are really good, their over-the-top performances actually work, Goodman and Forsythe are really funny as the Laurel and Hardy style cons, and Cobb makes a hilariously scary motorbike riding villain, shooting and blowing up animals. I agree with the critics that this is like a real life Tex Avery cartoon, seven years before the wizardry of Jim Carrey's The Mask, the slapstick and dialogue jokes work well, and there is also some great camera-work similar to that of The Evil Dead, a likable comedy. Nicolas Cage was number 33 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars the film was number 44 on Film 4's 50 Films You Must See Before You Die, and it was number 31 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!",Raising Arizona
6,ccthemovieman-1,"20 Years Later, This Is Still One Of The Looniest Films I've Ever Seen",9,26 November 2006,"When I first saw this I thought it was one of the craziest movies I'd ever seen. Twenty years later, I still feel the same way. No matter how many times I view this, I shake my head in amazement at some of the things I see and hear. It's definitely one-of-a-kind.The wacky characters and outrageous story, of course, are the attractions here but I also enjoyed the low camera angles employed here by the directors, the Coen brothers, and I've always enjoyed Nicholas Cage's strange dialog in the narration.Everyone in this film - everyone but the little babies - are totally insane, beginning with the lead people, the husband-and-wife team played by Cage and Holly Hunter. I got most of my laughs, however, from the supporting cast of John Goodman and Bill Forysthe as escaped convicts, Trey Wilson as the father of the quints and Randall ""Tex"" Cobb as ""Leonard Smalls."" For a pro boxer, Cobb turned out to be a pretty good actor.If you're looking for something different, something really far out and funny, look no further.",Raising Arizona
7,Tweekums,A madcap comedy from the Cohen Brothers,9,14 February 2019,"Herbert I. McDunnough, known to one and all as H.I. or 'Hi' is a repeat offender who specialises in robbing convenience stores; each time he is arrested and sent to prison his picture is taken by police photographer Edwina 'Ed' McDunnough; they talk and gradually he falls in love with her. After being released from another spell in jail he proposes to her and they marry. She is desperate for a child but is infertile and his record makes adoption impossible... then a solution presents itself; a news report about the 'Arizona Quints' gives Ed an idea. They kidnap one of them! If that didn't complicate their lives enough two of Hi's prison mates break out and expect him to house them for a few days and a bounty hunter dubbed the 'Loner Biker of the Apocalypse' is searching for whoever took the baby.This comedy from the Cohen Brothers is a lot of fun from start to finish. The fact that it is going to be a comedy is apparent as soon as we see Nick Cage, who as Hi, sports hilarious 'bad hair'; he is great in the role and Holly Hunter is equally good as Ed. These are two likeable lead characters despite the fact that they have stolen a baby. The story has many over the top aspects but they never quite get too silly. There are lots of genuinely laugh out loud moments throughout the film and plenty of great characters as well as Hi and Ed. Most notable of these are escapees Gales and Evelle Snoats and Leonard 'Loner Biker of the Apocalypse' Smalls. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to anybody wanting a good laugh; if you are a fan of the Cohen Brothers it is a must see.",Raising Arizona
8,ma-cortes,Cohen brothers comedy with great entertainment and fun,7,15 July 2005,"This amusing picture concerns about an ex-convict (Nicolas Cage) who falls in love for a policewoman (Holly Hunter) who takes him a picture each time he goes to prison . Both of whom wish sons but cannot have any . Then they decide to abduct one from a couple with five children .

It's a splendid comedy with set pieces cartoon where the action and humor is continuous from the presentation until the ending . The film was influenced by the works of Preston Sturges and writers such as William Faulkner and Flannery O'Connor , known for her southern literature . Enthusiastic performances by the two main stars , Nicolas Cage is perfectly casted , though his relationship with the Coen Brothers wasn't respectful , but turbulent . When he arrived on-set, and at various other points during production , Cage offered suggestions to the Coen brothers, which they ignored . And Holly Hunter is sympathetic , giving an attractive acting . The movie that was shot in 10 weeks has its moments here and there and being pretty enjoyable and bemusing . Many crew members who had worked with the Coen Brothers on Blood simple (1984) returned for this film , including cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld , co-producer Mark Silverman , production designer Jane Musky , associate producer and assistant director Deborah Reinisch , and film composer Carter Burwell . Breathtaking cinematography by Barry Sonnenfeld who makes a great camera work , after becoming a famous director with many smash hits (Men in black) .

9,moonspinner55,Mayhem in a vacuum,4,5 August 2014,"Modern screwball comedy from filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen (both credited as the screenwriters, Joel as the director) involving trailer-trash couple from Arizona who kidnap a baby from another couple with infant quintuplets. To keep this dubious comic premise palatable, the Coens are quick to ensure that every character is an oaf: outrageous, selfish and stupid, and usually with an eccentric, violent bent. The picture is frenetically mind-numbing--cartoonish mayhem running wild down a skittering line between crazy logic and insipid insanity--yet some viewers find it masterfully done. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are both very attuned to the Coens' broad sense of humor, but only the bit players (an elderly cashier, a bank patron) come up with anything surprising. On the odd occasion when Hunter's ex-cop suddenly develops maternal instincts or (God help us) a conscience, the movie comes to a dead halt. It also stands curiously still in any two-person scene involving a great deal of dialogue. Cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld works creative-overtime like a man possessed, spiking individual scenes with his energy, but Joel and Ethan's screenplay is exceedingly thin. *1/2 from ****",Raising Arizona
10,Quinoa1984,a wacky farce that still has me grinning today.,10,4 August 2000,"Though I thought the Coen brothers (producer and co-writer Ethan and director and co-writer Joel) deserve a lot of credit here for this film, I also would like to point out Barry Sonnenfeld, who did some exceptional camera-work here, that (like there best film Blood Simple) actually provided some comedy in scenes (shows how Sonnenfeld became a famed comedy director). The plot is a good one, in which Nic Cage and Hoolly Hunter (both in one of they're best performances) play a con-man and police photographer who get married and want to have kids, but when she can't, they decide to steal a famous one. Pretty funny set-up, with some cool action provided along the way. What helps make it work almost 20 years later are the actors, and the strange set-pieces. John Goodman makes a good supporting actor here, along with his partner in crime. But the best- and the actor I keep forgetting his name of now- plays the biker in the most grimy, uncouth way that is a howler. It threatens to run off the hinges, like other Coen brothers movies, but it stays on pretty much till the end. Where else will you get a hire-wire chase involving a bag of diapers, and an ending that almost pulls everything to be, well, sweet?",Raising Arizona
11,Coventry,Perhaps the funniest film ever made,10,30 July 2003,"The Coen Brothers are genius !! That's not an opinion, that's a fact. I can appreciate and respect all kind of different opinions on all sort of matters, but not on this one. If anyone says the Coen brothers are bad, overrated or not funny, they are just plain wrong. Raising Arizona is the funniest story I've ever seen. It can go over the top as much as it wants and still it doesn't become bad. That's a great achievement only the Coen Brothers can do. Jim Carrey can't do it and neither can Mike Myers. At the same time, this story is emotional and warming. How often do you see a combination like that. Joel and Ethan Coen often use the same actors and actresses. And they're right cause those who play in their films belong to Hollywoods very best. John Goodman, Holly Hunter...and in this film Nicolas Cage !! Nic plays one of his best roles so far. Perhaps even THE best. Holly Hunter is great as always and this role fits her perfectly. I believe it was also written especially for her. No need to say John Goodman and William Forsythe give away flawless performances as well. Try also to pay attention to the rather small part played by Frances McDormand. Raising Arizona is about a criminal falling in love with a police woman. They wanna celebrate their love with a baby but they are unable to have one themselves. Than the news breaks! A rich couple in the area received quintets. 5 healthy young babies. Hi and Ed (our couple) think it's unfair and they decide to steal one of them so they could raise their own little family. Now, the few lines I've wrote appear already in the intro of the movie. I can hear you think : with what else are the going to fill the movie. Well, go and see. If you haven't seen this film yet it's a real shame. It's a must see for everyone!!! Some scenes are so hilarious you'll have trouble breathing, I assure you. This film doesn't need stupid faces or teenager sex jokes to be funny.",Raising Arizona
12,michaelRokeefe,An odd couple start a family via kidnapping.,7,14 March 2001,"Nicolas Cage is an inept criminal that is arrested for a botched robbery. He falls in love with a cute police photographer (Holly Hunter)and the two yearn to start a family immediately after getting hitched. Adoption seems out of the question, so why not kidnap a baby from a wealthy family that recently welcomed quints into the world. Things get real dicey when an axe-swinging biker brute is hired to find the scoundrels that stole the baby.The style and wit of Ethan and Joel Coen are beyond compare in the field of directing and writing comedy. Innovative camera work by Barry Sonnenfeld combined with laugh your butt off situations makes this movie a hoot to watch. Hilarious to the max.Also notable performances by John Goodman, William Forsythe and Frances McDormand. This comedy just does not get old. A laugh riot.",Raising Arizona

16,Boba_Fett1138,Very amusing early Coen movie.,9,20 November 2010,"This was only the second movie the Coen brothers directed together but it was already very obvious from very early on how incredibly great these two guys were, as directors and writers, of these sort of offbeat, screwball comedies, which is also the reason why always so many great actors have lined-up to appear in their movies, even when they weren't established names yet within the business. It also made me realize how consistent they have always remained in their style, with their writing and just overall approach of film-making. This movie is already over 20 years old by now but it still feels as if this could had easily been a movie that they Coen brothers just finished a couple of months ago.And as far as comedies go; This one is about as great and amusing as they can get. It's a real goofy comedy, that takes us back to the earlier days of cinema, when screwball comedies were incredibly popular. And this movie is really being a simplistic one and doesn't seem to worry one bit about ever getting too silly with its story or any of its characters.And yes, this movie is obviously a very silly one with both its story and characters and then especially its characters I would say. It's a quite adventurous movies, in which lots of crazy characters pop up as it progresses. The movie works out as such an amusing one thanks for large part to these very same characters and fine actors that are portraying them. It does make the movie feel a bit disjointed at times because so much is happening and so many different characters involved but yet as a whole it all still manages to work out more than great.Leave it up to the Coen brother to make these sort of backward but yet normal everyday characters as some extremely funny ones. It's not just the directing and acting that makes these characters work out but also truly its writing, which is simply sublime. Lots of the movie its comedy also often comes from its dialog, that will make you laugh guaranteed. But having said that, this movie would had still probably not worked out as well if it didn't had the Coen brothers distinctive, unique directing style and approach to it as well.I really loved some of the acting within this movie as well. I also love Holly Hunter in everything but who was also real great in this movie was big man John Goodman, who always seems to be at his best, from a comedy perspective, in a Coen brothers movie. The Coen brothers further more used many other actors, who would later become, or already were, regulars within their movies, such as most notably Frances McDormand, who at the time was also already married to Joel Coen.About as great and amusing as a comedy can ever get.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Raising Arizona

The two of them have a lightbulb moment when they are watching T.V. and see that a local business owner had quintuplets with the help of fertility pills.What was their lightbulb moment?

So they proceeded to steal little Nathan Arizona Jr. hence the title: Raising Arizona.These two extremely flawed characters are a barrel of laughs.

18,AlsExGal,A comic gem packed with Southwest-style humor and gags,9,10 October 2020,"""Raising Arizona"" is a gem from the 80's made by the oddball Coen brothers who definitely do not have any particular style of filmmaking. Who would think that the makers of something as dark as ""Blood Simple"" could make such a screwball comedy as this? Raising Arizona has a unique style of comedy that doesn't appeal to everyone, particularly if you have no knowledge of the ways and people of the American southwest, since the film is full of thoughts and lines that hilariously exaggerate the customs of the area. For example, after kidnapping an old man at gunpoint, taking him on a wild ride while running from the police after a robbery gone bad, and then falling through the front windshield onto someone's front lawn, the main character takes the time to say ""much obliged"" to the old man before continuing his wild run from the police. Manners are still important in the Southwest, even to a felon on the run.As the film begins, we see what appears to be a different kind of love story. Convenience store robber H.I. (Nicholas Cage) falls in love with a beautiful deputy, Ed (Holly Hunter), who continually takes his mug shot each time he returns to prison. Once married, H.I. promises to stay out of trouble for Ed and they decide to start a family. Unfortunately, they discover Ed is ""barren"" and unable to have a child. They try adoption, but H.I.'s past felonies raise a red flag at adoption agencies, prompting H.I to note that ""nature and the prejudices of others had conspired to keep us childless"". It just so happens at the same time the wife of rich businessman Nathan Arizona (Trey Wilson) gives birth to a set of quintuplets. Ed comes to the conclusion that the Arizona family has ""more than they can handle"" with their new children and decides to kidnap one of the babies, with the help of her husband. And this is all before the opening credits.Things become even more complicated when two of H.I's prison buddies break out of jail and decide to stay at his place until they can come up with a plan that will be the start of ""a crime spree that will encompass all of the Southwest proper - or we'll get caught - either way we're set for life."" They invite H.I. to join them admonishing him that they know he's ""partial to convenience stores, but the sun don't rise and set on the corner grocer"". Note that one of the escaped felons is played by John Goodman. If you haven't seen this film since it first came out in 1987 you might have forgotten this, since this is one of his early pre-Roseanne film roles. Eventually Ed and H.I. come to their senses and return the baby, and we get the impression from the conclusion that someday in the future Ed and H.I. will have children of their own.This film is full of sight gags and inside jokes that you have to watch carefully to get. For example, Nathan Arizona's commercials for his Unpainted Arizona furniture stores have a tagline of guaranteeing his merchandise is the best and cheapest ""or my name isn't Nathan Arizona"". As it turns out, we find out his name isn't Nathan Arizona, it is Nathan Huffhines. He changed it because ""would you buy an unpainted dinette set from a place called Unpainted Huffhines?"". This movie is a light comic piece. Don't let some of the Coens' other darker works dissuade you from seeing this film - there isn't a dark moment in the entire thing.",Raising Arizona
19,Aaron1375,"Funny comedy for the most part, loses it a bit near the end.",8,3 November 2010,"This movie was a funny film about a married couple who are incapable of having children. Adoption is out, thanks to the fact the man has been arrested numerous times for holding up places. So what is a couple desperate to have children to do? Well go out and kidnap a child of this wealthy family that has like a whole mess of babies. Of course, this is not going to go off without a hitch as a whole lot of problems start popping up including crazed bounty hunters, friends that drop by uninvited after they escape prison, and bizarre employers who want to wife swap. Nicolos Cage is good as is Holly Hunter and the humor is great up to a point. It kind of disappears though after the bounty hunter guy shows up at the end and at this point it got serious and there is virtually no humor left in the movie. Granted, this only encompasses maybe ten minutes of the movie, still it is a kind of weak ending considering all the funny things that were happening up to that point like the failed hold up of a convenience store and leaving a baby on the roof of a vehicle. Lots of strange stuff going on in this one too, overall though it was a funny comedy.",Raising Arizona
20,The_Void,Lovely Deep South crime caper,6,3 October 2004,"Raising Arizona, the Coens' offbeat southern set crime odyssey is an entertaining and funny ride, which sees wannabe parents (Nicholas Cage and Holly Hunter) go to extraordinary lengths to get themselves their own little bundle of joy. Those lengths are extraordinary indeed, as, after hearing that she is unable to have children, the couple go into Bonnie and Clyde mode, which results in Cage stealing the baby of a rich entrepreneur. The film delights in being over the top and silly all the way through. However, the film still takes on it's own reality, thanks to the Coen brothers. The brothers have a knack for creating worlds in their films that are somewhat unlike the real world; they do it in all of their films, but I think that this one is arguably the best of them in that respect. It's offbeat tone does make it extremely funny, and at times the films reaches levels of hilarity - but it's not laugh out loud funny, it's the sort of humour that comes together because of the entire thing, a running joke, if you will.Cage dons a Deep South accent for his role here, and is actually quite good at it. He is very believable in his role as a small time crook, and his haplessness is, at times, very funny. Holly Hunter stars opposite Cage as the policewoman whom he marries. Holly Hunter is good here in her role, but that's all. The more charismatic Cage outshines her, but she still does her job adequately. The rest of the film is adequately populated by a decent support cast that includes John Goodman, William Forsythe and a small role for Frances McDormand, who would of course go on to excel in the Coens' best film; Fargo. However, despite a good cast and a nice atmosphere; Raising Arizona is just missing something that hinders it from being the ultimate in silly crime films. What it's missing is the heart; there's nothing much for us to connect to these characters with, and also the film is a little too linear. In Fargo, there were many things going on, whereas here there's only really the central premise and a little side story involving two of Cage's friends escaping from prison. Still, this is a cut above the majority of small time crook films, and the Coens' names on the credits should be enough to entice any fan of cinema to see it.",Raising Arizona
21,SimonJack,A dumb mixed bag missing the humor,2,16 June 2017,"Early into this movie, I began to long for the crispy, witty dialog and funny scenes of the great comedies of the mid-20th century. A little longer and I longed for the hilarious antics of the screwball comedies and frantic escapades of the movies of yore. And shortly, I pined for the clever, funny and wonderful plots of the old comedies. In the absence of any and all of that, ""Raising Arizona"" is little more than a stupid conglomeration of skits. If there is any real humor here, its disguised by nitwit characters in a dumber than dumb story. This was one of the hardest films to stay with, just to see how it ended. How anyone can find this enjoyable is beyond me. I thought about bailing on it twice, but then I wouldn't be able to be fair in a review of the film. I stayed, and my review is that this film was a waste of time – in its making and for anyone who watches it. The only character that comes close to any humor is Nathan Arizona Sr. (played by Trey Wilson) – but just in his early scenes. For clever and funny writing, I could think of only one line that might get a smile from a few viewers. That's this one when Leonard Smalls (played by Randall Cobb) visits Nathan Sr. Smalls, ""You wanna find an outlaw, you call an outlaw. You wanna find a Dunkin' Donuts, call a cop."" The Coen brothers tried to use techniques that were very funny in original films of decades ago, but all flop here. One is a haphazard police chase with continuous shooting that hits nothing. Another is a chase in and around, up and down, and through different rooms in a house. This is a dumb movie, with mostly dumb acting, a dumb script, dumb scenes and a dumb story. Audiences of the day, and the critics, didn't think that much of the movie then. But as society seems to dumb down in succeeding decades, this movie has viewers who enjoy it. I wonder if most have ever seen any of the great comedies of the past. The film does have a touch of sickness about it, in toying with various crimes as humorous. This is a dud of a movie,",Raising Arizona
22,namashi_1,Had the potential to become a legendary film!,6,23 January 2011,"The Coen Brothers are unbelievably talented people. They have made films, that some filmmakers can only imagine to make. 'Raising Arizona' is amongst their good efforts, but for me, this flick got wasted after a point.An idea as interesting as 'Raising Arizona', is hard to find or even think about. An ex-con and An ex-cop kidnapping a child, and then running away with it, catches you instantly. The film begins brilliantly, and remains rock-steady to a point. The flaws and the spoilers come along, in it's sub-plot. The John Goodman-William Forsythe track is strictly average, and their portions are prolonged a bit more than it should have.Coen Brothers have delivered once again, no doubt. However, the film isn't as convincing as their idea was. My summary correctly states my opinion, this film Had the potential to become a legendary film! But due to some loose-ends, it's unable to meet it's unprecedented expectations! Performance-Wise: Holly Hunter is fantastic, as always. Nic Cage is spunky. John Goodman and William Forsythe scream their lungs out! Frances McDormand is brilliant in a brief cameo, while Trey Wilson is just about okay.On the whole, I expected it to be more zany and interesting, and it didn't deliver the amount of laughs I expected from it. Nonetheless, a good film!",Raising Arizona
23,MovieAddict2016,It's just not very funny,6,28 December 2004,"Although many people consider ""Raising Arizona"" to be one of the funniest films of all time I find it an extremely overrated motion picture. The Coen Brothers are certainly unique filmmakers and as a duo they are one of my favorites - but the problem is that sometimes they try to be so bizarre and over-the-top that their story suffers. ""Fargo"" was really the perfect balance of dark humor and exaggeration - it is their most mainstream film and definitely the one with the most restrained humor. ""The Big Lebowski"" is really over-the-top but it's hilarious from start to finish.""Raising Arizona,"" like ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"", suffers from a pretty weak script and wandering direction. It starts as a straightforward (albeit strange) comedy, turns into drama, and ends as a wacky over-the-top action film. It's all done tongue-in-cheek but a lot of the humor just isn't very funny at all. The Biker from Hell being a good example of something that is pretty clever (sort of poking fun at the stereotypical villains) but it's just so bizarre it's not even funny! The movie is fairly realistic in the beginning but by the ending it's like watching some really bad cartoon with human actors - people are literally flying into the air for goodness sake! The movie is very amusing at first but once it starts trying to focus more on its plot it suffers a lot. First of all the humor basically becomes childish and/or nonexistent - Cage abducting the child is just not very funny and it goes on far too long. After that there are really only a handful of good jokes and even then they're nothing compared to ""The Big Lebowski."" Also the chemistry isn't very good. Holly Hunter's character is totally unlikeable and thin (as in: given no proper introduction). She isn't developed well at all, she seems like a masochistic b**ch rather than someone we like to root for. Cage is really good in his role and that's a shame because the idea of him being married to her really becomes grating. The Coens really misfired with her character.Many subplots and characters that are introduced are unnecessary and/or frustrating...loads of potential with John Goodman's character but it's all pretty much wasted in a barrage of stupid ideas.Overall I would have preferred a movie exclusively about the Cage character and his misadventures - once the film settles down into its plot and focuses more on Hunt and the rest of the cast it loses a lot of steam and potential....I can't really understand why so many people like this film. Sometimes I dislike a film and can at least see why others might think it's great - but with ""Raising Arizona"" I really do feel it's a major misfire from the Coens and their later projects - ""Fargo,"" ""Miller's Crossing,"" ""Big Lebowski,"" ""Barton Fink"" - are a whole lot better.",Raising Arizona
24,DKosty123,Offbeat Dark Comedy Full of Surprises,8,22 November 2010,"The Coen Brothers were doing their 3rd film here.

25,KineticSeoul,Hmm,6,8 February 2016,"This really is a strange and bizarre movie and I don't mean bizarre as in ""Eraserhead"" where it's very difficult to follow what is going on. You actually can follow the story fairly easily, it's just the character interactions and what they do just came off so strange. And sometimes even way over the top. Watching this movie was like watching a children's fairy-tale for adults. It's like the location in this movie is bizarre land with strange and quirky characters. Nicholas Cage was just right for this role as a likable incompetent ex-convict that falls in love with a female cop. But the female cop wants a baby, but she is infertile. So the couple decides to rob a baby from parents that have like 5 babies so they decide to steal one of them. After that just mayhem and weird interactions ensues. While ""Miller's Crossing"" (another Coen brothers's film) is a tightly written plot with snappy and sharp dialogue. This seems to be a film the Coen brothers just made to have fun with. Coen brothers often writes memorable and stand out characters and in this it's full of quirky ones. Not necessarily memorable but they are quite quirky and really has that indie vibe going for it. This is a cult film that will be a hit for some and others will just not like it. This is suppose to be a comedy and most of the jokes comes from the over outrageous visual humor and exaggerated expressions. I personally thought it was watchable, but will probably never watch it again. 6.3/10",Raising Arizona
26,ElMaruecan82,Pure hillbilly fun ...,9,30 September 2013,"You've gotta hand it to the Coen brothers, they sure know how to inject style and flamboyance in their creations. And to think that ""Raising Arizona"" was only their second feature film makes the accomplishment even more impressive although ""Blood Simple."" was a powerful announcement of two upcoming talents threatening to shake Hollywood's conventions with a unique sense of eccentricity, and human depth.""Blood Simple."" was still borrowing some elements from film-noir and Hitchcock movies, and, no matter how effective it was, it could have easily been targeted as an exercise in style. This is why the Coen brothers couldn't have made a better choice by making a zany comedy with a tender and more optimistic tone. And not only the film works but ""Raising Arizona"" is now a comedy classic, so special that it doesn't even deserve to be mentioned in the same breath than 80's comedies for the simple reason that it differs from what was made in that decade. And that's the thing about the Coen brothers, they make timeless films, set in universes, playing like crossroads between fantasy and reality, where their stories float with a bizarre but so penetrating poetry.I know this is a Coen brothers' so we're tempted to get deeper on the subject. Granted it's not just a story about two people who kidnap a baby because they can't have one, there are far more symbolism and philosophical material lying underneath the screwball carapace, but how about enjoying the film for what it is: one hilarious piece of cinematic greatness carried by the kind of colorful cast that made the Coen's films so lively. And what a cast! Nicolas Cage is H.I. aka ""Hi"" McDunnough, a multiple recidivist specialized in robbing market stores and Holly Hunter is Edwina aka 'Ed', the photographer who took so many mug shots she ended up proving that indeed, opposites attracted.But the Coen brothers are not the type of directors to comfortably sit on the presence of two solid protagonist, they know supporting characters are the spices that give the film its flavor. So, we have the two escaped prison buddies, two brothers played by two Johns, John Goodman, who'd become one of the Coen's greatest asset with such a physical presence he'd steal the show anytime, anywhere and Forsythe as his dim-witted brother. There is Sam McMumurray as Glen, the bourgeois pain-in-the-ass and the late Trey Wilson as Nathan Arizona, father of cute blonde-haired quints, the furniture magnate whose motto consist on concluding all his statements with ""or my name isn't Nathan Arizona"".Each character illuminates the screen with a unique presence, even little Nathan Jr. makes you believe people would kill each other to get him, and Frances McDormand is given a less important part but plays it with the required over-the-top way you'd expect from the woman who chose a guy like Glen for husband. Speaking of Glen, nothing against Sam McMurray but I would have loved to see John Turturro playing his part, if only because it would have made ""Raising Arizona""'s the consummate Coen brothers' film, with characters before stories. Hell, it goes even to the point where the most seemingly inoffensive market-cashier can tot a gunshot and become a Dirty Harry-like figure, no one is to be underestimated, not when laughs are at stakes.Naturally, such story deserves a worthy villain and this is where Randal 'Tex' Cobb makes his entrances, as a man coming from nowhere, supposedly incarnating the devil, whenever he goes, grass never grow back and this modern Atilla of biker of the apocalypse first emerges in HI's dream after he stole Nathan's kid. He symbolizes HI's conscience, something that will torment him until he finds the way to redeem himself, and this is the philosophical stuff hidden beneath the film, it's about characters doing morally wrong things, and finding their own path to redemption. When a recidivist teams up with a cop and both stole parents' fruits of love, you know this ain't the way to reach marital happiness.And the whole narrative is cooked up up in typical Mid-West accent, flirting with caricature but giving ""Raising Arizona"" its colorful spirit, the same as ""Fargo"" with its overuse of Scandinavian accent made of ""Yah"" and ""You betcha"". This is the Coens' signature and it doesn't limit to dialogues but goes to the soundtrack and from the title to the score, you have the hillbilly thing screaming all over the place. Till today, it's impossible not to hear ""Raising Arizona"" without having that fast-paced upbeat banjo music and catchy yodel that makes you want to escape from whatever makes your routine. You got it, ""Raising Arizona"" is pure entertaining escapism, with a man and a woman giving their life a meaning the wrong way, before learning the lessons, the hard way.And what a lesson! the conclusion of the film is probably the most insightful and beautiful thing ever put in a film, transcending the limits of comedies to something that cuts straight to your heart. And by the way, I couldn't believe Roger Ebert's review, my only guess he didn't have enough perspective and he probably changed his mind after. But thanks to Ebert, I learned the definition of a good movie, from Howard Hawks' quote. It's made of three good scenes and no bad scenes. There are none in ""Raising Arizona"" and there are three mesmerizing sequences: one of the most promising and funny introductions ever, then the market scene that reinvents the foot-chase forever, and made it deeply intertwined with hillbilly yodel like banjo music did for ""Bonnie and Clyde"", and then you have one of the most poignant and meaningful monologues ever.There are three great moments in ""Raising Arizona"", in the beginning, the middle and the ending, and if only for these moments, with so many laughs in-between, ""Raising Arizona"" is one of the greatest comedies ever  or my IMDb user name isn't ElMaruecan82.",Raising Arizona
27,bowmanblue,Cage does comedy,7,6 July 2020,"When you think about it... it's strange that Nicolas Cage hasn't really done more comedy in his career. His manic, over-acting style certainly lends itself to some humorous outlandish performances that are so extreme that you can only laugh at them. Here, in an early Coen brothers film, Cage plays 'Hi' - a petty small town criminal who tries to change his ways when he marries a local police woman 'Ed' (Holly Hunter). Don't think too closely about how an officer of the law could be so easily attracted to such a loser and just get to the part where they find they can't have children. Therefore, they decide to kidnap one of five babies a local wealthy businessman has recently fathered.Yeah, it's all not quite as 'believable' as some of the Coen brothers' later films, but, if you just allow yourself to go with it, you'll certainly have some fun. Of course Cage overacts, but then so do many other characters in the film, all of which mainly relying on behaving like one stereotype or another. John Goodman in on the cast list, but possibly comes across as a little underused when considering what else he could have brought to the script.Besides the cast and the completely ludicrous plot, I think 'Raising Arizona's' main selling point is its weirdness. It's certainly not a 'conventional' film and you really will wonder where it's going at times. The crazy direction mixed with the sheer randomness of the screenplay really does make it compulsive viewing and you'll soon find yourself being able to forgive the bits in the story that are slightly less believable than the rest (mainly certain 'character motivation choices' here and there).There are moments that will definitely make you laugh out loud and if you're looking for a film that feels like a B-movie with an A-list cast, or just a fan of the Coen brothers and what to see where they've 'evolved' from, then definitely give this one a go. It's certainly held up over time and is worth a watch every now and again.",Raising Arizona
28,g-bodyl,Brilliantly Wacky!,9,23 December 2014,"Raising Arizona is a completely bizarre movie or in more specific terms, your typical Coen brothers movie. I just fell in love with this oddball screwy comedy. It took some time to get used to, but this film offers razor-sharp dialogue. This is another example of how the Coen Brothers are good at everything. Not only can they direct, but they certainly know how to put together a screenplay. This film also has a wacky Nicolas Cage performance, an early performance that offers a shadow on what is to come.This early Coen Brothers film is a heist movie within the deserts of Arizona. This film is mainly about how an ex-cop and an ex-convict get married and they try to start a family. But when the McDunnoughs realize that the missus, Ed is infertile, they decide to kidnap a baby, one of the quintuplets of the local furniture man, Nathan Arizona. Once they kidnap the baby, their lives become a circus as people are hunting down the kidnapped baby.This is one of Nicolas Cage's earliest role as a leading man and it is the start of all his crazy, eccentric roles that he will possess in the future. But from his unkempt hair to his passion of robbing convenience stores, he delivers an excellent performance. Holly Hunter as Ed also does a great job even though she seems a bit strange. John Goodman is hilarious as Hi's convict friend, Gale.Overall, Raising Arizona is a very funny screwball comedy from a directing duo legend. The screenplay is utterly brilliant which produced some fantastic lines. It helps that the film has great actors relaying those lines to such perfection. The camera-work is unusual and strange, but that is meant in a positive way. There is many things going on in the film, so y'all better be up for the ride. A fantastic comedy that will keep you laughing. It's a strange film, but a funny one. I rate this film 9/10.",Raising Arizona

30,secondtake,A glossy almost black very comedy...breathless and proud of it,8,24 June 2010,"Raising Arizona (1987)After Blood Simple, which set high standards for these sassy new post-modern film makers (the Coen Bros.), Raising Arizona had a lot of people paying attention. And it disappointed no one with a sense of humor. It takes off fast (the first section before the credits is the best part of the movie, for better and for worse), and it never lets up its sense of ludicrous satire and plain old in your face fun.What else is there in a good, inventive comedy? It's maybe not everyone's taste, but the jokes are funny. The expressions (Nicolas Cage especially, but Holly Hunter, too) are amazingly sharp and comic without being simply silly, though silly they are, too. The plot, for what it is, has shafts of fairy tale to it, but Grimm Bros. style, for sure, macabre and touching on life and death matters. There is even a surreal, symbolic evil figure on a smoking bike, which first seems to be invisible to the characters, but then is a foe representing a tangible conscience plaguing the leads (including the leading victim, Mr. Arizona).Throw in the fact that the baby (and babies) are super cute, and that John Goodman and his sidekick escapee are really just cuddly dads at heart, and that Frances McDormand (future Joel Coen wife) has a short, splashy role that prefigures Sandra Bullock's full fledged Southern terror (from The Blind Side) and you have one messed up, cooked up, throttled up, majorly edited-up Harley ride of a movie.

(Nicolas Cage) loves to hold up convenience stores rather than get a job. This results in multiple arrests, time and again. Taking his mugshot is Ed (Holly Hunter), a police officer of tiny stature. H.I. has a fancy for Edwina, and, when learning her fiancé left her, he asks her to wait for him. In prison, H.I. bonds with other crooks like Gale (John Goodman) and Evelle. However, after his last parole, he marries Ed and vows to live the straight and narrow. It's hard. Working in a factory, H.I. notes how similar it is to prison, only you get a paycheck and a place to relax when the day is done. Pretty soon, Ed is wild to have a baby to join them in their modest mobile home. But, alas, Ed is infertile. There are hours and hours of tears. But, one bright day, Ed reads a newspaper article about a local businessman welcoming quints; Harry Barry Larry Garry and Nathan Jr. Ho ho, one couple doesn't need five young uns when others have none. So, Edwina, no longer on the force from her depression, goads H.I. into kidnapping one of the quints. He succeeds. But, wouldn't you know it, when word comes of the kidnapping, others want to get their hands on the baby, too. This includes Gale and Evelle who have tunneled out of jail and a wild bounty hunter. Can domestic life be possible for H.I. and Ed? This hoot of a film is one of the Coen Brothers best and a foundation for their reputation. Cage and Hunter are marvelous and the supporting cast is, too. Most noteworthy is the appearance of the very intelligent baby, who never cries but is often a source of supreme mirth. Certainly, the dusty terrain of Arizona is intriguing, as are the wild hairstyles and costumes. Yet, it is the script and direction by the Coens that make for a uniquely American film with longlasting value.

The Coen brothers are of course inventing a situation that is so complex that building a frame house on Mars would look easier. The man has been in and out of prison so often that he hardly knows what non-criminal living is. He has fallen in love with the cop that has been taking his police pictures every single time. But let's be more bleak (I would like to say more bleaker à la Michael Jackson) than that. She is sterile. And a dumb furniture dealer named Arizona has quintuplets exactly at the same time. So the man will steal one of the five babies, since the Arizonas are over-provided and he is under-provided, in fact deprived. Add to that a married couple whose husband is sterile and who have adopted five kids. they propose a swap for fun and love. No way. Bang Bang. Add to that the arrival of two apes who have just escaped from the prison by digging a hole and who come to their ex-inmate-friend to survive for a while away from the cops. And then the drama is total. The kidnapped child is kidnapped by the two prison escapees when they are told to beat it, and then by the motor-cycled bounty hunter who is running after the reward for the kidnapped baby when he gets on their back, and then back by the initial kidnappers, and then finally, what can they do with that child? A little bit of suspense for your own sake. Only the Coen brothers can invent such a bleak and sickening story. It is not hilarious, except if you like sick and sickening humor, but it is somewhere deep about the incapability of society to really provide everyone with a fair chance to do something worth living, and first of all a vision of life that could be better than the hell of an unavoidable purgatory from which there is no exit, escape or way out, a purgatory in which you are forever pampered with infantile childish punishing nappies in the shape of diapers.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID",Raising Arizona

Barely remember watching this film on its initial viewing and did not enjoy it too much, decided for another revisit. Although the humour and comedy in this film isn't necessarily funny, as it is more quirky humor, there is a sense of entertainment. The performances by both leads are solid but slightly over praised.Critics and some fans tend to consider it one of Nicolas Cage's better performances simply because he puts on an accent. John Goodman and his younger brother were highly annoying, and the mysterious biker villain felt unrealistic and out of place.Overall, this film isn't bad, it has some enjoyable moments but as a comedy or dark comedy it isn't funny.

The fast edits and bizarre content both work together to create this tempting fixation we feel. This is highlighted through the brilliantly narrated and scripted introduction which is a very simple plot setup made artistic through humorous yet dark dialogue twinned with running gags. It's cute, empathetic and genuinely funny. The situation is got across and it's not until the voice-overs end and the music starts up until you realise the actual film hasn't started yet; that was merely the introduction to the situation. What this also does is asks us a very serious question early on that will affect the way in which we look at these characters: 'Can we really root for child-snatchers?' That and the fact the accents are kind of annoying. When the film develops, you realise the comedy is very well space and doesn't make the mistake of force feeding us joke after joke in this desert dystopia the writers have created. Everything from the one-liners, the exchanges to the characters that break out of jail; all of it is well spaced and nicely timed within one another. Another thing is the multi-strand element the film uses just beyond half way which entwines each character's attempts to re-capture the baby. The events are, actually, rather fascinating as well as funny as fate intervenes in pretty hilarious ways just when all seems lost for certain people. The actual baby itself is an interesting use of a filmic 'Macguffin' and works well throughout. 'Where did it go?', 'How did it get there?' and 'What will happen now?' are questions that you will genuinely wonder, if you've put up with the odd way in which the film is put across up until this point.The film plays out like a bit of a dream sequence throughout which isn't necessarily a bad thing since dreams play an important part in the film (ie; the 'dream' to have a child in the first place and the 'nightmare' of realising what might happen if you're caught), just be weary of some un-formulaic editing and some thick accents that will stick with you well after the viewing. This is where I felt the similarities to 'Natural Born Killers' came in.Raising Arizona is worth a look, at least on the basis that it is where the now pretty popular Coens started off.",Raising Arizona

Thinking ahead, he's careful not to have any bullets in his gun so he will receive a light sentence but still knows a good deal when he sees one and his holdups become habit forming.Having been photographed in prison more than the Mona Lisa at the Louvre, the only thing left to do is fall in love with the picture-taking jailer, a woman called Edwina, Ed for short (Holly Hunter) whom he proceeds to marry. Of course, Ed makes H.I. go straight so they can have a baby and raise a family. Good luck with that. When they discover that Ed is unable to bear children, however, they become Robin Hood, robbing a kid from the rich furniture dealer Nathan Arizona, Sr. (Trey Wilson) whose wife just gave birth to quintuplets, and giving to the poor (he and Ed). Little Nathan, Jr. is cute as all get out and is different than other babies in the world because he never cries, come hell or high water.Things change and not for the better when two of H.I.'s prison buddies, brothers Gale (John Goodman) and Evelle (William Forsythe), rise from the muck and escape from prison (Gale says that the institution no longer served his best interests), then park themselves in H.I's trailer. Things go from worse to much worse, however, when Leonard Smalls, a heavily armed, grotesquely-bearded biker (Randall ""Tex"" Cobb), looking like the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse all rolled into one, is hired by Nathan to track down his baby.If you like shootings with lots of dead bodies, ridiculous car chases, surreal bank robberies, and more mayhem than the Trump White House, Raising Arizona is the film for you. By the way, it is one of the most hilarious comedies I've ever seen and even has a very touching message where you can both laugh and cry at the same time.",Raising Arizona

43,Movie_Muse_Reviews,The Coen brothers so easily make strange comedy poignant,8,24 August 2008,"I think ""Raising Arizona"" is more a comedy in that you are in awe of the complete stupidity of every one of the Coen brothers' characters. There aren't that many ""jokes,"" it's just all sort of ridiculous. The Coen brothers first successful comedic film is pretty much a stranger version of their later comedies, taking a small time crook story and expanding it in terms of weird. Most criminals aren't smart or clever and the Coen brothers let you know that for sure.In the film, Nicholas Cage plays a repeat convict named H.I. McDunnough who convinces a cop named Ed (Holly Hunter) to marry him somehow. The couple then decides the American dream for them is having a baby, so their plan is to steal a quintuplet of a wealthy business owner. Though they are successful, it's not that simple, especially with a $25,000 reward for the baby.The Coen brothers create the dumbest criminals and most irresponsible human begins to grace to the silver screen (that are actually believable and not just dumb for laughs). We don't quite get to know any of the characters that much, we just know all of their motivations: money or children. Cage, early in his career, shows success in a role that would seem out of character for him in this decade. John Goodman as H.I's escaped convict friend and Frances McDormand and Sam McMurray as family friends with crazy kids round out a pretty great cast.I can't really overstate the weirdness of this movie. There are some strange fight scenes, lots of unnecessary screaming, a guy riding a motorcycle with two shotguns on his back--there is a clear intention to be outside of normal here. Though as the Coen brothers later prove they're unbeatable at, it's not without some poignancy.Oddly enough, the way these characters come into conflict with ideas of the real world, like the reality of taking care of a child and its demands, is quite effective. The viewer is so wrapped up in the characters' blind motivations that those things that are obvious to people about responsibility in the real world sneak up to you in the film. There is also the whole ""crime doesn't pay"" mentality in terms of immediately satisfying your wants, but what makes ""Raising Arizona"" stand out for the Coen brothers is the sense of the American dream, even if it comes across as strange the whole film, it's definitely genuine. How the Coen brothers get you to see that amid absurdity is a secret they should tell no one, but it's incredible.",Raising Arizona

45,videorama-759-859391,"Watch Nic raise hell, comedy style",8,21 June 2016,"You gotta give these brother filmmakers, 10 for originality. When you go into any Coen brother's film, and I haven't seen many of theirs, you know you're going into something, where they even came through beautifully on the True Grit remake. This here was their second film, worlds apart from the brilliant baby, Blood Simple. The movie is just colorfully entertaining and crazy, from the word, ""Go"" with great and enjoyable performances to boot. Cage shows us again, how versatile he can be, critic Roger Ebert, calling him the greatest actor, alive, which has me thinking in some ways, may'be he he actually is. He's a repeat ex con who falls for police photographer (Hunter, who gives such a captivating performance, as she does in everything. As not being able to conceive, what does she have hubby do? Steal a baby of course, and this they do, from a score of them, belonging to a big wig couple. Soon they are being sought out by a war hog tracker (Randall Tex Cobb) who you'll never forget, where also Cage's happy family life, is disrupted by the loud intrusion of two escaped ex cons/friends (Goodman and Forsythe-wonderful) who make the dirtiest escape you'll ever see. There are some hilarious moments of wonderful writing in this off the wall peace, a kind of satire if you will about reform, and the American dream, where Hunter makes it so clear, that she wants a kid, where to her dislike, Cage can't keep off the straight and narrow, a scene reminiscent to Natural Born Killers, for some reason, where he steals huggies, and whatever cash is left over in the till. Not every one's gonna like this film, but those that do, it'll be more a case of love, where again these talented brothers, shown us what they're capable of, second time around, and it's originally impressive. What's quizzical, is the original's title's meaning. Again, you won't forget the war hog. If you want escapism and brilliant satire, this is the film to watch, but it will grow on you, and warrant a second viewing. Soundtrack is great.",Raising Arizona
46,freemantle_uk,A highly entertaining zany comedy,10,20 August 2013,"The Coen Brothers have made many great films and worked in many different genres. One of their most famous comedies is Raising Arizona, a fast paced, zany comedy that can only come from the minds of the Coens.H.I. ""Hi"" McDunnough (Nicolas Cage) is a career criminal who falls for policewoman Edwina ""Ed"" (Holly Hunter) and goes straight for her. After they get married they attempt to have a child, but when Ed finds out she is infertile and the pair unable to adopt the couple take the logically route of kidnapping a baby from a wealthy couple who have just had quintuplets. But their actions get complicated by two escaped convicted, a police investigation and a ruthless bounty hunter.Raising Arizona is a very funny comedy that zips along at a great pace. The Coens' fingerprints are all over this film, having a sharply written script and excellent direction throughout. The jokes are constant throughout the film, giving us a variety of style of humour, from great one-liners, character interactions and pure physical comedy. The Coens bring a lot of energy to the film as we get over the top set pieces like the robbery where Ed abandons Hi and the Coens being a brings a kinetic style with their camera movements and editing of set pieces. We get a great prologue at the beginning of the film as we find out about Hi and Ed's past and how they came to their solution with funny jokes on the way.As well as the direction, Raising Arizona is blessed with a top cast who give both comic and sincere performances. Cage and Hunter had great chemistry together, having excellent comic time and were committed to their roles. Cage worked well with his supporting cast as they assemble a top cast: John Goodman being a particular highlight as one of the escaped prisoners.The Coens Brothers' direction is frantic through the film, using fast paced editing, hand-held cameras and tracking shots, amplifying the comedy, showing this maniac universe and gives Raising Arizona a distinctive visual style. The Coen's regular composer Carter Burwell also supplies a great score for the film, particular the use of a country/folk like guitar score which was a perfect fit for the film.Raising Arizona is a very entertaining, funny and heartfelt comedy that can stand along some of the best works the Coen Brothers have had to offer. It is a screwball comedy that can cater to many tests from intelligent jokes, observations and character interactions, to more over the top physical and visual comedy.",Raising Arizona
47,Coxer99,Raising Arizona,7,17 June 1999,One of the Coen's best made films. Perfect cinematography and editing make this story of a young couple who kidnaps a baby because they are unable to have one of their own a sure fire winner. Cage is especially appealing.,Raising Arizona
48,mjneu59,Looney Tunes,6,29 December 2010,"After sending up the film noir tradition in their eye-opening debut feature 'Blood Simple', the Coen brothers returned with more of their patented, stylish mayhem, this time in the form of an unsophisticated, broad-as-a-barn-door comedy modeled after classic Warner Brothers cartoons. Following what must be the longest pre-title prologue in history (almost a separate film by itself), the film begins properly with the kidnapping of baby Nathan Arizona, Jr. by a good-natured petty criminal (Nicholas Cage, by no coincidence sporting a Road Runner tattoo on his arm) and his ex-cop wife Holly Hunter (courted during his frequent trips to the penitentiary). There's nothing approaching a genuine joke in the entire film; for laughs the Coens rely instead on their hyperactive camera and the dizzy exaggerated formality of their dialogue. Visually the film is frenetic, unreal, and infused with the sort of cartoon logic allowing babies to be tossed unharmed from the roofs of speeding cars. For most audiences the results will either be totally hilarious or utterly baffling (and possibly both), although a second viewing is recommended to fully appreciate the whip-crack pacing and overdrawn eccentricities of each character.",Raising Arizona
49,CubsandCulture,A lot more assured than Blood Simple,10,30 April 2021,"Outside of Fargo, I think this the Coen Brothers' best film. It is utterly daft. It is laugh out loud funny. The plot goes in places you don't expect. Nic Cage turns in an absolute gem of a lovable rogue. Best of all it has a free spirit and is merely fun. Some of the Coen's later film got to complicated and convoluted-sometimes they are too clever-but this film hits the sweet spot of being zany without being overbearing. It is surprising how much more sure footed this film is than their debut of Blood Simple.",Raising Arizona
50,MaxBorg89,Pure silliness - Coen brothers style!,8,5 August 2008,"After the controlled excellence of Blood Simple, Joel and Ethan Coen unleashed the wackiness of Raising Arizona, one of their more accessible films, so successful at the time of its original release that the brothers were actually offered Batman (!) as their next project (as we all know, they passed on it and along came Tim Burton). In retrospect, the offer doesn't sound so ridiculous: Burton's take on the Dark Knight is as much a freak show as Raising Arizona, though it is more about the sombre mood than surreal humor, which is the Coens' most notable strength.The absolute lunacy in this film comes in the form of H.I. McDunnough (Nicolas Cage), a convict who is absolutely incapable of doing any good whatsoever, and his wife Edwina, nicknamed ""Ed"" (Holly Hunter), a prison worker who married him after his latest stay in jail. The couple's biggest wish is to have a baby, but as it turns out nature - and luck - isn't really on their side. At this point, options are quite limited, and after learning wealthy businessman Nathan Arizona (Trey Wilson) has recently had five babies, they think: who cares if one of those kids ""disappears"" ? Apparently, a lot of people care, since H.I. and Ed have to deal with all kinds of insane individuals, from the Snoat brothers (John Goodman and William Forsythe) to a mysterious biker (Tex Cobb) who seems to have come straight out of Hell.Raising Arizona is, in many ways, a typical Coen brothers movie, relying not on easy or direct laughs, but more on the overall absurdity of the situation, paired with some healthy Reagan-bashing (H.I. starts insulting him in the opening monologue). That the satirical aspect isn't forced, but manages to flow naturally with the rest of the craziness, is one of the film's strongest aspects, next to the fantastic dialogue (""Hurry up, I'm in a dutch with the wife!"") and the inspired casting: Hunter and Frances McDormand, working with Joel and Ethan for the second time, are already at ease in the twisted Coen universe, while Goodman and Forsythe add the right does of quirkiness. The most impressive performance comes from Cage: still in his experimental phase (Wild at Heart was just around the corner), he is totally out of control in an edgy, brave effort whose wild energy is only a vague memory in his post-Oscar body of work. Cobb is good as well, but his character, who adds a more surreal touch to the movie's tone, doesn't seem quite at home here. The Coens have used the Hell motif in other pictures (Barton Fink first and foremost) to considerable effect, but in this case it looks more like an afterthought, albeit an entertaining one, rather than an organic part of the narrative.Despite its occasional flaws, Raising Arizona is in fact a perfect film for Coen novices, its accessibility and mainstream appeal (it's got Nic Cage in it) being potentially more seductive than the casual yet beautiful brutality of Fargo.",Raising Arizona
51,estebangonzalez10,The first Coen screwball comedy,7,5 April 2014,"""Are you boys gonna chase down your leads or are you gonna sit drinkin' coffee in the one house in the state where I know my boy ain't at?""Raising Arizona, the Coen brothers' sophomore film, is an eccentric screwball comedy that feels cartoonish at times but served as an exercise in form for their upcoming comedies. This perhaps is much lighter in tone and more humane, but some of their common trademarks can be found in this early film of theirs. I don't think it's as cynical as most of their other work, but it does have a similar quirky sense of humor that can be found in all their comedies. Besides being original, it also happens to be very entertaining introducing some wacky and memorable characters. If you are fan of the Coen's work you will see a lot of familiar faces (John Goodman and Frances McDermond in supporting roles), but it was the lead roles from Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter that truly surprised me. They were great together playing this unconventional family that will be really hard to forget. Hi is one of Nicolas Cage's most memorable characters and his crazy hair was the highlight of his performance. As in most of their films, the stereotypes are captured really well and this time it was the Southwest's turn to play for laughs with their thick accents. The performances in this film were all highly exaggerated giving the film its cartoonish tone. Raising Arizona was a joyful experience despite the fact that I didn't find myself laughing too hard; it's a good film, but not as good as The Big Lebowski. Despite their familiar trademarks, the Coens show so much range in their films going from neo-noir to slapstick comedies. They are a force to reckon with. H.I. McDunnough (Nicolas Cage) meets his future wife, Ed (Holly Hunter), in the most uncommon of situations. She is a police officer in Arizona, and he is a criminal who keeps on getting caught for robbing convenience stores. Since he never carries a loaded weapon his stints in prison are short, but he manages to turn his life around once he falls for Ed. They enjoy their first years of marriage and are truly happy together, so much so that Ed convinces Hi to start a family because their blissfulness should be shared. The only problem is that they are unable to conceive a baby and due to Hi's criminal past they can't adopt either. The only solution is to kidnap one so they find their perfect victim: one of the quintuplets of a furniture tycoon, Nathan Arizona (Trey Wilson). They don't think it's fair that the Arizona's got five children, so they convince themselves that they have more they can handle anyway. This event changes their lives forever as friends from Hi's past show up (John Goodman and William Forsythe), as well as his coworkers (Sam McMurray and Frances McDormand), and an evil apocalyptic bounty hunter (Randall Tex Cobb) who haunts his dreams. This baby has changed their lives forever.The wacky and over the top performances in this film worked really well thanks to some skillful writing from the Coens and some clever one liners. I already mentioned how good the lead performances were, but some of the supporting turns were also quite impressive, the standouts being Frances McDormand and Randall Tex Cobb. Cobb's character reminded me a lot of a cartoonish version of Javier Bardem's turn in No Country for Old Men. There are also some very funny scenes revolving around Trey Wilson and once again the Coens make the victim look really unsympathetic, allowing the audience to root for the wacky outlaws. It's a charming film with some great scenes, one involving a long crazy chase across an Arizona neighborhood. It is a very sharp and clever comedy that also happens to be very entertaining taking us through an adventure that only the Coens could come up with.",Raising Arizona
52,jimbo-53-186511,Raising a smile was a struggle for me,2,15 March 2018,"Ex-con H.I McDunnough (Nicolas Cage) and ex-cop Ed (Holly Hunter) end up married (as unlikely as that sounds), but when they learn that Ed is unable to conceive they make the bold and somewhat misguided decision to kidnap one of the 5 babies fathered by wealthy furniture tycoon Nathan Arizona (Trey Wilson) on the basis that him and his wife have 'more children than they can handle.' However, when Nathan puts up a $25,000 dollar reward to anyone who can successfully return his missing child back to him this gains the interest of several rather different parties...I watched this film this evening based on its rating and on its write up, but other than that I knew very little about this film. However, when watching this film I kept thinking that the film had a very Coen brothers type vibe to it and it came as little surprise when I saw their names rolling down the screen at the end of the film...Good or bad I'll say one thing for the Coen brothers and that is that they are rather unique filmmakers - the fact I identified this film as being one of theirs without researching it beforehand does prove that their quirky and somewhat unorthodox style does set them apart from the crowd. Despite this though Raising Arizona is still something of a weak offering...The tone is perhaps the biggest problem with this film; they take a serious subject matter (a couple being unable to conceive) and turn it into some kind of goofball chase picture which unfortunately generates few laughs. I often find that the Coen brothers are better when they don't try so hard - THE BIG LEBOWSKI had a daft plot and was pretty stupid, but it was hilarious and proved that the brothers could be funny as long as they didn't try too hard. On the other hand, THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE was one of their more serious films but it had an engaging story and worked better because it was a straight story that the brothers played more-or-less straight.Raising Arizona, unfortunately, brings out the worst in the Coen brothers in that it is loud, crass and rather unfunny - they try to combine serious storytelling with goofball antics which simply doesn't work. Hunter and Cage do their best to make the film fun, but as characters they don't evoke much in the way of sympathy and seem rather clichéd and one-dimensional. Having said that, Raising Arizona does at least show that Cage could act a bit (and at this point in his career he probably still cared about what films he appeared in). Hunter gives another sprightly performance and is far better than the picture itself. The only other strong performance comes from Trey Wilson and this film (like Twins) only acts a reminder to the great things that this man could have accomplished had his life not being cut so tragically short. So yes Raising Arizona has the Coen Brothers distinctive style all over it, but sadly like a lot of their films I found this one disappointing, unfunny and over-rated. If you're a big Coen brothers fan then by all means watch it if you must but personally I would rather pull teeth than sit through this abomination again.",Raising Arizona

Despite my expectations before watching this early Coen brothers film, I was somewhat disappointed with this screwball comedy with strange characters. Nicolas Cage has done this kind of non-acting before in other movies and Holly Hunter isn't a whole lot better. The movie is basically about a couple that wants a child, can't have one and decides to steal one of the quintuplets of a local rich family, obviously because they cant handle five. The antics that revolve around this act with other strange characters like a over-the-top motorcycle bounty hunter and prison mates also get in the act of trying to get the child and the reward money. All in all, the ridiculousness doesn't necessarily make for a very funny movie and I'm sure there have been better movies carrying basically this same premise.",Raising Arizona
55,NateWatchesCoolMovies,A kooky Coen Classic,10,21 November 2015,"The Coen Brothers Raising Arizona demonstrates what giddy fun not only making movies, but also watching them can be. If I were them, I would have sat in on random screenings across the country just to hear people howl. Such is the level of high comedy on display, a delirious ode to the screwball yarn that plays like a loony toons episode made by the Marx Brothers. Cage plays lovable, hopelessly dimwitted petty thief H.I. McDunnough, who just can't seem to not get repeatedly caught for his increasingly harebrained and stupid escapades. In police processing he meets rigid officer Edwina (a spitfire Holly Hunter) and immediately falls in love. When they find out that Edwina can't have a baby, she is devastated in that adorably bleary eyed, belligerent way that only Hunter can impart. H.I. has another 'brilliant' idea: kidnap one of the quintuplets of furniture tycoon Nathan Arizona (Trey Wilson, nailing both the preposterous and poignant notes and full well knowing the Coen's intention with the script. A great dude who passed way before his time). From there the film's fuse is lit, beckoning you to buckle up as it sails along at three hundred miles an hour on a surreal journey of pratfalls, chases, weirdos and wonderment. Edwina and H.I. cross paths with police, convicts on the run in the form of Gale (John Goodman in tip top, verbose form) and Evelle (William Forsythe) Snoats, and a monstrous motorbike riding bounty hunter (bear of a man Randall 'Tex' Cobb) summoned from hell to steal the baby back. The action scenes with him out on the highways are classic Coen gold, and as wonderfully outlandish as their work gets. There's an emotional thread running through the mayhem too, just enough to let us catch our breath between the symphonic ruckus of cacophony. Very unique in its constant will to be absurdly over the top but in a very precise, specific way, and never derailing completely. One of Cage's, and the Coen's best.",Raising Arizona

58,TOMNEL,The Coen's funniest film.,8,22 September 2008,"Of course, there's a difference between their best and their funniest. Of the comedies they've made (The Big Lebowski, Burn After Reading, Intolerable Cruelty, The Ladykillers, even Fargo), Raising Arizona plays the most like a comedy. There's no genre switching here, this movie is a downright over the top comedy, and it's pretty funny. It has an original plot and over the top funny scenes, along with clever dialogue, and fits right in the middle in the Coen's list of movies. It's not a masterpiece, however the huge cult following would beg to differ I'm sure.H.I. McDunnough (Nicholas Cage) is constantly in and out of prison, always for robbing that same liquor store. He falls for the police photographer Ed(wina) (Holly Hunter) and when he gets out a third time, he proposes to her. The only thing needed to make their life complete is a kid, but Ed is unable to birth one, and the adoption agency won't give them one because of H.I.'s spotty past. They decide to steal one of the Arizona family's newly born quintuplets. Two of H.I.'s buddies from prison, Gale and Evelle (John Goodman and William Forsythe) break out and come to live with the new family. To go along with all of this, a crazy biker is looking for the baby.What a crazy movie this is! The acting is bad, but purposefully bad, so it's good in what it's going for. It's so over the top, it's hilarious! As usual with the Coen brothers, the cinematography and direction is top notch. This is a great looking comedy. The chase scene through a house and grocery store is superbly shot and laid out. It's probably the best, most manic chase scene I've ever seen.With the positive comes the negative. The goofiness of this movie can be very stupid. Normally it's funny, but at times it wears thin. Dot, played by Frances McDormand, was a little too much with her typical mother performance. Luckily, this didn't bring down the movie too much, if at all. Not until the end did I actually care for the characters, but by the end they were developed quite well. Characters being likable is a problem the Coens have had in the past, but they pulled through with this one.Overall, this is a silly comedy, but a funny one. It's cult following is well deserved, and it fits in nicely with the genius of the Coen's works.My rating: *** out of ****. 90 mins. PG-13 for language, violence and some sexual humor.",Raising Arizona

Goodman shows the world he can be funny as the misunderstood and somewhat crazy escaped convict. Cage and Hunter have so much love to give, they steal a baby from Mr. Arizona himself.

However, all kinds of trouble are in store for this unusual family Raising Arizona is a wonderful film. It's just so much darned fun. As their careers have progressed, the Coen Brothers have become more successful and acclaimed but their films have lost a little bit of their pizazz, their joie de vivre. Check out this, their second movie, which is just a joy from start to finish; a smorgasbord of hilarious lines, funny off-the-wall performances, crazy antics, breathtaking film-making and sweet, good-natured sentimentality. The movie has several amazing sequences (the eleven minute montage opening, the dream of Lenny, H.I.'s goodbye note, the vision of the future), but the whole story blends into a beautiful little tale of comic folly, family values and redemptive love. Like all the best comedies, it makes you laugh, it makes you cry and it makes you feel good to be alive. Everyone is wonderful in it, Cage most of all, and the ensemble grab the screwball feel and make their performances big and broad in the best, funniest way. Both the dialogue and the accents are head-scratching gibberish - ""Well, which is it to be young feller ? You want ah should freeze, or get down on the ground ? Ah mean t'say, if'n ah freeze, ah can't rightly drop, and if'n ah drop, ah'm a-gonna be in motion  "" - but are never less than hilarious. There are too many good lines to count. It also packs in so much entertainment into ninety minutes; for example, it has a brilliant wedding scene which lasts exactly seven seconds and four shots - if only other movies could learn from the brevity of this example ! It also has one of the best chase sequences I've ever seen, a wild rampaging epic through a sleepy town which rushes along with dizzying speed. Kudos must go to the amazing cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld and the completely insane score by Carter Burwell, which sounds like a bunch of drunk guys with banjos and colds jamming Beethoven's Ode To Joy in somebody's kitchen. The music alone is unmissable, one of the funniest, most inspired and original scores you'll ever hear. Shot all over rural Arizona, in great locations. Sadly, talented actor Wilson (Nathan Arizona), passed away a couple of years later. He was a fine character actor who made several good movies (F/X, Twins, Married To The Mob), and his touching, thoughtful farewell speech sums up the heart of this terrific comedy classic. If you only know the Coens from their award-winning dramas, don't miss this little diamond from their early days.",Raising Arizona
62,RainDogJr,Baby,10,8 July 2008,"It seems that after a second view or more, the films of the Coen brothers change from just excellent to wonderful, perfect. I saw for the very first time Raising Arizona I think almost two years ago and I found it as a terrific comedy and I recommended it to some persons, one of them my cousin who also enjoyed it a lot. Now that I have seen it again I feel similar to when I saw Blood Simple for the second time almost one month ago, I mean I liked it much more than the first time I saw it!Raising Arizona has a simple premise, a very funny one: a criminal (Nicolas Cage) fells in love with a policewoman (Holly Hunter) and after he is finally ""clean"" they get married. As a couple their dream is to have a baby but here a problem: she is infertile and they can't adopt one due to the criminal past of H.I. McDunnough. Actually all this happens in the introduction and when the dream is broke, real problems can come. Here is when little Arizona appears and he will be the most important person for Hi and Ed. As, I suppose, you know little Arizona is one of the five babies of Nathan Arizona (Trey Wilson) and Florence Arizona (Lynne Dumin Kitei) so as Ed thinks that they have more of what they need, she wants one of the babies. Is a fun film but is also a wonderful love story, kind of even moving with many memorable characters and so many great lines. Little Arizona is definitely the most important character in the film and he changes everything for everybody. The crime against him is big but, in a terrific scene, Ed's love changes everything and ultimately Hi is a new person. This two really loves each other but circumstances and suddenly their love is questionable. Those circumstances include two memorable characters: Gale (John Goodman) and Evelle (William Forsythe). They are part of Hi's past and both are ""natural born criminals"" sort of so at any little chance they will take advantage. The classic annoying friends are here with Glen (Sam McMurray) and Dot (Frances McDormand) and they are part of those circumstances too. But the truth about who is really little Arizona is known for this four characters and he will change everything. The criminals are now ""responsible criminals"" and they feel that little Arizona is their baby too, magnificent and pure fun. In our love story, both knew that they weren't in the right way and Leonard Smalls (Randall ""Tex"" Cobb) is a great thug character that keeps Hi in mind that he is in the wrong way and ultimately he is the evil with a motorcycle in the search of a baby lost. But a baby lost in the hands of a loving couple will end where he really belongs and will help to place them in the right way, to dream againmaybe about Utah.About the -great- cast: this is one of my favourites pictures with Nicolas Cage and maybe his best character of the 80's. Holly Hunter, in her first starring role, is simply terrific in a great character, of course moving at many scenes. Both are an odd and strong couple. Support cast is also great with John Goodman in his first Coen brothers' picture (terrific and very funny just like William Forsythe) and since then he has appeared in, exactly, four more Coen bros pictures. Oh and the great M. Emmet Walsh has a very little role here, after his brilliant performance in Blood Simple.Then Raising Arizona is up there, along with Lebowski and O Brother, as one of my personal favourite from the comedies of the Coens (haven't seen yet Hudsucker) so I give the highest recommendations about it.",Raising Arizona
63,framptonhollis,entertaining and hearwarming fun,9,6 January 2017,"The Coen Brothers are normally known for being the creators of very dark films-even when they're primarily comedies, they will almost always be a dark comedy. However, ""Raising Arizona"" is a little bit different. It definitely contains a few of the Coen Brothers' typical trademarks, but it is much more lighthearted and joyous in nature. Don't get me wrong, there are a few dark moments, but I do not believe that any of the Coen's other films have nearly as much heart as this film.This is a very entertaining and funny movie. While not every single joke works entirely, and most of the humor manages to be very slapsticky, there are still plenty of moments of absolute hilarity. Certain comedic scenes seem like they are going to be somewhat cliché, but the Coen's manage to surprise and startle with their brilliant and inventive comedy. The film is also shot beautifully, which is yet another of the Coen's trademarks. Every single film of theirs that I have seen is visually stunning (especially ""The Hudsucker Proxy"", the only Coen Brothers film that I can say has nearly as much heart as this one), and ""Raising Arizona"" is no exception. Some of the visuals are surprisingly surreal, and the use of wide angle lens increases the bizarre comedic tone.The performances are also awesome. Although it is easy to laugh at Nicolas Cage and say that he is a silly, over the top actor, this film proves that he has quite a bit of talent. The rest of the cast is great as well, especially John Goodman, who provides the funniest performance in the movie by FAR. There are also wonderful performances from the likes of Holly Hunter, Frances McDormand, Sam McMurray, William Forsythe, and M. Emmet Walsh (who I happily recognized was from an all time Coen's classic ""Blood Simple""), who has a very brief role but is excellent regardless.If there is any Coen Brothers film that you should show to your family, it is definitely this one. Although it does have dark and violent moments, it has enough heart and humor to make it an overall feel good classic.",Raising Arizona
64,Sandcooler,Brilliant oddball comedy,10,4 July 2009,"There are really few directors that are as consistent as the Coen brothers. Their strange sense of humour just works in every movie they make, and it's extremely fun and addictive. With that said, it's difficult to decide which of their movies is the best, but this one is a worthy contender. It's incredibly outrageous, wild and crazy, but at the same time it's close and heart-warming. It has a very surreal look, yet the emotional scenes still look very genuine, which is quite an achievement. The characters are also vintage Coen, they're all offbeat and weird, but that just raises more sympathy for them. It also helps that they all express themselves through some razor-sharp dialogues. I could barely make out the lines because I was too busy laughing at the previous lines, you wonder where these keep coming from. This movie just isn't like anything I've ever seen. It's astoundingly funny in all its weirdness.",Raising Arizona
65,lewiskendell,Welcome to the Coen's version of the family unit.,7,10 November 2010,"""If I'm as bad as you, what good are we? What good are we to each other? You and me's just a fool's paradise."" I do enjoy it when the Coens get quirky. Raising Arizona isn't quite the homespun quirkiness of Fargo (which I loved), the paranoia-fueled quirkiness of Burn After Reading (which I loved), the southern-fried quirkiness of 'O Brother Where Art Thou, or the combination of bowling and WTF-level awesomeness and quirkiness that was The Big Lebowski. But, it has more than enough of it's own unique brand of quirkiness to spare, and it's a pretty funny movie as a result.I'll admit that I'm not much of a Nick Cage fan, but in movies like this and Kick-Ass where he gets to be over-the-top and zany, I think it works. He and Holly Hunter are the stars of the movie, and there desire to have a child and their (mis)adventures when they get one, kept me interested the entire time. And they're balanced quite well by the supporting roles of John Goodman, Sam McMurray, Trey Wilson, and William Forsythe. Raising Arizona is unique in a way that Coen fans have come to expect, and while I don't put it the top of their work, I find it difficult to believe that many Coen fans will be disappointed by it. Check it out.",Raising Arizona
66,bkrauser-81-311064,The Anti-Blood Simple,9,27 October 2013,"The Coen brothers have made a name for themselves as a pair of brilliant masters of their craft. They build on a solid foundation aided by philosophy, literature and the Hollywood Golden age. Using a palpable mix of classicist storytelling, idiosyncratic characters and dark humor they have made an undeniable contribution to cinema that will never be washed away. So why am I not sold on the countless inta-classics that they churn out every few years?Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of The Big Lebowski (1998). Miller's Crossing (1990), Barton Fink (1991), True Grit (2010), Fargo (1996) and No Country for Old Men (2007) all have their moments and heck, I even like their lesser works: Intolerable Cruelty (2003), The Hudsucker Proxy (1994) and The Ladykillers (2004). Still, as I have always said, to me for a film to rise above it needs to be an experience, not just a film. In that respect only two films have risen to that level, at least for me. The aforementioned Big Lebowski and Raising Arizona (1987).Joel and Ethan wanted to make a movie as far different from their first feature Blood Simple (1984) a neo-noir that won the Palm d'Or for the auteures celebres. So instead of something dark they made something light. Instead of slow it was quick and instead of starring Frances McDormand, it starred Nicolas ""freak-face"" Cage.If the term ""screwball comedy"" is applied to the work of Preston Sturges then I am at a loss as to what one would call Raising Arizona. The breakneck speed at which it throws things at you is mesmerizing. Yet the story is told with such a firm hand that watching the movie at times feels like being in the cab of a Nascar; claustrophobic yet invigorating.For the uninitiated the story takes place in and around Tempe Arizona. Ed (Holly Hunter) and H.I. McDonough (Nic Cage) are as unlikely a couple as you are likely to find. One is an ex-cop while the other is a repeat offender with the attitude of a high school drop out and vocabulary of a Sunday preacher. They get married and figure the next logical step is having a kid. But after they find out they can't conceive, they steal a quintuplet from a local millionaire in desperation. It all goes pretty haywire from there with car chases, prison breaks and one scary looking bounty hunter but the oddball characters stay true to their oddball selves from beginning to end.The Coens showed a visual aptitude in Blood Simple but here they unleash their talents with reckless abandon, throwing the audience face first into a rube-golberg they themselves designed. The centerpiece of their contraption is a ten minute chase through the houses, convenience stores and supermarkets of Tempe with multiple people in pursuit of H.I. holding a package of Pampers. There is another point where H.I. and Ed try to keep the kid out of the bounty hunter's hands in an epic showdown that is as tense as it is funny.Raising Arizona is certainly not just a movie, its an experience that registers on an emotional level. H.I. finds that he's out of his depth when it comes to becoming a parent and attempts to recede back to his former state of irresponsible ineptitude. Yet, as with all times of trial, it's impossible to revert, you must always move forward, no matter how painful. A lesson that in my mind, is ultimately more important than anything said by a toque wearing cop with a Minnesotan accent.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/",Raising Arizona
67,fntstcplnt,Raising Arizona (1987),9,9 September 2019,"Directed by Joel Coen. Starring Nicolas Cage, Holly Hunter, John Goodman, William Forsythe, Trey Wilson, Sam McMurray, Randall ""Texx"" Cobb, Frances McDormand, Lynne Kitei, M. Emmett Walsh. (PG-13)Nutty trailer trash couple, one an ex-cop (Hunter), the other an ex-con (Cage), desperately wants to start a family, but can't have children of their own; once they learn of a well-to-do couple (Wilson, Kitei) that had quintuplets, they decide that there's more than enough love to go around and help themselves to one of the offspring. Engagingly offbeat, exuberantly stylish comedy from the Coens, a rather bold exercise for just being a second feature, crafting a special kind of world bent between reality and fantasy, populated by mannered eccentrics and dazzling camera tricks; sort of a missing link between Preston Sturges and Wes Anderson. Storyline-wise, not one of their most compelling or original, but this is the sort of movie where attitude and energy count more than dramatic interest. Cast to perfection and brimming with sublime touches (gotta love that yodeling!), to say nothing for the funniest chase scenes since the heyday of Buster Keaton.

68,mike48128,"Hubert and Edwina ""borrow"" a Baby!",9,11 June 2019,"A Coen Brothers masterpiece. It starts out slowly and builds up momentum. The last half is totally outrageous, funny, and heart-warming. H.I. is a 3-time-loser that holds up convenience stores and goes to prison for about 18 months at a time. He falls in love with the little Arizona town's police woman ""Ed"" and marries her when he finally gets out. So many funny and outrageous situations: Ed's time in jail. Stealing and raising Arizona. The baby being left behind, perfectly safe, in a carrier, in the middle of the highway. Robbing the ""Hayseed"" Bank. The ""showdown"" with the bounty hunter .

An easily-missed ""nest egg"" is that the bounty hunter has the same tattoo H.I. does. Best seen uncut as the first half is a bit slow and that is the only reason I didn't give this movie a ""10"".

69,DeeNine-2,Not Coen and Coen's best,6,8 July 2000,"Frankly this was a disappointment to me. I'm not sure if I know the difference between funny and stupid, and so I guess the best thing I can say is comedy, even more than beauty, is in the eye and the ear of the beholder.I thought John Goodman was the funniest person on the screen in this one. He has a quality in his acting that could turn comedy to drama or horror in a fraction of a second. He did that a couple of times in this film, and of course with TV's Roseanne it was a weekly chore. ('JJ'-Just Joking.) I wouldn't be surprised to see him cast as some kind of really mean heavy one of these days. He could do it.Holly Hunter proves here and elsewhere that she is more than just a pretty face. Her almost painfully true to life portrayal of a nice but not overly bright cop was perfect. Normally almost too cute for words, she was here almost plain. I think she was working on her career for the second half of her life. (She was twenty-nine when this film was made.) She knows that there is nothing deader in Hollywood than a 'cute' actress past her thirtieth birthday. (Meg Ryan is the case that tests the rule.)I am not a Nicolas Cage fan, regrettably since I've seen him in four or five movies. I thought he gave the best performance in Mike Figgis's Leaving Las Vegas (1995), but without the gorgeous Elisabeth Shue, I would never have watched that good but rather depressing flick. I thought he was tolerable in Honeymoon in Vegas (1992), but I didn't think much of the film. In David Lynch's Wild at Heart (1990) he certainly gave a creditable performance, and maybe even a very good one; and the movie wasn't bad, but I just thought that he and Lynch pandered too obviously to their young, outsider audience. None of this is anything against Cage; it's just that the character he usually depicts, a sweet, dumbed-down/but lovable outsider, just doesn't appeal to me. (Of course Cage himself is anything but dumb.) It's obvious that the movie-going public likes him a lot, and I imagine that women find him sexy, cute and just the kind of non-threatening guy they'd like to snuggle up to. Still Cage is worth keeping an eye on. I think with the right material, he may one day give a performance worthy of a great actor. One thing I can tell you for sure, if you like Nicolas Cage, you'll like this movie because his presence and style dominate throughout. As far as the direction and script goes, this was not in the same league as either Blood Simple (1984) or the widely acclaimed Fargo (1996), two previous and of course very different offerings from the talented brothers, Joel and Ethan Coen. One last word: be careful who you see this with. The little boy babies, especially the one (or two?) playing Nathan, Jr. are just adorable. Your girl friend/wife will just go gaga, and you may hear the Power Station song playing in the background with the lyric, 'She wants to multiple/Are you going to do it?...'(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

Paired up with probably my favorite actress of all time, Holly Hunter, I knew going in that I'd most likely be in for a good time. And color me surprised when yet another favorite shows up, John Goodman, who I'd somehow missed when glancing over the cast. Is Goodman even capable of acting badly? Even when the dude's in movies I don't like, he's still amazing.I do have to say that the writing here doesn't show Holly Hunter off to her true potential (I'm looking at you, Broadcast News) but she still kills her role.This will definitely become a regular rewatch for me; it's the perfect mix of outrageous comedy and pulpy crime.",Raising Arizona

As the cruel hand of whatever(fate,luck,God,etc.) has for the oddly matched yet truly compatible couple,she cannot have children,and given his status as an ex-con,their chances at legitimate adoption are almost nil.

73,bobsgrock,"A very, very acquired taste.",6,17 December 2009,"With just their second film, the Coen brothers show that they are willing and capable of creating an entirely different film experience each and every time. After their stunning debut with the sharp, enticing crime thriller Blood Simple, what could be further from that than an oddball, idiosyncratic comedy about an ex-con and an ex-cop getting married and stealing a baby from a set of quintuplets because they can't have kids? Two of the most energetic and gratifying actors working today, Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter, go head-on with their outrageous dialog and characters that are so broad and outlandish, it is impossible to not notice them. Both are good in their respective roles, especially Hunter, but some characters weigh down the story and take time away from those we really want to see. John Goodman and William Forsythe play a couple of inmates who know Cage and hope to rob a bank after escaping. There is also a seemingly frightening and terrifying man-hunter on a motorcycle that seems right out of Mad Max. It was these situations that puzzled me and left me wondering what they were doing in this story.I guess I didn't like the movie too much, but probably only for the script, which is in my opinion one of the weakest of the Coen's. The characters are so broad and outlandish that it takes away from the emotional value able to see in them so we are witnessing more behavior than character. I did laugh at certain sections, but there were several scenes that felt from another movie. I guess I can't be too upset seeing as how I have seen many other Coen brother films I love, but it came as a bit of a surprise to me that this disappointed me. Then again, the Coens have always been a very acquired taste. This one is very, very.",Raising Arizona

75,sharky_55,Maybe it was Utah.,7,29 January 2016,"The way that the characters in Raising Arizona talk reminds me of another Coens film, O Brother Where Art Thou. But I think the latter manages to restrict it sensibly to the right characters; two, in particular. They both had a natural knack for showmanship and first impressions - Ulysses McGill, the pompous, smooth talking leading man with the well slicked hair, and the bible salesman Big Dan, who showed a talent for the spoken word not alike his character here, the escaped prisoner at large. Raising Arizona, however, doesn't seem to have a limit to this sort of stilted, solemn dialogue as if they were narrating a history book. We are first introduced to HI via this voice-over, and it is immediately eye-catching as opposed to the events of the opening sequence; small crimes being committed, repeated arrests and getting closely acquainted with the local law enforcement. Petty red neck criminals aren't supposed to speak like this. Initially, this becomes an idiosyncrasy that the viewer can latch onto. The earnest, drawling, misunderstood, small-time crook that just wants to settle down and start a family. How heart-warming. And then, we slowly realise that everyone in this world speaks this way.The female officer and bride to be Ed, is bawling from the second encounter. The siren is almost as loud as her screams when she finds out she is barren. Later, as the loving parents glance over their stolen prize, they are so in love that they again cry out in joy. The pair of prison escapees, rising from the muddy ground like some sort of primordial rebirth, wittily remark that prison no longer had anything left to offer them. They play a big part in the comic absurdity of the presentation of the film, almost Looney Tunes style. Twice, they realise they have left the baby behind, and like some sort of frozen moment in time, they turn to each other and yell out a long-echoing yell. And then they bustle back in hurry, over the sound of Burwell's giddy, upbeat banjo and yodelling score. In another instance, HI uses a plank of wood to block a flying knife, and stares right at the close call, bewildered at his own cartoonish luck. And then as his trick with the grenade is revealed, there is another frozen moment as Smalls looks from the missing pin to HI, and then promptly explodes, much in the same manner as Wile E. Coyote might plummet after being momentarily suspended in mid-air over a cliff. This is all very funny, of course. Smalls is the sort of over the top villain in both his mannerism and costume that appears in a weekly cartoon; here is a man that picks up babies drive-by in the same manner that HI grabs at a package of Huggies nappies. The first appearance of the Arizonas has the camera pointing dead straight at the quiet couple lounging in their twin chairs like a pristine still-life caricature. Later, the discovery of the kidnapping has the camera speed across the barren plains and roads, over a car and fountain, up the ladder and right into the pit of Mrs Arizona's hysterical wailing mouth. It is reminiscent of Frances McDormand's own animated shrieks at meeting little Nathan Junior for the first time. The women of this film are in short, barely quieter than a shrill siren. The pressing issue is that this humour isn't misplaced, but rather ever present. Arizona Senior makes a plea to the public to find his lost son, and then slips in a little promotion for his furniture chain. HI pours his heart and troubles out to Glen, desperately searching for that solace in the middle-age rut, and instead receives a stammering suggestion of wife-sharing (albeit very funny). He is so aligned with a life of crime that any attempts of declaring to live a decent and normal life are met with glares from Ed, and when he announces himself a changed man, he simultaneously cocks a shotgun. Raising Arizona demands that none of these characters ever have a serious moment or be taken too seriously - even the young store clerk, with a brief appearance, brandishes his gun like some western outlaw - and so as HI and Ed return Nathan Junior to his rightful home, and HI has a long, dreamlike moment of retrospection, it doesn't really feel like a moment earned.",Raising Arizona

77,Stampsfightclub,Coens make another comedy gem,8,30 June 2009,"Unable to conceive, police officer Ed McDunnough (Hunter) and her ex-con husband H.I (Cage) steal a baby from a wealthy businessman, only to encounter numerous problems.After the successful Blood Simple in 1984, The Coen brothers maintained their rise into the cinematic universe with this sharp and tactically astounding piece of film-making with a well scripted plot and some sharp direction to make a wonderful watch.Starting off with a surprising and diverse approach to the prison world, H.I is in and out of prison more than The Dude is out of the bowling alley. This quick succession of events is scripted by a swift Nicholas Cage accent in a funny manor, with the events falling in place against the on screen revelations of the constant robber. Soon H.I and the police officer hit it off and in virtually no time at all, we have the major plot device, the stealing of the baby. Mineralizing all the background and cutting straight to the point is one of the Coen's strong points. In Burn after Reading John Malkovich finds he is fired and creates his memoires before he loses them in the first half an hour. The legendary writers and directors certainly know how to pack the early punch and gain our interest.Perhaps this is one of the most fascinating openings, because of the absurdity of the concept of baby stealing. In no time at all we are right with the couple contemplating the decision to steal one of Arizona's babies in a bid to make their lives more fulfilled. Sat outside the house and H.I is soon climbing a ladder into the toddler's shared bedroom where the seven babies sit adorably silent. From the dream sequences in The Big Lebowski to the wood chipper sequence in Fargo, this has to be the brother's best executed moment. All the babies sit in perfect silence as Nic Cage comes to take one of them away. This whole scene is dark comic magic with a minimal problem soon ensuring chaos as the babies parade around whilst the central protagonist tries to redeem himself. The comedy on show here is wonderfully typical childish behaviour that is exactly what you want after the fast flowing montages. This settles the plot down with the gentle comedy and the wonderfully shot interplay with the kids. Of course in typical Coen fashion things are shaken up before the dust can settle and when at home the new family finds they have some visitors in the shape of H.I's old inmates, which adds an extra comedy gem as well as some dramatic sparks to proceedings.From here on in the good nature of doing the right thing for the baby is left out as the Coen's use that special sense of self-indulgence for their protagonists in a rightful bid to make the drama and comedy that little bit funnier.Raising Arizona has a few faults. Nic Cage's character is too sluggish on the uptake to find funny with the constant narration offbeat, and the bad biker is strange in context but regardless this 1987 release is sharp and funny, with that wonderful uniqueness only the brothers can pull off.",Raising Arizona
78,Mister-6,"Okay, then...",10,6 September 2000,"This is one of those surreal experiences that make you wonder whether or not you laughed at what you saw or what you THOUGHT you had seen.  Of course, being concocted by Joel and Ethan Coen makes it even more surreal.As ""repeat offender"" H. I.

After returning to the same prison time after time under the eye of Officer Ed (Holly Hunter), he goes straight and they get married, planning to have a big family.  It is only then, he finds that Ed is a ""barren, rocky place"". 
So, what's a couple to do?This is where the ""Arizona"" of the title comes in, when they steal one of the quintuplets of the Arizona family.  Naturally, the father (Wilson) goes all out to find the culprits, even enlisting the aid of a ""tracker"" (Cobb), who is kind of an existential bounty hunter with a good nose.From this deceptively simple story line, the Coens create a dreamscape that is mesmerizing, serpentine, loaded with all matter of visual input, deft one-liners and characters that are so off-the-wall that it's hard to forget them and the situations they get into.Coen Brother stalwart John Goodman plays yet another flaky loon - this time an escaped con - who, along with his little brother (Forsythe) complain that the prison ""had no more to offer them"".Of course, the chases, fight scenes and getaway scenes are elaborate, well-choreographed and exciting, as well as funny.  How could they not be? This whole movie is one huge snowball rolling down the side of a mountain, growing larger and rolling faster as it reaches the end of its trip.But to try and explain this movie is an exercise in futility; you'd be better off explaining Kierkegaard to a room full of second-graders.  You just have to see it yourself.  If your sense of humor is a bit on the dry side and you love fancy camera work and Fellini-esque characters, it's your kind of movie.Trust me.Ten stars and a complimentary pack of Huggies for ""Raising Arizona"", the best Dadaist head trip film with kidnapped babies, exploding bunnies and Frances McDormand in the desert you'll ever find...that has a fight in a trailer.",Raising Arizona
79,TOMASBBloodhound,Early Coen brothers effort has plenty of laughs.,8,21 November 2010,"You never really know what to expect from Joel and Ethan Coen the first time you sit down to watch one of their films. Long before their masterpieces of Fargo and No Country for Old Men, these two already knew how to baffle an audience. For laughs just read Roger Ebert's clueless review. He had no idea what he was watching or how to review it. If he saw it for the first time today he'd no doubt award it at least 3 1/2 of 4 stars. But since they only had Blood Simple under their belts at this point, Ebert obviously didn't feel obligated to give Raising Arizona anything more than a quick dismissal. I must admit I was originally baffled by these characters too, but the film had such energy, funny physical comedy, and incredible camera work that I was compelled to see it as many times as it took to appreciate it.The plot centers around Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter who are newlyweds unable to conceive children. Hunter was a policewoman who got to know Cage over the many times he was arrested for robbing convenience stores. It was her job to take the mugshot photos of incoming crooks and the two took a serious liking to one another over the years. And his criminal record puts adoption out of the question. Though Cage figures their respective records should simply cancel each other out. Anyway, the couple resorts to kidnapping one of five babies born to a furniture magnate and his wife after she took several fertility treatments. Complicating things are two of Cage's old prison buddies who break out of jail and attempt to kidnap the little tyke for themselves. And there is a true oddity of a character in the form of a sadistic biker/bounty hunter also looking for the child. Ex-boxer Randall ""Tex"" Cobb plays him and he is almost a precursor to the Anton Chigurh character of No Country. Only he's a lot uglier and dirtier.The film doesn't last long and is mostly and assortment of chase scenes and slapstick that generally find their mark. There is about a five minute chase scene at the center of the film that will have you howling right along with the yodeler on the soundtrack. The actors are given some truly odd characters to play, but they generally do a good job with them. Frances McDormand may have been too over-the-top however. Her role is brief however. Cage is allowed to do what he does best in many scenes.... wig out! In a script which calls for a lot of yelling, he yells perhaps the loudest. The late Trey Wilson, who plays the furniture giant, pretty much steals all of his scenes. Certainly his lines are funniest. If you haven't seen this one for a while, you may want to see it again. Still a very funny picture. 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.",Raising Arizona
80,gab-14712,Raising the Coen Brothers' Careers!,9,23 October 2020,"In 1984, The Coen Brothers introduced themselves to the filmmaking world with their brilliant debut, Blood Simple. That film proved that the auteurs mastered the art of storytelling. Three years later, they released one of their career-best (out of many career-best, lots of subjectivity) films, Raising Arizona. This little gem proved that they mastered the art of dialogue. Sure, everyone has weird accents but that does not change the fact that the screenplay, also written by the Coen's, is gold. This movie is the very beginning of their particular style of word usage that will come to define them over the next several decades. I know many old-school critics felt the film was shallow or were surprised at what they saw, but many consider this one of their best films. It is hilarious, has characters you will never forget, a fantastic screenplay, a wonderful score, great cinematography, and just that sense of weirdness you will come to love. It feels like one of those strange Nicolas Cage movies. Wait a second, this is one of those strange Nic Cage movies.
After the success of Blood Simple, The Coen Brothers wanted to shift gears and create something more uplifting. After the tension and the darkness of that film, can you blame them? Despite the main character H.I breaking the law a million times, the Coen's worked to make their characters sympathetic. And it worked! Despite the laws being broke and crimes being committed, you feel for the plight of H.I and his girlfriend. I found it interesting how the ideas for the dialects were created. It is a mixture of local dialect combined with eccentricities from local magazines and the Bible. They surely are weird, but this is supposed to be a weird movie, right? The directors brought back most of the production crew from their debut film such as Carter Burwell creating the score (and actually made yodeling not annoying) and Barry Sonnenfeld behind the camera who really did some excellent work.
This film is about a man named H.I. McDonnough (Nicolas Cage) who has made a living on holding up convenience stores and going to jail. After one such encounter, he falls in love with policewoman, Ed (Holly Hunter). There is just one problem. Ed is unable to conceive a baby. She convinces him to steal a baby from rich car salesman, Nathan Arizona (Trey Wilson). After all, his wife gave birth to five babies. They aren't going to miss one, right? As they go about their plan, they encounter fellow convicts from the law; Gale (John Goodman) and Evelle (William Forsythe) and Leonard Smalls (Randall 'Tex' Cobb) who looks like he could be part of the Hells Angels gang and has been tasked with retrieving the baby.
The actors clearly had a great time making the movie. Say what you want about the accents, but the performances themselves are amazing. Can you imagine this Nic Cage character carrying around pampers and acting as a father? No, but it is hilarious to watch anyway. The Coen Brothers wrote Holly Hunter's part with her in mind. So, it is no surprise she killed the role. John Goodman became a Coen Brother regular after his winning performance. He was part of the riotously hilarious bank robbery scene that had me rolling around in laughter. ""Where are the bank tellers?"" ""Here, sir!"" This is the PG way of saying it, but this line delivery was hilarious. Trey Wilson is great as the bombastic Arizona Sr. Hey, keep an eye out for Frances McDormand.
Without a doubt, Raising Arizona is a comedic tour-de-force. It's not for everyone, especially those with an old-school mentality. Regardless, The Coen Brothers crafted a special film that introduced their style that would flourish in years to come. The movie was a big hit and Ethan Coen would later say that this would be their last film to bring in hordes of money (not exactly true), but the world of cinema was gifted when these auteurs made this film. It's funny, strange, and has one of the best bank robbery sequences.

82,ajs-10,Great script and some great performances...,8,13 February 2011,"I do like the films of the Coen brothers, in particular their earlier works. This is one I have seen a couple of times before but this is the first time I've reviewed it. What we have is a brilliantly scripted piece with some great performances and a pretty crazy plot to boot! More of my thoughts later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters please mind the baby while I write the next paragraph).NOTE: Although every effort is made to give as little away as possible in my summaries, sometimes a little extra may slip out. If you feel you may read something here that may spoil your future enjoyment of the film then PLEASE DO NOT read the following paragraph. (I don't know one person whinges and you've got to put disclaimers all over the place!!) H.I. McDunnough is a repeat offender; he robs convenience stores. He is often at the police station where he meets and falls in love with Edwina ('Ed' for short), a cop. They get married and live happily for a while that is until they decide to start a family. You see, Ed discovers she can't have babies and this dashes the hopes of the young couple. And then they hear of the 'Arizona Qunits'; five babies born to Nathan and Florence Arizona. Thinking they've probably got more than enough to deal with, H.I. and Ed decide to steal one for themselves and this is where it all begins. Now, in the interests of not giving too much away, and because I got whinged at (you know who you are) I'm not going to say any more here although I would like to.First of all, a truly excellent script, the Coens were really on form when they wrote this one. There is some tremendous dialogue, although the pacing does go a little awry in places. I think it's one of the best performances I've seen from both Nicolas Cage as H.I. McDunnough and Holly Hunter as Edwina 'Ed' McDunnough. Also worthy of note are; Trey Wilson as Nathan Arizona, John Goodman as Gale Snoats, William Forsythe as Evelle Snoats, Sam McMurray as Glen and Frances McDormand as Dot.The opening of this film is one of the best I've seen, beautifully paced, funny and it sets up the characters and the situation perfectly. Of course, this momentum cannot be maintained throughout and, although efforts are made to raise it, it never quite reaches the same heights. The characters are all fully formed and excellently portrayed, which seems to be a rare thing these days, particularly in comedy films. So, over all, a great script with some brilliant dialogue and excellent performances but the pacing is a little uneven still very much recommended.My score: 8.3/10",Raising Arizona
83,Ben_Cheshire,"Empty, unfunny and unimpressive Coen Brothers outing.",6,8 May 2004,"I didn't know the Coens could make a bad movie till i saw this. I could appreciate what they were going for, but i think the screenplay was just not up to scratch. There's no narrative drive - no reason for us to watch till the end. The premise was not good enough, and they filmed each scene for way too long. A quicker pace might have helped, but it wouldn't have made it a funnier movie.I just couldn't believe what a simple level this movie operates on - there's nothing more complex in it than an impotent couple stealing a baby off a couple with plenty of babies and trying to juggle having a baby with the criminal tendencies of Nick Cage.Just generally unimpressive. Barry Sonnenfeld's whooshing steadicam shots along the ground are very nice, but the scenes they are in play out like jokes told to a silent, staring audience, totally flat.For classy Coen, O Brother Where Art Thou, for hilarious perfect Coen see Big Lebowski, for the most fun see Hudsucker Proxy.",Raising Arizona

With little alternatives they decide to kidnap Nathan Arizona Jr. (TJ Kuhn) infant son of local furniture czar Nathan Arizona Sr. (Trey Wilson). But because kidnapping a baby of a local businessman is going to cause a stir HI and Ed get a whole lot more than they wish for. The Coen brothers are great with dark comedy and it really shows in this film. I can't really think of a whole lot of other movies that make kidnapping (let alone baby kidnapping) into a funny subject. With great characters all over the place saying funny lines who couldn't love this movie's humor. It seems very much like an episode of the Simpsons where all the action revolves around grown people doing stupid things. And that is where all the humor lies. I really can't recommend this film enough so I'll just end by saying go see it.,Raising Arizona
85,Tito-8,Offbeat in every way,6,3 December 1998,"While by no means a classic, this film is still a lot of fun in a WEIRD sort of way.

Nevertheless, the movie has several moments of inspired lunacy, a terrific opening, and a reasonably good pace that make it all a worthwhile experience.",Raising Arizona
86,AhmedSpielberg99,Fiendishly Cartoonish yet Sweeeeeeeeeeet!,8,30 April 2021,"With a breakneck pace, Looney Tunes-esque ridiculously-exaggerated sound effects, boisterously rambunctious style, vertiginous camerawork and hysterical editing, I guess calling this batshit crazy Coens' crime comedy film a live-action cartoon wouldn't be preposterous. It's wild and quirky, but it's also extremely smart and clever in every respect. Just like a cartoon, it finds humor in the most horrifying scenes by hyperbolizing the violence to the brink of absurdity. But there are also boasts of that signature Coen brothers' stone-faced, deadpan humour here. Uses of repetition and refrains permeate the movie to produce some chuckles, but some of them are inextricably linked to the theme itself, most notably H. I. McDunnough's frequent run-ins with the law. Raising Arizona is also playful and cheeky, and I believe that is where it gains its heart. At the surface, the moments of emotional inertia are played for comedic effect, but they actually make room for H. I. McDunnough to reconsider and reevaluate the whole situation he and his wife are in after kidnapping the baby and ruminates over the consequences he regretfully waits. Nicholas Cage shines in these moments as his face that shows how bested by unavoidable fears he is juxtaposes the rather eccentrically affable atmosphere that predominates the entire movie. Holly Hunter's Ed, though, is the one who retains the emotional core of the movie that's ultimately unveiled by the end to hammer home the sweet message of the story. Hunter is phenomenal, and it's not her fault that the lunatic absurdism overshadowed the story's emotional beats every so often, the thing that made the movie a bit crude. Nevertheless, Raising Arizona is a fantastically maniac non-stop chase movie that's extremely heartfelt and kind at its essence, much like Gale and Evelle.",Raising Arizona

The acting was good, Nicolas Cage gave the best performance, i liked him a lot in this, one of his best performances i think, liked him more here than adaptation and a lot of his new stuff (although he is off and on and at times brilliant even in recent films).

Also, I don't have the film school sophistication to enjoy the editing and makeup, for example, if the plot and characters are awful.But I've found the Coen brothers' work accessible, especially ""O Brother Where Art Thou"". And Raising Arizona was a worthwhile comedy -- original and interesting. I couldn't identify with the protagonists, and there were some slightly surreal bits that dropped me out of the film, and this was definitely a comedy / drama. And I have not quite forgiven ""Holly Hunter"" for the horrid ""The Piano"". But there was plenty of wacky and I laughed out loud several times. Who should see this film:-- comedy lovers who think a bit of wacky will make up fora bit of drama.-- drama lovers.

I personally found it good and in this review I shall tell you why I thought it was firmly good and the reasons also.The story is quirky and can be funny, not really the most funny thing ever but it can make you smile and laugh occasionally and with such a crazy story revolving around a crazy baby, it starts to be a good film. I felt the comedy does lack slightly in the sense of big chuckles but the film is more of a good crime movie too with well I won't ruin it but two incidents of crime which make the story thrilling as well as quite funny.Nicolas Cage in this is possibly his best acting role, a string of bad performances from the man seem to vanish in this where he actually seems to fit in with the crazy going's on and plot. I particularly enjoyed John Goodman who as Cage's best friend is humorous but kind of strangely not nice even if he speaks in his familiar voice of Goodman and seems near kind hearted. Cage really is the main show and for good reason with this strange and hard to understand role.The Coen brothers direct and write this and as I said before it is nowhere near some of there masterpieces but nonetheless is entertaining and proves to be a fun adventure in all truth. I love the soundtrack to this and the vast vast setting of the desert which serve the film with an even weirder premise with the couple living basically in the middle of nowhere, apart from occasionally coming across shops. It isn't that that funny and is why I put it here in the criticism paragraph because the movie I felt lacked the jokes it promised me and should have said it was slightly more serious as a film. Of course there are funny bits but another criticism is the acting which is good yes but some of the supporting are average but that is all really, the film Is hard for me to fully criticise but I don't think it is anywhere near being great.I think those who enjoy fast comedy and a sweet couple in the middle will enjoy this as it I believe it can be fully enjoyed and quite a bit. The story holds up and so I can't see why someone wouldn't enjoy it so see for yourself how you find it when you see it. Finally some will like the quirky parts I was talking about as it makes for an interesting plot and some kind of strange things happen to the main cast.Overall a 7/10 from me meaning it is firmly good, people will enjoy this much more I Guarantee but it all depends on that persons comedy preferences In truth. Go watch and see yet another Coen's production, don't expect as much of it as some of there other works but it can be very much appreciated and even a little skillful at times.",Raising Arizona

""Hi"" McDonnough (Nicholas Cage) is a philosophical but slightly dim career criminal who has been arrested so often that he gets to know ""Ed,"" short for Edwina (Holly Hunter), the officer who takes his mug shots. Hi takes a shine to Ed and promises to go straight if she marries him. She accepts, and they move to the Arizona desert, where Hi holds down a factory job and blissfully watches the sunsets with Ed. Their serenity is shattered when the couple decides that they want a child and discover that, as Hi puts it, ""Ed's womb was a rocky place where my seed could find no purchase."" (One of the film's many delights is Hi's unexpectedly flowery dime-novel narration.) Ed goes into a severe depression until she sees an item in the news. Nathan Arizona (Trey Wilson), owner of a chain of unpainted furniture stores, has become the father of quintuplets. He and his wife joke that they now have more children than they can handle.In what seems like a perfect ""helps you, helps me"" situation, Hi and Ed kidnap one of the Arizona infants, figuring that they'll have a baby and the Arizonas will have less of a burden. The Coens play the American Dream for farce, Hi (Nicolas Cage) and Edwina (Holly Hunter) attempt parenthood through kidnapping. With nods to cartoon slapstick, ""The Road Warrior"" (1981), ""Doctor Strangelove"" (1964), and Sam Raimi's horror films, and a script that mixes southwestern slang and polished locutions, the Coens extract maximum wackiness from their sly send-up of familial urges. From crude yet refined convicts Gale (John Goodman) and Evelle (William Forsythe) to blowhard father Nathan Arizona to swinging procreators Glen (Sam McMurray) and Dot (Frances McDormand), all the cartoony characters want to parent baby Arizona for all the wrong reasons. Cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld's sharp compositions, low camera, and manic ""shakycam"" shots showcase the Coens' energetic visual wit, particularly in a prolonged chase featuring dogs, cops, a ""panty""-wearing Hi, a gun-toting convenience store clerk and a package of purloined Huggies.Complete with carefully modulated over-the-top performances from the entire cast, ""Raising Arizona"" confirmed the Coens' place among the most distinctive filmmakers to emerge from the 1980s independent cinema",Raising Arizona

I. is a character is easy to like and join the journey with - the entirety of the cast and their colorful characters hugely entertain, including young and fresh John Goodman & William Forsythe playing two prison escapees. Never heard better screaming. The story, too, keeps surprising and skipping along at a fast pace. In the comedic feat and amazing adventure that it is, are also something more serious to see, like the fears of being a parent, the responsibilities - and how scary they seem - of caring for a child. And love.. Love that we unconditionally have for our children. Everybody wants to raise an Arizona. In a lot of ways, ""Raising Arizona"" is definitely over-the-top, like, for example, over-the-top enjoyable. Seriously though, the eccentric values of this film are strong, and that's no surprise, when Coens team up with Cage. Though actually their relationship has been tense, they say.Like the entire career of these directors, ""Raising Arizona"", too, is visually striking and fast moving, even though not as polished as their later works, but we gotta remember it's the 1987. Cinematography and editing are in good relationship, there are plenty of crazy steadicam action, all the creative angles you could ask for, and vivid colors all around. And good soundtrack to run it by. What else speaks ""Coens"" so much but a yodeling banjo song in the background for action.""Raising Arizona"" is a feel-good, smile-much, be-very-entertained comedy adventure, provided that You like the kind of humor Coens bring to the table. Every aspect is on level, and it's a well rounded movie with a just a slightly underwhelming ending. My rating: 9/10.",Raising Arizona

Nathan Jr....I think.,10,18 July 2017,"When I saw this in the movie theater in 1987, I laughed out loud numerous times, which is something I rarely do when I go to the movies. I realized at the time that this was probably the funniest movie I had ever seen. But since I was still relatively young at the time (under 30), I assumed that I'd eventually see something that was even funnier.Fast forward to 2017, and this is still the funniest movie I've ever seen, so I guess I have to give it a 10! I'm not one of those people slavishly devoted to the Coen brothers, but I'd say Raising Arizona and Fargo are their best. However, they've had some duds as well (Burn After Reading, anybody?). But I do admire their fearlessness to take on many different genres.I thought the script for Raising Arizona was fantastic, and I thought they would be making other very funny movies in the future. Alas, that hasn't been the case. In terms of being funny, I thought Intolerable Cruelty was a distant second. Fargo is probably their very best, but the humor is a lot more subtle and nuanced.",Raising Arizona

Lucky then, local tycoon Arizona just had quintuplets, surely he can spare one to those less fortunate...If the excellent Miller's Corssing is the Coens' idea of a gangster film, you can imagine what their version of a family comedy caper would be. Chances that you'd imagine something like Raising Arizona are close to zero. There's a sweetness here mostly absent from the rest of their catalogue, and the inventive madness is cranked up to 11, though not in a way that will alienate the more mainstream viewer. The cast, predictably for a Coen gig, are excellent, and the main duo turn in career-best performances. If you are new to the Coen brothers, this is as good a point of entry as any, endowed as it is with a rigorously classical structure, ace comedy and memorable moments - The Lone Biker of the Apocalypse! - it will put an indelible smile on your face, one that will subside long after the credits have rolled.",Raising Arizona
101,coldwaterpdh,Genius on so many levels.,10,21 May 2008,"""Raising Arizona"" is one of those rare American films that seems to capture the essence of what this country is all about. From first light, with that banjo strumming and breaking into the Arizona sunset and song, we are treated to the lush landscape of a bygone era: That of the 1980's American southwest. Trailer parks, barren desert plains, jutting red rocks, desolate highways and small town Tempe...it's a testament to the film-making ability of the mighty Coens. The cast is perfection; each worthy of a spot on Mount Rushmore and a hand print on Hollywood Blvd. Each line in the script should be savored and reviewed over. And over.

102,gary-444,"Intelligent,Whimsical Comedy",8,19 October 2008,"Firstly, I should make it clear that this review is 21 years after release. Consequently, it is possible to look at this in the context of a considerable body of work. Such a perspective serves this film well. The Coen brothers are good at narrative script,character and situation. All three are worked to the full here.Sometimes you question quite how clever the Coen's are, when you do, you realise the answer is ""very"". What they do is put caricatures in absurd situations, then draw out everyday truth and humour from the story.The sets are frequently deliberately ""staged"", the parents of a soon to be kidnapped child are sat on what appears to be a theatre stage, rather than a front room.The kidnappers trailer opens out into a vast condo set inside - and you don't care.The story itself is simple, a habitual convict marries a cop, she discovers she cannot conceive, so they kidnap one of a set of Quintuplets on the basis that the parents have more than they can handle.Some escaped cons who resolve that they have ""taken all that prison has to offer"" in turn kidnap the child for the reward money pursued by a Bounty hunter.Visually the film veers from the surreal, the Bounty hunter is straight out of ""Mad Max"", to the engaging,when Nicholas Cage, playing the recidivist convict kidnaps one of the Quins from their cot.Intriguingly this later scene is shot with a light humorous touch, echoing ""Three Men and a Baby"".The script resolutely refuses to follow any moral logic or sense of consequence, what it does instead is to relish and explore how the characters behave in bizarre, extraordinary situations.You either buy into it, or you don't.

103,jcbutthead86,"One Of The Greatest And Funniest Comedies Of All Time. An Excellent,Unforgettable Classic From The Coen Brothers.",10,24 June 2013,"Raising Arizona is easily one of the funniest,greatest and most original Comedies of all time and a timeless film classic. Filled with great direction,an amazing cast,a wonderful screenplay,truly beautiful cinematography and an unforgettable score,Raising Arizona is The Coen Brothers at their best and greatest.Raising Arizona tells the story of H.I. McDunnough(Nicholas Cage),a criminal and repeat offender and police officer 'Ed' Edwina(Holly Hunter)who fall in love and after falling in love decide to get married and have kids. When H.I. and Ed can't conceive kids of their own,H.I and Ed kidnap a quintuplet,Nathan Arizona JR(T.J Kuhn JR) one of the children of local business man Nathan Arizona(Trey Wilson). When H.I and Ed take Nathan J.r and want to raise him as their own wild and hilarious things happen in their lives.Raising Arizona is one of the all-time great classic Comedies from The Coen Brothers that came after their amazing film debut Blood Simple. When filmmakers have a first film that is so acclaimed and well loved, most filmmakers have to do a second film that lives up to the quality of their first film and not only does Raising Arizona live up to Blood Simple but also gives viewers a brilliant and much brighter and lighter cinematic experience. One of the reasons Raising Arizona is excellent and truly hilarious is because The Coen Brothers have given us a flawless film that combines great laughs with style and substance where everything in the film is over the top and exaggerated to the point of going over the top beyond belief. The laughs and humor in the film are funny,ingenious and original with hilarious Slapstick Comedy,funny dialog and moments in the movie that have you laughing until your stomach hurts and will have tears running down your face. The laughs are so crazy and over the top you will you're watching a surreal live Action Cartoon. What is also great about the Humor in this film and other Coen Brother films is that the laughs are subtle and used in visuals and imagery that are not obvious the first time you watch RA but when you watch the film with multiple viewings you will notice or catch some of the visual jokes of the film. And speaking of of visuals RA is one of the most beautiful and visually stunning Comedies I have ever seen. Barry Sonnefield's photography is amazing and powerful with wide angle shots,close ups and shots of the sunlight,road and dusty world of Arizona. Sonnefield's photography gives the film a surreal and wild energy that you don't see in most comedies and that is one of the great things that sets RZ apart from other films of it's type because RA can not only have a wonderful style but can also have amazing substance. The screenplay by Joel and Ethan Coen is hilarious and well and one of the best screenplays in Comedy history with the Coens giving the main great dialog that is funny,memorable and stylized as well as greatly using narration for H.I. McDunnough and lines from the main characters that are quotable and will stay in your mind. The two main characters H.I. and Ed McDunnough while over the top and are cartoon characters who are funny but are given great depth and humanity and you feel like the two truly love and care for one another and even though H.I and Ed kidnapped a baby they don't do it for fame or money,they do it because they want to be parents and want to love a child and the kidnapping make the main characters more complex than they truly are and that is one of many things that is great about RA and the Coens. Although not an Action film RA has a couple of good Action and chase scenes that are thrilling and exciting. Especially the film's main chase scene which is one of the funniest,wildest,original and over the top chase scenes in film history and it is a classic chase that that you will never forget. The ending of the film is funny,beautiful and very optimistic and will make you wonder what will happen to H.I and ED. An great ending to a great film.The whole cast does great jobs in their roles. Nicholas Cage is excellent,funny and at his best as H.I McDunnough,with Cage bringing laughs and depth to the role. Holly Hunter is brilliant as 'Ed' Edwina McDunnough,with Hunter feisty and funny and having great chemistry with Cage. Trey Wilson is wonderful and fun as Nathan Arizona,a local business man. John Goodman and William Forsythe are great,funny and over the top as Gale and Evelle Snoats,escaped convicts who are H.I's friends. Sam McMurray and Francis McDormand are amazing and hilarious as husband and wife Glen and Dot,friends of H.I. and Ed. Randell 'Tex' Cobb is fantastic as Leonard Smalls,a man hunter who's a man of few words and is looking for Nathan JR.The direction by Joel and Ethan Coen is excellent,with The Coens always moving the camera,using wide angles,low angles,close-ups and giving the film a great visual style. Great direction by The Coens.The score by Carter Burwell is is amazing,funny,beautiful and very quirky and matches the tone of the film,with Burwell greatly mixing whistles,yodeling,organs and banjos. Wonderful score by Burwell.In final word,if you love The Coen Brothers,Comedies or films in general,I highly suggest you check out Raising Arizona,a truly hilarious,funny and unforgettable Comedy and film classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Raising Arizona

Sometimes, films can surprise you with no expectations. But this movie failed to really get off the ground.John Goodman, the only other recognizable face in this film besides Cage, is there with his bud. When they get whift of the kidnapped baby's true identity, they steal the baby instead of collecting on the reward. Nobody had any real logic in this film. And what is worse, the film was just generally unfunny.The baby bit, with everybody stealing him, was funny the first time. But it wasn't the next four or five times. Old bits. The robbery was also kind of funny. But even then, it could not make up for the fact the rest of the movie was sub-par. Overall, not too awful. But then again, being sub-par isn't all too thrilling either. ""C-""",Raising Arizona

106,kijii,Tale of the recidivistic store robber & his barren cop wife,8,11 December 2016,"This is tall tale comedy about a recidivistic convenience store robber, H.I. McDonnough (Nicolas Cage), who marries a barren cop, Ed (Holly Hunter) whom he had met on several occasion while being booked into the Maricopa County Maximum Security System. Ed feels that they desperately need a baby to make their family life complete. But, since she can't have a baby and they can't adopt one (due to H.I's long criminal record), he decides to steal one of the locally well-known Arizona quintuples made famous by their father, Nathan Arizona. Arizona is an unpainted furniture tycoon and TV commercial celebrity. The kidnapping of the Arizona baby leads Nathan Arizona to ""hire"" a biker bounty hunter from Hell to find his baby. Added to this, H.I, has other problems such as a visit from two of his old penal inmates, who break out of jail and won't leave his family unit alone. Another of H.I.'s problems is the fact that his boss, Glen, and his wife, Dot, are ""swingers"" in the sense that they are into spouse swapping and want H.I and Ed to swap partners with them some time. They also want a child young enough to cuddle and seem to have their eyes on the Arizona baby. All this leads to some hilarious high-speed chases through the Arizona desert. This was the first Coen brothers movie that I ever saw in a movie theater. I wasn't ready for it then, but now it just fits in perfectly with all of their other great movies.",Raising Arizona
107,Silverzero,"Quirky, delightfully eccentric comedy from the Coen brothers.",10,15 August 2003,"Renowned for witty dialogue, quirky performances and bravura styles, the Coen brothers are among the most innovative filmmakers around. And `Raising Arizona' ranks as one of their best films to date. The plot is simple enough- a young couple steals baby when they can't have one of their own-- but it provides the chance for some hilarious situations. And while the running time is a narrow 94 minutes, plenty of laughs are to be had and the story develops quickly enough. `Raising Arizona' is the definitive cult classic. A mass following has compensated for little attention upon release.
The script is as sharp and witty as one would hope for, and you can tell that a lot of work has gone into it- smart, witty and comprehensive. The verbal wit is top-notch, but some of the best gags come from the `Cannonball Run' style visual wit. The demonic `Angel of Death' who kills all little creatures in the most bizarre fashion is hilarious, as are the riotous kids who bring new meaning to `rebellious'. But the funniest scene is definitely the grocery store hold-up sequence that escalates into a slapstick chase.
The performances are superbly comedic all round. Nicholas Cage and Holly Hunter flews their comic talents as the white trash protagonists. Even the costume designs (Cage's hair especially) are hilarious to look at. Meanwhile, Coen regular John Goodman is tremendously funny as is his equally dim-witted brother played by William Forsythe. Even the small parts that go to Sam McMurray and Frances McDormand among others are funnier than expected. One problem that can affect similar stories is that they can sometimes be a little thin. But `Raising Arizona' never wears out its welcome. It sticks to the set-up but brings in plenty of fresh sub-plots that brilliantly coincide with the main story. This is by far the best movie of 1987. While pictures like `The Last Emperor' and `Moonstruck' may have hogged the Oscars in an otherwise mediocre year, they didn't survive the test of time.
If you haven't yet seen `Raising Arizona', you should check it out because you're in for a treat. It works on a small-scale, but brilliantly improvises. Memorable one-liners, excellent humour and impeccable timing make for a classic of less-than-epic proportions. My IMDb rating: 7.9/10.",Raising Arizona
108,mhasheider,A clever and wild comedy.,9,18 October 2000,"I've seen some of the movies that the Coen brothers have made (""Miller's Crossing"", ""Fargo"", ""The Big Lebowski"").  Before I saw ""Raising Arizona"", ""Miller's Crossing"" was my favorite movie that was done by the duo.   The film stars Nicholas Cage and Holly Hunter as H.I. (Cage), an ex-con and Ed (Hunter), a cop who takes the mug shots.  After H.I. gets out of prison for what he hopes is the last time and prosposes to Ed to marry him. Once they married, the only problem that they have is Ed can't have children.  Their dilemma is quickly solved when the wife of a furniture owner who has the last name ""Arizona"", has quints.  Ed gets H.I. to take one of the quints.   The second half of the film is even more entertaining than the first as Ed and H.I. must deal with Gale (John Goodman) and Evelle (William Forsythe), two of H.I.'s former prison buddies and Leonard Smalls (Randall ""Tex"" Cobb""), a bounty hunter who goes by another name ""Warthog from h---"". There's one funny chase scene that goes from a store through a house and ends in a grocery store.   This movie is simply great, the performances by Cage and Hunter are almost perfect.  Carter Burwell's musical score is great and had me laughing my head off.  Barry Sonnefeld's camera work of the landscape is superb. ""Raising Arizona"" is a clever and wild comedy.",Raising Arizona
109,higherall7,Step to the right and into the Future...,8,19 March 2016,"Just a howl from start to finish! The exposition is marvelously evolved and the opening credits as grand as any narrative hook sent to arrest you and go gunning down the road. This is a beautiful and yet sensitive and sympathetic portrayal of Midwestern and Southern white folk also referred to as so-called 'white trash'. Carter Burwell really knows what he is doing with the music; a mixture of organ, banjo, whistling and yodeling; and the Coen brothers edit it all in to the brilliant chase sequences with verve and exhilaration until music and motion are almost a form of high poetry.The lines of dialogue are as good as anything Abbott and Costello could have devised and it's fun to watch Nicholas Cage race around as reformed ex con H.I. McDunnough to see who's on first. Holly Hunter as his twice decorated police officer wife is also wonderfully histrionic as Edwin 'Ed' McDunnough and Randall 'Tex' Cobb comes riding out the hell of one of H.I. McDunnough's nightmares as though sent on a mission from the Grim Reaper. John Goodman and William Forsythe as the Gale and Evelle Snoats brothers cheerfully demonstrate the bonds of friendship that can accrue between members of the penal institution. Trey Wilson has some of the best lines as the harried, upright television entrepreneur Nathan Arizona, and comes across at turns as savvy, righteously indignant, and even wise about the human condition in a homespun sort of way.Admittedly many of the characters are caricatures of real life people and look and act like refugees from a Robert Crumb comic strip, the far side of the moon exaggeration of so-called 'crackers' we would make jokes about after games of softball and drinking cool-aid. But it is fun to watch these denizens of the New South and New West cavort around in their own buffoonery and misdirection with those famous narrow-minded attitudes and folksy perspectives we have all come to know and love. I found it a welcome respite from all the charges about how black folks were compelled to be the clowns and buffoons and indulge in all manner of coonery for the entertainment of largely white audiences. I found these under-educated, none too bright citizens of the Coen Universe oddly charming in their furious attempts to entertain me for once.The most appealing part of the film for me comes at the end when H.I. McDunnough has a dream that takes him into the Future. I have read that one of the limitations of the criminal mind is its inability to properly forecast a positive Future. Here at the film's conclusion McDunnough seems to evolve psychologically to make this quantum leap into a new beginning. This is quite an endearing sequence and it is hard to fault a couple who wanted to create a family so bad they would break or bend any law known to man or beast to get it. After all, isn't that the American Way?Or was that last night's pickles and ice cream talking?",Raising Arizona
110,antagonist117,"A good movie in its own right, but also a working out of ideas that the Coens would continue to improve",7,10 December 2014,"If the Coen brothers' first movie, ""Blood Simple,"" was the earliest example of their brand of nail-biting but thrillingly imaginative violence, ""Raising Arizona"" is the first full realization of their knack for wordplay. Several of their later works, notable ""Fargo,"" would blend the two components in more or less equal measure, but here the dialect and dialogue are front and center. The supporting character played by Frances McDormand uses an imperative tone, with eyebrows raised in pre-judgment, to ask new mother Holly Hunter about the baby's future matriculation: ""You are going to send him to Arizona State."" She is not an exaggeration; the question marks her as a type familiar to anyone raised near the clannish land-grant colleges of the south and southwest.Though this line is sufficiently believable, and though McDormand and Hunter prove their command of accents (not for the last time), there is of course a great deal of affectation in the way the Coens' characters speak. Yet it is not correct to say that the archaic poesy the Coens put in the mouths of countrified people is a pretension or a ridiculous jest. When Nicholas Cage's character substitutes ""slumber"" for ""sleep,"" ""ether"" for ""air,"" and ""twain"" for ""two,"" he is speaking in a way folk really spoke once upon a time. His letter to his wife reads almost like a letter home from a Civil War soldier. There is a great deal of ridiculousness in ""Raising Arizona,"" all of it intentional and some instances of it more successful than others, but the emotions of the characters and the language they use to express them are as heartfelt as they are playful.Some critics have accused the Coens of punching down with their humor, but in ""Raising Arizona"" all of the comedy is the kind that puts the audience on the side of the desperate and downtrodden. The ""hayseeds"" in the local grange easily out-argue a pair of robbers (who are themselves sympathetic enough, in their turn). The only really dislikable person in the film is a relatively well-off factory manager, and it is he, not the man who lives in a trailer park, who shows himself to be a racist and a degenerate.Coen brothers films are not known for social commentary, but ""Raising Arizona"" contains some light critique of society's treatment of individuals with convictions on their records. Nobody in the movie believes that prisons exist to rehabilitate people. A frequent offender opines in a marvelous opening monologue and montage that their purpose must be revenge. At the other end of the movie, the victim of the central crime bookends this idea by declining to press charges since ""there's no harm done.""What doesn't work as well as the Coens' crackling script and characters are their action sequences. The editing is a little rough, which is understandable since much of the drama involves a live baby whom the director cannot actually put in harm's way. The introduction of a motorcycle-riding, grenade-tossing villain is funny at first, but when he starts talking (through a voice-stifling fake nose for some reason) he loses much of his appeal. Holly Hunter carries herself well as a twice-decorated police officer, a presentiment perhaps of Marge Gunderson in ""Fargo,"" but she is given too little to do in the final set piece.""Raising Arizona"" is a very good movie in its own right, but in comparison to the Coens' later masterpieces it can also be viewed as a working out of principles and patterns that would take several more years to come to their fullest fruition.",Raising Arizona

112,buzznzipp1995,Stranger than friction...,10,17 March 2007,"This is one of my favorite comedic Nick Cage movies.

Her wife to Nicholas's Hi is splendid and undoubtedly one of her most underrated yet to me memorable roles. This was fast and focused, on quite a few hilarious players who make this 'Raising' what it should be. I guess I am not a ' traditional ' Cage fan that's why I love the different roles that he has had, not all, but some. John Goodman and William Forsythe are a super-idiotic team with too much criminal ambition. They were a solid piece of this movies foundation. They, the somewhat happy couple want a baby and yet they are surrounded by fools, who have criminal intentions, even friends aren't friends, exactly. The ghost rider adds a spooky element to the tale of barren existence. I also liked the king of naked furniture and his sort of 'Bullyish' attitude loud and proud is he. Cage is so discombobulated in this (i.e.) his hair and clothing and demeanor that you can't help but feel sorry for him and his peace officer spouse. All in case, this comedy runs fast and the cantor is faster, but totally enjoyable. If you missed this one in the theater, catch it and if you saw it long ago, see it again.

114,faraaj-1,Early Coen comedy,7,31 December 2007,"Roger Ebert recently called the Coen Brothers an American institution. Their latest film, No Country for Old Men is out in cinemas now and is widely expected to win a handful of Oscars in March amidst a hail of critical praise. I tend to agree with the view of critics about their high standing in American cinematic history, especially during the otherwise largely barren 80's. Their films can be divided into two categories: crime and comedy.Their earlier crime films, movies like Blood Simple and Miller's Crossing and more recently Fargo are hailed as classics and justifiably so. Blood Simple and Miller's Crossing may have aged with time, but they are still very stylish and intelligent films and will, I believe, stand the test of time like the B&W classics of film noir.Their comedies however, have been a hit and miss affair. They haven't received the critical acclaim of their crime movies even when they were among the very best of the genre such as the brilliant The Big Lebowski. Where you can see a strong noir influence in their crime movies, the comedies are heavily influenced by Preston Sturges whose Sullivan's Travels inspired the title of O Brother Where Art Thou! I didn't much like O Brother or the recent The Ladykillers. The primary problem was with the script and the heavy duty homages to Ealing and Sturges.Of their comedies, Raising Arizona is probably the best after Lebowski. It does not take itself seriously and can get surreal at times but combines reasonable characterizations with a zany plot and good writing to entertain. Nic Cage gives a good early performance, before he went the way of the blockbuster, as an incompetent thief who falls in love with Holly Hunter's police officer. They decide to kidnap a child when they can't have one of their own. The child is one of several (5 or 6) born to a millionaire businessman. The Coen's milk the setup for all its worth in both the kidnapping attempt and the aftermath when assorted criminal elements try to take the child from them. A good humored and good natured film, this is decent viewing for fans of the Coen's. Others not accustomed to their style and work may find it a bit dated.",Raising Arizona

Nicolas Cage is comedically at his absolute best in this, with Holly Hunter as a very supporting sidekick. John Goodman has a small role, but continues to charm us all. It's a film with dark themes, but an overall emotional and feel good spirit to it. Sometimes it goes a little overboard with the silliness and changes tone at times, but it never fails to entertain. It also provides what is probably the most overblown villain out there. A biker (Leonard Smalls) who enters dreams, brings back babies for money, and guns down rabbits for no reason.

Like all Coen brothers films, the off-beat characters are the story and the film's greatest strength. Cage, Holly Hunter, John Goodman, William Forsythe, or even Randall ""Tex"" Cobb. All do a fine job at making you feel at home in the Coen brothers world. Since each film of the brothers is set in a different locale, the dry and inhospitable desert of Arizona is brought into drab life by the Coens and their misfit characters. I love all the Coen brothers movies that I've seen so far with the exception of The Man Who Wasn't There. Their films are unorthodox works of art that need to be experienced with a open mind. You need to be open to a different movie experience to truly appreciate them. Bottom Line: Like all Coen brothers works, a work of art. A truly great film that I just watch over and over and never get tired of.",Raising Arizona
121,TheFilmGuy1,A Very Funny And Original Film,8,24 August 2014,"Raising Arizona is full of the weird and hilarious Coen brothers style of humour that really works so well. It's a crazy and unique ride that is a total classic, for good reason. Raising Arizona has a lot of great and funny performances, the highlight being Nicolas Cage. His crazy and unpredictable nature works well here, and you can't help but laugh at his antics. Holly Hunter also does a great job as his wife, who has some pretty good laugh out loud moments. John Goodman also has a role among some other recognizable faces that all come together really well.The humour is the biggest strength in this film, because it will really have you laughing out loud. There's lots of really witty and well thought out jokes, including some slap stick humour which works wonderfully. One stand out comedic scene is when Nicolas Cage decides he needs to get some Huggies for the baby, and he resorts to his criminal ways to do so, leading to a really funny chase scene that keeps you laughing throughout. Overall, I would recommend this movie. It's very light and funny, making it a quite enjoyable and easily watchable movie.",Raising Arizona
122,billybrown41,My second favorite Coen movie.,10,18 April 2002,"Next to The Big Lebowski, this is my favorite movie the Coen Brothers ever did.  Every time I see it, I laugh like it's my first viewing and Nicholas Cage is PERFECT as H.I. ""Hi"" McDonnaugh.  Any movie that has a chase scene centered around a bundle of diapers deserves a place in my top ten list. That scene is priceless.  Also, I loved the yodeling and the banjo picking.",Raising Arizona

""You bet I do.""), between him and Gale & Evelle (they're a swell bunch of guys""), between Nathan Sr. and Mrs. Arizona (""I do love her so.""), and of course all the love for Nathan Jr.  By the end nobody wants the baby for anything else but love; the only ones with other motives are the biker and HI's boss, and we all know what happens to them (even the boss' tacky wife wants to cuddle Nathan).  Gale & Evelle start out taking little Nathan for nefarious reasons, but as soon as Nathan does ""a doodle"", they adore him too, and find contentment returning to prison voluntarily...I have to stop - I'm misting up here...there's more, there's so much more...Everyone with capacity for genuine peace and love should embrace this wonderful film.  Thank you Joel & Ethan.",Raising Arizona
125,bannonanthony,Absolutely amazing 80s Coen classic.,9,8 January 2009,"'Raising Arizona' was the first Coen Brothers movie I ever saw, and I admit I left it a bit late before watching it, but I finally saw it as the classic it is now rightly regarded as. The quirkiness of the main characters like Hi and Ed, and the downright menace of 'Mad Max' style villain Leonard Smalls really appealed to me. Nicolas Cage, in a relatively early leading role, is excellent as the former criminal trying to go straight and a young Holly Hunter is equally on top form as the cop who wins his heart. Coen regular John Goodman also turns in a great performance as a bank robber who makes Cage's life difficult.One thing I like about the characters is that they are mostly portrayed in a sympathetic light, the exceptions being Glen, Dot, their kids and the aforementioned Mr. Smalls. I take it that the role of Smalls will be one Randall 'Tex' Cobb will always be remembered for. If this is so, then I am glad, because the Lone Biker of the Apocalypse as Hi labels him is one of the most iconic movie villains I've ever seen. The comedy and drama is handled equally well in this movie, with a lot of laughs coming regularly. And I really like how the ending is optimistic. All in all, 'Raising Arizona' is a great movie. If the film has any faults, it's that the characters of Glen, Dot and their kids are so reprehensible it's hard to believe. But I guess that was the point. Please watch this movie. You're in for a treat.",Raising Arizona
126,sakram,Cool,7,20 October 2017,"This is the kind of movies I really like to watch from time to time, they won't overload your mind, won't demand lots of thinking, they are light on your heart, and will definitely make you chuckle and laugh, moreover they have a point, and Raising Arizona does just that. With Nicolas Cage in the lead, and the not-so-much-telling title, you gotta question what this movie has to deliver, but it did deliver quite some. It's a cool movie to watch with your friends trust me.7/10",Raising Arizona
127,K-Slicer,True Comedy,10,2 August 2003,"""Raising Arizona"" is a king among the genre of comedy. I have been a big fan of the Coen Brothers ever since I first saw ""Fargo"" and this is by far the purest comedy they have made (made really for laughs but also made very smartly). Of the comedies that came out in the 1980's, this is one of the most original and stunning (much like Caddyshack and Back To The Future). If anyone watches it, they are in for a treat that they will remember for quite a while.Here are my reasons (spoilers): (1) Nicholas Cage plays the best character of his career as H.I. ""Hi"" McDonnough. He convincingly played a complex, difficult yet funny, resilient ""reformed"" armed robber involved in a kidnapping plot gone horribly awry. He easily had the best male role in the film. (2) Holly Hunter is just great as Ed, the hard as rock ex-cop who has been struck barren. She plays her character menacingly and lovingly and it was very believeable. She had the best female role in the film. (3) If there was ever a movie that takes a simple plot line (like the kidnapping of a child) throws into a blender with a few extra ingredients (like the actual reason for the kidnapping) and something comes out that this really good. The plot of the film is very original and something that was unseen in film before that. Quite a nice piece of writing I must say. (4) My favorite scene of the film involved the chase scene that lasted for ten-some minutes and it was all over a package of diapers. I was reminded of the fight scene from ""They Live"". Besides that, it was probably the quirkiest and funniest chase ever caught on celluloid and it must have inspired many others like it. (5) One aspect of this film I really did like is that toddlers have the effect of making even the most hardened criminal go all mushy inside. That is a sign that someone out there believes that humanity capable of love even if it does bad things. Wishful thinking is sometimes a good thing. (6) A staple of most Coen films has been John Goodman and he does well here as Hi's buddy. As he screams, you wonder if he is either acting tough and acting as if he has constipation. (7) I love the cinematography in this movie. The multiple angles and multiple cameras that were used produce some very nice shots including both Hi and Ed running seperate directions from the car before it exploded. The Coens know how to use the camera. (8) The elaborate sets used in this movie help the set the scene for how weird it would become. The Arizona house was a colorful and wide-open space and it could suggest that this is foreshadowing since the movie was colorful and it was wide open as to where it would end up at. (9) I have never seen a movie with an eleven-minute introduction before. It was an awesome sequence and one of the best the sequences I have seen in a Coen film.  One of the funniest as well. (10) The denouement of ""Raising Arizona"" seemed well-suited to me. As I said earlier, wishful thinking is a good thing and there are people who are willing forgive out there if something is done against them.  Ten reasons give a score of ten.This is a very positive film with a very positive feeling. It has a lot of heart even though the initial setup was a kick in the stomach. The characters are treated with care and respect and I sympathized with them. This a true comedy and an inspiration to other quirky comedies out there now. Anyone and everyone should watch this movie and laugh and smile because it had that effect on me.  Here ends my rant!",Raising Arizona
128,imagiking,Raising Arizona: Devoid of Humour,3,15 January 2011,"In the run up to the release of the eagerly anticipated True Grit, I thought it time to catch up with those Coen Brothers films I had yet to see. Made in their formative years, Raising Arizona is the second Coen film, following up the largely decent Blood Simple.In and out of prison for armed robbery a number of times over a period of some years, repeat offender ""Hi"" McDunnough begins to gradually fall for police photographer ""Ed"". After Hi vows to reform, they marry and decide to have children. Upon discovering the infertility of Ed, they opt to steal one of five babies born to local furniture salesman Nathan Arizona.Any film which numbers Nicolas Cage among its cast is a big risk for me. The man is one of those actors whose presence almost always signifies a terrible film to come. The combination of this bearing the Coen stamp and being the first Cage film I'd seen since Adaptation—in which he is, dare I say it, bearable—assuaged my fears and allowed me to sit back with hope intact. The film's opening is rapid in pace, though not too much of a fault: it's a little distracting, and feels a tad rushed, but it's no serious problem. The humour—for this is a comedy, in case you're unaware—starts relatively strong, an extended scene in which Hi attempts to control the quintuplets whilst choosing which to steal particularly humorous. Had the credits rolled immediately thereafter, I would've been happy. But they don't, alas. What follows is just over an hour of completely misguided humour, bare caricatures, and that most hated of ""comedy"" clichés: the parody of deep-South life. To call it an uncomfortable viewing experience would be an understatement, my eyes trained on the DVD player ""time elapsed"" display as my fingers drummed on the chair, waiting for it all to end. Other than in the first half hour, I genuinely don't think as much as a brief chuckle escaped my mouth. The characters are irritating, underdeveloped, uninteresting, and uninvolving (the bounty hunter biker caused me no end of sighs and wails of despair). I now remember, if you'll permit me something of a tangential thought, that I did in fact laugh twice: once each for Frances McDormand and John Goodman, both of whom are amongst the painfully few good things the film has to offer. Though that said, the scene wherein Goodman emerges from mud vexed me with its silly shouting. As if I wasn't disappointed and disgusted enough with the film as a whole, to return to things, the ending is utterly revolting garbage which attempts, in a most upsetting way, to sanitise what has gone before with paint-by-numbers sentiment. Simply infuriating.Raising Arizona, you may have noticed, was not quite for me. Almost entirely devoid of humour, characters, or any shred of likability, it is a welcome edition to the Nic Cage canon. I think it possible that I'd have hated this less were it not a Coen Brothers film—not, that is to say, that I'm the kind of person who decided that the brothers were the saviours of American cinema after seeing No Country for Old Men—simply that all I'd seen by them prior to this had been at least quite quite good. In summary, do try to avoid this.",Raising Arizona
129,thehumanduvet,Near-perfect manic surreal comedy,9,28 March 2000,"This was the first film by the amazing Coen brothers I ever saw, and it was a truly stunning experience, opening my eyes to so much more than I had ever thought possible...The Coens set out to make a slapstick, everyone-run-around-screaming comedy with all the depth, multi-layering and intertwining of visual and verbal imagery one would expect from a five-hundred-page classic novel. This hilarious movie, packed with a constant stream of sight-gags, one-liners and zany bit-parts, could almost be set in a crazy parallel world where everyone looks at things (and talks about them) just a little bit differently. Every part is played with zest and brilliance by a superb group of actors; the whole look and feel of the film is slightly kooky, a little too bright to seem real - the visual flair and style that the Coens have become famed for is already stunning in this early effort. Nick Cage was born for this part (and maybe Wild at Heart), as were Holly Hunter and Tex Cobb, and John Goodman is on the road to brilliance that would lead on to his truly amazing performances in Barton Fink and The Big Lebowski. If this film doesn't have you rolling with laughter and warmed all through, then...well, I suppose you just like a different kind of film.",Raising Arizona
130,blazesnakes9,One of the funniest comedies I've seen in a long time,8,13 August 2014,"When I first heard of Raising Arizona, I was 8 years old. I was spending a weekend with my dad and it was on a Friday night. Usually when I see a movie for the first time on television, I either direct my attention to the screen to see what it is or direct my attention to something that I was doing. I came in right in the middle of the movie and I didn't know what it was about and I certainly didn't understand the concept behind it. But, I do remember laughing and having a good time while watching this movie. Now, looking back on it, it still makes me laugh even harder and longer.The story centers around a convict/loser named H.I. McDunnough, (Nicholas Cage). His friends called him Hi. For the last several years, Hi has been robbing convenience stores and ending up in the slammer. After three times, Hi decides to go straight. He seeks the attraction of a pretty cop named Edwina ""Ed"" McDunnough, (Holly Hunter). Soon after, Hi and Ed get married. But, there's just one problem. They want to raise a family. So, the couple decides to keep trying. But according to a local gynecologist, Ed is infertile, meaning that she can't have kids. According to Hi's perspective, he can't ""plant his seed"" into Ed. Hopeless, the couple decides to steal one of the Arizona quints. One night, Hi and Ed steal one of the quints from a very wealthy businessman, (Sam McMurray), who owns a furniture store in Arizona.As the movie progresses, the humor starts to kick in when the local police and the F.B.I. conduct a manhunt on the missing quint. Meanwhile, two prisoners, (John Goodman and William Forsythe), escaped from prison and take shelter in Hi's home. But, the two prisoners want Hi to go along with them to pull off a heist. While that is going, another character comes walking into the story. An deranged and hellish lone motorcycle driver, (Randall 'Tex' Cobb), enters the story through Hi's dreams and his job is to find the quint and find the people who stole him. You can see that the movie is quite ambitious for its own kind. To tell you the truth, it is. This is the first comedy being made by the always entertaining movie-making duo, Joel and Ethan Coen. Their movies never ceased to amaze me. They have really carved out a reputation of movie- making with their witty scripts and their zany approach to a story. What surprises me is that this movie is actually their first comedy. Before the Coen brothers made Raising Arizona, they wrote and direct a very dark and violent neo-noir film, Blood Simple, which was released three earlier. This is quite surprising because Blood Simple was a very serious and sometimes bloody film that had a lot of twists and turns in it.Here, it's a change of pace. How they were to pull this one off is something that strikes me dumb. Watching the movie, I found myself laughing more than ever since I now understand the themes involved. One of the funniest scenes that I saw and it is the most significant one is when Cage's character robs a convenience store and disguised himself by putting pantyhose on his head. This plan doesn't since his wife leaves him behind, having him deal with the trigger-happy clerk and the police. The chase goes all over the place with Cage being chased by the clerk, the police and a pack of dogs. Even in the middle of the chase, Cage is even given a lift with an screaming hayseed driver. The way the chase sequence is shot makes it seems that the chase is being played as a cartoon. Maybe that's why the scene made me laugh the first time around. It's that sense of wacko humor that generates a laugh out of the audience. Not only the film's humor made me laugh, but toward the end of the movie, there's a bittersweet sense that ties the movie together with the characters trying hard to have a family.The writing by the brothers is very funny and even the performances by Cage, Hunter, Goodman and even Forsthye are excellent. I did believe that Nicholas Cage was really Hi. The fact that he sports a mustache and a dopey appearance when he is getting his mugshot done is very funny and also interesting. I'm not really a big fan of comedies because most of them are done pretty badly and never seem to hit me with their humor. That is true in today's movies. In today's movies, you can get away with everything. You can get a kick out of a audience that admired slapstick humor or bathroom humor. I understand that perspective. But, I enjoyed watching comedies that have funny dialogue in it. i believe that if you can make an audience laugh out loud with the dialogue, then that can be funny alone. The Coen brothers know how to generate a laugh out of the audience with their style of writing.Even in the today world, the Coen brothers are still going strong. Last year, they written and directed the Oscar-nominated picture, Inside Llewyn Davis. The brothers seem to really be shifting gears according to the genres. They can frightened you and tantalizes you with Blood Simple. They can make you laugh with Raising Arizona. They can compel you with Miller's Crossing. And they can jolt you with The Big Lebowski. I wonder what they're going to do next. ★★★ 1/2 3 1/2 stars.",Raising Arizona
131,kekca,My rating: 7,7,30 July 2013,"Honestly, I did not expect even the first Cohen brothers films to be really good. This one definitely is worth watching because the seriousness with which Cohen brothers make frivolous movies is best and this time.Busy throughout the film to make the foreground absurd or to the characters or to the situations in which they fall in, the two filmmakers get us into the world of attracting of opposites. Line from the movie, which can serve as an example here would be: ""If a frog had wings, it would hardly hitting the legs into the body when jumping."" In equally absurd way arises the love between a young policewoman and obsessive in robberies of shops criminal (collection of fools, as they point themselves).As she turns frigid, they decide to steal a child from a newly born five twins. And thus began the mess that does not stop until the end. The film is good for putting away bad mood and driving good one.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",Raising Arizona
132,ed_two_o_nine,Absolute Classic,9,6 January 2008,Wow this film just gets better with age. This is a classic movie which proves that script and character will always give you more than any amount of dollars thrown at a movie. This is classic Coen brothers' territory here. Great characters populating a simple yet effective story with a script to die for. The simple premise of the story is the couple of perennial petty criminal HI and police officer Ed who can not have a child so decide to steal one of the children of the wife of a local successful business man who has just had quintuplets. But that is only half the story we get introduced a multitude of magnificent quirky supporting chahrcters along the way who each bring something special to the movie including an early supporting role from the always superb Francis McDormand.) For me this along with 'Wild at Heart' is Nicolas Cage's two finest performances. He brings great aloofness and swagger to the character of HI (another great Coen brother's character name) and the Coens reciprocate Cage's performance by letting the camera love him. Cage is supported greatly by Holly Hunter with other great performances such as another Coen brother's favourite John Goodman. The film is superbly on what was clearly a small budget but that probably only enhances the overall quality of the move and if anything has aided the ageing process. This is a must for movie fans and a must own for Coen brothers fans,Raising Arizona
133,kyle_c,*** out of ****,7,24 September 2002,"Funny comedy by the Coen brothers about a couple (Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter), who kidnap a baby because they can't have one of their own captures the feel of a screwball comedy well.  It's flawed only in that it becomes a little bit too crazy and silly at times.  Great dialogue, if a little weird, with some hilarious moments.  Not as good as ""The Big Lebowski"", but still a solid effort.",Raising Arizona
134,R_O_U_S,Zany,8,19 January 2004,"Perhaps the least restrained movie the Coen Brothers have ever made, this is brimming with OTT performances and memorable sequences such as John Goodman being born from the Earth, the two leads falling in love over a police camera, and of course the baby in the road. Best of all, and the moment that sticks this movie firmly in my heart, is the bit where Randall ""Tex"" Cobb, as the biker from Hell, blows up a rabbit.",Raising Arizona
135,Det_McNulty,An Outrageously Whacky and Delightful Quintessential From The Coen Brothers,7,9 June 2007,"After the Coen's triumphant debut Blood Simple, the Coens returned to pursue their career as two of American cinema's finest talents. Raising Arizona is one of the many films which established the Coen's universal talent, proving that their debut was not a fluke, but a film which marked the career of two of independent cinema's geniuses. I cannot begin to stress just how good Raising Arizona really is.In tradition of the absurdity a Coen Brother film follows, Raising Arizona depicts turbulent chaos through quirky humour. Raising Arizona follows the adventure of a simple-minded, kind-hearted couple who are failing to have a baby due to their problematic circumstances. H.I. (played by Nicolas Cage) is an escaped convict, but he feels to have learnt the error of his ways while jumping in and out of prison for his harmless, yet failed hold-ups. He meets Edwina (Holly Hunter), a neurotic and somewhat overwhelming police-officer, who marries H.I. after he is released from prison. On finding that Edwina is infertile the couple op in for adoption, sadly adoption also fails due to H.I.'s prison record. So, the desperate pair resolve the matter by kidnapping one of a furniture tycoon's quintuplets. Havoc ensues.Yes, Raising Arizona is loud, eccentric, sensational and overwhelming, but it all helps to make it such a remarkably entertaining film. It is rare that a film is able to balance such a variation in contrast around practically every element. The pure joy which can be gained when viewing this often turbulent, yet charming ride helps to personify cinematic enjoyment. Propelled by its fast-paced, character-driven script Raising Arizona does not stop for breathing space. Basically, The Coens set themselves a narrative target and they then let the film run on this ""invincible fuel"" of technical prowess. The free-spirited imagination and wit makes Raising Arizona an unforgettable experience.The technical side of Raising Arizona is just as strong as its narrative. For example, the quick-fire, clean-cut, smooth editing gives the film a vibrant edge of insane comedy. The nifty set-pieces are highly creative too, designed with an expert knowledge of a comedic environment. I am a huge fan of slapstick comedy, which successfully blends tones of surrealism.For an actor who is usually horribly wooden, Nicolas Cage gives -what I consider- his superlative performance. He shows understanding of the script, creating a character that is blissfully unaware of his surroundings, while still being emotionally complex. In fact, I would go so far as to say that Nicholas Cage brings an outstanding level of panache to his performance. Plus, there is a wildly lavish amount of chemistry between both Cage and Hunter.Raising Arizona is an innocent film from The Coen Brothers, which remains something that almost anyone is bound to fall in love with. I cannot begin stress as to how much I recommend you watch Raising Arizona, no doubt you will be thoroughly entertained.",Raising Arizona
136,paulo20,The only film where I like Nick Cage,9,6 February 1999,"I don't really like Nick Cage in any movie except Raising Arizona (and perhaps Kiss Of Death).  Maybe it's just that his character is uninteresting to me, I don't know.  But that's not a problem with RA.  Cage plays a great character and plays him very well.  He's a regular joe everyman who only wants to raise a family though he's apparently willing to go any length to do that, along with his wife (played by an equally flawless Holly Hunter). It's a role that Cage plays with sensitivity and a sort of quirkiness.  I can't imagine any other actor playing this part.  But not only does this film have a great performance by Cage, it also boasts the arguably best film performance by John Goodman.  Just about everybody in this film has a certain charm, especially the cute little baby.",Raising Arizona

139,dissident320,Not a masterpiece but very funny,7,30 June 2017,"I'm not a die-hard Coen brothers fan but I've watched and enjoyed the majority of their movies. This being one of their early ones, it was neat to finally watch it. From the start, it's apparent that they're going for a much more slapstick and visual humour than their later comedies like 'The Big Lebowski or 'Intolerable Cruelty'. Nicolas Cage is surprisingly restrained in this early role playing a lower than average intelligence 'repeat offender' robber. For me, I found John Goodman to be the highlight of this movie. Not only does he get some of the best visual gags, it feels like he knows how goofy the movie is and is just having fun with the role. But really, the visuals are the highlight of this movie. Barry Sonnenfeld was the cinematographer (Who would go on to direct) has plenty of fantastic tracking shots and cameras attached to motorcycles that really helps the movie stay exciting and fun throughout. The humour has aged quite well, the only thing I noticed is that it had a rather cute ending compared to a lot of their later comedies. Still definitely worth a watch, even without Nic going 'Full-Cage'.",Raising Arizona

Every single time it gets me. I laughed uncontrollably to the point where I was scaring my wife. Maybe it was the music for the scene that did it to me. Absolutely hilarious.""Raising Arizona"" is a quirky, upbeat comedy crafted with great care by the Coen brothers. Some of the funniest scenes of any movie that I can think of come from this movie. I did not see it when it came out, and didn't even see it on video immediately when it did. I feel I missed out for quite a while. Perhaps without the success of ""Fargo"" and my fondness for ""The Hudsucker Proxy"", I might've missed out altogether.Nicolas Cage is just incredibly funny as a convicted felon trying to walk the straight and narrow, as his loving wife, Holly Hunter, also putting forth a great performance, demands that he do. All the other cast members put forth a performance that any director would be privileged to receive.I've seen all of the Coen brothers films, and this one is definitely worth checking out if you're a fan or not. Watch this film until the title credits appear, and if you're not drawn in by then, you may never be, which would be a shame, because you'll miss out on a great film.",Raising Arizona
141,RaiderJack,A Comedy Classic!!!!,8,21 May 2007,"This is the first Coen outing I ever remember seeing ...This is a wonderful piece of off-the-wall comedy for virtually all tastes which strangely enough has very real family values shrouded in the most absurd situation. In a nutshell, it follows the attempt of a strangely matched couple, gloriously realized in Nicholas Cage and Holly Hunter, who because of her inability to conceive, decide to steal one of a set of quintuplets because ""they had more than they could handle."" Both Cage and Hunter have gone on to become huge stars but it is wonderful to see them so long ago in such an affectionate comedy. Of course John Goodman gives a signature performance and since then I have made it a point to see all of the Coen Brothers productions and rarely have I been disappointed. Trey Wilson is just great as the father of the quintuplets and the dialog is superb. Frances McDormand is hilarious as a ""swinger"" and her husband is flawless as the typical redneck with a horrible sense of humor. This is truly a regional comedy and I have watched this with friends who were not from the South, finding myself having to explain just what they meant by a certain phrase at a certain time... The counseling session with the prisoners in the beginning is a stitch. Forget critics who referred to this as a ""flaky"" comedy. Makes you wonder just what standard they were working from. No matter. The most important thing is your reaction to it and what you tend to get out of it which, I strongly suspect, is the secret to the Coen Brothers' success. In any event, this is a worthy addition to any movie collection and you will enjoy this over and over and over again!",Raising Arizona
142,audrablum,Enjoyable and visually exciting,8,31 March 2019,"This week I watched the crime comedy Raising Arizona (1987). The logline reads ""When a childless couple of an ex-con and an ex-cop decide to help themselves to one of another family's quintuplets, their lives become more complicated than they anticipated."" Naturally, it has all the impressions of a Coen brothers' film. There are larger than life characters, plenty of suspense, and the classic cinematography that Joel and Ethan are known for. The story had me from the beginning when H.I. starts propositioning Ed. I thought, there's no way a cop could ever fall for a con. From there I was hooked. The movie was interesting, light-hearted, and well told. I feel like I haven't seen the crime genre married to the comedy drama very often, and I found it to be an interesting combination that worked really well for this story. Although, the writing in this story was compelling, I wouldn't necessarily say it is my favorite thing that the Coen brothers' have produced. To me, what really made this film was the actors' performances. Tom Hanks was great in the lead role, but I think it was Holly Hunter who really stole the show as the bright-eyed love-interest who ended up being the catalyst to the whole plot. I was actually also impressed with how much screen time the baby had. Working with children can be challenging and I was impressed with how many types of shots that were pulled off with the baby. The cinematography, as one expects in a Coen brothers' film was on point. There were many exciting camera angles and shots that kept me watching. Overall, I enjoyed this film and would recommend it to others.",Raising Arizona

All 4 of my 20-30ish sons can recite the lines verbatim and we play it at least once every Christmas when we're all together... because it truly is a family-holiday film. The 2 other movies we play are ""..Wonderful Life"" and ""Christmas Vacation"". Does that give you a hint?I wont go into what others have already said here, other than to say that I wholly agree with the laudatory superlatives.The only puzzling thing to me are the few comments that disparage this classic Coen Bros effort..

145,jlacerra,Perhaps the funniest film ever made,10,4 August 2001,"Raising Arizona may be the funniest film ever made!   From the off-beat way the Cage-Hunter couple meet, to the distressingly hilarious kidnapping scene, to the side-splitting chase scene repleat with dogs, cops, insane grocery clerks, and a package of Huggies.  It has its touching moments, such as HI composing his goodbye note, and the couple's return to the Arizona nursery.Menace and suspense is provided by Randall Cobb's biker/baby-dealer.  Icing the cake is John Goodman and William Forsythe as bumbling prison escapees and would-be bank robbers.  However, the serious and touching elements are proportioned throughout, just enough to give counterpoint to the almost constant humor that is present in the visuals and dialog alike.  And, believe it or not, the movie manages to remain intelligent and satirical; it can be enjoyed by all age groups.  This is a funny, funny picture, with great performances by all, especially Cage and Trey Wilson.  
I'm shocked that this masterpiece is absent from IMDB's Top 50 Comedies!
Two thumbs way, way up!!!",Raising Arizona
146,h_sarp,Enjoyable,6,19 October 2020,This film is the first example of Coen's humor and bares great resemblance to their later films such as Big Lebowski and No Country for Old Men. It is also their trademark storytelling where several less than intelligent characters form a chain of events which are resolved through chance and coincidences.,Raising Arizona
147,hou-3,Terribly disappointing after Blood Simple,2,15 April 2018,"I find it hard to believe this awful movie followed Blood Simple. In that film every scene is brilliantly written, acted and shot. In this film, by contrast, virtually every scene misfires. The relationship between Cage and Hunter is implausible and Cage's silly hair quickly becomes irritating. The kidnapping and everything that follows is gauche and mediocre. The Big Lebowski and Barton Fink are among my favourite movies so it's not as if I don't enjoy the Coen brothers' sense of humour. Indeed, the problem is the absence of anything genuinely funny. But then the Coens are nothing if not inconsistent, witness Burn after Reading and Hail Caesar.",Raising Arizona
148,serafinogm,An early Coen Brothers offering that trumpets more to come!,10,12 October 2015,"It is truly amazing how few movies are made that exist as vehicles for just pure viewing pleasure (without shocking the senses), for one to get lost in the moment and forget the grim realities of existence! Raising Arizona is such a vehicle. Tour de force performances by the cast; Cage, Goodman, Hunter, Wilson (RIP), Forsythe, Randall Tex Cobb, the whole cast really, not a weak offering to be found. Clever, entertaining, funny, and if you separate your viewings by a few years it will fulfill your entertainment needs all over again. Screenplay was spot on and it was a pure joy to sit through. I saw the Coen Brothers first offering (Blood Simple) and although it showed promise (I would not recommend it) it was surpassed by leaps and bounds by 'Raising Arizona'. I thoroughly recommend this offering!",Raising Arizona
149,someokiedude,"A Living, Breathing Cartoon",10,7 April 2020,"It is here where The Coen Brothers began to come into their own and the film that introduced some of the tropes that would eventually seep into the rest of their filmography: unusual, strange side characters, forces of violence and mayhem that have no explanation, and absurdist, off kilter comedy combined with genuine suspense. This film is certainly a comedy first, but it also works as a crime thriller, and it also works as a story.You would think that Nicolas Cage being paired with The Coen Brothers would be a dream pairing, considering the mutual eccentricity that befalls both parties. But apparently things were tense between the three, as while the three were friendly to each other, Cage's knack for improvisation often conflicted with the Coen's main plan for what they wanted with the film. The relationship with Randall 'Tex' Cobb, who played the antagonist Leonard Smalls, was also tense throughout the making of the film, to the point where The Coens swore never to work with Cobb again. But despite all of the tension that was on set, the film turned out to be a remarkable feat in comedic storytelling, and I actually prefer this far and wide over their cult hit The Big Lebowski. As good as The Big Lebowski is, I found Raising Arizona to be far more charming and strange in its execution. There are so many moments that are ingrained into my memory and so many quotable lines that come from this film that my family and I quote to each other to this very day.Raising Arizona also has some of the most inventive and creative cinematography that I've ever seen in film. While it doesn't have the polish of some of their later films such as No Country For Old Men, A Serious Man, or Fargo, they make up for it with creativity and eccentricity. You can say that you may have seen really good looking films, but none can ever say that you've ever seen a movie that's as creatively shot as Raising Arizona is. It's fast, expressive, and exaggerated. The way that the shots play into the physical comedy is just masterful, and I adore how exaggerated everything is. It also plays into one of the finest chase scenes ever put to film, there's never been a film where a chase scene has been so tense, creative, and hilarious all at the same time. The exaggeration that the film shows throughout the runtime earns its title as, how Simon Pegg put it, a living breathing Looney Toons cartoon.The acting should not go understated either. Despite the creative differences, Nicolas Cage gives one of his finest performances as the good natured, though dim-witted HI McDunnough. I've often championed Cage as a capable, gifted actor, as he's suffered the fate of being type cast as that oddball guy, though he has given some fantastic performances in films such as Leaving Las Vegas or Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans. Though I wouldn't say that he acts against the type as the misunderstood oddball, Cage brings his usual eccentric charm into the role of HI and steals the scene in most of the scenes that he finds himself in. Holly Hunter is also great as the stern, but still good hearted Ed, and she's probably the most sympathetic and compassionate person of the film. I love the chemistry between Holly Hunter and Nicolas Cage that seeps into their performances throughout the movie, as you really buy into their relationship and that they really do love each other and have each others backs. Other scene stealers would be John Goodman and William Forsythe as the incompetent criminal duo Gale and Evelle, I don't know but I just find people who yell incoherently to be hilarious for some reason, but they also bring a likable charm to their characters despite the fact that they're a couple of lowlife criminals. Tex Cobb, despite being a bit flat in his performance, successfully brings an aura of intimidation and is the source of most of the tension and suspense that befalls the film while also being charming in some bits as much as the rest of the cast is.This was the first film where Joel and Ethan showed that they could combine suspense and oddball comedy seamlessly, and in my opinion it is their best one out of the bunch. Raising Arizona is a gift that keeps on giving and a film that I doubt that I'll ever forget.",Raising Arizona
150,kickstand,now-classic gem,9,28 February 2000,"This film has pretty much reached cult classic status for its outlandish ""shakycam"" cinematography (can you believe it's by Barry Sonnenfeld?) and witty dialogue.

151,talkymeat,You HAVE To See This Movie!,10,20 August 2009,"This movie is without a doubt one of the finest comedies ever made. I know you probably think it looks weird, but believe me you will be pleasantly surprised.Raising Arizona centers around HI, a multiple felon, and Edwina ""Ed"", a highly decorated cop, who met while she was taking pictures of felons in prison. When they find that they can't have a baby the natural way, they kidnap one of the nine kids of a famous furniture tycoon. HI and Ed must try and raise the baby while the cops are looking for the baby, two of HI's escaped felon friends move in, and a bounty hunter is hot on their trail.This movie has one of the funniest collections of characters I have ever seen. Every single character is well acted, interesting, and funny in their own way. Even Nicolas Cage, in his only exceptional performance, adds a lot to the movie.Much like other Coen comedies, Big Lebowski/O Brother, this also has a very interesting and complex plot. Many intertwining plot points as well as an amazingly thoughtful end for a comedy. Raising Arizona also has a lot of off-the-wall comedy which really appeals to me. The entire convenience story robbery/chase scene is comedy gold.So in summation, Rasising Arizona is one of the most underrated comedies of all time and is a must see for Coen fans or just fans of film.",Raising Arizona
152,ashi-lance,Raising Arizona'87,9,7 February 2013,"Criminal Herbert I. ""Hi"" (Nicolas Cage) after his continued visits to a prison happens to marry Edwina ""Ed"" after his latest release from prison. Soon the couple discovers that Ed is not fit to be a mother and are unable to adopt a baby due to Ed's Criminal record. So they decide to kidnap one of the Quints of a local furniture magnate ""Nathan Arizona"" believing it to be Nathan Jr. Problems arouse as Hi is visited by his prison buddies and he thinks of returning to his notorious lifestyle along with his supervisor discovering that kid is not his after he made an unsuccessful wife swapping offer to him. Matters get worse as a bounty hunter named Leo Smalls gets in search of Nathan Jr. to sell him in the market and Hi's buddies taking undue advantage of junior's identity. Do watch this early Coen Bros. movie because of some great comic scenes especially the scene where Hi steals a pack of diapers and it is one of those movies that gives us the insight into the kind of characters the duo generates, dialogues they write and unconventional music score that became symbolic for their future movies.MY RATING: 9/10",Raising Arizona
153,ClassicAndCampFilmReviews,"""They GOT more than they can handle!""",10,30 August 2005,"""Raising Arizona"" is one of what I consider to be the five instantly classic films by the team of Ethan and Joel Coen, the others being ""Blood Simple"", ""Fargo"", ""Oh Brother Where Are Thou"", and ""The Big Lebowski"". But ""Raising Arizona"" is my personal favorite, and probably the most quotable films I have ever seen, with some of the best dialogue ever written for film. The story in brief: H.I. (Nicholas Cage) and ""Ed"" (Holly Hunter, in one of my favorite roles of hers) portray, respectively, an ex-con and a cop who meet when he keeps getting arrested for robbing convenience stores. They fall in love, get married, decide that ""there is just too much love"" between them, and they need a ""critter to share it with"". Upon finding that ""Edwina's insides were a rocky place"" where H.I.'s ""seed could find no purchase"", they try to adopt, but are turned down because of H.I.'s record. Then they read in the newspaper about local unpainted furniture storeowner Nathan Arizona (Trey Wilson), owner of ""Unpainted Arizona"", and his wife having quintuplets as a result of fertility pills, and who joke that ""They got more than they can handle"". The couple hatch a plan to take one of the babies and raise it as their own. What results is an ongoing, fast-paced, hilarious set of misadventures, complicated by the appearance of a ruthless, heartless outlaw named Leonard Smalls (Randall ""Tex"" Cobb) Nathan Arizona hires to find the missing baby, and two felon friends from H.I.'s past (John Goodman and William Forsythe), who make a childbirth-like escape from prison. Sam McMurray (the smarmy dad in ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"") is H.I.'s....smarmy boss, Glen. Frances McDormand (real-life spouse of Joel Coen, and star of other Coen films such as ""Blood Simple"" and ""Fargo"") is his excitable wife Dot. M. Emmet Walsh (""Blood Simple"") has a scenery-chewing cameo role as H.I.'s talkative co-worker.When Ed finally opens up her 5'2"" can of Southern-fried whup-ass, throwing her badge to the dirt, striding towards Leonard Smalls as she bellows with all her might, ""Gimme back that baby, you warthog from HELL!!!"" I always fling my arms up and shout ""You go girl! Kick his ass!"" And the way Hunter cries is hilarious.Holly Hunter was great in this role, as one would expect. She's a very talented actress, in both serious and comedic roles.Nicholas Cage and Holly Hunter made a great on screen couple, Cage with his hair standing out in every direction, looking like a hapless, browbeaten puppy half of the time, and Hunter as his diminutive firecracker of a wife who loves him and tries to keep him honest (oh yeah except for that little kidnapping excursion). I could go on and on about this film but suffice to say that so far I haven't met anyone who didn't find ""Raising Arizona"" hilarious. And as any great Coen brothers film, it has a certain mythic quality that's hard to describe, but is present all of of the brothers' best efforts. When I was single, I often used Coen brothers films as a barometer of sorts for prospective boyfriends. For instance, I remember seeing ""Fargo"" on a first date, and when we came out of the theater, the guy (whose name I have since forgotten anyway) remarked ""Huh, I didn't think much of that"", while I was thinking how blown away I was by the film! I immediately thought to myself ""So much for him! This relationship won't last long.""For more great Coen comedy, check out ""Oh Brother Where Art Thou"" (2000), which is loosely based on Homer's epic poem ""The Odyssey"". Another great Coen comedy is ""The Big Lebowski"" (1998), which also includes my favorite singer/songwriter Aimee Mann in a brief cameo, and boasts a cult following that has resulted in an annual ""Lebowskifest"" for fans of the film.""Blood Simple"" (1984) is probably my favorite film noir modern-day classic tale of lust and betrayal, and is my personal second-favorite Coen brothers film. ""Fargo"" (1996), which won the Screen writing Oscar, and an Oscar for Frances McDormand, is another must-see Coen classic.",Raising Arizona
154,moviekid-2,the coens at their funniest,10,2 July 2001,"I haven't seen this movie for a while but I loved it and I thought it was the most funniest movie that I have ever seen. All of the cast members in this film give excellent performances, especially by Holly Hunter. The Coen Brothers managed to make a feel-good movie after Blood Simple and they have succeeded in doing it. I LOVE THE COEN BROTHERS! I love them! I have seen all of their films and they are masterpieces. The funniest thing about the Coen Brothers is that they have a huge portal in their head and once you get inside of it, you can never get out and you see all these weird images in their head that they put in their movies like this one. Also, one of the great aspects of this film is the cinematography which was flat out great. This movie is the one for you. Recommended.10 out of 10",Raising Arizona
155,davidholmesfr,When comedy turns desperate,6,21 May 2002,"About a third of the way through this film it seems that the writers suddenly realised that they had created a story which would be difficult to sustain as comedy. After all, kidnapping a baby is hardly a laughing matter, although the execution of the crime was played with humour. But where to go once the baby is settled into its new `family'? Yes, there might have been a few laughs to be had with Hi struggling to come to terms with fatherhood, but beyond that?So enter, stage below, a couple of escaped convicts and the rabbit hunter from Hell, this latter character appearing to belong to some parallel dimension. And suddenly the sub-plots become the core of the story with all the characters becoming increasingly frenetic. So the humour, of a sort, is restored but at the expense of any belief in the storyline or the characters. The only characters who might have saved this were Dot and Glen, the friends from Hell with their malevolent brood of what just about passed as children, and Nathan Arizona himself who was probably the best of all. The latter's comment towards the end about paying the reward in unpainted furniture as an alternative to the promised cash was one of the truly comic moments in a film which became increasingly dependent on outrageous visual jokes such as the exit, stage top, of said rabbit hunter. Inventive and well photographed as it is, just because it's a Coen Brothers film does not automatically elevate it to a pedestal  other than perhaps for knocking it down.",Raising Arizona

157,SanTropez_Couch,Coens' at their most charming,7,3 April 2003,"The Coen's second movie has an innocence that makes it endearing, especially to a non-Coen fan. (I am one, I'm just saying for those haters out there.) The language takes a joy in itself and is very Coen-esque, although overall I was left with the feeling more of Sam Raimi. Some camera moments are like ""Blood Simple,"" like when a dude on a motorcycle drives over a car (directly reminiscent of that camera rising above a body on the bar in ""Blood Simple"") or those energetic, rapid steadicam shots that are lifted from Raimi.It's a charming, guilt-free comedy at no one's expense (unlike the mean-spiritedness and superior snobbery of films like ""Fargo,"" where Jonathan Rosenbaum dubbed Frances McDormand's character the Coens' ""pet hick""). It's shameless slapstick.When Cage (the ex-con) and Hunter (the ex-cop) get hitched, they decide to snatch one of Nathan Arizona's little quintets; after all five is much too much for one family. The two get attached to little Nathan Jr., and Cage (his name is ""H.I.,"" as in Hudsucker Industries) has these two buddies (John Goodman and a porky, hilarious William Forsythe), escaped convicts almost literally burped out of the ground, that have their eyes set on Nathan Jr. as well.Cage is wacky and offbeat, a young, virtually unknown at the time the film was made (probably still trying to shake off the nasal Gumbi accent from ""Peggy Sue Got Married""). He's still got that renegade actor quality to him, that over-the-topness that's not quite honed enough, but it fits the material perfectly.The film is in the tradition of their goofball charmers like ""The Big Lebowski"" and ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" -- not as hilarious as the first, and not as episodically plotted (or clever) as the second.The pleasures here are in the innocent sight gags and dialogue -- Cage's grungy, just-about-mullet and mustache, Goodman's sideburns, Frances McDormand's quick appearance as a white trash wife to Cage's boss. Then there's this oil-covered, apocalyptic bounty hunter intent on collecting the reward for the stolen baby.By the time the movie's over (it's a quick 90 or so minutes), a baby's been stolen, some animals have been shot, a man's been attacked by dogs, some people have been shot at, and someone held a grenade too long -- and it's the Coens' most innocent movie to date. You could almost say it's tender and sweet.***",Raising Arizona
158,richievee,A Total Waste of Time,1,21 October 2018,"As a general rule, I like the Coen Brothers' movies very much, but this one is embarrassingly bad. Nary a laugh from beginning to end, with all of the characters screaming throughout any tense situation that may arise in the heavy-handed script. Explosions galore, with tiresome chase scenes that defy the laws of physics. John Goodman is the only likable figure to be seen. Holly Hunter is cute and tries hard, but the writing is insurmountable, even for her. If you want a brilliant Coen Brothers comedy, look no further than the wonderful THE HUDSUCKER PROXY, which is pure cinematic gold.",Raising Arizona
159,Diego_rjc,The Coen Brothers were just as good in 1987 as they are today,9,28 January 2010,"Back in 1987, the Coen Brothers weren't as well-known as they are today. Back then, they only had made the 1984's 'Blood Simple.', an extremely low-budget, but promising film, that showed all the talent they had. 'Raising Arizona' is only their second movie, and in my opinion, just as good as their movies today. This movie was also low-budget, but it did well in the box-office and putted they on the Hollywood spotlight. When 'Raising Arizona' starts, even if you don't know what is it about, you realize in the same minute it's a Coen Brothers' film. All the elements of their movies are here - extremely eccentric characters, very smart dialogs and an absurd story, with lots of absurd situations. The movie begins with H.I (Nicolas Cage) narrating how he, an ex-con, met his wife, Ed, an ex-cop. This sequence takes about 10 minutes of smart and funny images, and then the titles are shown. After this, they try to get pregnant, to only find out that Ed can't have babies, so they both try to steal a baby from a couple that had five of them. I though, by watching the movie, that I knew where this was going to, but believe me, I didn't. Ethan and Joel Coen write an unpredictable and crazy script, with even more better characters appearing on screen.When 'Raising Arizona' came out, its two leads, Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter weren't famous at all, he had only been in his uncle's (Francis Ford Coppola) pictures, and she did inexpressive films. So this movie helped them to turn into stars, and it also shows their excellent comic vein. The supporting cast has names like John Goodman and Frances McDormand, two actors that would become regulars on the Coen Brothers' films, both doing a nice job. William Forsythe is also brilliant, so is Randall 'Tex' Cobb, in one of the most funny character I've ever seen in a Coen Brothers' movie.Joel Coen does an excellent job directing this picture. The already- funny situations become even more funny with his brilliant direction. The scene where H.I. tries to steal a diaper is simply one of the most funny and well-directed sequences I've seen in a long time. The Coen Brothers are also famous for their work of editing, and it isn't different in this one.Overral, this is a extremely funny and absurd movie. It showed the Coen Brothers, Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter to the world. Of course this isn't better then the Coen's masterpieces ('Fargo', 'The Big Lebowski' and 'No Country for Old Men'), but it's an excellent picture that has everything that a Coen Brothers' fan need - smart dialogs, eccentric characters and absurd situations. A must-see for any comedy fan.9/10",Raising Arizona

Quirky cast of character,surreal sequence and goofy scenes makes it memorable. You got young Hi (Nicholas Cage),an ex-con and Ed(Holly Hunter) ,an ex- cop .As odds even out they both marry each other which is the most interesting thing. Incapable of giving birth to a baby ,and Hi's past stops them from adopting any. Ed breaks down and find an illegal way to get a baby ,and that is.....stealing it from the owner of biggest unpainted furniture owner in Arizona. That's the whole plot ahead,the idiosyncratic characters and dialogues and the situations they get in. It is replete with these funny slapstick situations and deft camera-work which seems really entertaining. John Goodman and William Forsythe as two criminal and fugitive brothers are really funny and good. The character of Leonard smalls is very well written and it is like hound slash killing machine which can track anything. Shooting rabbits through the desert it gets in the way of Hi and Ed ,the way it has being depicted is amazing. Highlight of the movie is undoubtedly the climax ,filled with soaring emotions and pathos generated narrative.

163,icfarm,"""Son, you got a panty on your head . . . """,10,18 September 2007,"Hilarious! Two then-unknowns, Nicholas Cage and Holly Hunter - both future award-winners, and deservedly so - play the most unlikely of couples. Cage is Hi, an ""armed"" (I use quotation marks because he normally makes sure the gun he carries is not really loaded) convenience-store robber. Upon being arrested, he meets a lovely little police officer named Ed (Hunter) and does not let the circumstances stop him from flirting with her (""What kind of name is Ed for a pretty thing like you?"" Her answer: ""Short for Edwina. Turn to the RIGHT!) Upon the occasion of his second arrest, he notices that his Officer Ed has clearly been crying. She reveals to him that her fiancée has dumped her for another woman, and he responds by calling her ex a ""fool"" for leaving her. Hi serves his time and meets other inmates including a trustee (I assume) who simply growls at him as he passes by and two other convicted armed robbers/brothers (John Goodman and William Forsythe; these guys are geniuses at casting). Upon his release, He and Ed are married (""Okay, then"", says the pastor who performs the ceremony after they say their I-do's). But something is wrong in paradise. You see, Ed BADLY wants to have a child - or children - and after some time trying to conceive on their own, they decide to see a doctor, who gives them the news that Ed is infertile. Upon trying to adopt, they are rejected because of Hi's, as Ed herself puts it, ""checkered"" past. But then, they see on television that a local millionaire furniture-store owner who goes by the name Nathan Arizona and his wife have just had a set of quintuplets due to the wife's use of fertility drugs. Rationalizing that it won't be so bad to take one baby from a couple who already have four others, they proceed to kidnap one of the tots (Nathan Junior, they think) and bring him home.But of course, complications ensue. You see, our two brother-convicts have escaped, and who do they seek out? None other than their prison buddy Hi. Needless to say, Ed is not thrilled with this turn of events. Meanwhile, Hi has lost his job due to beating up his boss (after said boss, while at their house for a barbecue, tells him that he and his wife are ""swingers"" and wants to know if Hi would ever consider ""wife-swappin"".) Hi cannot bring himself to tell Ed that he lost his job for ""defending her honor"", and this causes tension between the two. So much so that, although he has turned down a chance to join in a bank heist with the escaped-con brothers, he decides to rob a convenience store he goes into with the intention of getting diapers for the nipper (which he does, just before he pulls an unloaded gun on the clerk and orders him to empty the till). Seeing what he is doing, Ed decides to leave him there, driving off and taking the baby with her. Meanwhile, it turns out the teenage, braces-wearing clerk has a (loaded) gun of his own, and has no qualms about using it. There follows a chase scene that must be seen to be believed. The words ""fall on the floor funny"" come to mind. Ed finally shows up, picks up Hi, and they retrieve the diapers, which had been abandoned on the road somewhere along the way.The Arizonas, in the meantime, have troubles of their own besides a missing baby. You see, a bounty hunter (Randall ""Tex"" Cobb) has shown up and promised to find the child. But he is not satisfied with what they have officially offered as a reward and threatens to sell the baby on the black market if they do not agree to his price.Poor Hi, meanwhile, has to deal with his outraged boss (the ""swinger"") who shows up at his trailer again to officially fire him. But that's not all, folks - he has figured out the baby's true identity for himself, and wants the baby for himself and his wife (who seems to have a baby obsession; she wants another as soon as the youngest one they have is ""too big to cuddle""). But the brother-cons overhear this and decide to kidnap the baby for the reward. Hi, of course, refuses to let Nathan Junior (he thinks) go without a fight, but he loses. The brother-cons take the baby and attempt their bank heist. But they decide to take the baby into the bank with them and then forget to put him back in the the car as they make their escape. Upon discovering they have forgotten him, they scream - and then scream some more when a cannister of blue paint that was put in their bag along with the money from the bank explodes.It all leads up to a final confrontation between the bounty hunter, Hi, and Ed. I won't give anything else away, just say that this is one of the funniest, most original films I have ever seen. Cheers.",Raising Arizona
164,ArmsAndMan,Listening to Arizona,7,5 January 2006,"After being wowed by Blood Simple, I thought this movie was a let down. When I first saw it, I couldn't understand how the Coen Brothers could stumble so quickly. The comedy in Blood Simple was absurdist, not cartoonish. Then along comes this extended, live action Chuck Jones cartoon, but without the verve.Last weekend, though, I had the chance to reconsider. Joel's hyperactive Steadicam hijinks really distract from Ethan's sly dialogue. OK, it may still be as silly as a Warner Bros. cartoon, but the biggest laughs often come from what people say, and when the say it.Try turning off the image and listening to this movie. It ain't Preston Sturges, but at least it knows what to aim for.Some of my favorites: ""Hi, you get on up there and get us a toddler. You know them people got more than they can handle!"" ""Sometimes a man has to put career before family."" ""You got any funny shaped balloons?"" ""Well, if you think round is funny.""""Sir, do you think your child's disappearance may be a UFO abduction?""

165,zaremskya-23761,Hilarious and Wild,10,16 February 2017,"This film is excellent. The Cohen Bros put together a motley assortment of characters to form a spectacular cast. The premise of the film is wild and out of control, leading to the kookiest of hijinks that put the characters in a host of trouble all the way through.The theft of a baby to replace a barren womb sounds unfeasible to most, and indeed, the execution of, and results of said action are remarkably absurd. Lives become intertwined in the perilous events of the film, and the C. Bros are able to balance the ludicrous aspects of the film with somber, thoughtful dialogue and insightful philosophical musings from the characters, which makes the return to the wild action all the more hilarious.The C Bros have just begun in their careers, but already they have cemented their place in greatness with this spectacular Southern romp. It's sharp, fast-paced, and witty with insane chase scenes, nutty characters and just all out fun. Terrific film.",Raising Arizona
166,cinema_lover97,Worth your time,8,18 August 2020,"The hilarious opening montage and the accompanying monologue by Nicolas Cage establishing his thug life, and finding his wife was perfect in every way. It also had the funniest response to a question I have ever heard.
'Why do you say you feel trapped in a man's body?'
'Well, sometimes I get the menstrual cramps real hard.'This film was hilarious, the dialogues were original, the acting was fabulous, and the direction by Joel Coen was creative and tight. The oddball comedy and characters were refreshing. I was smiling throughout the whole movie, but the Huggies chase sequence made me crack up with laughter. The film was filled with so many quotable dialogues, it was insane.The introduction of the warthog biker was so good, he first reminded me of Ghost Rider which later Nicolas Cage portrayed on screen. The police and the FBI questioning Nathan Arizona in his home, the fight between John Goodman and Nicolas Cage, the bank robbery, and the maniacal AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH of John Goodman, who could forget that? and other moments will forever remain in my memory.Nicolas Cage portrayed the oddball character of H.I. McDunnough fantastically. Holly Hunter was remarkable, the same goes for John Goodman, William Forsythe, everyone was incredible in their roles. Loved the cameo of M. Emmet Walsh as a joke-cracking co-worker. The yodeling made the already wonderful Huggies chase sequence so much better. The cinematography and the editing tremendously improved coming from Blood Simple. but, also retained the magic of the previous film.This is a kind of film that I will never mind revisiting at least once every year.",Raising Arizona
167,Ink789,A masterpiece,10,24 July 2019,"It's tough to explain how much this film meant when it came out in 1987. There just wasn't anything else like it, and it has withstood the test of time. More than just my favorite Coen Brother's film, it is likely my favorite film period for how original and fun it was at the time it came out. I know there are other masters of the craft out there, but I can watch this movie over and over, and it never gets old. The Deer Hunter and Midnight Express are exceptional films, but they don't lend themselves well to joyful repeat viewings. The Big Lebowski is outstanding as well, but the narrative arch is more satisfying in Raising Arizona, and I think the laughs are just as plentiful, if not more. A modern masterpiece!",Raising Arizona

The opening sequence leading up to the opening credits is as near perfect a bit of film-making as you will ever see - explaining the recent history of Hi (Nicolas Cage) and Ed (Holly Hunter) in a series of visually stunning scenes with the laconic, rolling narration of H.I. himself... then the film starts!Love-story, kidnapping, prison escape, car-chases, bank robbery, cute babies, gunfights, The Biker Of The Apocalypse - no-one but the Coen brothers would have even attempted to make a film like this. Holly Hunter is superb, and Nicolas Cage pitches his performance perfectly to undercut the mass over-acting going on around him and serve as the eye of the storm for the story. Beautifully shot - it must be seen in wide-screen to appreciate fully. God bless the Coen brothers!",Raising Arizona

170,daniel-ambia,The best from the best,10,20 January 2007,"Raising Arizona has the best opening montauge possibly in the history of cinema. I have seen this movie about forty times and each time it gets better. It's the story of a useless repeat offender serial convict named HI (played brilliantly by a 23 year old Nicholas Cage) who falls in love with a police officer he keeps running into at central booking. After his final stint in prison HI decides he wants to settle down so he proposes to Ed while she's taking his fingerprints. They move into a trailer, he gets a job and they try to start a family. Unfortunately Ed is unable to reproduce and because of HI's checkered past the two are unable to adopt. As their relationship begins to deteriorate, a famous Arizona couple gives birth to five children. Ed and HI get the idea to kidnap one since the parents obviously have more then they can handle and what ensues is pure comic genius plus a country version of Beethoven's ninth symphony and a supporting role from John Goodman. Okay then. What can I say, I love this movie for the simple fact that the trailer they live in has more firearms in it then a small country and Nicholas' Cage's southwestern accent is to die for. Anyway two thumbs up, see this film.",Raising Arizona

I agree with both statements. This movie is hysterical because it is stupid, which is not an accident. Not all stupid movies are funny. The premise, the characters, and the dialogue are all purposely outrageous making this over-the-top melodrama a first rate comedy.

175,giuliano-3,yet another Coen classic,8,18 December 2000,"This is the first of three installments in filmaking greatness from the Coen brothers. Raising Arizona is an American comedy at its best, poking fun at the rednecks of Southwest US while being endearing to them at the same time. The cast of RA is simply perfect. I would have to say this is Nick Cage's best film, one of the best for Holly Hunter and John Goodman, across the board every actor gives a great performance. At first viewing, RA might come across as ridiculous tale of yokel rednecks in Arizona. But there is much more to this film than just comedy and, like in Fargo, there are many other themes more central to the main characters than the obvious plot-driven ones. Upon further viewing many treats come alive in the backround of shots. This is a rich film, and excells in every way. There are simply no other comedies like this one, comedic films that are also artisticly flawless are very hard to find. One of my 10 favorite films of all time, 9.7/10",Raising Arizona

178,theVHSrocks,Good not great and a movie ultimately held down by its most unique elements,7,13 March 2007,"When I first saw this film, I only saw the end. I thought the film was pretty good but a rather minor work. I had figured I hadn't missed much. However, when I saw the film from start to finish, I realize the best of the bits were at the start. Unfortunately, the best bits at the part didn't change the whole film, leaving me with the same conclusion as I'd before, only maybe a little more demonstrated of the films strengths. Raising Arizona follows a couple of an ex-con and an ex-cop, who decide to steal a baby after finding out that they cannot conceive one of their own. They talk in a creatively awkward regional accent/manner, shared by pretty everyone in the film, and they rarely express emotion, using their face, shared by many people in the film. They develop moral justifications using wisdom consistent with their regionality, and they get into many types of troubles throughout the film, descending through all manners of the realistic and bizarre. These troubles are funny, and they are also in a way self-aware. The problem is that the whole film is perhaps a bit too self-aware. The manner by which the characters speak feels as if that's how every character speaks, and it starts to feel a bit through the film that the joke was overdone and more effort should have been made to differentiate the characters. On the same token, the way the film goes about is a bit too of for lack of better phrasing ""opposite of melodramatic"", and by the 9th time, you've seen the female cop character staring blankly at the camera, you wonder if the whole bit was just way too stylized. The whole thing feels overly scripted for an indy-style comedy, and to boot, there's a mediocre climax and plot over and under emphasis. The thing is that the film works well enough in the spite of such things. The self-awareness is charming for what it is, and a lot of fun jokes, especially those of nice old men, are found. The lines are cute, and even if all many of the story aspects don't completely work, they still have enough worthy elements to justify their inclusion. The film is not a bad way to spend an afternoon at all, and it is certainly one you'll remember. After all, this is still a pretty unique way of doing a film through and through, and any unique success is likely to be remembered. It's the type of movie that is bound to have a cult following. It's also a type of film that could easily be commercially successful. It's a time of film that combines an offbeat sensibility with a very onbeat type of concept, and it is ultimately this that most defines the film in addition to perhaps serving its detriment at times. It's a good film, but its sensibilities and structure ultimately are what prevent it from reaching a level higher than ""good"".",Raising Arizona

Top notch performances from everyone including a young Holly Hunter and an even younger Nicholas Cage - one of the few movies he hasn't phoned in the Nic Cage performance.

John Goodman is excellent as well as the escaped convict that tries to help. I think.

185,CUDIU,A freezing illusion of perfection,6,21 February 2005,"This comedy is in the style of others by the Coens (The Big Lebowski and The Ladykillers in particular), only much faster, with one gag following another. It conveys a typical feeling of coldness, just as everything were built and invented with no real inspiration, by just sitting at a table and squeezing into the thing as many brilliant details as a barely 90 minutes long movie can bear. I don't deny that the result is pretty enjoyable, but all the stuff that you have to go through while a credible setting is built out of nothing in the first 30 minutes is as terrifying as Fargo was... you are not even able to smile at it, you are just horrified by this depiction of the squalor of life in ""deep"" America. After the first minutes you can relax and enjoy a slapstick comedy brilliantly developed and brought to its end. But I don't think this is intellectually superior to any other comedy just because it is by the Coens. I am not surprised at all by the fact that these guys became star-filmmakers in Europe because of much appreciation by the French, who are always appealed by extremely intellectual wit but are never bothered by emptiness of meaning.",Raising Arizona

From our penal and adoption systems to how we value material success over moral goodness as depicted by H. I's boss being more prosperous but much less moral than him (""You keep your God damn hands off of my wife, Glen!) it's hilarious and intelligent humor. All of the acting is also terrific, from the literal/figurative outlaw biker--""Why, I myself as a pup fetched $25,000 on the black market""-- to his actual outlaw friends who broke out of jail"" ""We released ourselves on our own recognizance."" The film is filled with so many memorable, insightful (and again hilarious) one-liners, from ""HI, you're young and you got your health, what do you want with a job?"" to the oft-quoted ""Son, you got a panty on your head!"" that alone would make it worth considerable praise. But of course it's much more than that, being at it's core a very sweet and compassionate look at a young couple struggling against ""biology and the prejudices of others"" to make a good life for themselves in the often cold and superficial world they face.

With that being said, they obviously have a gift for cinematic storytelling and out-of-the-blue characters. Which is sometimes what makes the movie (like Burn After Reading, one of my favourite of theirs).With Raising Arizona, I gotta say, I was disappointed. I had high expectations, obviously, and I was let down a little. I found the main characters a bit despicable and lacking any kind of logic motivations. It makes a entertaining movie with funny situations, but as far as the story goes, it's lacking. It kinda goes nowhere. Good performances and directing. The writing I wasn't a big fan of. Witty and clever dialogues, but from another time. The language and expressions sounded like a 50's TV series (I'm nit picking here). But overall I didn't hate myself watching this, but it was a bit too goofy for it's own good and lacked a higher purpose of existence. With that being said, it's fun to watch. 6/10",Raising Arizona
191,werlingjakob,"""Raising Arizona"" is a Hilariously Twisted, Deep, and Very Entertaining Coen Brothers Comedy",8,17 September 2018,"When you think about the director duo The Coen Brothers (Joel and Ethan Coen), you probably think about their more popularly known movies such as Fargo and No Country for Old Men. But what most of The Coen Brothers movies all have in common is that nearly all of them have something to do with crime. And Raising Arizona is not only one of their best movies to do that genre, but also is probably one of their best movies, period. And since Raising Arizona was only their second full theatrical movie (their first being 1984's Blood Simple), that is a pretty good achievement. The film's plot/story is great while also hilariously (and gleefully) twisted, not to mention delightfully Tim Burton Gone Southern-esque eccentric. A story about an ex-criminal and his policewoman wife who, after finding out that they cannot make a baby, steal one from a wealthy furniture store magnate whose wife recently gave birth to quintuplets, who's robbery causes their lives to become increasingly difficult due to two escaped fugitives and a biker bounty hunter, now that is wonderfully strange. The acting is strong, mainly Nicholas Cage and Holly Hunter's performances as the main characters H.I. McDunnough and Ed. Though the supporting performances of Trey Wilson as Nathan Arizona, Sr., John Goodman as Gale, William Forsythe as Evelle, Sam McMurray as Glen, Frances McDormand as Dot, and Randall ""Tex"" Cobb as Leonard Smalls are all still equally strong and further contribute to the comedy and craziness in this dramatic screwball comedy. As I believe I already said, both Joel and Ethan Coen did an excellent job at both producing and directing this movie. They twist reality and create often odd scenarios out of ones that start fairly simple. They manage to create a surrealist, Southern dreamscape full of memorable characters and lots of deceptive metaphors. This movie actually kicked off their success as a movie-making duo- though it wasn't their first. This movie's action sequences are all ridiculously over-the-top and comical, though decently executed and featuring good choreography, cinematography, and lots of excitement In fact, some of this movie's funniest moments occur during the action sequences, the best one is probably either the introduction of Leonard Smalls or the chase scene that starts at the convenience store. Though there aren't enough to make it an action comedy, mind you. And as for this movie's humor, it's great. Raising Arizona is full of deft one-liners, humorous situations, and lots of dark/screwball comedy. My favorite line personally is ""Relax, we got a baby. And they got four that are almost as good as this one."" And my favorite scenario is probably the funny ""could you clarify' bank robbery scene. This movie's writing is also outstanding, the characters are very memorable and charmingly quirky, the character development is slow but clear, and the movie is packed full of witty, smart-ass dialogue and crazy scenarios. And if you look a little closer, you will see that this movie also is quite deep and full of metaphors such as H.I.'s attempt to start a new life being compared to pushing through the dry Arizona mud and just how barren and rocky the wombs of the women of Tempe, Arizona are. Of course, like a lot of The Coen Brother's movies, Raising Arizona also has great jaw-dropping cinematography, exciting action-packed choreography, and great visuals. All the shots of Arizona's canyons are the best in my opinion. Last but not least, this movie's exploration of childless marriage is handled quite maturely, though a little toned-down- which makes sense because Raising Arizona is a comedy film at heart. All in all, Raising Arizona is a great, hilariously twisted, dramatic Southern comedy that is possibly some of The Coen Brothers best work and the movie that kickstarted their long-lasting success. If you like a dramatic comedy with lots of dry humor and deep metaphors and smartly hilarious dialogue, not to mention one with a heart. Raising Arizona is for you. I highly recommend it.",Raising Arizona

There's nothing disturbing about the violence. It's a very funny, Tom-and-Jerry style, cartoonish slapstick violence.  It's hilariously funny, and the highlight of a thoroughly stylish and inventive film.But the human reason for the violence, and the lovability of the characters, and their unfulfilled dreams, well, that's what disturbed me.

With hindsight, I think this movie is better appreciated as an 80's movie in that the humour is mostly visual and the moral of the story is spelt out for the viewer, however sentimental and (I'll admit) heartwarming it is.It has the usual Coen trademarks (twisting plots, poetic characters etc) but the techniques appear rather forced in this film, which is a shame. The 'Coen touch' isn't executed as nicely as it is in other films they've worked on.Trying to pinpoint where exactly this film falls short of greatness, I personally believe it comes down to Randall Cobb's character (which I think is needless and only inserted for poetic reasons). The whole cast do their acting job superbly, even Nicolas Cage, who actually provides one of the best performances in the film, to my surprise.The film succeeds at making me care for the characters of Ed and Hi and Nathan Jr, so I guess that's great but the film doesn't make for a brilliant watch, sadly. Watch it once or twice maybe, but no more. It could have been a great film I think if only some parts of the story had been omitted or extended. So if you're not one for nitpicking (which I horribly tend to be) then this film should provide a good night in or two.",Raising Arizona
202,Mannequin,Splendid! Fabulous! Warming!,10,13 January 2003,"I knew this was going to be a good movie within the first minute of the opening scene. It's the only comedy I've sat through in which I actually laughed out loud - a solid belt of laughter - within the first 30 seconds. Comedies don't normally do that to me. They normally wait a while. They build up to the big joke, and it's not always even that funny.Raising Arizona began on a good note for me. Towards the middle, I was beginning to think it would wind up in a less-happy way, and admittedly I felt a little disappointed. But the movie really is touching, and the ending is fabulous! It makes up for the doubts you'll have, if any.Nicholas Cage, who I'm not actually a great fan of, does a superb job - as does Holly Hunter. (She was also great in ""O' Brother Where Art Thou""). I really think they played their parts well.I would definitely recommend this film to you. It has a little bit of a ""Married With Children"" sort of tone to it, but the jokes are intelligent and witty. It'll sometimes catch you off guard with a really funny scene and you'll really laugh out loud! I love movies like that!I like a comedy who doesn't feel it has to continually make you laugh, like ""Scary Movie"" does or ""American Pie."" They're good those films, but it's almost like they can't pause to tell you a story. They have to try and force-feed you jokes all the time. And that's the difference between those types of comedies and this one. Raising Arizona tells you a story. And makes you laugh a whole lot along the way.Don't worry if when you're watching it you start to think it's going down a certain path, because it changes. And it ends up in a really good place...I really hope you like it!",Raising Arizona

204,magnoliaX82,Raising Arizona (1987) [Directed by Joel Coen],9,6 December 2002,"Alright, I'll admit THIS to all you anti-Raising Arizona people: you have some pretty solid reasons to support your opposition against the film. You're right, it's not as good as Fargo or Miller's Crossing. And, yes, it's a little pointless. But if you didn't enjoy the movie at all, then you completely MISSED it's point. Because in the end, Raising Arizona is intended as nothing more than a guilty pleasure, a wonderful day-dream that you don't want to wake from (POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD which is actually part of the symbolism behind the ending, during which H.I. ""dreams"" of an epilogue). And if you're able to put up with some strikingly bizarre oddities, then the far-fetched premise of the movie will actually seem partially sensical, making it a bit easier to suspend all disbelief and just enjoy the ride. Because when it comes to unbelievable stories, they don't get much weirder than this: H.I. (Nicolas Cage) and his wife Ed -- short for Edwina (Holly Hunter) -- are enjoying life as a married couple, until they make the shocking discovery that she's barren and they can't have the children they long for. So -- going with the flow of the moment and doing what they think is right -- they decide to kidnap one of the ""Arizona quintuplets"" to raise as their own (although they still can't agree on a name for it). Things get even MORE strange when a sadistic bounty hunter named Lenny Smalls enters the picture, aiming to find the baby and collect the reward it's parents have put up... or if that fails, sell it to the black market. Full of hysterical antics and classic lines (e.g. ""I'll be taking these Huggies and whatever cash ya got"") the Coen Brothers have once again succeeded at delivering us an out-of-this-world observation on close-to-home issues. But it's not just the screenplay or the zaniness of Raising Arizona that makes it so enjoyable, it's every aspect of the picture: the acting, the Carter Burwell soundtrack, and the up-roarious chase scenes. And if that isn't enough to convince you nay-sayers of the greatness of this film, then it might help to know that it was ranked by A.F.I. as the 31st funniest movie ever made. So if you haven't watched it yet because you've been turned off by all the negative reviews, or you HAVE seen but just didn't get it, give it a second chance: you're bound to have a good time.Grade: A-",Raising Arizona

The premise / set up of the story is goofy but alright, but then the chaotic scenes you have to sit through the story line, are just too many.

It is one of those few films you find that seems perfectly balanced. Just the right amount of comedy, just the right amount of seriousness, just the right amount of introspection. No dead spots. It is suitable for any viewing audience, unlike ""Fargo,"" which was a bit too cruel in its humor (the kidnapped wife running blindly into things was NOT funny), or ""The Ladykillers,"" which was a great film that unfortunately had a steady stream of foul language coming from one of the characters, which really felt out of place and distracted from the rest of the movie.

I think that attitude is central to Coeney Island, and this film certainly falls into the category euphemistically called ""quirky"". Products such as this can't be blamed for aiming squarely at their intended audience. If you like this kind of pseudo-intellectual fare, bully for you. There are plenty of vendors for this kind of ware.All others who will try to find anything substantial will be sorely disappointed. You won't experience wildness, depth, sentiment, wonder, fury, intrigue, edginess, insight, lasciviousness, or even a good joke. In fact, what's really missing is honesty.You will be served up mounds of pretense and self-important contrivance, infused with long-expired sophomorism, and powdered with clip art humanism.Package above with ,uh, quirky dialogue (hard to assign that term since the characters don't express anything to each other or the audience) and you have all the haughty form-over-substance. cookie-cutter originality that the anesthetized soul craves.It was finely-crafted bubble-wrap, I admit that.",Raising Arizona

216,ryangrogers,well-done comedy that does more than just achieve a few laughs.,6,6 October 2016,"Raising Arizona Film ReviewIn a time where so many comedies made today are filled with immature jokes, poor plots, and unrealistic circumstance, the Coen Brothers are able to produce a well-done comedy that does more than just achieve a few laughs. The film makes viewers feel for the main characters and their hardships, creates a viable villain that will stop at nothing while also giving the audience exactly what they came for-to be entertained and to laugh. The events of Raising Arizona take place during the Reagan era in the United States' history. While going to prison for another crime committed, H.I. McDunnough (Nicolas Cage) meets a young female cop by the name of Edwina (Holly Hunter) that he eventually falls in love with. After being set free, he marries her and they begin their life together in Arizona. When the couple find out they cannot have children of their own, they come up with an extravagant plan to steal one of a group of quintuplets from a local family. H.I. must adjust to the family man lifestyle while also dealing with the consequences that arise as the result of kidnapping the baby. The Coen brothers almost always do a quality job of bringing resonance to the films they direct. In this case, they achieve this through biblical and mythological allusions permeating into the plot. In Raising Arizona, issues of fertility, class, a talisman, and the ubiquity of dreams all arise, issues that also occurred in parts of the Bible. Since H.I. and Edwina cannot have a child, an issue of fertility, the couple elects to steal a baby from a family they feel are of higher class that do not deserve 4 children all to themselves. Dr. Spock's Baby and Childcare is a talisman because it goes with whoever currently has ownership of the baby, Nathan Jr. The ubiquity of dreams plays a key role in the movie when ""something supernatural"" is unleashed to get back the baby in one of H.I.'s dreams. This element is used to move the plot as Leonard Smalls (Randall Cobb), the man seen in H.I.'s dream, becomes a reality. The brothers also include a well-rounded amount of tropes in the film. H.I.'s change in clothes during one scene also shows his change in status or persona. He changes from a robber that does not want to give up his old ways to a family man that must learn to take care of his family. Two criminals escape prison during a downpour. This flood represents a clean slate and an opportunity at new lives for both of the escapees. Another element that brings success to the movie is the verisimilitude within. The Coens chose to cast several locals to give the film a sense of realism as well as an authentic, local flavor. Thanks to a wide range of shot types, including point- of-view and chase shots, Raising Arizona is able to be extremely dynamic, making it easier for the viewer to watch and drawing one's attention. Despite many positives, the film also has several negatives that do take away from the experience. H.I. lives in a desert in the middle of nowhere in Arizona where many people use slang often. However, when H.I. narrates the story, he uses extremely elegant dialogue, dialogue that would probably only be used by someone with a high form of education at the time. This dialogue was unconvincing sometimes and seemed a bit unrealistic. There is also a very shallow side-story involving two escaped criminals that takes away from the plot and does not really bring much as far as character development goes. Both the men's characters seem silly and take away from the film itself. As Roger Ebert puts it, ""The movie cannot decide if it exists in the real world of trailer parks and 7-Elevens and Pampers, or in a fantasy world of characters from another dimension. It cannot decide if it is about real people, or comic exaggerations."" The movie almost tries to be more than it really is by having relatable humor and heartfelt moments but also being unrealistic and displaying an exaggerated sense of reality. Raising Arizona is an enjoyable viewing experience that does have lots of laughs and characters that audiences will love. However, the movie just does not seem to know what it really is and tries to compensate by being realistic and absurd at the same time. Audiences looking for a relaxed, fun time or a family-friendly comedy should see this film. Very critical viewers that don't like quests or absurdity should not watch the film. Overall, Raising Arizona is a fun viewing experience but not much more than that. It deserves a 6 out of 10.",Raising Arizona

The story line was completely unbelievable, which was fine, as I feel that the filmmakers knew this while making it. My problem was it wasn't funny enough for this genre of film. Don't get me wrong, I did laugh at some parts, it's just that most of the time I was thinking, ""this is stupid."" Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter play an outlandish couple of a repeated felon and a police officer, who decide to steal a baby as Holly Hunter's character ""Ed"" is deemed infertile. This then leads to a whole giant fiasco as everyone seems to be after this baby, and H.I (Cage) and Ed just want to start a family. The performances I'd say were pretty good. There were a lot of characters in this film and I felt they all did a great job. I didn't really see the point of the bounty hunter. I felt Randall Cobb did a great job in his character, but I really didn't understand what the Coen brother's motivation for him was. I guess the point they were trying to make, if they were trying to make a point, was that family life isn't all it's cracked up to be. What's important is that you love your family.

Raising Arizona carries the style of kung fu and road warrior movies: lots of absurd action, cartoon-like characters, fast-moving camerawork.It feels similar to the later films Wild at Heart and No Country for Old Men. Despite sharing settings, imagery and cast, Raising Arizona comes out weak compared to the other two. While the first two are respectively fantasy and gritty realism, both paired with fantastic characters, Raising Arizona is caught somewhere in between, without enough time to let the characters come into their own. The erratic world the movie takes place in lends to its silly slapstick nature, the execution is less than ideal.Despite its great cast, most of the movie lacks dialogue. The opening minutes of the movie are fast paced, witty, and stylized. While the style is never lost, the humor and speed fall off early on. I was personally put off by the endless action scenes, starting with the heist itself. They drag on far too long. They are colorful, but not funny or exceptionally exciting.

235,robinsok@hotmail.com,One of the funniest things I've seen on film,10,13 October 2002,"If you're looking for an offbeat comedy that has lots of great lines yet also has a heart, this is your movie.  This is the Cohen brothers in top comedic form, with lots of ""out there"" characters but ones you want to keep inviting back for more viewings.  Nick Cage and Holly Hunter are a perfect pairing in this early film in both their careers.  Tex Cobb is the ultimate outlaw/ bounty hunter.  And watch for Frances McDormand in a hilarious bit part.  Furthermore, you have to love lines like ""Oh H.I. you're young and you got your health, what do you want with a job?"" There are more laughs in the sequence before the opening titles than in many entire movies.  A crazy story, but somehow it ties up very nicely and gives a certain humanity to the main characters.  If you have ever liked a Cohen brothers movie, this one is a must-see! Rating 10/10",Raising Arizona
236,morganstrk,Raising Arizona: Americana Essential,6,4 November 2012,"Raising Arizona is a film that follows the story of an unconventional couple; convict Hi (Cage) and police officer Ed (Hunter), as they attempt to find harmony and happiness in their lives together. However, their greatest obstacle is Ed's sterility that slowly wears on their relationship and threatens their sanity until opportunity arises in the form of a wealthy local whose wife births ""more than she can handle"". Accomplishing the abduction proves a bit difficult, but the rabid persistence of Ed drives their mission to success, and with the addition of this vital piece, it seems a true family is born. Unfortunately, prying and obnoxious colleagues, mischievous jailbirds/buddies, and a gritty detective with a Harley threaten their happiness, but also demonstrate how misguided and selfish their actions have been. Returning the baby to an appreciative and surprisingly sympathetic father, Hi reflects on the affection we have for children, even if they're not our own and is able to sleep peacefully with dreams for the future that he hopes holds a family of his very own. I generally appreciate the Coen Brother's films and what I appreciate most is their ability to hold interest of the audience through plot twists and strong characters; there's nothing extreme or very showy about their work and yet it stands out because there is only ever and illusion of normalcy and sanity in their characters or the plot, really the work is quite complex but we appreciate it more because they make no pretense. Raising Arizona continues this tradition and also has quite a flavor of Americana, enhanced greatly by the colorful characters. The humor was ludicrous most times, but it was balanced through the sensitive and reflective nature of the protagonist, whose broodings lend itself to the underlying sense of loneliness and hopelessness of the characters and the landscape and drive the rich plot forward. I feel that any criticism would simply be void for two reasons: I believe that this film is very stylistic and I don't believe that they ventured out of this particular structure, any risk they took (including the dream sequences) had basis in reality and only served to give the film more poetic flavor, and secondly, I believe that the film was unique and heartfelt among it's genre, which at times is difficult to achieve in something externally so seemingly detached as comedy, and mainly, I think there was valid reasoning behind it's creation, which is my only objection with modern film. The cinematography of the film was very interesting and was able to keep the audience occupied by the sheer amount of stimulation the wild camera movements brought. I was able to appreciate the shaky camera work simply because I think it does justice to Hi's convict past as well as his current lifestyle, punctuated by his most daring criminal offense yet. This apparently dramatic and brutal world is something that few of us can sympathize with and I think the long takes through several different environments contributes to that foreign aspect of the film that quite frankly makes it hilarious. Motifs in the film include the joined hands of Hi and Ed, representing their bond and their support of each other, the fire that erupts from the detective, representing his nature, and the convenient store that represents Hi's temptation or the pull of his old life. The brothers use this as well as a few non-diegetic inserts (including baby toys) to bring a bit of understanding to the rapidly moving plot, but it is interesting to note that this veers a bit from the slapstick genre that is quite shallow and brings a poetic aspect to the film. In the abduction scene the use of high-angle and low-angle shots capture flawlessly both the perspective of Hi and of the babies and the power shift that takes place between them, succeeding in making Hi seem vulnerable among these small creatures. Also, throughout the entire film the use of the wide-angle lens is used, making people and surroundings seem distorted and often a bit out of proportion. The abduction scene demonstrates the use of this very well, especially when the babies are taking a very long time to reach the door and then the end of the hallway, giving Hi enough time to catch them before Mrs. Arizona discovers. This also contributes to the suspense of the scene, because everything seems to take longer to happen and Hi is running out of time to act. Off-screen action and voice is used quite a bit to stage a change in events in the plot and repetition of certain events forming a montage is comedic as well as clarity inducing. It really strikes both emotional stances quite well and makes for a heartfelt and poetic take on the slapstick comedy genre, aided by the strong narrative voice that guides us through a ridiculous and tragic journey of an unlikely couple trying to find the missing piece in their family.",Raising Arizona

There's not a bad performance in this whole movie. Surprisingly, Nicholas Cage even gives a good performance (and not in the so-bad-it's-good way). I loved the soundtrack and how it was used in the movie. The editing was great with only exception when T.I. (the main character played by Nicholas Cage) brakes his boss's nose. I believe there was a continuity error but it's next to unnoticeable if I remember correctly. I felt for T.I. and believed each actor in their individual roles partly because of the tone which was set up beautifully within the first few minutes. The chase scenes were exciting and the movie remained visually interesting throughout. The ending is touching and the movie is near perfection in my opinion. Now: the bad things! What are the bad things? I guess some of the Huggies brand diapers were a problem. A minor problem of course, but it can just Whatever though... it's a great movie otherwise and I'm giving this one a decent 9/10 teetering on being a strong 8/10. Good job!",Raising Arizona

I have seen the movie at least 40 times and every time I laugh out loud many times. The chase scene in the supermarket is very original, and the camera work from the point of view of the babies when H.I. is in the bedroom of the Arizona household deciding which critter to get is amazing. Cage and Hunter and every actor is perfect in the movie. One of the best lines is ""We released ourselves on our own recognizance"" when H.I. prison buddies break out of prison. When Edwina is driving back to pick up H.I. after he robs the convenience store, and she turns to Nathan Jr. and says ""Everything's changed!"", this is another sweet line, and I say this often to my husband and kids, when they question something not going their way.

He should play more white trash roles,he seems to do very well at it!!! My favorite scene is the fight scene in the house between John Goodman and Nicolas Cage. He should make a sequel to this. Nathan Jr. is grown up and running Painted Arizon because of his ""uncertain"" reason to cause trouble in college,he was kicked out of the university then H.I. tries to rob the store one night only to find out that they were a family once,although the script never actually says it,its just one of those ""unspoken"" lines.

Cage and a great supporting cast including Holly Hunter and John Goodman stumble through this flick in a seemingly never ending chain of comedic events.

I know that sounds incoherent, but the quote, ""anyone caught bi-pedal in under five wears his ass for a hat"" says it all.  When was the last time you saw a movie that could seamlessly manage to use the word ""bi-pedal"" in the same sentence as the phrase ""ass for a hat?""

247,Karl-30,More Than Meets the Eye,10,8 January 2004,"This movie is much more than an outrageous and unique comedy. One reason for its cult following has been consistently missed by the critics: repeated viewings reveal surprising layers of meaning and an intricate web of symbolism.At the heart of this film is the timeless debate known as ""nature vs. nurture"": are we more a product of our genes, or of our environment? How much of an effect does our upbringing have on our likelihood to turn out as either a law-abiding member of society (a society which in this movie is of dubious merit, as represented by Hi's job and his unctuous boss) or as a criminal deviant from its norms?The symbolism in this film is rich and evocative--while always contributing to the comedy. Note how often the adult characters cry and carry on like infants. Note the way the escaped convicts are ""born"" into the outside world. Note the marriage of a convict and a police officer, and the difference in their families visible in the brief wedding shot. Note the juxtaposition of milk poured over cereal with the infant's feeding bottle, as Evelle observes, ""Ya don't breast feed him, he'll hate you for it later. That's why we wound up in prison."" And note the frequent use of phrases such as ""that's natural,"" as opposed to ""you're not being true to your nature"" or ""mother didn't love me."" As Hi observes, ""maybe it's my upbringing, maybe it's just that my genes got screwed up, I don't know.""
The quasi-biblical, poetical and aphorism-laden language the characters use in the-state-adjacent-to-Utah is both touching and funny. Every word of the film is a finely polished gem. Ed's little plan is ""the solution to all our problems, and the answer to all our prayers."" Her infertile womb is a ""rocky place where my seed can find no purchase."" And as Hi later writes in a touching letter to his dearest Edwina, ""I feel the thunder gathering even now...I cannot tarry...better I should go, send you money, and let you curse my name."" On the other hand, the crotchety Arizona characters also have a remarkable literalness of expression. A packet of balloons does not blow up into funny shapes, not ""unless round is funny."" And as the old codger in the bank robbery points out, ""If I freeze, I can't rightly drop, and if I drop, I'm gonna be in motion!""Even the music in this film is perfectly executed, from the hilarious yodeling and whistling of the main theme to the way the chilling accompaniment of a nightmare is later revealed to be a haunting children's nursery song, and then mutates into an ethereal melody in the film's final scenes. The characters, despite their flaws, are all surprisingly sympathetic. And the film is tightly constructed, without a single unnecessary scene or moment. It ends with a bang, not a whimper, its final words resonating with significance and yet leaving one wanting more, like a swift exit after a great punch line.At the deepest core of this film lies a mystery wrapped in an enigma: who is the once-orphaned ""motorcycle demon from hell,"" and what is his relation to Herbert I. McDonnough? The answer to this puzzle relates intimately to the ""nature vs. nurture"" theme. While I think I know the answer, I'll leave it for you to figure out, based on the clues (""show the tattoo!"") liberally scattered throughout the film. ""Okay then!""",Raising Arizona

It took me several viewings before it sunk in that the film's base story is about child kidnapping; which is an extraordinarily serious crime. But this film makes you enjoy every minute so it's easy to forget the seriousness of the base story.While I'm not a fan of Nicholas Cage, I thought this was a perfect vehicle for him.

Really though, even though Raising Arizona's one of his least well known works, Nick was masterful in this (as were John Goodman and everyone else, but he's my god).The script is fabulously wacky, with the classic dimwitted crooks and Nick as a sensitive but hard as nails hick.  The scene in which the two male crooks drive away from robbing the convenience store is laugh out loud funny, and the whole movie is a gem.  Though I must warn you- if you see this, don't expect to be able to discuss it with your friends, at least not if you're a teenager.

259,nordungg,Slightly disappointing,6,22 February 2011,"Due to mild sickness I was forced to stay at home for a couple of days and in this time I managed to see four Coen Bros' films (Blood Simple, Raising Arizona, Barton Fink, Miller's Crossing) and I find Raising Arizona the least enjoyable of all of them, or maybe even the least enjoyable film of the Coens in general. I must admit that at least partially because I never enjoyed films with an infant as one of the central characters. Well, that is a matter of personal taste and it absolutely doesn't have to make a film bad.The role of Nathan Jr. could be in this film, being Coen Bros' production, easily substituted with any other valuable object (say, with a suitcase full of cash as in No Country for Old Men) and that would not really affect (predictably unpredictable) plot in any way. Nicholas Cage is suitable for the role of HI, also Holly Hunter fits very nicely in the Ed's character and the side role casting can't be really criticized as well. One simple problem of this film is that is not funny for a comedy, not dramatic for a drama, not adventurous for an adventure and not mysterious for a mystery. And as a cocktail of all of them it doesn't really reach later films by Coen Bros. It is not strange that they have decided to improve the impression 20 years later with No Country for Old Men (similar plot, some similar characters, incredibly better result). And what the hell was that screaming of John Goodman and William Forsythe in the car good for?!",Raising Arizona
260,kkehl4,My Favorite Movie of All Time,10,29 December 2010,"This has been my favorite movie for years. I am particularly fond of the fact that I know many of the locations where filming took place. For example, the grocery store scene was at Earl's supermarket, at Hayden Road and Indian School (it has since changed to a Basha's). The hayseed bank was actually the steak house at Riata Pass, an area that has since been overrun with new housing developments.The filming is excellent, with very interesting camera angles (e.g. the bouncing baby view). The plot is engaging, and the characters are hilarious. I especially love the use of the phrase ""well, OK then."" Not really an Arizona phase, but it gives a good provincial feel (maybe they were after the term ""OK, well"", which IS actually used some).In the end this is a story which has surprising parallels to ""No Country for Old Men""--local hick gets into illegal mischief, pursued by villain of virtually mythical proportions, full of local color for the area (Arizona for RA, West Texas for NCfOM). Unfortunately, in NCfOM, the ending is not so uplifting.And hence lies the contrast of Raising Arizona to most (or at least many) Coen Brothers films: it has a genuinely happy ending (except for the ASU part ; )).Well, OK Then!",Raising Arizona
261,julialjulian,"""Son you got a panty on your head""",8,8 December 2011,"Raising Arizona is a comedy about Herbert 'H.I.' McDunnough, played by Nicholas Cage. H.I. has a troubled past, but is ready to put all that behind him and start a family with his love, Edwina or Ed played by Holly Hunter. H.I. and Ed met in jail where Ed would take H.I.'s booking photos each time he was arrested. They fall in love and decide to build a life and start a family. When H.I. and Ed discover they can't have children of their own, they set out to relieve a wealthy family of one of their quintuplets. Settling in with their newly kidnapped son, matter turn from bad to worse when H.I.'s old jail buddies show up looking for a place to stay. When a hefty reward is offered for the return of the kidnapped child, H.I.'s jailhouse friends Gale, played by John Goodman, and Evelle, played by William Forsythe, decide to cash in. Add in an evil, biker bounty hunter looking for some extra cash and you've got a hit comedy.This movie is all about perseverance. H.I. never gives up. He wants to make everyone in his life happy, and in the end tries to do the right thing. Even though he has had many a run in with the law, you can empathize with this character. Nicholas Cage does a great job creating a somewhat pathetic but likable criminal. The voice-overs, narrated by Nicholas Cage, and the dream sequences, add quirkiness to the film. The musical score adds to the hilarity with whistling and yes even some yodeling. The zany characters, and hilarious stories, and quotable lines (e.g. ""I'll be taking these Huggies and whatever cash ya got""), make this film a must see. If you enjoy this film, I would recommend another film directed by the Coen brothers, The Big Lebowski starring John Goodman. This film is another hilarious Coen brother's comedy about kidnapping and hilarity. Overall, I definitely recommend this film. The ""never give up"" attitude of the main characters and all the comical scenes make it worth your while.",Raising Arizona
262,malata82,Artistically funny from beginning to end,10,27 July 2012,"A story centered on a couple's desperate need to have a baby, is the basic theme that Raising Arizona employs. However there is nothing basic about the actions that occur in the whole 94 minutes of the entire film, it is both a fast paste and unpredictable story line that takes the audience on a baby kidnapping, bank robbery and Jail breakouts and yet funny at the same time.The couple, H.I. McDunnough (Nicolas Cage), and Edwina ""Ed"" (Holly Hunt) first meet in jail when McDunnough is arrested. Ed, a cop takes his mug shot and his fingerprints while asking her out, she takes up his offer. After a quick wedding the couple soon finds out that Ed is barren, adoption is also not an option due to McDunnough's criminal background. The couple's next decision, to kidnap one of five baby quintuplets from a rich, well known couple named Nathan and Lynne Arizona all goes wrong.The high energy storyline is matched by the fast, quick, and smart use of cinematography style, the subject views are shot from each character's viewpoint, even the baby's. The camera angles are both high and low, and there is a particular seen where McDunnough has been tied up to a chair by his friends from jail, Gale Snoats (John Goodman) and Evelle Snoats (William Forsythe), and is struggling to get free, he falls to the ground, the camera shooting also appears to fall with him. There is a lot of movement in almost every scene, yet the focus of each character is still sharp, and from time to time zooming in on the characters' facial expressions. The color pallet is vibrant and yet remains natural and realistic.Raising Arizona also employs voice-over narration by McDounnough (Nicolas Cage), which guides the audience through the complicated storyline, this type of sound effect is a wise choice because it compliments the film's quirky artistic vision from the Coen Brothers, which would have otherwise confused the audience, if there was no background information being set up by the narration. The choice of music is also interesting because it adds to the humor of the action in certain scenes, the explosions and gun shots are also exaggerated at times, almost mimicking cartoon like styles.Raising Arizona does not have the typical comedic theme, but the plot of the couple's desperate actions to have a baby is credible enough to make this a good film. Along the way I also learn that this is not the only theme in this film, but that it is also about friendship and love, which Ed and H.I. also realize when they find out that having each other is more important than having a kidnapped baby.",Raising Arizona
263,nye09,A comedy for the easily humored!,5,27 July 2012,"Raising Arizona is a not-so-funny comedy surrounding the marriage and infertility of ex-cop, Ed McDonnough (Holly Hunter) and her ex-con husband, H.I. (Nicolas Cage). When the couple is told by her doctor that they would not be able to conceive a child of their own, Ed is devastated. While watching television one evening, the couple sees that Nathan Arizona (Trey Wilson), a rich, furniture store owner and his wife were now the proud parents of quintuplets. Ed concocts a plan to ""borrow"" one of their babies because she believes they ""have their hands full"" with 5 babies. This in turn sets off a crazy string of events which leave the couple in a fight for their ""borrowed"" child, their freedom and their love for one another.The theme of Raising Arizona is a character's struggle within themselves to soothe the constant ""wants"" in life that are not necessarily needed. Throughout the movie, Ed just wants to be happy. Before marrying H.I., she just wanted to meet the right man and get married. During one scene when Ed is booking H.I. into one of his many jail stints, she is sobbing because her then fiancé' had broken up with her. This was the first time that Ed realized that she had feelings for H.I., when he showed compassion for her and told her that her fiancé' had to be stupid to leave her. Soon after, Ed and H.I. were married and she immediately wanted to start having babies. This proved to be impossible for them and her desperate ""want"" to be a mother caused her to grow depressed, lose interest in everything - including cleaning her house and she lost her job. H.I. just seems to be along for the crazy ride. The wild story line and almost unfathomable shenanigans in this movie are somewhat similar to the 1990 Dennis Dugan movie, Problem Child, starring John Ritter. In both movies, there are couples who desperately want to have a child and when they are both given what they want it proves to be much more than they can handle. Both movies are filled with conflict and chaos right up to the very end.The motifs and camera angles brought out the theme of this movie and made it more exciting to watch. Throughout the movie the viewer is constantly reminded that Ed wants a baby and after Baby Arizona is ""borrowed"", the camera is fixated on how Ed and H.I. plan to keep him and keep their secret. The camera techniques were great in this movie. There were several parallel cuts that took the viewer back and forth between two different locations as the suspense was rising. In one particular scene, Ed, H.I. and Baby Jr. are driving home from spending a day with friends and they pull into a store to pick up some diapers. H.I. is tempted to resort to his old ways and ends up robbing the store. Ed sees him through the window and immediately becomes angry and drives away, leaving him to fend for himself. What H.I. doesn't anticipate though, is the store clerk is ready for him. After pushing an emergency button to alert the authorities, the clerk pulls out a rifle and starts shooting at H.I. Just as he is running away the cops pull up and start a wild chase. The cameras cut back and forth between H.I. running through streets, yards and houses, the cops chasing him and Ed, who had a change of heart about leaving him and decides to go back and try to help save him from the police. All of the chaos and goofy humor combined with a crazy plot take the viewer right back to the theme of the movie, choose your ""wants"" lightly because they just might turn out to be your ""want nots"".",Raising Arizona
264,emilymanter55,The Importance of Theme in Raising Arizona,8,6 December 2012,"The film Raising Arizona begins with the unfortunate life of H.I. McDunnough (Nicholas Cage) and his journeys in and out of prison where he meets his future wife, Edwina ""Ed"" (Holly Hunter), a corrections officer. The two get married and discover that they cannot have children of their own, despite their beliefs that they are good people and would make great parents. Around that time, Nathan and Florence Arizona (Trey Wilson and Lynne Kitei) give birth to quintuplets, and discover that so many children are ""more than they can handle!"" The McDunnoughs, with their good intentions in hand, kidnap one of the quintuplets to raise as their own, believing that they are doing the Arizona's a favor. The primary theme of this film is the effects of karma, or the idea that ""what goes around comes around."" This theme can be found throughout the film, as characters like Gale and Evelle Snoats (John Goodman and William Forsythe) fail in their attempt to rob a bank and eventually return to jail. The theme can also be found through the consequences that the McDunnoughs face as a result of the kidnapping, and the reactions of Nathan Arizona when he finally learns what has happened to his son. The primary tool used to explain the theme of the film is the voice-over. A voice-over can be used to fill in gaps and make a film cohesive, or to explain background or contextual information to the viewer (Boggs & Petrie, 2008). In Raising Arizona, the voice-over is used for both reasons, and gives thorough insights into the thoughts and motives of the characters. This tool is very effective in conveying the theme of the film in that sense. The acting throughout the film is also very effective in helping to convey the theme of the film. H.I. is a very innocent character, despite his many crimes, and the acting portrays this well. Ed is another naïve character, who does not fully understand the consequences of her actions. As both of these characters begin to realize the consequences of their actions, they begin to take responsibility for them and try to do what is best for everyone. In that sense, both actors help to contribute to the theme of the film by effectively displaying the emotions and motivations of their characters. The theme of this film is similar to the themes of many other films, like, for example, the film Elf, where the primary character, Buddy the Elf (Will Ferrell), acts on his good intentions, even when his actions may not be the right thing to do. For example, in one scene, Buddy gets in a fight with a store ""Santa"" (Artie Lange) because Buddy knows that the man is an imposter.The message of this film is very important to everyone, because good intentions are very important, but it is still important that one always tries to do what is right. Though they may have started off on the wrong path, Ed and H.I. finally make amends and do what is right for everyone involved in the situation.References Boggs, J. M. & Petrie, D. W. (2008).

265,prillzilla,Raising Arizona,10,17 March 2005,"Raising Arizona came before Fargo and The Big Lebowski and is still my favorite of all the Coen Brothers films. It moves at lightning speed and has no ""fat"" at all. Just looking at Nicholas Cage with his squinty eyes and mussed hair makes me giggle! It has the best lines of many movies. ""We're using code names"", ""I think I got the best one"", ""Okay then"", ""They had more than they could handle"", and more. I love the way the characters speak kind of flowery and are still easily understandable. I think that's one of the Coen Brother's trademarks(see George Clooney's character in O' Brother). I think it was the first time I saw Holly Hunter in a film. All the actors did fantastic jobs. John Goodman went on to be in several more Coen Brothers films. This is one of my all-time favorite films. If you like quirky, see it.",Raising Arizona
266,stratocasius,what's you favorite line in the movie...?,10,31 March 2005,"Gale Snokes...""Damnit H.I., the sun don't rise and set on the corner grocery."" the little subtle hints that the Coen bros. put in there are awesome...like the KOEN on the mike of the news anchor interviewing Nathan Sr. The old black inmate that HI is incarcerated with... ""We ate sand..."" ""You ate SAND?"" this is one of those rare movies that NEVER gets old... Enjoy. My best scene is when Glen comes back to the trailer to tell HI that he's fired...""I'll pitch my voice, wherever i PLEASE"" And Smalls saying ""A cop couldn't find his but is he had bell on it."" And Evelle during the bank heist ""Not even our codes names..?"" Awesome. What is your favorite line or scene from this movie? There won't be another movie like this one, ever...",Raising Arizona
267,cpiper-2,Raising Arizona,10,2 May 2005,"Some people just don't get it--blue collar characters with Ivvy-league vocabularies, what's so funny about that? Well, it IS funny and that's only part of the reason why this film is a classic. Where do I start? Each time I watch this film (100 times and counting) I come away with something new to watch for the next time. Each scene and every remark has meaning--""I know you're partial to convenience stores, but damn it HI, the sun don't rise and set on the corner grocery!"" Just one example--words to live by. Well done, Coen Brothers. Your best work ever.cp",Raising Arizona
268,carolmann888,Best Movie Ever,10,9 July 2021,I have watched this movie many times and it's still the best movie ever made!,Raising Arizona
269,starbooty11,overrated,4,20 February 2007,"I really don't understand the appeal of this film. I truly like many of the Coen brothers films (Barton Fink, Fargo), but It just seems like everyone in the film is trying way to hard to be funny. I especially loathe the characters that are brothers (John Goodman) who escape from prison and the pointless subplot of the deranged hell's angel. Maybe It's just me. A lot of people I know say this is the funniest film they have EVER seen. I wanted to like it but with every character in the film screaming out lines with effected voices made me want to just shut it off. I will say that the technical work, like in most of their films is fantastic but this one just does not work for me.",Raising Arizona
270,neiltsimpson,Off the wall comedy,9,31 December 2005,"Along with Barton Fink and O Brother this has to be my favourite Coen Brother's film. I may be in the minority but I did not enjoy The Big Lebowski (I think Jeff Bridges is probably the most reliable of actors - I would watch him in a soap commercial and find him value for money), Fargo or The Man Who Wasn't There. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter have seldom been better and the chemistry between them is pure gold. This is a real laugh out loud comedy with some set pieces that deliver with repeated viewings. I have seen this film five or six times, and as someone who rarely watches a film more than once or twice, I can't praise this film more highly. I haven't seen it for a few years otherwise I would have written a more insightful review. I don't love every Coen Bros film but this one made me want to see every film they have made since at the cinema rather than wait for the DVD.",Raising Arizona
