0,SnoopyStyle,wonderful exotic visuals,6,23 December 2015,"At a Los Angeles hospital, Romanian girl patient Alexandria meets bed-ridden stuntman Roy Walker (Lee Pace). Roy starts to tell the little girl a fantastical tale about her namesake Alexander the Great. The next day, he tells her another story about six disparate warriors on a quest to kill corrupt ruler Governor Odious. Each one has his own reason to seek revenge.Director Tarsem Singh has an unique beautiful style. It is colorful and luscious. The movie starts with Lee Pace and the little girl. I don't know if it's absolutely necessary to use the storyteller idea. One thing is certain. The little girl is incomprehensible. I can barely understand what she says only with caption. I don't find the hospital that compelling. The imagined story is a different matter. The visuals are wonderfully exotic. That story is almost unimportant. I would like to stay solely with the imaginary world.",The Fall
1,claudio_carvalho,Fantasy and Reality Entwined,8,2 May 2010,"In the beginning of the Twentieth Century, in the pediatric wing of a hospital in Los Angeles, the talkative five year-old girl Alexandria (Catinca Untaru) is recovering from a broken arm. Alexandria works with her family of immigrants in the harvest of oranges and she has just lost her father. When she meets the injured stuntman Roy Walker (Lee Pace) recovering from a fall and also brokenhearted with the loss of his girlfriend to the lead actor, he begins to tell a fantastic tale about six heroes and their common enemy, the hideous Governor Odious. Black Bandit that lost his brother Blue Bandit that was killed by Odious' men; the expert in explosives Luigi that was outcast in his town by Odious; the Indian that lost his gorgeous wife that was abducted by Odious; the former slave Otta Benga that lost his twin brother in the fields of Odious; Charles Darwin that receives a rare ""Mistica Americana"" butterfly killed by Odious; and Mystic that hated Odious that destroyed the fauna and flora of his lands, join forces to defeat the evil Odious. While Alexandria fantasizes the story projecting the images of her acquaintances in the characters, the heartsick Roy uses her innocence to ask the girl to still morphine and medicines from the dispensary for him to commit suicide. ""The Fall"" is one of the most original films that I have recently watched. This adventure has a stunning opening sequence in black and white and slow motion with the Allegretto from Ludwig van Beethoven's (1770-1827) Symphony # 7 in A mayor, Opus 92 in the soundtrack. The story entwines reality and fiction, burring the situations in a certain moment, and may be understood in many layers; therefore this dramatic feature can also been seen by children and is a great family entertainment. The cinematography sets and locations are very beautiful and bright with intense use of colors. This is the type of movie that deserves to be watched more than once to have the full understanding of all situations. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): ""Dublê de Anjo"" (""Stunt of Angel"")",The Fall
2,kosmasp,Thinking outside the Cell,8,6 May 2009,"If you have David Fincher and Spike Jonze ""presenting"" your movie, you have to have something going for you. While the tag ""acclaimed"" director might feel a bit stretched (at least for me) for the guy who was formerly known to show us Jennifer Lopez in the Cell (especially her refrigerator scene is very memorable, although not many other things are), he does have a visual style that is original. And with The Fall, the story does his visuals justice too (contrary to the Cell experience).Visually he has his own almost unique style, the story however seems borrowed. But lending from the fairytale structure isn't a bad thing. It kind of reminded me of the movie ""Princess Bride"" a bit. Of course a much more mature alternate version of that. The R-rating has it's reasons. I like the movie, but the ""stubborness"" and a sort of mood change at the end of the movie, might make it an unpleasant view for some (mainstream?) audience members.",The Fall
3,ccthemovieman-1,Amazing Visuals & Intaru's Acting Make This Memorable,9,30 July 2010,"Somewhere on the Internet, someone wrote a column, ""The Ten Most Visually-Stunning Movies Of The Last Decade"" (or something like that.). The only movie I hadn't never heard of on this list was this one - The Fall - so I anxiously checked it out. Well, it certainly lived up to expectations, especially on Blu-Ray which was the recommended way to view the DVD.Yes, it was one of the most amazing visual films I've ever seen. The story was a strange one and which gave me mixed feelings about it, was it was but okay. If read the other reviews here, you'll find everyone agrees ""The Fall"" is amazing ""eye candy"" but opinions really vary on the story, from loving it to hating it. In addition to the stunning visuals, the other thing that amazed me was how good an actress young Catinca Intaru (""Alexandria"") turned out to be. I can see why she beat out 400 other competitors for this role, and received top billing. A Romanian girl who could speak decent English, she and the lines she delivered made for a very believable character.Overall, this is a film you might like and might not, perhaps depending on your appreciation for photography. To me, that and realism of the child actress, made it a disc worth keeping.",The Fall
4,dbborroughs,The power of stories and our need to hear them,8,15 March 2009,"Tarsem's four year labor of love about a little girl in a hospital. She was injured in a fall and is waiting to heal. As she runs about the hospital she makes the acquaintance of a stuntman, also injured in a fall. He begins to tell her a story that spins out and has unexpected repercussions for both of them.Beautiful, one of a kind film is a magical exploration about the power of stories and the need to hear them. Shot all over the world this is a film was clearly shot on location from the pyramids to the Taj Mahal to beautiful islands in the sea (but its not a pirates tale). It is a movie that takes us places and shows us things we have never seen before, even if we have. I love how this film creates the two worlds, one of Los Angeles Once upon a time and the other in the mythical world of the tale. Its so rare that a film gets so much right.While many people will click with the film and its tales of life and adventure, I know some people will be driven to distraction if not by the deliberate pacing then by the fantasy tale which has the feel (rightly) of being made up on the fly. Anyone who's ever made up a story on a fly will be able to relate to having to pull a story out of the things at hand. Yes the real life stuff is logical and in order but the fantasy story is less so with real life influencing what is happening. Once it became clear how what was happening in the lives of the characters was influencing everything I sat on the edge of my seat in order to see how the next twist would happen.This is a magical film for lovers of stories of any sort. (Though its probably a bit too dense for kids-it carries an R rating for reasons I don't understand) I'm guessing that you will be moved.(And I don't think its a pretentious film, I think other than its feelings toward telling stories I don't think there is much going on, just a good tale)",The Fall
5,lastliberal,"We're a strange pair, aren't we?",8,28 January 2009,"Romanian Catinca Untaru was magnificent as the little girl Alexandria, who was hospitalized with a broken arm. She comes in contact with a stunt man (Lee Pace) who has her steal morphine so he can commit suicide while he tells her incredible tales.It would not matter if there was not one word of dialog in this film. It was an incredible experience without a word being said. The cinematography and costumes were beyond splendid. The characters were super.The story goes from reality to the tales, back and forth, and sometimes reality and the tales are mixed together in a fascinating way.",The Fall
6,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Stunning and interesting,10,17 January 2012,"In a hospital in LA in the 1920's, a depressed stuntman meets a fellow patient, a young girl with a broken arm, and tells her an epic tale of five mythical heroes. It changes as it goes on, based on their state of mind and the interaction between storyteller and audience... and really, doesn't any? Thus, this explores the nature of a narrative, as well as themes of suicide, redemption, love, pain, cruelty, etc. The double-layer fiction(one of them unfolds gradually, as you realize what is actually going on, and both are presented through the eyes of the 6-year-old child) is handled rather well, and things that happen in one of these two mostly well-written plots(and no, the ""made-up one"" is not supposed to make sense) affect the other. Her imagination brings it to life, and it is composed of elements that have affected her life in some way, and colored by her limited level of experience of the rest of the world, how much she perceives, and the like. The acting is quite good. Catinca grows on you, at first you might be kind of annoyed by her(I was), then you realize that you've come to find her adorable, with her broken English and believable child personality. In fact, all of the characters are credible(though we really do focus mainly on this duo. Visually, this is an incredible and unforgettable piece of art. This was shot in various countries all over the world, and they are tied together in a cohesive, not culturally specific, whole. Props, sets and costumes are elaborate, exquisite and beautiful. This would appear to be Tarsem's best work(and so far, the only thing he's made worth the investment of time... well, there's hope for Mirror Mirror). His style really fits this. This deserves multiple viewings, and they aid the understanding and appreciation. There is some bloody violence and surreal disturbing content in this. I warmly recommend this to fans of adventure, drama and fantasy, as well as its concept. 10/10",The Fall
7,evanston_dad,"You May Find Yourself Falling for ""The Fall""",9,21 October 2008,"A strange and wonderful film that's as much about the love of movie storytelling as it is anything else.Lee Pace plays a stuntman, Roy, who suffers an accident and winds up in a Los Angeles hospital, crippled and suicidally depressed. He befriends a little girl, Alexandria, who's in the hospital with a broken arm, and who is entertained by his fantastic adventure stories. Roy begins to manipulate her into stealing morphine for him as a method for committing suicide, but she instead proves to be the thing he needs to help him get over his depression and continue living.This film reminded me both of ""The Princess Bride"" and ""Pan's Labyrinth."" The story within the story has a ""Princess Bride"" feel, complete with the occasional tongue-in-cheek moment to remind us that what we're watching is the creation of someone's imagination. But it's also like ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" in that the story we see acted out is diffused through a child's eyes -- the story is Roy's, but the visual interpretation of the story is Alexandria's, so the characters in the story are played by the people she interacts with daily, with the result being that the distinction between reality and fiction sometimes becomes blurred.The creators of ""The Fall"" clearly intend for their film to be about the joys of movie storytelling. Alexandria says at one point that she doesn't like ""flickers,"" but the story Roy tells her is exactly the kind of outrageous adventure he would be in himself, and she's hooked. And one of the last scenes in the film shows the hospital staff and patients gathered together to watch the slapstick western that Roy injured himself filming, and they're all enjoying it immensely.I doubt there will be a movie this year that looks better than this one. The production and costume design and cinematography are so imaginative and striking as to send some moments of the film into the world of the abstract.Grade: A",The Fall
8,ferguson-6,I Fell Hard for this one,8,1 June 2008,"Greetings again from the darkness. I am not much of a fan of director Tarsem's ""The Cell"" ... found it over the top and a bit full of itself. This one, on the other hand, is a multi-layered visual and spiritual feast! Starring Lee Pace (last seen as the soulful-eyed piano player in ""Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day"") as a recently paralyzed stunt man from the ""flickers"" and newcomer-extraordianare Caina Untaru as Alexandria (a precocious young patient at the same hospital), this film is captivating throughout. Pace wins young Alexandria over with colorful and detailed stories to which we are provided a buffet of colors and settings! There is no shortage of life lessons here, but it works on a few levels. Watching the trusting Alexandria discover the truth and try desperately to save her own innocence is both heart-wrenching and fascinating.This one grabs you from the opening sequence and doesn't let go until the story is completed. David Fincher and Spike Jonze are both listed as Producers and I can only assume are behind the distribution of the film. Hopefully enough word of mouth will spread so that it gets some of the recognition it deserves.",The Fall
9,gradyharp,Seeds of Scheherazade,10,28 March 2009,"THE FALL is one of the more stunningly beautiful cinematic works to be created in recent years. Vibrant young director Tarsem Singh, born in India and trained at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, CA, produced, directed and wrote (with Dan Gilroy, Nico Soultanakis, and Valery Petrov) this magical tale that blends fantasy, illusion, dreams, and altered reality with one of the more touching stories imaginable. The film takes many risks and for this viewer they all work. With only one other film ('The Cell') in his bag, this splendid work signals the arrival of a new Dali/Fellini/Bunuel figure in cinema. The setting is a hospital in Los Angeles sometime in the 1920s where a little immigrant girl Alexandria (the amazing Romanian child actress Catinca Untaru) is recovering from a broken arm. She waders the hospital looking for something to help her while away the hours and comes upon a kind patient Roy Walker (Lee Pace) who has been through numerous operations and is addicted to morphine. The two form a friendship through Roy's willingness to weave stories for Alexandria (much in the same vein as Scheherazade) and in Roy's stories the various patients and personnel of the hospital take on fantasy roles: there are five men (including Roy as the Blue Bandit) who are attempting to kill Governor Odious (Daniel Caltagirone) including Darwin (Leo Bill), the Mystic (Julian Bleach), Otta Benga (Marcus Wesley) and other fascinating characters. How the stories intertwine with Roy and Alexandria as friends and as victim of morphine abuse and supplier of the drug makes for a complex, multifaceted adventure that takes place in beautiful, strange locales throughout the world. How the relationship between Roy and Alexandria develops amidst all the surreal tales is the focus of the film. The cinematography (Colin Wilkinson), costumes (Eiko Ishioka) and musical score (Krishna Levy) enhance the beauty of the film, as does the transition into the creation of silent movies that opens and closes the film. There is more in this little film than one viewing could ever completely reveal. Visit it once and become as addicted to the magic as was the king to Scheherazade's endless tales.

10,zetes,Great,9,5 October 2008,"Reminiscent of The Wizard of Oz, The Princess Bride and Pan's Labyrinth. It's the story of two people convalescing in a hospital in 1910s Los Angeles. One is a foreign girl around 4 (Catinca Untaru), who fell from a ladder while picking oranges and broke her arm and collarbone, the other is a Hollywood stuntman (Lee Pace), who paralyzed himself during a stunt where he was to jump from elevated train tracks onto the back of a horse. He agreed to do this mainly so he could impress his ex-girlfriend, a movie starlet who has recently moved onto her co-star. Crippled and alone, he meets up with Untaru, and begins to weave a fantastic tale of bandits, a princess and an evil prince. The fantasy sequences are perhaps what this film will always be known for. Director Tarsem, a famous and popular director of music videos and television commercials, filmed these sequences all over the world when he was on location doing his other work. If you've studied architecture or archeology or art history, you'll recognize many of the locales he used. Basically, he used his own money to finance these expeditions, filming at some of the most beautiful places on the Earth. The fantasy world that is created in the film is pretty thin, and definitely just an excuse to create some beautiful images, but that works well narratively. After all, Pace is creating this story out of thin air, and the only person he's trying to impress is a four year-old girl. Plus, he's incorporating a lot of her ideas into the story. It is, after all, pretty much a bedtime story. The breathtaking images of the fantasy world may make the film memorable, but it is the emotional grip of the Los Angeles portion of the film that makes it a great movie. The Fall does have its flaws, mostly when Tarsem reverts to more commercial- and MTV-like sequences, as in one sequence with native dancers and a completely unnecessary dream sequence, but, in general, I was involved in the main story and in awe of the images I was seeing.",The Fall
11,Buddy-51,magical fantasy film,8,14 January 2009,"Filmed in over a dozen different countries, the gloriously exotic ""The Fall"" begins modestly enough in a Los Angeles hospital in 1915 where a young movie stuntman lies paralyzed, the result of a stunt gone awry during the filming of a silent western. Unable to leave his bed, Roy Walker strikes up a friendship with a 5-year-old fellow patient named Alexandria, a recent immigrant working in the local orange groves, who is recuperating with a broken arm. To pass the time, Walker takes on the role of a modern-day Sheherazade, regaling his little companion with a tall tale of heroes and villains set in the exotic world of the ancient Near East. Meanwhile, we discover that a more sinister motive may be lurking behind Walker's befriending of this innocent, trusting soul.""The Fall"" is really two movies in one - the outer film, involving the storyteller and his listener, and the inner one dramatizing the tale Walker is recounting. The former provides a sentimental and touching story of two hurting people from vastly different backgrounds who reach out to one another for friendship and support. The story-within-the-story, on the other hand, takes a little getting used to, since at first it seems like nothing more than hokey, early-movie melodrama essentially unrelated to the two main characters at hand. But then something truly miraculous occurs during the course of the film, as writer/director Tarsem Singh begins to meld his two seemingly disparate strands into a beautifully integrated and seamless thematic whole, blending realism and surrealism in a thoroughly unique and unceasingly imaginative way (the characters in Walker's fanciful story are derived from the various patients and staff at the hospital). Singh's mastery of color and design comes to the fore in this work, as he makes superb use of architecture, landscape, costuming, set decoration and cinematography to achieve his desired effects.Equally impressive are the quiet, intimate scenes set in the far more prosaic world of an infirmary where one of the characters has lost all will to live and the other has trouble differentiating fantasy from reality. Lee Pace and first-time Romanian actress Catinca Untaru are simply wonderful together as the damaged man and the inquisitive child, with Untaru, especially, tearing at the heartstrings with her refreshingly natural and utterly unmannered performance.A glorious paean to the healing powers of imagination, ""The Fall"" is one of those movies that it is virtually impossible to describe to someone who hasn't already seen it. It truly must be experienced first hand to be understood and appreciated. So without any further adieu, I recommend ""The Fall"" for your viewing pleasure.",The Fall
12,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Different and subversive, but sadly not to my tastes",4,15 February 2009,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In a mental health wards in 1920s Los Angeles, a young girl named Alexandria (Catinca Untaru) befriends a patient named Ray (Lee Pace) who tells her a tale of a group of men who set out to bring down a warlord who has wronged them all in some way. But as the tale goes on, the themes of the story start to blur with the realities of both Alexandria and Ray's life, and starts to reveal a truth both of them find hard to accept.If I were a stoner, my first thoughts on The Fall would be 'that was some fu*ked up sh!t man!' The name of Tarsem Singth is instantly recognizable as that of the man behind the 2000 Jennifer Lopez film The Cell and here he has been given free reign to indulge in his subversive fantasy world. The result is a weird and warped piece that gets by more with the visceral imagery of it rather than a discernible plot of some kind. It's a clever attempt by Singth to mould two stories that look like they're about to collide together and to create an air of suspense of what might be coming, but unfortunately the fantastical, far fetched plot line and characters failed to rub off on me and the end result was a film I actually failed to keep awake through. **",The Fall
13,MOscarbradley,Visually gorgeous but in this case it isn't enough.,6,19 May 2018,"Visually Tarsem Singh's ""The Fall"" is one of the most beautiful films ever made. The credit sequence, shot in slow motion and in black and white, is breathtaking and when it goes into full colour it is never less than gorgeous. It's a kind of Arabian Nights phantasia as Lee Pace's hospital patient, (he's an injured stuntman with suicidal tendencies), tells a series of tall tales to a another patient, a little girl with a broken arm, (an enchanting Catinca Untaru), The problem is the stories are too 'adult' for children, as are the sequences set in the hospital, and too inconsequential for an adult audience. However, imagery this beautiful is rare, (Singh shot the film in a number of world-wide locations), and if there isn't much here to tax the brain, the eye is constantly dazzled. Unfortuantely, in this case, that really isn't enough.",The Fall
14,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Bedtime stories.,6,17 August 2021,"'The Fall (2006)' is essentially, if I may borrow a phrase from a fellow reviewer, 'The Princess Bride (1986)' with a dash of assisted suicide. If that sounds dark, it's because it is, though the piece itself isn't overly dour. The basic plot surrounds a depressed, newly paraplegic stuntman whose broken heart is probably more damaging than his broken back and an innocent, curious Romanian girl who's stuck in hospital with her arm in a cast after falling while picking oranges. The former spends most of the movie tricking the latter into getting him the morphine he needs to end his own life, a selfish act that really does make him rather hard to root for. The girl, on the other hand, is a perfectly empathetic protagonist, unaware of the darker aspects of the man she has come to idolise for his penchant for storytelling. That story, an epic yarn of romance and betrayal, is loosely allegorical for the stuntman's recent life, and the flick explores it in a rather abstract fashion. Huge chunks of the picture are dedicated to this fictional story which, while visually distinct and often engaging, does suffer from the problem that it's presented as being fictional and, as such, doesn't really 'matter'. Of course, that isn't strictly true, but it's hard to stop that thought from creeping into your mind - especially during the thing's more indulgent sections. Though it's a bit slow and doesn't amount to all that much, the film is generally entertaining. It's definitely unique and has quite a lot going for it from an aesthetic point of view (including a short but brilliant stop-motion sequence). The emotional beats start to come together towards the end of the affair, too, and ultimately make the story feel worthwhile. It isn't brilliant, but it's decent and distinct. 6/10.",The Fall
15,gbill-74877,Gorgeous scenery,7,18 July 2020,"Visually there are so many beautiful scenes, and director Tarsem Singh more than does justice to the extraordinary places he takes us to. There is a touching story here, a story about story-telling, how stories transport us but are also invariably woven into our own minds and evolved by them. A little girl (Catinca Untaru) and early Hollywood stuntman (Lee Pace), both traumatized in their own way, make a connection in a hospital through a story he tells her over the course of the movie. Unfortunately, that story to me was less moving than I think it could have been, not living up to the interesting framework or gorgeous scenery, which took away from my engagement somewhat. The end sequence, showing a montage of some of the silent era's greatest stunts, is truly special though.",The Fall
16,cricketbat,Simply stunning!,10,16 August 2018,"The Fall is simply stunning! The visuals are amazingly beautiful, the story is compelling and the acting is superb. Lee Pace proves he's more than the Piemaker from Pushing Daisies and Catinca Untaru is so refreshing and real. It may be a bit artsy for some, but I feel that this film deserves much more praise and publicity!",The Fall
17,secondtake,"Whatever its limitations, it's an incredible journey and filmmaking milestone",10,11 February 2013,"The Fall (2006)Simply extraordinary. Yes, the child-like fable of a plot will leave some people restless, but there is so much else going on here it boggles the mind. The core of the movie is a young man in a Los Angeles hospital bed with a leg injury telling stories to a little girl who has broken her arm. Their interactions--many unscripted--are so warm and endearing you fall in love with both of them, especially the little girl (an amateur Romanian girl with natural camera ability).But the stories become the movie, in pieces, with characters from fairy tales in faraway places. It is these places that might steal the show--natural and ancient man-made wonders, filmed with such delicious rich color and spatial verve you gawk. In some cases it's so terrific you wonder if it's real--was CGI lyrically put to use? But I think not, not usually, and no matter, it's not meant to be real, but the best kind of dream.Our two characters appear in these dreams as well, and slowly all the many characters, many of them somewhat mystic and powerful, take on relationships with the reality of the hospital. I can't say more. The heart wrenching turning point comes when the girl quite literally tries to save our young man's life. There are small moments where you might be swept away and bewitched and yet slightly bored, too, which sounds impossible, but the themes in the second quarter of the film start to get redundant, and the characters, now familiar, have lost their novelty. But get past halfway and it intensifies. I can picture someday the director (Tarsem Singh, who funded it all himself) creating a director's cut which is always longer, and I'm hoping he might see the opposite benefit--a tighter film with the fat removed. It got to the end and despite my small and wandering doubts, I was blown away. There are some final twists of reality by the end, or a clarification of what we are really looking at, that make it yet more moving. And clever. And with a touch of cinema-worship thrown in, which always works for movie lovers. When it was over I wanted to see it again, if not today, someday. Don't miss it.",The Fall
18,ironhorse_iv,Watch it! Your eyes will reached orgasm by the visuals.,8,7 January 2013,"The story starts out in Los Angeles, 1915 where young Alexandria (Catinca Untaru), a Romanian-born child who is recovering from a broken arm. At the hospital, she meets and befriends bedridden movie stuntman Roy Walker (Lee Pace). Roy promises to tell her an epic tale if she helps him with stealing morphine so that he can attempt suicide. Roy's tale go like this, an evil ruler Odious has committed an offense against five heroes. Otta Benga- a slave, a Indian warrior, an Italian explosives expert Luigi, the surreal version of Charles Darwin, and lastly, the masked bandit AKA Roy. Each characters mirrors somebody, Alexanderia knows in real life. The stories become a collaborative tale to which Alexandria also contributes. Alexandria herself becomes a character: the daughter of the bandit. There is a heartful father to daughter relationship between them. During the shooting of the movie, Lee Pace, pretend on and off screen that he was an actual paraplegic to takes his role serious. Roy is in agony because of his injury, and it's no surprise that he gave the villain the name 'Odious' as it's mean hates. However, once he is forced to create art of his own (his story), he realizes that his other art (the movie) is worth the personal sacrifice. The use of Buster Keaton clips works well, as Keaton is well known for risking personal injury for his art. This is also why the scenes at the beginning and end are underscored with Beethoven's 7th--a piece that Beethoven composed in spite of his own injury (deafness). The child actor who played Alexandria stole this movie in my opinion. Cantica is adorable. She really inexperienced I might add as a actor as she never acted before, still able to be really engaging all things considered. She wasn't even a actress, the producers wanted a normal child. The realism of Cantica's performance is perfect; she isn't a kid reading lines, she's a kid reacting like a kid. The talk between Roy and her about throwing oranges at the priest is just funny and cute. Their chemistry is just so amazing. The screen writing is great. When Alexandria sees the story. Her experiences are limited and shown by great writing like the Indian. We learn late in the movie that her family knows and works with an Indian man. When Roy actually meant is 'Native American', she picture a Eastern Indian. The same can be said about Wallace the monkey. In the story, Charles get all his bright ideas from Wallace and steals it. In real life, Charles Darwin might have stolen ideas from Alfred Russell Wallace. We hear the film through Roy's words, but we see the story unfold through Alexandria's eyes. The inherently subjective nature of art is part of what makes it both beautiful and worth sharing, even if it means making significant personal sacrifice. It never mattered that the characters lacked any sort of substance, this isn't a story for adults, it's told to a little girl, a fantasy in more than one way, a ploy for pills as well as it's own story. Sometimes things just need to fall into a convenient place to move a story along. So to say it lacks deep characters or substance is to judge from the perspective of an adult. The plot is secondary, but I don't think that really makes the movie less impressive and since the movie is kinda meant to be from the point of view of a child, maybe it is better that the arc is simple, and obviously missing details. The time constraint can hurts while attempting to quickly create a narrative creates the strong visual drive of a music video, the stylistic choices that Tarsem makes in his full length films. He ends up making every moment sort of a sensory assault. It's proves you can make beautiful films without resorting to tons and tons of CGI. Watch the introcuts from the butterfly to the island, and the priest to the desert. That wasn't CGI there. As Roy become more depress, the story turns more and more deadly. The story of the film, started with a fall, and Roy incorporated that into the story he told with how the characters got their start and met their ends, illustrating just how much that fall had affected him mentally, not just physically. It was also used when the little girl fell off the counter and hurt herself, her fall being the catalyst, ironically, which pulled him out of his depression in the end. This series of scenes in the movie is a depiction of one man's struggle with depression and the voice of innocence that finally saves him. When he went all ""Hamlet"" on the characters is that he wanted to show her not all fairy tales and stories show people who live happily ever after, to prepare her for life that will not always be the way she wants it to be. But upon realizing that in this situation with her all injured and bandage, children do not need that kind of message at that moment in their lives when they are already experiencing it for themselves. Sometimes a bit of happy ending is good for them to experience and enjoy since they might not ever get it in real life and should savor it. It's good to see a movie that's made simply to be enjoyed. Director/ Writer Tarsem could have just written a film for adults with all the details and explanations for everything but that's not what the movie is about, it's not catering to any audience specifically. But this is a movie for everybody. The Fall tells us that great art is worth the sacrifice, and it conveys this message in the most beautiful way conceivable. The Fall is a masterpiece of the highest order, and you shouldn't dismiss it just because it doesn't spoon-feed its message to its audience. Give it a watch.",The Fall
19,paulclaassen,A visual treat like no other!,8,4 May 2019,"Wow, what stunning visuals and photography!! The incredible visuals in Tarsem Sing's first film 'The Cell' prompted me to watch 'The Fall', his second feature film. The visuals are even better then 'The Cell'. In fact, every scene is a masterpiece and visual treat. Tarsem certainly knows how to show off the male physique. And the costumes are sensational! To add to the film's unique style, the acting was also very natural, especially Catinca Untaru as the five-year old girl. She is FANTASTIC! She's also so adorable, she is bound to steal your heart.The film also has a very deep message, and for someone who has lost a close friend to suicide, this was very emotional as the story unfolded and the hero's intentions became clear.

20,eddie_baggins,A beautifully made hidden gem,8,27 July 2014,"A gem of a movie that remains largely and strangely unseen even these 8 years on from its original release, Tarsem Singh's 2006 film The Fall which is proudly presented to the public by Spike Jonze and David Fincher is a unique and often startling tale which features some of the most dazzling imagery of modern cinema and a story that while ultimately quite simple is emotionally affecting.Director Tarsem Singh has subsequently gone on to make the Hollywood films Immortal's and Mirror Mirror and one feels that those films were won thanks to his efforts behind the camera here but while those films were solid and ultimately forgettable pretty pictures, the Fall showcases a whole different side to Singh which gives off the feeling that one day the molding of his visual sense and the added effect of a truly rounded story will combine to create something even stronger than his efforts here. In The Fall Singh presents at a very high frequency images that will last long in the memory from Elephants swimming in the open seas through to a burning carriage in a forlorn desert, many scenes in this artistically beautiful tale could be transported straight into a painting. The Fall while largely formed around these impressive vistas and set pieces is also transcended to greater heights thanks to some fantastic acting and very lovable characters.Centring an at its core quite dark tale around young actress Catinca Untaru as injured girl Alexandria and her friendship with fellow hospital patient and internally haunted stunt man Roy Walker played by the charismatic Lee Pace (who won his role in the Hobbit trilogy on the back of his performance here) could have been a movie killing move by Singh but both these actors are up for the task with Untaru in particular creating one of the most memorable child performances of the last decade showing a great range of emotion and likability within a girl that has her own demons to deal with. The on screen relationship between these two characters is a real strong point and showcases that Singh has the ability to handle his actors as well as he does his visuals.With outstanding cinematography from Colin Watkinson, fine direction by a very talented director who has much still to give and well-acted by its cast of largely unknowns, it's not hard to see why The Fall is held in such high esteem by many that have caught it and a rating inching towards a rounded 8 on IMDb showcases that this film has many fans the world over. For something completely different and for something consistently beautiful, The Fall is the movie you are seeking and even with these years on from its original release a blast of fresh air in the world of movies.4 butterfly islands out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check into - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",The Fall
21,Rectangular_businessman,"Much better than ""The Cell""",8,16 June 2010,"Fall as a pretty but vacant vanity project rather than celebrating Tarsem Singh's daring, monstrously ambitious independent achievement. My initial impression was, ""oh, it's just Baraka with a plot."" And a plot already too familiar from classic ""meta""-fantasies like The Princess Bride and The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, at that. But the ingenuity with which Singh toys with the devices of story, storyteller, and audience almost make it a ""kiddie"" Adaptation. Moreover, the bleeding of grim reality into fantasy qualifies The Fall as a lighter (though not by much) companion to Pan's Labyrinth and Northfork.There's enough substance here for several movies, and countless sly borrowings, yet The Fall rarely feels pretentious or symbolically overstuffed. It's light, accessible, and an absolute delight for the eyes. Any inconsistencies in acting, tone, narrative, and design are cleverly explained away by the creative tug-of-war between storytellers with very different frames of reference and states of mind. I thought the inevitable cultural dissonance between the stuntman and the immigrant girl was especially well handled. And it needs to be said again and again what an amazing find 10 year-old Romanian actress Cantinca Untaru was. The Fall simply would not have worked without her.",The Fall

Still to the day, The Cell is the one true masterpiece he made.",The Fall

24,Chris Knipp,A film for devotees of bizarre and exquisite imagery,9,6 June 2008,"'The Fall' has an endless series of incredibly exotic and beautiful visuals and deserves to be seen just for that. Tarsem (Singh)'s use of oddly contrasting main characters and costumes recalls Alejandro Jodorovsky, and the mélange of seldom-seen people and places mimics the late-career cinematic working methods of Pier Paolo Pasolini. The trompe l'oeil landscapes-into-faces obviously evoke some of the paintings of Salvador Dali. The director previously made 'The Cell' (2000), a darker film with an equally intense focus on bizarre fantasy and a blurred interface between reality and the visions of the unconscious.Even Tarsems' two main characters--on whose appeal the success of the frame story depends--are again a study in exotic contrasts. They are a burly, boyishly appealing American stunt man named Roy (Lee Pace) and a preternaturally articulate but heavily accented little Romanian girl, Alexandria (Catinca Untaru), like him injured in a fall (he, off a bridge; she, from an orange tree). They develop an offbeat friendship in a hospital. He tells her stories, which constitute the colorful side of the movie and are also an elaborate allegory or dream-vision about his own life, at least in that the evil ruler he describes, Governor Odius (Daniel Caltagirone) is his real-life love rival, a silent film star named Sinclair--and as time goes on many of the characters in the fantasy stories begin to turn up in the hospital as staff or visitors. Eventually the two realities slip into and out of each other with more and more dizzying regularity.The present-time setting after all is exotic too, and production designer Ged Clarke's most lavish contribution to the project. It's an early twentieth-century California hospital staffed by Catholic nuns. Lying in his bed there, Roy, the apparently paralyzed stunt man, tells Alexandria the tales of a set of men with revenge wishes toward the evil Odius. One of this band of warriors is Roy. The rest, who may also be manifestations of him, are: an Indian (Jeetu Verma) , an Italian explosives wizard (Robin Smith), a magnificent black ex-slave called Otta Benga (Marcus Wesley), Charles Darwin (Leo Bill), accompanied by his shy, genius pet monkey, Wallace; and (sometimes) a wild-eyed fakir (Julian Bleach). The main fantasy costumes are brilliantly conceived by the fashion designer Eiko Ishioka.Roy's purpose is to use his storytelling, Sheherezade-style, as a cliff-hanging device to coax Alexandria into stealing morphine from the dispensary, with which he intends to commit suicide, though at first she doesn't know that. Nothing is clear and nothing is resolved in the present. Eventually the ""real time"" events progressively come to seem as surreal as Roy's narratives. It's not clear to me for what purpose these stories were ultimately conceived by Tarsem and his writers Dan Gilroy and Nico Soultanakis, other than to provide the framework for the astonishingly beautiful fantasies, mostly depicting confrontations and battles both spiritual and physical. There is some ugly violence and yet it's all beautiful. Everything is aestheticized. Even blood is gorgeous. Red is a pretty color, after all. Certain landscapes and architectural wonders linger in the mind, though sometimes what happens in them is overshadowed by one's curiosity about what the location was, of the 26 in ""over 18 countries"" that were used by the patient Tarsem, who took years to make this, and funded it out of his own money. There are many falls; there is much talk of butterflies. One of the film's tour-de-force transitions moves from a butterfly into a landscape in a lepedopteral shape. Darwin's monkey, by the way, is a skillful lepidopterist. Among the astonishing visual tricks, at one point the slave Otta Benga's back is completely filled with long arrows, and he falls over backward and is suspended above ground on them. A wedding in a large spectacular oriental-baroque building is ornamented by whirling dervishes: Tarsem and his cinematographer, Colin Watkinson, have as keen a sense of architecture as of landscape, and every images is beautifully composed. The revengers are at first stuck on a little island but are rescued by a small elephant: they and the elephant are beautiful seen underwater. In front of a palace in the Far East a big red ""teardrop"" design Talbot Largo lives up to its reputation as ""the most beautiful car in the world."" A friendly black man delivers ice to the hospital from a tiny truck and teases Alexandria for trying to lick it. (He turns out to be Otta Benga in an earthly form.) There is more and more and yet it never seems too much because it is all so gorgeous, and because constant returns to Roy and Alexandria bring us back to earth, as in the 1981 Bulgarian film 'Yo Ho Ho' (to which this owes a debt) and Dennis Potter's 'The Singing Detective.' It seems some sequences don't mesh properly. If that's because Alexandria and Roy re-imagine the storyline, images trump logic in an emotionally logical way--if without final resolution.Little Alexandria is appealing and Untaru may become a wonderful adult actress, but her speech is sometimes garbled and hard to follow; some of the dialog with Ropuy is awkwardly improvised at cross purposes. The latter scenes between the invalid pals become increasingly maudlin, weepy, and sad, and that sadness has already become hard to care about because it's out of focus, and even comic at times.In the NY Times Nathan Lee off-puttingly declared that ""'The Fall' is a genuine labor of loveand a real bore."" I didn't take it that way. It's no more a bore than Jodorovsky. And it has more humanity. But there's no doubt that the audacious and beautiful staging of the fantasy scenes outweighs the narrative value of the movie. A ""bore"" for some, perhaps, this will be a cult classic for others. It has few equals. As a visual stunner it can hardly be too highly rated.Released in the US May 9, 2008 (111 theaters).",The Fall
25,strong-122-478885,"Googly, Googly, Go Away!",5,24 August 2015,"After watching ""The Fall"" (with its impressive-to-look-at visuals, but, its decidedly incoherent and screwed-up storyline), I have to say that I sure as hell hope that Indian director, Tarsem Singh, doesn't turn out to be yet another dingbat movie-maker like M. Night Shyamalan (who, yes, indeed, is also from India).I mean, that's definitely the last thing that Hollywood Heaven needs is another foreign film-maker whose films are all style and zero content (or, more appropriately, all awe and no wonder).I found that (with ""The Fall"") Singh so clearly did not understand how to skilfully meld fantasy with reality and emerge with a tale of the fantastic that speaks with reasonable intelligence to an audience of thinking adults.From my point of view, ""The Fall"" flip-flopped so often (and so clumsily) between dead serious and senseless frivolity that, before long, my patience grew really thin and I ended up watching the remainder of this film's striking cinematography in fast-forward mode.",The Fall
26,arthur_tafero,Promising Director - Tarsem Singh - The Fall,6,11 May 2019,"There is a lot to like in this film. The cinematography and art direction are top of the line. The homage to the silent film stunt men, Buster Keaton, and All Quiet on the Western Front are beautifully done to a wonderful classic music selection by Beethoven. It is surrealistic in half the film, and neo-realistic in the other half. This causes more than a few problems. The subjects of violence, violent death, romantic love, drug addiction, suicide and depression are probably not appropriate subjects for young children, like the one depicted in the film. The film is a visual and artistic treat for adults, but the audience should be just that; adults. The film is not suitable for children under 12 in any way. Even though there are no overt sex scenes, the suggested violence is actually worse than sex scenes for children. If Singh intended the film for adults only or at least for those over 12, then he has a wonderful future as an original, promising director. But if he expects to have children gawk at this story, I would have to put him in the class of Roman Polanski; and that would not be a good class to be in. I, like the little girl in the film, believe in the better nature of human beings; so I will give him the benefit of the doubt and a better than average rating.",The Fall

It is quite an experience to behold.",The Fall
28,truemythmedia,Lucios Production Design and Cinematography,10,27 February 2020,"As often seems to happen, some strange confluence of forces weaves its way through the film scene every once in a while and taps into some zeitgeist or commonality within studios, filmmakers, and writers to create two similar movies releasing nearly at the same moment. ""Dante's Peak"" and ""Volcano,"" ""Skyscraper"" and ""Rampage"", and ""Armageddon"" and ""Deep Impact"" to name some of the more prominent examples.Here's a strange one, though, that I had no clue of until I saw ""The Fall"" and realized its remarkable similarity to ""Pan's Labyrinth."" Both are films in which a young girl is swept up in circumstances she doesn't understand, cut off from her parents, and finds solace in a fantasy world, and best of all, they are both beautiful films with great acting and emotional moments which will truly move the audience.The film opens with some beautiful slow-motion black and white shots of what looks like an old west scene on a bridge with a train and team of men trying to haul something up out of the water in the river below. It turns out that this is actually a movie set but a real rescue of a stunt actor who has taken a fall.Roy (Lee Pace, ""Guardians of the Galaxy""), the stuntman, meets a young immigrant girl, named Alexandria, who is in the same hospital as him, with a broken arm. The young man befriends her and begins telling her an Epic tale by which she is quickly entranced to the extent that he can convince her to steal Morphine for him in exchange for more story. It seems that Roy's intentions to overdose into suicide are completely over her head and that the story is doomed to end in tragedy.From the opening moments of the film to the connection between Roy and Alexandria to the strength they both find in each others love and stories, I was hopelessly in love with this movie, beginning to end.To begin with, the visuals are stunning. Not only do we have a 1920s hospital, film crew, and movie stars captured in all their ragged and pompous reality, we get a fantasy realm imagined by a little girl that could not feel more exotic and far flung if you were a child of the same era reading ""1001 Arabian Nights"" yet woven with childlike simplicity and earnestness throughout. The stunning production design and costuming are most likely the thing that would have made this movie jump off the video store shelf at you were you to happen upon it.The acting, while somewhat ho-hum form Lee Pace, is counteracted by a brilliant performance from Catinca Untaru who plays Alexandria. Her eyes of excitement and hope, delighted squees, and pleading tears are the heart of a movie that could otherwise have been termed as style over substance. There are wonderful themes at work in this film but it all would fall flat without this one little girl who has never been in anything else of note. In fact I would say that the heroine in this film is far more compelling than the one in ""Pan's Labyrinth.""The themes of the film are less than focused but not in a way that seems aimless. It seems more that they are surfacing for air every once in a while and we see them in more obvious way but they are always swimming underneath the surface of whatever scene, whether in the real world or in the Epic tale. Of course, there are themes of love's redeeming power for those who are broken but also the power of story to lift the human spirit which has been bruised.As a cinephile, I especially appreciated the not to cinema's power to immortalize even if it was a bit heavy handed. I'm sure not lovers of cinema would find it to be a strange way to end a film but then, if you aren't a lover of movies, you probably wouldn't be watching this film or reading this review.I definitely would describe this movie as fitting into that category of film I am always on the lookout for. Films that are beautiful yet true in their depiction of hardship and pain are rare and even more so are films which do so in such a way that seeks to elevate the human spirit itself from the doldrums of what we call normal life into those brief moments wherein we glimpse something less tangible than the simple realities which confront us day to day.Film has a tremendous power to hint at the expanse of the human interior which we so often neglect not only in each other but in ourselves as well. This film accomplishes this spectacularly whether you identify more with a little girl pleading for a hurting man to not give up or with a man so hurt and broken that he sees no way forward this is a film that will have you believing that there is another chapter to the story and one worth writing, at that.",The Fall
29,AudioFileZ,Dreaming In Technicolor...Amazing!,9,10 July 2009,"First off, kudos to Tarsem Singh (director), Colin Watkinson (cinematography), Dan Gilroy/Nico Soultanakis (writers), Cantinca Untara and Lee Pace (actress/actor) for bringing what, for the life of me, seems more like a dream than a film. Spectacular, and that's an understatement.Set in 1920's Hollywood and taking place in a hospital the story revolves around a seriously injured hospitalized stuntman who has lost his will to live. He finds redemption by manipulating a poor immigrant child, also a patient, who helps him realize the value of love is never based on that traditional relationship of a man and a woman. It's much bigger and will certainly be peppered with pain and failure which only makes it richer if you just don't give in to human frailty.The brief synopsis I just wrote though is woefully inadequate in describing the grandeur of this light epic. It's as if your most colorful and fanciful dream has come to life in living color. You must simply see it because words fail to describe it. How anyone got this so right and so engaging is beyond me. Truly one of the best films I've ever seen and it's not even that deep on the surface, but, of course, one can study it from now on and get deeper and deeper truths which, in the end makes it quite amazing.I guess some will dismiss it while others will be deeply engaged. I'm in the later group as you can tell. I would bet more fall into the later group too as this is a true joy to watch. If you missed it in the theaters like I did you will be extremely thankful you have a second chance. As I stated earlier, quite amazing!",The Fall
30,Samiam3,"Beautiful movie, clumsy story",5,10 August 2010,"It is disappointing that the sheer beauty of The Fall ends up going to waste because the story is not on the same level of competence or solidity. Like The Princess Bride, The Fall is a story within a story. It's about a stuntman in a hospital with a broken leg. One afternoon he befriends a six year old Spanish girl, who has a broken arm. He promises to tell her a grand epic fable if she fetches his meds (of which he could be taking way too many)The Princess Bride was focused almost entire on the story within the story. The Fall tries to balance both. For a good hour, it is delightful, but after ward, things get messy as director Tarsem Singh tries to blur the line between the real world and the storybook world. It gets distracting, and draws way too much attention to itself. What might have helped is if both portions of the story were equally appealing. Uunfortunately, the real-world portion is too devoid of the kind of heart and soul that The Princess Bride lives on. The Fall is a gorgeous exercise in art, and an explosion of color, shape and size, but it becomes too hard a story to invest in or care for, and is subsequently disappointing.",The Fall

32,richard-1787,"Astounding visuals, lame story",5,4 June 2008,"I went to see this movie despite a poor review in the local paper because the previews I saw contained some of the most beautiful and remarkable photography I had ever seen. As it turns out, this is really two movies, one inside the other. The ""outer"" movie is a forgettable Hallmark Hall of Fame type drama about a Hollywood stuntman who has lost his girl and wants to commit suicide. He regains a will to live because of the affection of a young girl. Obvious and uninteresting.The ""inner"" movie is quite otherwise, however. The stuntman, in the hospital with the young girl, tells her a story that she visualizes using people in her own life (yes, just like the Wizard of Oz). Her visualizations are both gorgeous, with astounding and vibrant color, and wildly imaginative, producing images worthy of a great surrealist painter.The team who produced the visualization sequences should be gathered back together to make a full-length feature film containing more of the same. The writers who produced the script for this movie should be banned from further participation in film. If ever there were a film that would be better with the sound off, this is it.",The Fall
33,bkrauser-81-311064,"Pretension, Thy name is Tarsem Singh",2,27 August 2016,"I will make a bold prediction. By the end of director Tarsem Singh's career, he will make at least one great film. One film that will not only be visually resplendent but a critical masterpiece worthy of immortality. One film which will be lovingly fawned over and studied like it were a chiseled Roman statue or a carefully cobbled mosaic. One movie that will invariably label the director ahead of his time and color his earlier films gems unrealized by contemporary audiences.Why do I think this? Well despite all of his films being overly indulgent garbage, it's the kind of overly indulgent garbage that critics and academics trying desperately to seem smart will automatically gravitate towards. In a visual medium, Singh is a visual thinker and has the dexterity and technical know-how to create a truly unforgettable tableaux from frame to frame. Yet he's never the original scribe of his own films projects and depends too much on sloppy editing. These choices harpoon his ambitions and sabotage any real chance his films have to surmount their other minor problems.Take The Fall for example. The plot of the film revolves around an injured, possibly paralyzed stuntman who befriends an innocent little girl while wasting away on a hospital bed. Roy (Pace) manipulates Alexandria (Untaru) into smuggling morphine for him so he can end his life. He tries to accomplish this by telling a nebulous fairy-tale to keep the young girl entertained as she herself recovers from a broken arm. In the fairy-tale a gallery of rogues are all seeking revenge on a nefarious regional governor who has wronged them all in some way.Every once in a while, a list will worm its way out of cyberspace, enumerating history's most visually impressive films. The Fall seems to always appear as a special mention and with good reason. The striking natural vistas and pre-industrial urbanity that Singh captures over a rumored four year shooting schedule are simply breathtaking. Not a single set was built in service of The Fall. Instead Singh shot the film in 28 different countries and searched for the most surreal, mystical and colorful places on the globe, scouring the blue city- scape of Jodhpur, the reefs of Fiji and the deserts of Namibia for the perfect shot. The travel was not in vain either. Anyone impressed by the sleek green-screen produced mayhem of this year's Jungle Book (2016) should give The Fall a look then stick their head in a bucket of cold water.Yet even the least discerning of movie viewers will shift in their seats in dismay over the wooden dialogue and boring characters. The story of the stuntman and the little girl aches from the pains of a clichéd story made empty and hollow. This is despite the young Catinca Untaru aptly balancing loquaciousness with curiosity in a way few child actresses reasonably can. The story within the story is likewise airless and hollow suffocating the grandeur of the film like dead air on the radio. Lee Pace as a narrator doesn't help things, lacing his tall tale with a deadpan delivery so simpering and pathetic that it can vicariously make any audience miserable.The screenplay written by Dan Gilroy and Nico Soultanakis preens with the pretentious, preachy quality of an Oliver Stone film only it doesn't have the luxury of interesting characters. There's an excess of feeling and sweeping, grandiose emotions yet the images paired with dialogue feel like their speaking something important and urgent but in two undecipherable languages.Tarsem Singh seems to do the impossible with this film, he manages to be both a bore and boorish. Usually the man's intensity and bluster is enough to at least make films like Immortals (2011) and The Cell (2000) interesting (if not unintentionally hilarious); not this time I'm afraid. I wanted to like this film and perhaps in the years to come, The Fall will go through a reevaluation. I suspect it will take Tarsem Singh writing his own screenplay, digging deep into the recesses of his own soul to get a film truly worthy of consideration thus putting his filmography in the limelight. I for one will need a lot of convincing before I give this wannabe Federico Fellini that kind of change of heart. Sorry, being pretty just doesn't cut it.",The Fall

She was so innocent, curious and sweet that I just fell in love with her character. I was wrapped into both the story being told and what was going on in their real situations. The writing was well scripted and clever.I understood the movie was about ""Roy"" initially wanting to manipulate ""Alexandria"" into helping him commit suicide after his accident left him paralyzed and he was heartbroken over a woman. I also understand that after ""Alexandria's"" fall, he realized that he was wrong to have used ""Alexandria"" the way he had. As he killed off the characters in his story, ""Alexandria's"" begging that he not kill off himself put him in the position to promise he wouldn't, therefore erasing his suicidal tendencies.When ""Alexandria"" is released from the hospital, she clearly idolizes ""Roy"" and sees him as someone amazing and that was a sweet way to end her point of view. My dissatisfaction comes from not really understanding what happened with ""Roy"". Was he not really paralyzed? Was he able to return to movies or were the movies that ""Alexandria"" watched simply movies that he had made before his accident? I didn't fully understand that and I had to take a couple points away for that.However, it was a beautifully filmed movie. The colors were rich and I swear that they must have shot the whole movie in natural lighting. I say that because it seemed to lack that glossed over look.

Also, the plot is magnificent and definitely different from many similarly schemed movies that are distributed each and every year. Unfortunately, for me the film feeled a bit to quiet. I understand that this man is broken-hearted and really on the edge of a depression but still the film could have used some more tension and twists. As it is, this is a beautiful story of a broken love, but it doesn't keep you on the edge of your chair.All in all it is nonetheless definitely worth a watch.

I had this feeling it'd be some type of artsy-fartsy flick and that I'd be making a lousy mistake by spending 8 bucks on it. Actually 18. I bought the Nacho Combo. Well, I'm telling you this, The Fall was a fantastic film, and if you're on the fence about seeing it, get off it and go see The Fall. Oh and to the fat kid who took my ticket, ""It's a really weird movie."" What the hell are you talking about fatass? It ain't weird in the slightest. Fat crap.Story focuses on a unique relationship between an injured and depressed Stuntman and a charming, bright lil girl. Our bed-ridden stuntman begins to tell our lil leading lady a story, an epic story, about the story of a group of bandits who all share the same goal. Revenge. With him telling the story, our little actress is the one visualizing it. And with a child visualizing the story, only rich imagination follows. And this is what leads this story into classic territory.The Fall could be the most beautiful looking film I've ever seen. Films like What Dreams May Come, or even a film like Apocalypto, have this unique style and feel about them that truly feels gorgeous. This is like that, but above it at the same time. With unbelievable sets and fantastic cinematography, it's really something else altogether. It's the film's real star, but little Cantica Untaru is a very, very close second. Her ability to act at such a young age is ridiculous. Some has to be some type of improv, because her acting feels so innocent and genuine. Either way, fantastic job casting this lil girl.This is a movie most people should really enjoy. It has serious issues of life and death, but it also has great charm and an adventure tale that keeps you entertained. A great date movie for sure, and just an amazing labor of love.

Young Alexandria uses what she knows to encompass herself into the fairy tale as her new friend Roy weaves a yarn of intrigue, not to lift the child's spirits, but instead for his own selfish gains.A big part of the film can be seen in the line from Pace's Roy, ""Are you trying to save my soul?"" He jokes it after Alexandria gives him some food she stole, a Eucharist from the hospital chapel, yet we as an audience know the truth behind those words. While this Spanish girl is really only attempting to connect with someone that will give her attention and friendship after breaking her arm working the orange groves, she is unintentionally doing just that. She is giving this man a reason to live, whether he realizes it himself or even wants it at all. Injuring himself with a suicide attempt on set of his new movie, this stunt man may be on the mend, but his heart is still broken from his girlfriend leaving for the film's star. Still desperately trying to find a way to end his life, Roy begins to tell a story of a battle against insurmountable odds, a group of five bandits looking for revenge and not caring what happens to them in order to achieve it. Always stopping short, ""at the best parts, when the story gets beautiful,"" as Alexandria says in her broken English, Roy begins to use the girl in order to acquire pills for which to overdose on. He feels bad for his ruse and doesn't want the young girl to see him in his current state, but the pain of his heart is too much to bear.Visually stunning, the art direction is breathtaking. I don't care what bad things I've heard about Tarsem's first film The Cell, I need to see it as soon as possible based solely on the artistry displayed here. Right from the start we are treated to the credit sequence in slow motion, black and white beauty. Unaware in the moment of what it is exactly we are seeing, the subtle melancholy of the sequence is unshakable as we begin our entry into the real world at a convalescence hospital. The imagery stays with you, though, and shortly you are transported back into that world of intrigue with Eastern influences, vast dunes of sand, labyrinthine temples and cities, and clear, crisp imagery choreographed with a technical genius. Every character in the story comes from a different part of the world with a specific skill and culture. We have the African slave, the Indian swordsman, Charles Darwin and his monkey Wallace, the Teddy Roosevelt-esquire explosive specialist, the mystic seeker brought forth from a burning tree, and our hero, the masked bandit. Each costume is crafted with care and grace, filling the frame with a sumptuous beauty to mesmerize you for the duration and allow the separation between this fabricated reality for the dreary one of pain and solitude always waiting to come back outside their minds.While my eyes were treated to a gorgeous display, thankfully my mind was not left behind. One may anticipate this being a children's film, a world of make believe as two souls come together in order to save each other. On the surface this fact can be agreed upon, however, this is a very dark tale that, maybe undeserving of its R-rating, pulls no punches as far as showing the cruelty of the world, rather than sugar-coating a message into the proceedings. As Roy says, ""everything dies."" This is a very true statement and Tarsem never shies from showing the reality of that situation when necessary. Both in the real world and that of imagination, we are shown instances that are very difficult to watch. Emotionally draining at times, this is not your run-of-the-mill cautionary tale; it will tear your heart out and show you the pain that exists inside of Roy. Complete with a scene of stop-motion animation, showing us the inner workings of Alexandria's mind in duress, this film takes you to the edge and sometimes over.These moments of emotional weight hinge on the stellar performances of all involved; most importantly those of Pace and Catinca Untaru. Pace has the range to play the fictional hero fighting against the evil Governor Odious and still be the broken man, bedridden and finished with life. And Untaru shows an immense sense of realism as this Spanish girl listening to a tale of wonderment, dealing with issues of loss and sacrifice, complete with a very tenuous grasp on the English language. What at times seems too natural, her quizzical looks when not understanding what Pace says to her and therefore just smiling or repeating herself, becomes utter genius when we catch her lying to both mother and doctor as she plays translator between them. The poise, grace, and abundance of life, (both to smile and to cry), is unbelievable and without her, this film wouldn't have been near as good as it is. The two have a brilliant rapport, causing the audience to giggle at their language gap and tongue-in-cheek moments when the story is shown to be just that, ever changing as the tellers evolve it, and to feel the bond being forged. With a climax that is difficult to watch, yet utterly entrancing through the tears and anger being let out, The Fall never ceases to amaze and I cannot wait to immerse my entire being into this magical world again.",The Fall
40,fwomp,A Visual Feast For The Eyes...,9,20 February 2009,"THE FALL is going to rank up there as one of the most visually stunning films you've probably never heard of. Filmed in India, France, Romania, Indonesia, Africa, Italy, the Maldives, Turkey, Nepal, Egypt, China, the Czech Republic, Fiji, Indonesia, and the U.S., the film's broad leaps from continents and countries makes for some incredible shots that fall across the screen time and again.Combining both child-like fantasy and human frailty, the story is seen through the eyes of a child named Alexandria (unknown 9-year-old starlet Catinca Untaru). Recovering at a hospital in 1920s Los Angeles, she stumble upon a severely injured stuntman named Roy (Lee Pace, THE GOOD SHEPHERD). Roy wants nothing more than to end his now miserable existence by overdosing on morphine. And he sees a way to get it when Alexandria comes to him as a friend. He regales her with a fantastical story about bandits, adventurous scientists and freed slaves. We, the audience, view the storytelling through the mind of Alexandria as she interprets what Roy tells her, making for some pretty lighthearted moments. But mixed amongst them is the seriousness of what Roy wants from her: for her to get a bottle of medicine so he can commit suicide.As the story Roy tells her comes to a close, and he becomes more desperate for the drugs, Alexandria ""falls"" and re-injures herself while trying to obtain the medication Roy wanted in order to end his life. Adding to her injuries, Roy must finish the story by telling her who lives and who dies, but Alexandria isn't ready for that ""fall"". Is Roy ready? That, as they say, is where the real story rests, and where the real story ends.The acting isn't stellar by any means, but the sweeping vistas, amazing dissolves, and nearly painted-on, picture-perfect shots will have most watchers' mouths gaping. The intimacy of the story and how it unfolds also adds an emotional uniqueness that will probably surprise most viewers. I know I was.If you want something that's a stunning spectacle in the style of THE CELL and CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, then you'll gobble up The Fall.",The Fall
41,innocuous,"Not a masterpiece, but wonderful....",9,20 April 2010,"I usually read quite a few of the other comments before I make my own. In the case of ""The Fall,"" it seems like the only truly negative comments are about (1) a lack of clarity in the young lead actress' diction, and (2) the ""simplicity"" or lack of depth in the story. I might agree a bit with the former, but it's not intolerable and it certainly fits in with the character and her age. (It's amusing how often the lead actor says ""What?"" to her, as he also has difficulty understanding her from time to time.) As far as the second complaint, I don't think it has much merit. The story is a simple one, true, but it has many levels of understanding and you really have to put yourself in the place of a five-year-old to appreciate the subtleties. Unlike many young characters in recent movies, this girl is definitely not a miniature adult, with wisdom and understanding far beyond her years. She is naive and inexperienced, translating the story she hears into her own visions and simply failing to appreciate the ulterior motives and experiences of others. There's nothing purely ""simple"" about that. Some of the commenters here on this site (and on several other sites) are clearly uncomfortable with being reminded about what it's like to be that age and have to cope with adults.Enough has been said elsewhere about the visuals in this film. Believe me when I tell yo that they will not disappoint.Highly recommended...if you're not in denial about what being young is actually like.",The Fall
42,moviesleuth2,LIke a dream,8,28 November 2008,"Dream sequences from movies are always shown differently from the dominant story lines, whether its through different filming techniques, or if they're really inventive, bizarre costumes and settings. Most of the latter are so visually tantalizing that they are usually some of the more memorable sequences of the movie, and leave you wanting more. Director Tarsem has a special gift for audiences who see his new film, ""The Fall:"" half of the movie is like this.Alexandria (Catinca Untaru) is in the hospital with a broken arm. By accident, she meets and makes friends with a fellow patient, Roy Walker (Lee Pace). Roy entertains the little girl with an epic tale about five bandits on a quest to defeat Governor Odious (David Caltagirone). But Roy has some darker motives for telling this tale.Our dreams are influenced by our reality, so it makes sense that the tale, as seen through Alexandria's imagination, is heavily influenced by her reality (most obviously by the characters being played by people at the hospital). However except in a few instances, this is not very clear because we do not see the connection between some of the characters in reality and their alter-egos in the tale. Still, the overall influence is clear enough to show what Tarsem wants to show.Typically in a film where there are two story lines running at the same time, one of the stories (usually the most visually interesting one) is shown more at the expense of the other. ""The Fall"" is different. It's actually the story between Roy and Alexandria that takes up the bulk of the film. This isn't as big of a problem as one might think because their story is the more compelling one, believe it or not. Still, it shortchanges the ""epic tale,"" which hurts both that storyline, and the film overall. More importantly, I was left wanting more. Tarsem had the same problem with his previous film, ""The Cell."" I think what happened is that Tarsem understands the temptation to spend more time on the more visual story than the other one, so he overcompensated. The problem is that he went a little to far and the film is slightly off balance.Like ""The Cell,"" the visuals are astounding, even in the Roy/Alexandria story. The fantasy sequences look straight out of a magazine ad, and it works. They are bizarre, but in an other-worldly sort of way. After six years from ""The Cell"" (four of those working on this film), Tarsem clearly has not lost his touch with costumes or scenery. While they are not as ""out there"" as they were in his previous film, which is saying a lot, they fit perfectly.""The Fall"" is highly recommendable, and a feast for the eyes and the mind.Note: I don't understand how this film was given an ""R"" rating. There is no justification for it. There is minimal violence, all of which is stylized but not graphic. There are are a few disturbing images, but not enough to warrant such a stiff rating, especially since like the violence in the film, they are heavily stylized. This is clearly PG-13 material.",The Fall
43,griffolyon12,An Adult Kid's Movie,10,24 July 2010,"It's kind of weird to say, but is it possible for there to be such a thing as an adult kid's movie? I mean, a movie that is styled like a kid's movie, but deals with subject matter above and beyond a child audience? I think that is what Tarsem's movie, The Fall, is. It is an enchanting experience, capturing everything that I've ever loved about kid's movies, but in a package that was clearly targeted towards adults.Roy is a Hollywood stuntman in the Golden Age of Hollywood, a man scorned by the love of a movie starlet. Roy has had an accident on set and found himself in a hospital pitying himself over the loss of his love. Here Roy meets a young girl named Alexandria, who has a broken arm. Alexandria and Roy strike up a friendship as Roy starts telling her this epic fantasy/adventure story about five men hunting down a murderous governor. As the story is told Alexandria blends people from her reality into the fairy tale, to where this story becomes real to her. But as we soon learn, Roy tries to bend Alexandria's desire to finish the story to his means to get him meds so he can kill himself.The Fall is a movie that is at times, fun, at times frightening, and at other times sad. Like the great epics of cinema history, The Fall is a heartfelt movie that steadily drives forward to reach maximum emotional connection, but it is a movie that is brusque and rough at times. Alexandria catches glimpses of the adult world, these glimpses coming both in the fairy tale told to her by Roy and through her watching people around the hospital. It's a movie that keeps things like death and love mysteries, as they were when we were children, and it is these mysteries that keep one as an adult enthralled (cause are we any closer to solving them).Actor Lee Pace plays Roy with utmost pity, and his performance is one that will be lost on many, being one of those performances that is consistent throughout but never has a real wow moment, but I for one was quite impressed by his skill and range. Lots can be said about little Catinca Utaru, who portrays Alexandria, she is cute as anything, wide-eyed, and innocent, and when she cries she breaks your heart. These two actors are the anchor to the whole movie, and I think it is why the fairy tale story spun by Roy has all the more resonance, when the fairy tale world and reality collide in Alexandria's mind.Director Tarsem Singh's movie is filled with lush visuals of astonishing lands that are almost too fantastic to be real, but no CGI. This movie is epic, and what makes it all the more sweeping is that everything you see was done in camera. On a technical level, this is one of the most technically astounding movies I've ever seen. The cinematography is beautiful, the action well choreographed, and the blocking of scenes works to a point of visual perfection that few directors manage to do.So I love this movie. The Fall is a fantastic cinematic achievement that has to be experienced. It's ethereal, totally unbelievable, playing like a kid's movie in terms of tone, but with adult subject matter. The Fall is a unique package, one that is a true Hidden Gem.I give The Fall a 10 out of 10!",The Fall
44,WriterDave,The Stuntman,8,3 June 2008,"""The Fall"" opens with a disembodied symphony of black and white images done to the tune of Beethoven's 7th where the beauty is in not fully understanding what you are watching. There's a train, a bridge, a man in the water, a rope, and the hoisting up of a horse from the river. And there's one quick shot of actress Karen Haacke, looking shocked and dreadfully beautiful as she (and not yet the audience) realizes what has happened that made my jaw drop.Some movies, like the ""Indiana Jones"" films, are designed to evoke fond feelings from other movies. Then there are films like Tarsem ""Don't Say My Last Name"" Singh's ""The Fall,"" which exists to tell a tried and true story with new images we have never seen before. When we last met Tarsem, he gave us the trippy crime flick ""The Cell"" in which we were made to feel sympathy for a serial killer who literally became trapped inside Jennifer Lopez's head--talk about HELL! With ""The Fall"", Tarsem, wanton and reckless, creates a tenuous relationship with the audience as he weaves the tale of broken-hearted silent film era stuntman (Lee Pace) who suffers a severe injury after a foolish stunt (seen in the opening) and forms an unlikely friendship with a migrant farm girl (Catinca Untaru) who broke her arm falling from a tree while picking oranges.""The Fall"" shares some thematic similarities with Terry Gilliam's ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"" and the Polish Brothers' ""Northfork"" as Pace's character begins to construct an elaborate fantasy world for the little girl to pass the time. The images Tarsem creates are breathtaking, strange, and confounding and like nothing seen in modern cinematic myth-making. The vibrant director uses visual and textural transitions from scene to scene (witness a butterfly turn into an island, or spilled coffee turn into blood) like it's nobody's business. ""The Fall"" is a true independent film, shot over the course of four years in twenty-eight different countries and funded primarily by Tarsem himself (with some last minute help from contemporaries David Fincher and Spike Jonze). With no CGI alterations, part of the fun is trying to figure out how some of the scenes were shot. Sometimes distracting is trying to determine where they were shot--as I believe one of the scenes was done (is it even possible?) outside India's Taj Mahal.There's sometimes an undercurrent of malevolence in the imagery, and often it is so over-the-top in its pageantry as to become incomprehensible inside the grander scheme of the simple fairy tale. Paradoxically it also reaches the level of silliness as one scene involving the overly dramatic death of a monkey named Wallace had me laughing so hard I almost cried. Meanwhile, the acting verges on amateurish. Justine Waddell in her dual roles as a nurse and princess is stunningly gorgeous but vapid. In the lead role, Pace, ranges from wooden to overly emotional, while the pint-size Untaru is so uncommonly naturalistic one wonders if she even realizes she was playing make-believe. These follies can be forgiven, though, as the movie celebrates the power of imagination and the lore of films. Where else are you going to find a man shot to death with dozens of arrows only to fall on his back and be held suspended by the very instruments of his death? Believe me, the scene is amazing.""The Fall"" succeeds as a movie for true film buffs. Critics like Roger Ebert, who sincerely love movies and their power to entertain, have raved about it, while others more cynical have dismissed it as a moving coffee-table book of empty modern art. Viewing it as a midweek matinée, I witnessed the only other patrons walk out, while some ushers looking to pass the time, sat in on the last ten minutes, which featured a montage of silent film era stunts that gloriously celebrated the old images that astounded their audiences just as much as Tarsem's new images attempt to astound us. The ushers seemed to get a mad kick out of it, and so did I.",The Fall
45,Eumenides_0,An Inventive Epic Drama,8,5 May 2009,"The Fall is an obscure, but priceless gem. Tarsem Singh, known only for The Cell, has created one of the best modern fantasy movies, blending an epic storyline with a heartwarming relationship between a little girl and an injured stuntman.Alexandria, a young immigrant, is at a hospital recovering from a fall that broke her arm. She's curious and restless and wonders around, charming everyone with her good spirits. One day she meets a man, Roy, lying in bed. He begins telling her a story involving heroes, evil kings, far-way lands, princesses and lots of magic. She's captivated, of course; but in return for his story, Roy asks her to bring him pills he needs to sleep. Roy is trying to kill himself, but Alexandria doesn't understand that.This is a fascinating story about the loss of innocence: on the one hand, Roy narrates a marvellous story, and we can't help cheering as he and Alexandria write themselves into it as the heroes. On the other hand, it's disturbing to see the way he uses her for his own ends. Many times his story reflects his mental state: when he's happy, everything is alright; but when he becomes upset, the story becomes darker.The finale is beautiful and fitting for both stories, both the magical one and the real one.And then there are the technical aspects. Visually speaking, this movie is unforgettable. The cinematography is rich in bright colors and breath-taking landscapes. The costumes are inventive and otherworldly, sometimes frightening, sometimes comical. Locations were chosen all over the world for shooting, making this movie a visual feast of different architectural styles.But in the end the heart of the movie is the young Catinca Untaru and Lee Pace. Their performances were so good I found myself crying at times, so good was their friendship portrayed on screen. This is a marvellous movie, worthy of children and adults alike.",The Fall

Here, the ending is a bit confusing if anything, and poor on the emotional level. There just isn't any tension at any moment, or any redeeming quality to the last minutes.Perhaps the film should've focused less on certain elements of the plot, developed other scenes more...there's like an imbalance about it, like some areas feel unfinished, others too exposed...Should be said the lead character is good looking, and a fine actor but a bit too precious... and the little Romanian girl is incredibly natural and the film captures her spontaneity amazingly well, with her broken English and so on.Interesting, but flawed.",The Fall
47,loganx-2,Amazing See In Theaters,10,11 June 2008,"A beautiful and amazing film. Like Jean Luc Godard's ""Alphaville"" which transformed 60's Paris into a dystopian sc-fi planet without the use of special effects, Tarsem's ""The Fall"" shoots in 18 different countries and transforms some of the most beautiful locations on earth into a surreal fantasia of orange deserts, blue cities, and underwater photography of elephants swimming in the open ocean. The story is deceptively simple tale of a stuntman named Roy, whose taken an emotional and physical fall, meeting a 5 year old Persian girl named Alexandria, who fell and broke her arm working the California Orange grooves,meeting in a hospital in 1920's Los Angeles. Alexandria has lost her father, Roy's lost his girl and is suicidal, and Roy begins telling an epic tale of revenge, staring characters based on hospital staff and historical characters. Five heroes an Italian explosives expert, an Indian Prince, an African self-freed slave, Charles Darwin as young British naturalist who speaks to animals, and a mysterious masked Zorroesque bandit who is at turns Alexandria's father and Roy himself, set out to kill their mutual enemy Governor Odious(The leading man from the film Roy was working on, who stole his girl and drove him to his stunt/suicide?) in the story Roy tells Alexandria, provided she fetch things for him. Like so many oneiric fantasies, this story is about innocence and Romanticism vs. the big bad world, in Don Quixote it was romanticism and fantasy vs reality and deception, ""Pans Labrnth"" romanticism against fascism, ""Brazil' romanticism against bureaucracy, and ""The Fall"" likewise is romanticism against despair. The film is as grand in it's themes as it is in it's visuals, touching on love, death, despair, story-telling, manipulation, the early days of film making, innocence, cross cultural relationships(when Roy says wigwams describing the Indian's back-story, Alexandria imagines Hindu Palaces.), and reconstructing your life after a trauma, picking up the pieces after the fall. I was glad I saw this in theaters on a big screen, one of the most vibrant and beautiful things I've ever seen anywhere and at anytime. If you've seen Tarsem's first film ""The Cell"", you've got an idea of this directors abilities to work with both visuals and performers(he mad J-Lo passable). Alxandria is played by one the best child actress I've seen in a very long time, a 5 year old who speaks like a 5 year old, which injects a good helping of humor into the story.

I really loved the cinematography in it... probably one of the best I have seen. It is vivid, scenic, and evokes the imagination; an entire aura of a fairy tale world. The fusing of real-time & the stories told by Roy is seamlessly creative. Alexandria's take on Roy's telling of the story, i.e. what each of the characters looks like (Nurse Evelyn, a family friend, Roy himself, the delivery man at the hospital in which they are residing) is not only revealing of how Alexandria feels about each of these people, but also an added touch that demonstrates how every reader's, every viewer's perception and take-away from a book or movie, respectively, can differ dramatically. The friendship between the two main characters is sweet and most touching.Hands down, a much underrated gem, with masterful cinematography that more in the industry should aspire to replicate.

Pace plays Roy Walker, who one day sees a girl named Alexandria (Catinca Untaru), and starts telling her stories of bandits and pirates and cowboys and Charles Darwin? Yes, in all the terrible midst of these terrible western stories, Charles Darwin goes with the shoot-em-up gang. This movie is so terrible- unrealistic, boring, stupid, dreadful, and leaving a bad taste in my mouth. It's as much fun as getting stabbed. The movie repeatedly tells the same stories. ""First, there was a pirate, and then Charles Darwin."" ""Now there's a pirate and no other than Charles Darwin."" This is an example of the redundant stories that float around in the terrible The Fall.

Shot on 26 locations over 18 countries, it is as if Tarsem Singh, the director, channeled the spirits of Salvador Dali and Federico Fellini to bring forth a visual hallucination of the best children's bedtime story ever conceived. The story begins in a Los Angeles hospital in the 1920's where an injured and suicidal stuntman relates a fantastical epic story to a very young patient. Reality shifts and blurs as his vivid imagination soars, and the tale weaves throughout time and history.

Would have made sense to have named him Alexander, after the great Greek Emperor. None-the-less, Catinca Untaru's performance was natural, real and annoying some times when I could not understand her and had to turn on the subtitles in the crucial moments toward the end. No matter, It did not distract from this feast of a film.I have been telling everyone who will listen to me to see this masterpiece. This is what film is for, not words. Words are for the stage. This is poetry in motion. The locations are rich with history and drippingly caught at their best by Colin Watkinson, the Cinematographer. The costumes shine in their invention and imagination owing to the sheer creative genius of Eiko Ishioka.The real find in this gem is Lee Pace, Julliard grad, last scene in Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day. I believed him in his difficult role. Forget he's a good looking lad, see that his acting is honest.Screenwriters, Dan Gilroy and Nico Soultanakis, give Tarsem Singh, the director of the Cell, a canvas on which to paint an epic story of simplicity. Of Tarsem, I say, this is a man whom you invite to dinner and just listen to his mind and his creativity for hours over good wine and my Ya Ya's spinikopita.

56,Bob Pr.,"Unusual, unique -- unlike any other",9,5 July 2008,"I saw this earlier this week with 3 friends.I'd been wanting to see it ever since reading some ""User Comments"" on IMDb -- most rating it 10 out of 10 stars (for now, its overall rating by 2,000 voters is currently a smidge lower than the ""Lord of the Rings"" and a smidge above ""Gone WTW"" and ""Wizard of Oz"").A VERY unusual movie with stunning visuals and scenery. It took 4 years to make and was filmed in (I think) 18 different countries.The year is roughly 1915-1917 (before troops come home from WW I) and the scene is a half-occupied hospital in southern California.One patient is an actor/stunt man in silent films who was injured in a movie and is paraplegic. A 6-7 y.o. immigrant girl, Alexandria, also a patient, visits him; she has a broken arm from falling from a ladder while picking oranges with her family.He tells her a story in many installments about a despised ""Gov. Odious"" in a far-off country and the efforts of 5 people to overthrow him in retaliation for hurts he's made on their loved ones or them. The installments take place in many varied, stunning landscapes and in many stunning architectural sites (e.g., the Taj Mahal + many others).The characters and sites in the various episodes of the story are those of Alexandria's imagination. The actor, for instance, mentions an Indian and his squaw but for Alexandria, ""Indian"" means someone from India so that's who's depicted.The photography and scenes in the tales are great, remarkable. While this film has not gathered much praise from film critics (Roger Ebert's is an exception, please see, he considers it like nothing else ever made) it HAS generated MUCH praise from many viewers, some of whom see it multiple times, considering it one of the best movies ever. It seems on its way to becoming a cult classic.There are 2 parallel stories -- one is the growing relationship between the girl, Alexandria, and the paralyzed actor in despair over his physical condition and the loss of his girlfriend to someone else and the other is the stories he tells Alexandria and which we view as in her vivid imagination. The narrative dips into despair until finally achieving redemption.Some violence is present but (IMO) most is handled in such a way as to be tolerable as an imaginary violence. For instance, one character has so many arrows shot and stuck into his back that he falls backwards and lies there, belly up, as if a coffee table suspended by hundreds of arrow/caterpillar legs. There is also some subtle humor: Darwin is one of the 5 who seek to overthrow Gov. Odious; Darwin has a pet monkey, Wallace, from which he occasionally seeks advice. (Alfred Russell Wallace sent the actual Darwin a paper proposing a similar theory to Darwin's; that prompted Darwin to finally present his own together with Wallace's.)A MOST unusual film, like nothing else in your experience.IMO most of the film deserves a 10 for photography/settings and the intertwining stories between the stuntman and the girl together with the girl's imagined view of his stories. But I've rated it a 9 because it was hard to understand the girl's voice and words plus the ending seemed a little weak and muddy.",The Fall
57,marymorrissey,"tarsem is sort of known as a bit of a copycat, see the originals, not this",2,9 June 2008,"the costumes in particauly look really cheap/cheesy, which is pretty disastrous as they go up against these historical settings in all their grandeur. the story is threadbare, the style is . . . Paradjanov shot with helicopters, and any Paradjanov film is a far better investment of your time, of which this film is a total waste, interminably long, hokey, and what T and company brought to it does not live up to the scenery in the many and various exotic locales. one exception: the sequence involving an elephant is worth the proverbial price of admission, esp if you like elephants...esp if you like swimming elephant, especially if you like swimming elephant rescuing people, a favorite theme of mine!it's a nice gimmick for interviews to say that lee pace pretended to actually be paralyzed during shooting, but there is nothing all that strong going on in this film performancewise. he's not bad or anything and the little girl is sort of OK, I could have done with a lot less of her, she's cute but she's not absolutely magnetic or anything, would have been to her advantage and the film's to have a bit less, same for pace! personally I would not have had him in a sleeveless vested thing, cause he doesn't have the muscle tone to wear something like that! I liked watching the cell in the theater and actually enjoyed how he ripped off people like damien hirst, making sly commentary on his art in that instance. trying to watch it on TV recently though I realized how sort of overdone and not so great it really is though...as long as it was, it seems to have been cut. what was up with the nurse, who had no role of any substance but then at the end it seemed. . . she must have had a lot of scenes that were cut, as she suddenly gained unexpected significance.there are some hot hombres in this film, but the men in Paradjanov films are even better anyhow. . .",The Fall
58,TheVictoriousV,"Mastery of photography, color, scenery, editing, and imagination",10,10 January 2018,"Tarsem Singh's The Fall is mastery of photography, color, scenery, editing, style, and imagination the likes of which you have never seen - and most likely will not see again after the viewing. It is a story told by a broken stuntman of American silent films, as envisioned by a nine-year-old Romanian girl who shares the same hospital. The result is, and I do not hand this designation out like candy these days, unique.The stuntman is Roy Walker (Lee Pace) and in addition to his inability to work due to crippling himself during a dangerous bridge-jumping stunt (the ""fall"" of the title), he has lost his girlfriend and is more or less prepared to die. However, he makes the acquaintance of an orphaned patient named Alexandria (Catinca Untaru), and tells her a brief story of Alexander the Great, whom her name reminds him of. Should she return the next day, he says he will tell another story.That story is of The Masked Bandit and his allies, who venture through just about every picturesque and strange-looking location on Planet Earth to find the evil Governor Odious (Daniel Caltagirone), who has wronged them all in some way. Some of them are simply stereotypical products of far-off lands, like Luigi (Robin Smith), an Italian with explosives to spare, and a character known simply as The Indian (Jeetu Verma). Others are historical figures, such as liberated slave Ota Benga (Marcus Wesley) and Charles Darwin (Leo Bill), complete with a pet monkey who assists him (and is named Wallce, after the scientist whom Darwin is rumored to have stolen ideas from). Last but not least is The Mystic (Julian Bleach), who exits a burning tree on an otherwise empty shorline to give our heroes bewildering clues.You're out of luck if you try to think too much about logic and logistics in this story. I could not tell you how our heroes summon elephants to free them from a small island or how to make sense of the montage where the heroes jump from Paris to Spain to India to Tibet to wherever else. I'm not supposed to. Besides, you will find that the characters ask similar questions.As the girl imagines the tale, eventually including herself as a character, we notice parallels between the fairy tale and the world she lives in, as well as her comprehension of the words used. ""The Indian"" is envisioned as the Indian man who works in the garden and whose ""wigwam"", as Roy calls it, is an oriental palace. The beautiful Sister Evelyn, meanwhile, manifests in the form of a similarly named nurse at the hospital, played by Justine Waddell; Luigi is a one-legged Hollywood actor who visits Roy, and the historical figures don't much resemble their actual real-life counterparts. There's more but you get the idea.The Fall was shot on location in 28 countries, IMDb tells me, over a period of four years, and virtually none of what we see is via the use of computer-generated effects or green-screen backgrounds. Every piece of unthinkable scenery, all the remarkable structures (including the vast labyrinth of stairways and the ancient village where some of the buildings are painted blue), every masterful costume; whether it was hand-made for the film or a strange but stunning place on our home planet, what we see is completely real. 100% of it, insists Tarsem.The only thing I suspect is a digital effect (unless it is stop-motion, which is also utilized in a brilliantly animated nightmare sequence that really stands out) is the moving scarification tattoo that moves across The Mystic's skin in one scene. I don't know how else it could have been done. There are VFX artists listed in the credits so at the very least, someone deserves praise for making the digital effects completely unnoticeable (give or take a moving tattoo).The imagery is complemented perfectly by Krishna Levy's music and Colin Watkinson's impeccable camera work, as well as certain editing tricks I am yet to fathom. Of the directing and acting I cannot say enough. The screenplay, I learn, is based in part on a 1981 Bulgarian film called Yo Ho Ho; I assume it's the part with The Masked Bandit.At the heart of it all is a warm and believable chemistry between Lee Pace and Catinca Untaru, the latter of whom went through production unaware that Pace wasn't crippled in real life as well (how fitting). In some ways, Roy is inadvertently cruel to Alexandria, taking advantage of her childlike innocence and curiosity to make her bring him morphine. However, the two found each other at the right time, and I hope this isn't too much of a spoiler, but this fairy tale ends on a brighter note.No matter. The journey there is a once-in-a-lifetime feast for the eyes and an imaginative exercise in using the medium to its fullest - even as the real star of the show is something as close to reality as our own pretty little world. It is not escapism from reality so much as it inspires you to explore the more beautiful parts of it. If there's anything bad about the movie it's the implication that Buster Keaton did not perform his own stunts.",The Fall
59,dumsumdumfai,Wow!!!! and good acting in 2 separate stories,5,18 September 2006,"When I walked out of a TIFF screening of The Fall at the Elgin Theatre in Toronto, I could not figure out why I could not have enjoyed this film more. It has great visuals, costumes, above average acting from a little girl, and 2, count them 2 stores that eventually merged together.Then 2 days later, while seeing Del Toro's ""Pan's Labyrinth"", the same feeling is there. The feeling is observant detachment. And I even walked out of Pan's... for different reasons.To paraphrase, Hudsucker Proxy, ""The Fall"" fails because there are 2 stories,one based in reality and the other fantasy. And they are equally important. One take you away visually without connection to any of the characters or emotions. The reality takes hold to your emotion but it can not hold on for long as the fantasy part resumes. That was the problem for me.I much prefer ""The Cell"".",The Fall
60,CineCritic2517,Cute but too self-conscious,1,7 September 2013,"While being treated for a broken arm in a catholic hospital in the 1920's, 5 year old Alexandria imagines the stories that are related to her by a heavily medicated fellow patient. The film jumps from one pretty scene to the next showing the fragmented story line seen through the eyes of the little Alexandria. But besides the pretty pictures and the cutesy of Alexandria, the movie doesn't put much else on the table. Some pace and deliberation as to what the film wants us to experience while following a little girl's fantasies, seems sorely lacking. There is a good film in here somewhere, but it's lost in an obvious attempt to dazzle the audience with beautiful sceneries and exotic, colorful locations. The story itself should have been more engaging.6.1/10",The Fall
61,anthonyjlangford,One of cinema's greatest achievements,10,19 April 2009,"Rest assured, once the word of mouth begins to permeate through the grapevine; barely a soul will escape its many and brilliant charms. The Fall will escalate from cult gem to one of cinema's greatest achievements.This is as complete a film as one could hope for, succeeding on all levels; it is a visual feast, but never for its own sake. More than once I was reminded of Baraka with its exotic imagery, there's no CGI here but The Fall is also layered with humor, drama and poignancy. In essence, it is a film about storytelling, about imagination and the power of fantasy to heal and transpose us out of the ordinary, all hinged on the brilliant performance of young Catinca Untaru, her debut film. I can't imagine any Hollywood studio casting a lead with a strong Bulgarian accent, let alone a child. Thankfully they weren't involved. The Director, Singh funded much of this himself, tacking onto his international television commercial shoots. Catinca gives the most naturalistic and truthful performance of any child actor on film. She's wonderful.In essence, the tale weaves around a 6 year old Bulgarian immigrant with a broken arm who meets an injured stuntman in a hospital in Los Angeles in 1915. It is the silent era but she confesses, 'I do not know this, moving picture.' Beginning innocuously, Ray begins to tell the girl a story, based in part upon her reactions. Director Tarsem Singh incorporated Catinca's actual responses into the story itself, an epic fantasy. Both the fantasy and the hospital scenes are revealed concurrently. It all seems simple enough, but this is just the beginning, as we are drawn into the rich layers of the story and the people telling them. In a way, it is reminiscent of the Wizard of Oz, the real people and their more fantastic alter ego's. There are no name actors in this film but it is all the better for it. Each character is memorable, reinforced by the haunting sounds of Beethoven's No.7.It's been a long time since a film has been so pitch perfect. I search for flaws but cannot find them. Shot over four years in eighteen countries, The Fall is the little engine that could and somehow did, while the other shiny engines were too busy blowing steam, this one snuck past them all.",The Fall
62,pivic,One of the very best fantastic films I've ever seen,9,18 September 2008,"One of the biggest surprises in years, for me. This film centers around a little girl in a hospital in the 1920s, who listens to the fantastic stories of an injured stuntman. There's more to the plot, but I'll leave things at that. This film is nothing less than impeccable, towering far over most other films that deal with the realm of the imaginary impossible that I've seen. The direction is sublime, pretentious and concentrated, yet allowing the actors to flourish, and hereby I must specially mention 11-year-old Catinca Untaru, who plays the lead character; her playing is human, simple, yet radiant in the extreme, looking back at the film. She takes nothing away, yet does the most human impression of a child that I have probably ever seen in a film. Thoughts, lines of dialogue and spontaneity flow through the film and add to its greatness, mostly through her. The cinematography, pace of the film, its epicness - always injected with down-to-earth humanity in its ways - constantly reminds me of what it's like to be human. Utterly recommendable, and I hope the director, Tarsem Singh, soon delivers his may-be serial killer-project, ""The Unforgettable"".",The Fall
63,joemamaohio,My Review,9,15 October 2008,"In this visually stunning epic, Alexandria (Catinca Untaru) is a young girl who's injured her arm and is in the hospital. While there she meets Roy Walker (Lee Pace), an actor who was severely injured. They form an unlikely friendship, and Roy tells Alexandria a story about five heroes who unite to kill the treacherous Governor Odious (Daniel Caltagirone), who did each of them wrong.As the story develops, Alexandria becomes more and more involved in the story, and Roy's life, and soon the lines of reality and fantasy are blurred.This is one heck of a good film. The cinematography is utterly amazing, and the overall story is so moving and powerful that you can't help but fall in love with Alexandria and the story being told. Simply one film that should not be missed.",The Fall

A stunt man telling a fictional story to a little cute girl and as the movie progresses you see that reality and fiction is getting mixed. Seen from any eye of a little kid, the fiction part are sweeping visuals lit up with bright colors. The movie is shot almost completely in the forts and palaces in India in cities Jaipur, Jodhpur, Agra and Jaiselmer. These places are shot so beautifully that you can't believe your eyes. Even if the movie is a complex story to tell, still it is done convincingly in entertaining way. The cute adorable little girl lit up the every frame she is in. The movie is another example of famous saying ""Movies are never about what, it is always about how"". Don't miss this movie, if you like your cinema to surprise you again and again.",The Fall
66,Johan_Wondering_on_Waves,Great how fantasy and reality come together,8,12 July 2015,"OK this is far from a scary movie despite there are a few brutal killing scenes towards the ending of the story which is told by a heartbroken injured stuntman to a 5-year old girl who is also in hospital because of a broken arm. Usually I'm not keen on this CGI and visual showcase like Avatar or Life of Pi (which I found both dreadful in all aspects). This one actually had some deep going and raw story going on with some great chemistry between the two protagonists. There are comparisons made with The Cell. I must say The Fall beats that one in every aspect also because the Fall gives has a hopeful ending with a positive message without it becoming bitter-sweet. The current 7,9 rating I would say is a bit exaggerated but this is actually one of the better visually beautiful movies which actually does have a decent story and characters to care for. Most of visual showpieces do lack in story and/or nice characters in my opinion. But this one was just wonderful in every way. Such a positive message that the movie gives too and little Alexandria is so sweet giving the bitter Roy hope again.",The Fall
67,mirwais-orbit,Welcome to Tarsem's mind!,9,12 December 2008,"Since the first day I saw the trailer I was impressed.For me, Tarsem is the opposite of Wes Anderson and Tim Burton. Anderson is known for scenes visually interesting but completely out of perfection so that the characters find themselves in strange and comic situations. Burton likes to play with strange and uncommon tales and characters, and intensifies it with his dark visions. But Tarsem is completely preoccupied with the careful and perfection so that the characters find themselves in amazing and heroic situations in uncommon tales intensified by colors and textures presented as a living part of the stories so you can feel the taste of the images, like colorful candies.Tarsem is responsible for a not so interesting movie but another tremendous visual piece of work, The Cell (2000). And like the first one, The Fall (2006) is another movie that its visual concept leads entire movie, blowing your eyes with exuberant scenarios, eccentric characters, fabulous costumes in an amazing photography and a unquestionable art direction.His direction tries to be more than perfect, his visual concepts are so solid in his mind that sometimes it's just unbelievable and unimaginable that it could be possible. Each frame seems like a picture taken from a photo-art magazine, everything looks so perfect and the different colors and textures are contrasting. His movies take us to illogical and surreal journeys like dreams, but in the end everything has a perfect sense.This movie is about a little girl (Alexandria) and a man living in a hospital (Roy). Both meet each other and exchange some experiences. She gives him the hope to achieve his objective while he gives her the opportunity to travel thru an amazing imaginary world with another 5 heroes: a masquerade, an Indian, an ex-slave, an explosive expert and... Charles Darwin. But there's a line that ties Alexandria to the fantasy world, and it's the reality, that some times can be sweet, but also can be bitter.The Fall is an absolute wonderful fantasy movie that explores the particular mind of an infant with subtlety within a fantastic tale ruled by 5 pleasant characters. It's sincere and also nostalgic because makes us remember our childhood and how powerful a child's imagination can be.",The Fall
68,pontifikator,Fascinating film that doesn't quite work for me,7,21 January 2013,"A little girl and a handsome young man are in the hospital, she for a broken arm, he for a broken back. Alexandria (played by Catinca Untaru) and Roy (Lee Pace) pass the time by telling stories. Roy starts them out, but Alexandria visualizes them, so we have a cross fertilization which can be surprising and funny, but which is always breathtaking. Alexandria is about 11, and her visualization of the tales includes those around her, so (as in ""The Singing Detective""), we have the hospital staff pulling dual roles as Alexander the Great, a princess, heroes, and villains. The costuming is some of the best I've seen, and the cinematography (by Colin Watkinson) is wonderful. IMDb says Tarsem Singh disclaims all trickery -- what you see on the screen is what he actually filmed, with no special effects. The scenery and action is so breathtaking, I actually doubt this. It's that good. I really liked the movie. On one level, it's a hospital story about the blossoming friendship between two people, one of whom is a little girl. Ms. Untaru is captivating as the girl, with no evidence of acting at all. Little Alexandria is utterly guileless as Roy cunningly uses her to collect morphine tablets for him.On another level, it's a fantasy initiated in the mind of Roy who is killing time that lays heavy on his shoulders but kicked into fantastic overdrive by the bored little girl stuck in the hospital with a broken arm. Because of the intertwining of the characters in the hospital with her fertile imagination of the tale, we have some hints of magical realism as she encounters the characters in both the fantasy and the reality worlds she inhabits.On another level, it's a swashbuckling hero movie where a team of five swear to defeat the evil doer who has done each of them a wrong. It's here, though, that the movie let me down. Each of the five is a character, and unlike ""The Princess Bride,"" for example, there's no real warmth among them, no feelings between them, no camaraderie. Just five guys with the same goal. It's unfortunate, because we spend a great deal of time watching them strive for their goal, but I never had any feelings for them during their various ordeals. Because of that lack of emotion among the five heroes, it misses the sweeping epic saga-ness it should have had as we watched the epic grandeur of the settings and costumes (designed by Eiko Ishioka) and listened to the epic music (Beethoven's Symphony No.7 in A major op.92, 2d movement, allegretto, for example).I recommend the movie in spite of that one shortcoming. It's based on a Bulgarian movie by the name of ""Yo Ho Ho,"" which I've never seen or even heard of.",The Fall

Not TOO deep though story- and characterwise, classical happy end and positive message for the viewer... but you came for the beauty and got an uplifting fairytale! So not really a letdown. I still think there are many other more complex and thought through plots, yes... but the art department for sure got its stage to shine here. Costumes! Locations! Setdressing! Wow! Great acting from the little girl as well.

If for no other reason (and there are others) see it for the cinematography. It is truly brilliant. I saw it at home on our 60"" screen, HD. That was good enough. Don't wait for it to come to a theatre unless it's an art house revival. It was made several years ago and got limited showing. Probably because it is polemically 100% different from all the special effect garbage now put out. As I sat, and began to wonder, I thought to myself, can they really do all this with computers now? And I thought, probably. Too bad. They used to actually have to go to all these wonderful places. Surprise, He did! It was filmed in 28 countries! It isn't all about scenery though. There is a simple plot which is not quite so simple and rather beautiful in and of itself. As I watched more and more, I thought to myself, ""No American director made this."" This is a morality tale in the manner of someone like Satyajit Ray. I've had the Apu trilogy for years and consider it a true masterpiece. So it turns out the director is Indian and he actually financed the movie himself. And it shows. Many reviews call it a vanity movie. What movie was ever made without the vanity of the director an overriding element. I think what Hollywood didn't like about it was that he just went ahead and did it without their mind dulling censorship, making it more palatable for the masses. What if everybody could do that?

It became incredibly sadistic towards the end with the young guy wanting to commit suicide then having a screaming fit infront of the little girl when he wakes up an realises he hasn't successfully killed himself with the morphine. I mean, wtf??? He makes all the characters die and upsets the little girl who by the way is recovering after falling trying to get this loser his morphine pills and he has the nerve to upset her by being nasty and making the characters die.

This definitely deserves some Oscars if only for the cinematography.This story of two people, a man and a little girl, both who are in hospital because of a fall. He is a stunt man for films and she a daughter of migrant workers. The two meet and the man says he will tell the girl a story, but only if she does something for him in return. I won't spoil it for you but the story of those two becomes very moving and affects the ""story"" he tells her. The images of the ""story"" are breathtaking as they are filmed all over the world in the most beautiful locations and involve the characters of their real life world. Let me tell you, you won't be disappointed in the ending.Both the man (played by Lee Pace) and the girl (played so adorably by Catinca Untaru) are wonderful here.

I Didn't Fall For ""The Fall""",5,11 August 2015,"While watching ""The Fall"" the one question that kept coming to mind was - Is this supposed to be a movie aimed for the entertainment of children, or, is it strictly targeted for an adult audience? If ""The Fall"" was intended to amuse a child, then its violence, gore and frightening scenes were certainly enough to give a good number of the kiddies nightmares for days.But, if ""The Fall"" was actually aimed at an adult audience, its storyline was so simple-minded that it could only entertain those with the lowest expectations when it came to the realm of intellect and coherency.Had the overall visual aspect of ""The Fall"" not been as striking as it was, I most likely would have given this far-out, fantasy picture a lower rating than 5 stars.",The Fall
74,liberalgems,"A Twisted, Dysfunctional Story About Child Abuse!",1,13 June 2008,"I'm a sucker for anything fantasy or science fiction oriented! I give each and every film the benefit of the doubt! What troubles me so greatly is that The Fall starts out as delightful - and then turns into something very ugly!Keep in mind this about an innocent and rather naive child somewhere between 8-10 years of age. She is manipulated into assisting an attempted suicide. This is no potential mercy killing, either! It's about a grown man who will descend into the pits of hell to emotionally scar a rather vulnerable child. He has no self control or conscience! All he cares about is killing himself, so why worry about collateral damage! Nor is this some backwater hospital. It's state of the art for the 1920's! Where famous people and orange-harvesting, migrant workers cross paths. But this ""modern"" hospital lets a young child run around with impunity, literally sharing a bed with middle aged man who is known to the hospital staff as suicidal. Hey, but its the 1920's and this crazy non-sense doesn't raise so-much as an eyebrow!But when the child, who may have fractured her skull from falling - because she made a second attempt to raid the morphine in an unlocked and unguarded pharmacy - we get to watch this very disturbed man turn his delightful story, that he created from thin air, into a nightmare of gruesome death and destruction. To add insult to injury, we then get to see our young hero start crying hysterically while lying trapped in a hospital bed, no-less, totally at the mercy of this lunatic! If this is not child abuse, I don't know what is! At this point, I said to myself, doesn't this young child actor have any parents? How could they let their rather young daughter act in such a twisted movie? Aren't they exploiting their child?My next thought was: ""This is such a sadistic story, and I paid my hard earned money to watch this unmerciful, pain-inflicting non-sense."" I don't know about you, but that's not my idea of entertainment! My only consolation is this god-awful film is currently running in only 1 obscure movie theater in a metropolitan area of well over a million people!

75,fablesofthereconstru-1,"""Baraka"" meets ""Adaptation""",7,31 May 2008,"""Once upon a time,"" reads the caption in ""The Fall"", there was no movie industry in California, but there were orange trees, and stories; except the stories were contained in books, and sometimes the story required a human voice.Set in the twenties, time is pertinent in ""The Fall"", as the storyteller weaves his elaborate tale to his young listener. The images generated by the narrator are painterly-looking for an intellectually-based reason, Roy(Lee Pace) grew up visiting museums, not movie houses. The hospital patient has been to a couple of films, but he doesn't know what the fuss is all about. The elaborate compositions in ""The Fall"" emanate from an art lover. The moving picture that illustrate his words and ideas are paintings come-to-life.Late in ""The Fall"", the tone of Roy's story changes. Some would say, the thematic elements are unsuitable for Alexandria(Catinca Utaru, his captive audience. But remember, this is the nineteen-twenties; there was no such literature or film(once the ball started rolling) that catered(or is that, condescended) to children, no such thing as niche entertainment. A young girl like Alexandria read Jane Austen and Charles Dickens, not Nancy Drew mysteries, or Judy Blume. Early twentieth-century girls had their periods, too, but they didn't have to read about it.To the movie buff, it should be clear that Tarsem, best known for R.E.M.'s artfully blasphemous ""Losing My Religion"" video, was inspired by David Fricke's ""Baraka"" and Spike Jonze's ""Adaptation"". His love affair with the Dziga Vertov-inspired, pan-cultural film about the world we live in, can even be glimpsed in his video for Deep Forest(""Sweet Lullaby""). It's not just the sheer amount of countries that this production touched ground on, ""The Fall"" actually lifts entire scenes from ""Baraka"", most pointedly, the scene, in which a shaman chants with his disciples. The influence of the Charlie Kaufman script that starred Nicholas Case and his doppleganger, thankfully, is less obvious. There's a good, sizable chunk of ""The Fall"" that seems bad, but purposely so, I think, just like the moment in ""Adaptation"", when Donald Kaufman(the hack that goes to the Robert McKee seminar) takes over the narration from his twin-brother Charlie. In ""The Fall"", the darker narrative is a reflection on Roy's fatalistic state-of-mind. The subtext, Roy's tragic personal life, is barely kept in check, if at all, when Alexandria asks Roy to pick up the story where he had last left off. The violence isn't senseless. There's a psychologically-based reason for each death, but their renderings, are gratuitous, on the verge of being repetitious. ""The Fall"" starts to feel like a never-ending story.",The Fall
76,Qanqor,Really beautiful,9,23 October 2010,"I'm generally the curmudgeon. I can be pretty hard to please when it comes to movies. And frankly, I approached this film with some skepticism. Indeed, my Netflix copy of the film sat on my shelf for many weeks, unwatched, because I felt under-motivated to watch it, and couldn't for the life of me remember what had caused me to order it in the first place. I still don't remember. But I'm certainly glad I did! I just finished watching the film, and I really, really liked it. It was just beautiful. Visually beautiful. Aurally beautiful. Emotionally beautiful. I found I really connected with the characters and the story, much more than I had expected to from reviews I had seen. The movie is extremely artistic without being annoyingly artsy-fartsy. The interplay between the story and the story-within-a-story is fascinating and well done. Everything was just delightful. This is the kind of movie where I'm reluctant to say too much, because I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't seen it.And I would be remiss if I failed to make mention of one of the excellent choices made by the film makers: the wonderful use of one of my very favorite pieces of music, the second movement of Beethoven's 7th Symphony. Very effective and very appropriate.I've read some of the negative reviews, and I think there's a consistent misunderstanding lurking there. If you think that the outer story is just a framework to allow the telling of the inner story, you've missed the point. The *outer* story is what this movie is all about (as underscored by the title), and the inner story is merely a part of that story.The one nit that I will pick is that at times I found the dialog *really* hard to understand, for a variety of reasons. Too many times I was forced to back up a few seconds and re-watch with the English subtitles on; and on doing so found that I had indeed missed some important and revealing dialog. In some cases this may have been unavoidable, but in some I think the director is really at fault.And yet, even with that nit, I gave it a 9; without it, it would've been a 10. That's how much I liked this film. Go see it.",The Fall
77,Lomedin,Warning: this film will crush your heart,8,4 May 2011,"There are a good few films mixing fantasy and reality in this sort of way. Terry Gilliam is an expert at that. And his Tideland comes close to The Fall. However, The Fall has got its own beauty and charm. The photography is extremely beautiful, and I can only imagine the effort that was taken in order to get all those magnificent locations. The colors are awesome. Now, for the plot. Well, let's say that, opposed to other films entwining fiction and reality, the non-reality of this film keeps to itself quite a lot and, at the end, it only stays like it is, and both fantasy and reality keep well separated. Now, I don't want to spoil anything and won't go into specifics but, as I state in the title of this review, I have to warn you. This film starts in a peaceful manner. Like I always do in this type of movies, I was expecting tragedy at any moment. However, it seemed to delay and delay, never striking and simply making the story more sweet. I started to wonder if, after all, this film was not going to have any horrible occurrence to remind us that reality is what it is. Oh, how well they fooled me, made me believe that I was safe. Because all that extra comfort will only make your heart break in a less endurable manner. The sadness showed in this movie doesn't come from a terrible act destroying innocence, but from innocence itself, and the consuming desperation of those who cherish it even when they cannot cope with their own lives. I didn't feel like that in a long time, and no film of these characteristics made me cry for years until I saw the beauty of the struggle for clinging to life to keep that innocence, the simple and natural things in life, shattered and untouched at once. The Fall honors its name by making you fall deep into emotions once lost and leaves you with a bitter sweet taste that you will appreciate. Special mention to Catinca Untaru, who is able to perform his role in such a natural way that you cannot help it but feeling attached to her. Highly recommended, beautiful",The Fall
78,ciscokid1970,Feast for the eyes with a dramatic fantasy storyline,9,11 February 2010,"I highly recommend you rent this movie and watch it on a big screen. This is a OK family movie, contains mild violence but has been adjusted to be child appropriate, for lets say 8 and up. My 2 daughters of 10 and 7 enjoyed watching this film.I do not want to give too much away. The movie centers around a Hollywood stuntman, played by Lee Pace, who is in a hospital after a movie accident. By chance a little girl, Catinca Untaru (9 year old in her first movie), who is also in the hospital finds him. Roy starts to tell this little girl a fantastic made up story in return for her getting things he needs. The story he spins takes them off to far of lands with castles, vast deserts, mountain lakes and more.I love movies that have a good story line...but I Truly LOVE movies that take advantage of the cinematography bringing your eyes colors, landscapes and wondrous shots that exercise the rods and cones in your eyes. As a bonus you get to see some wondrous sights in India and South Africa.Tarsem Singh, Nico Soultankis and Dan Gilroy wrote a great screenplay and Singh also directed.Lots of credit goes to the Art, Wardrobe, Set Design and Visual Effects department.Colin Watkinson did a great job of cinematography, especially brilliant being he is fairly new in the industry.",The Fall
79,scarletminded,The best movie you will never see...reminds me of Guy Maddin with a huge budget...and better sense of humor but Tarsem holds his own as a director with this one,10,5 June 2008,"If you took equal parts Princess Bride and El Topo, added a dash of Guy Maddin and Terry Gilliam, you might just understand what you are in for. I didn't know anything about this movie except I happened to see a trailer for it on TV really late at night and heard the name Spike Jonze, who I like and Tarsem, whose name I knew from The Cell and The Cell, despite JLo being in it, was a very interesting movie. Weirdly enough, I had a movie card for Landmark Theatres and it expires on June 6th and ta-dah, The Fall was playing at my local theater. Kismet I guess.It reminds me of Guy Maddin in a lot of ways, the hospital setting, the little girl with her arm in a cast that is a lot like his characters, the John Cusack type male lead too, both of these characters are very charming, even though they steal and lie. The wide shots of many countries and the costumes are majestic when ""the story"" is told, the story is the Princess Bride type element with the desert shots and oddness being El Topo (the scene with the birds coming out of the mystic's mouth seems very Jodorowsky-esquire) , except it gets a lot darker than the Princess Bride and is less obscure than El Topo (you can follow the story the first time through). Reviews have called this a ""vanity piece"" but I don't think it is. It has all the drama, comedy, tragedy, pathos of most Oscar winning movies, but it is more interesting to watch and yes, when the little girl cried, I found myself almost weeping, the acting was that good.The hospital setting does make this rather morose in parts, but also real. The characters are tragic and many ways, yet are almost comic too. There is a Wizard of Oz feeling to this movie, wait, more of a Return to Oz, it being darker. I loved a lot of the surrealistic images, it seemed to work with the loose narrative Pace with giving the little girl. I liked the wall of people, the fact that Charles Darwin was a character, that the eastern Indian was confused with a Native American, etc. I also thought the movie was going to have a very bad ending many times, then an overly nice one and then the ending was in the middle, being neither good nor bad for the characters, I thought Pace may have adopted the girl, but oh well. Why this movie hasn't been given a huge box office run or commercials during prime time is beyond me. This is a movie that has Oscar written all over it, though now it couldn't win one. So many bad films get nominated while this one won't be seen by many people. It is too bad, because it is uplifting, sad, funny, morbid, mesmerizing, surreal and if you freeze framed any of it, it would made a great picture, much like The Holy Mountain, which is one of my favorite films. Tarsem takes a surreal oddball base and makes a plot line around it, one that can be followed by most people...so it surprises me it wasn't released in theaters until now or advertised. It's a shame. it's very good and takes you on a ride.",The Fall
80,eve_dolluk,Visually stunning but has a heart as well,9,8 December 2010,"A friend told me about this film and it seemed like the sort of film i would enjoy. The first thing I fell in love with was the Chemistry between the two leads Catinca Untaru who plays the young girl Alexandria and Lee Pace who plays the injured Roy Walker.Catinca is not a trained actor and it shows but in the most delightful way, this is no pre-madonna demonic child star. I have a feeling they just did many takes and caught her at her most natural and this worked very well. The Story is split, into real life and the fantasy world that is created by Roy and visualised by Alexandria. The reality is a lot harsher than the fantasy but eventually the two can end up blending together.The two story's are also visually different, the real world being duller with almost a brown hue and that feeling of an age gone by. The fantasy world is bright colourful and like a work of art containing stunning backdrops, locations, costumes and visual representations of an imagination.There is CGI and also a bit of standard animation, although in many occasions its hard to see where the CGI begins as everything looks real but in a grand artistic "" I am looking at a painting "" kind of way.As a viewer the first time I was mainly interested in the relationship and story of the main characters, Its a roller coaster journey for them both and you never quite know how it will end. On my second viewing I was then engrossed in the visual aspect and was able to appreciate it a lot more.On top of all that there is great Humor to the film as well as emotion excitement and action.Overall I give this a 9 which is quite high but for me it worked so well and I have re-watched it many times and that is always a win.",The Fall
81,rlange-3,Promising start but never gets out of low gear,4,10 January 2009,"Yes yes, cutesy little girl, great actress, endearing, with majestic visuals but... it never really goes anywhere. And after awhile the novelty wears off and by the midpoint in the movie I found myself waiting for a ""point"". By the last quarter, I was waiting and hoping for an ""end"" and slipping into terminal boredom.Obviously most people liked the movie a lot better than me, and I have no problem with that. There is no reason to give this movie a one or a two but I wish it had been over at the midpoint, giving me the experience without the listless last half.Here's your tenth line. Like the rest of the movie, it doesn't contribute much.",The Fall
82,Tanay_LKO,"""The Fall - and a Rousing Tale of Friendship""",8,12 October 2017,"An injured stuntman (Lee Pace, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"") and a young orange-picker girl (the uber talented - Catinca Untaru) - both ""fell and fractured"" - strike a chance friendship in their hospital. Roy begins telling her a story of romance, bandits, adventure with Charles Darwin, a Pyrotechnic, an Indian Warrior, a Free-Slave as their peers. The epic-plot flushed out of Roy's own remorse and heartbreak, ironically set in the magnificent palaces of India, though, it is with little Alexandria's potent and pure imagination we all see a world beyond the helpless shortsightedness. To have fallen is human, but to have risen must feel divine.It's surprising to have found ""hope"" in the most unlikely of places; but, that becomes ""soul enriching"" to have attained so from a child's vision.A moving, heartfelt account of fantasy-drama, which couldn't have been summarised any better by Alain de Botton... 'The moment we cry in a film is not when things are sad but when they turn out to be more beautiful than we expected them to be.' ... so, indeed.Outstanding!",The Fall

She does not appear to be acting. Very normal and natural manner. Watch for her in flicks. This is an Oscar worthy movie absolutely. How did this get missed. Where has it been?

85,pazu7,Best film so far this year. So where is it??,8,10 June 2008,"I am completely baffled at the absence of this film from major theaters. It is quite easily the best film I have seen this year and perhaps in quite some time. It also includes one of the more memorable performances by a young artist.The Fall is visually stunning, has a great script, is dramatically engrossing, subtly witty with captivating performances (especially from the young Cantica Untaru) and has a wonderfully crafted score that manages to accentuate in the background but comes to the foreground at the right moments with motifs that shape the film without being overbearing.The multitude and variety of landscapes and locations blend seamlessly with deft digital trickery to create such beautiful imagery that I could watch it with the sound off.In describing it to a friend I called it a child friendly ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" or an adults ""The Neverending Story"". OK, not the greatest analogy, but it does accomplish the same characteristic blend of fantasy/reality but with more humor and without the dark tragic tone.A great film, award material. So where is it? This site doesn't even have it in their ""now playing"" section. At least not when I checked a few minutes ago.Little Miss Untaru deserves recognition for her performance. I hoped neither she or the film get dissed.",The Fall
86,chuck-526,2 viewings - 2 different movies,8,1 September 2008,"I watched The Fall twice, and enjoyed it much more the second time. The second time I followed all the bits of the plot and experienced an emotional connection with the film. I wasn't plagued as I was the first time by not being able to understand some of the dialog, missing many nuances, having quite a few lines appear to be non sequiturs, and losing the thread repeatedly during the many highly abbreviated scenes. The first time I saw a chain of gorgeous visuals chained together tentatively by a story line I could barely follow. The second time I saw the rich multi-layered story of complex characters.With memory flashbacks and revisited scenes there were often at least three stories progressing all at the same time.I understood that many elements of the fantasy story were shaped by the limited understanding of a very young girl. The ""evil"" costume used throughout came from the anti-radiation suit worn by an X-ray technician. (What's ""radiation"" to a five year old?) The incongruity of an ""Indian"" that used words like squaw and wigwam yet looks like someone from the Mongol empire made sense viewed through the eyes of a little girl who couldn't clearly distinguish the two meanings of the word ""Indian"". And the fluid boundaries between the fantasy story and the hospital story almost always involved something the little girl had actually seen (an elephant charm, an ice delivery truck, etc.) At the end of my first viewing, one section of the credits I read was about the ""dream sequence"", but at the time I couldn't figure out exactly what that meant. The second time it was clear that one sequence was different from the rest, and that it was largely composed of images from earlier parts of the movie come to life in strange ways.The stories, which are a sophisticated mix of self-reference and irony, don't fall prey to the over-seriousness self-reference alone sometimes implies. Actors drop out of character for brief moments at unexpected times. Particularly hard to swallow events are sometimes pointed out by the actors themselves, while other times whoppers are accepted without a second thought. For example an actor wonders how the inscription inside a small locket can be so long, even while not noticing it makes no sense that a ""solid gold"" (a very soft metal) locket could stop a bullet. Dialog in the fantasy story is not always predictable, but sometimes is instead asides about the use (and misuse) of story formulas.Archival footage of very old ""flickers"" shows just how outrageous many of the early stunts were. The sorts of things that nowadays would be done with CGI and twenty years ago were done only by expert stunt men seemed common back then. Watching the old footage, I sometimes wanted to yell ""watch out"" and sometimes wondered who in their right mind would insure such things. A common element in synopses of The Fall appears to greatly mislead and ultimately neuter a significant element of the movie: synopses usually describe the protagonist Roy as always having been a ""stunt man"". This is definitely true of his later life after the events of the movie. But the events leading up to the movie make more sense if the separate profession of ""stunt man"" didn't even exist yet and Roy was just a regular actor.",The Fall
87,TonyDood,"""The Fall"" vs. ""Pan's Labyrinth""",8,8 December 2009,"I just saw ""The Fall"" after hearing about it for some time and, while watching it, thought two things. 1) It brought to mind ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and 2) showed me that, while ""The Fall"" was far from a perfect movie, it points out everything that's wrong with ""Pan."" To misquote Roger Ebert, I hated, hated, hated that movie. That's what this review will be about and if you don't want to hear my comparisons of the two films with that slant, don't read any more.Both ""Pan"" and ""Fall"" are personal, stylized films that concern young girls in situations where their childhood innocence is in jeopardy and refuge--of sorts--is found in a fantasy world that has nebulous borders with reality. Both little girls are required to complete tasks that require them to be more adult than they are prepared to be, to serve the needs of someone else, and in both cases the fantasy worlds they wander in, which are generally more malevolent than fanciful, act as a mirror and commentary to this journey; symbolic representations of their inner journeys.The first noticeable difference is in look. ""The Fall"" is jaw-droppingly bright and beautiful, the imagery echoes Fellini, Gilliam and Jodorowsky in terms of amount of work undertaken just to get one single shot as beautifully rendered as possible. By contrast, del Toro's film has a sort of ""Henson""-esque knock-off feel to it, the sort of ""blue and black"" color scheme that has been around since the 80's. The ""fantasy"" world of the film is bleak, ugly and unfriendly, a terrible place that no one would want to go, and doesn't look much different than the ""real"" world the characters inhabit.Technically both films sport incredible attention to detail and a filmmaker in love with his art and style, often to the detriment of story. Watching ""The Fall"" to the end it's clear there wasn't one wasted frame, it just seemed confusing because one didn't know what the outcome was going to be, ie, you had to actually think a bit. ""Pan"" is full of sidetracks and tangents, clearly because the director simply thought it would be ""neato"" if certain creatures looked or acted the way they did, and the same with the human characters, who don't resemble ""real"" people any more than the monsters.The performances of Lee Pace and an alarmingly talented Catinca Untaru in ""The Fall"" are so real and touching it's like watching a magician perform--it's hard to believe that what you're seeing isn't real. You like ""Fall's"" characters even though Roy is a reprehensible, broken being that you should hate. ""Pan's"" sympathetic characters are so remote and un-knowable you can't like them at all, they're just more props for del Toro to move around like his dripping-with-goo puppets and dark, etched walls.Thematically, ""Pan"" presents a universe in which there is little or no hope, presided over by an evil human being who has no human attributes and is All Bad All The Time. The plot exists only to point out the unpleasant, and NOT universally shared belief, that life is to be suffered through, martyr-like, in order that one find rewards and riches in the afterlife that you were denied on earth. The violence is gratuitous and mean in a way that, far from being ""brutally honest"" speaks more about the immaturity of a director who couldn't stop himself from going too far, for kicks.""The Fall,"" on the other hand, assembles a crazy quilt of subtle clues that present a world that is complex, interesting and realistic. In life, unlike a scripted movie, things just keep going, no one knows exactly what to do and there's good and bad to be found everywhere at various times. For every answer there's a question, but the sooner you learn to live with the knowledge of these things, the easier your life will go--something everyone can appreciate learning even if they don't like hearing it. The fantasy world created is a brilliant fusion of what a man is dreaming up and how a little girl interprets what he says and, despite some silly humor, the world is indeed very ""fairy tale"" like and magical. The violence is also gratuitous in parts, but violence IS ugly, and as the young Alexandria is literally forced to find out, it can't always be avoided...but it can be dealt with in a world of hope. Director Tarsem obviously knows a thing or two about grief management and loss, and how to battle through to come to peace on the other end. The denouement of ""The Fall"" is a beautiful moment that avoids being cloying and over-sentimental while still being satisfying and very moving.Finally, in ""Pan"" a young girl is forced by all-powerful, unknowable forces to complete a task that doesn't make sense to her and in the end is rewarded with a crown. In ""The Fall"" a young girl is guided by an unknowable force into an interaction with a damaged soul that sends her on a journey that doesn't make sense to her but ultimately gives her tools to grow, learn and lead a more fulfilling existence from then on. The choice of which is the better film is as obvious to me as a brightly colored butterfly.",The Fall

It has a certain innocence sprouting out beneath all the tension that you forget the pain of the characters but focus on their epic journeys of courage, valour and most importantly the will of never giving up till the very end.Just as the little girl is anxious everyday to listen to the tale of the five heroes and thier quest to get revenge, knowing altogether that it is a made up story from characters and elements that we see in the hospital, yet we gladly forget about it and eagerly wait for the next chapter of the story just like the little girl.Our lead hero who is a stuntman during the glorious and dangerous 'Silent Era of Films' is hurt in love and has broken his back in a filming accident, he has lost all his will to live, then the little curious and mischievous child enters his room and they from an friendly relationship where he tells her a made up story to make her leave but soon their friendship strengthens and takes different turns just as his story progresses to different chapters and angles.It is because of this daily routine of progressing the story that we are introduced to different memorable characters and locations, and at the same time his will to live is ignited again. Just like the story, he becomes a father figure for the girl who has lost her father at an very early stage.THE film has no major flaws, has excellent on location filmography showing us various historic locations all across the globe with brilliant Cinematography and an flawless music score that fits the scenes and brings out their meanings beautifully and gives us absolutely no reason to dislike this masterpiece of modern cinema showing us brilliantly the Dangerous era of experiments in cinema when people actually put their lives on the line for making movies and whose efforts need to be appreciated even more i.e ""The Silent Era.""The subject matter is tragic yet it has a certain feel-good feeling to it like 'Secret life of walter mitty', 'The Diving Bell and The Butterfly', 'The Awakening' etc that tells us to live our lives to the fullest even in the most difficult times as good times shall definitely come to those who live freely.",The Fall

I was stunned, moved and so deeply affected the first time I saw it that I continued to dream about it for several nights. Now, every time I watch I ask it, as the protagonist asks the child, ""Are you trying to save my soul?"" Not only because it has the most endearing child artist I have ever seen on screen, or because it is filled with visually stunning images, or because it has metaphysical theme, or because it has Indian connection, but because apart from all these, how the story is told by interlacing the subtleties of human emotions with dreamy fantasies, that makes me watch it over and over again.Whenever I am sad, I watch it to cheer me up.

I want to guess how things are going to turn out, if I even understand exactly what's occurring. The ending is what brings things together (or doesn't). So many Hollywood films are at least fairly good, but then a lame ending is tacked on, ruining the experience. The idea, apparently, is that the audience must feel good. At the end of ""The Fall,"" I don't know how I feel. It seems to encompass many if not all human emotions in a very economical and satisfying way.Basically, ""The Fall"" is a psychological film - the surreal imagery reflects a particular mental state that is generated from real, historical conditions. Even today, people who do stunts for movies often place themselves in very dangerous situations. I had never thought about how many people were seriously injured or killed in all those incredible stunts of the silent movie era. We go to see films and don't really think about the toll it takes on those involved. Instead, if we think of anything besides the film, we think of the lives of the ""stars."" ""The Fall"" compels us to ask why we prefer film to storytelling (either orally or in the form of a book), which is true for most people today. I felt very satisfied at the end.Yes, I can think of some things I would have done differently (which I would view as superior), but I don't see how any ""flaw"" this film may have detracts from the overall effect. If you want a movie that has ""good guys"" and ""bad guys,"" with the usual structure and the Hollywood ending, please don't go see this. Wait until you think you are seeking something more meaningful in life, and then go see this film. Note that this is not for the ""intellectuals"" who think that a lack of clarity and a confused symbolism mean that a film is a ""great achievement."" What's also great about it is that you can bring older children to see it and then have an intelligent conversation with them about what happened and what it may mean, both now and when they grow up.",The Fall
101,sonicheze8,"Visually mesmerizing, fantastically filmed",9,30 July 2019,"The fall is a gorgeous film. I heard about this movie from praises about its cinematography, and all those praises were verified through my watch of The Fall. A story in a story - one about a girl and a stuntman, another about an epic tale spanning the globe in the perspective of the girl. The perspective plays a big role in the film and it's fun to see why her childish wonderment is an excellent frame for this film, as it allowed the film to go all out on the set-pieces, breathtaking landscapes, detailed costumery. There are scenes where the camera zooms out until the characters are but small lines on the screen.Incredibly stylish and dazzling, I found this movie's vision to be all-consuming. The enthusiasm and detail spent on each scene were enough to appease the visual storytelling. Moreover, the film has a natural and direct way of filming dialogue. Sometimes, multiple characters will talk at the same time, and it translates to a style of film that's unique and distinct. The acting of Catinca Untaru was awesome. Her childlike naivety and her inability to understand English as it wasn't her first language made her unbelievably charming and cute. Apparently, her dialogue was mostly spontaneous and the director made the filming more discreet to facilitate her actual portrayal.The bleeding of real-life and imagination is a central theme that I took notice to. I think the film took the right steps to make the film more grounded instead of a stylistic mash of beautiful scenes. It's real, and fun and there's probably no film quite like this.",The Fall

This movie works on almost any level you want it to. As a kids/adventure epic...As a romance drama...As a comedy of errors...As sci-fi...well, maybe not sci-fi so much, more fantasy. The writing is solid, but honestly until you watch the film a few times, you probably won't realize how well the film is actually written (since you will be visually awed and following the story so closely). The cinematography is absolutely stunning - some of the best in any film (and that is NOT hyperbole). It was shot over four years and incorporates footage shot in over 20 countries...which is pretty rare/incredible for a movie anytime, but especially now. Also, there are almost no special effects...even the burning tree man has no cgi. Really, just on every level, this is what you want out of a film...it is entertaining, unique, and unforgettable.PS: This is the BEST movie to show off your blu ray player.",The Fall

But the whole Austin Powers franchise deserved to be rated R. My wife took the kids to it, got almost half way, & walked out. But I saw nothing in The Fall to justify it being given such a restrictive rating. It's mostly a story told by an actor in a hospital telling--as he makes-up--a fantastic story to a little girl whose also in the hospital.The story is beautifully filmed in dream-like sequences. Great acting from all, especially the main too characters. There's nothing inappropriate for kids to see, so if your kids are old enough to understand the theme, or have it explained, then I see no reason for them not to see it. I think the younger ones will be captivated by the beautiful visuals & young co-star.",The Fall
105,JolinKnight,Imagination and reality,8,29 August 2013,"The only thing I knew at the beginning of this movie is that this is a story telling but involving the emotion of the real life. I think one thing can get from this film is that imagination is not far away from reality. Here I am totally opposite to those guys who always say people should live in reality rather than too much dream. And from this movie I get my proofs. Firstly, everyone need dreams, no matter who they are, how old they are or what kind of life they are living. An injured stunt man who can only lies on the bed everyday, whose girlfriend abandoned him, and whose career seems to be over. An little girl who accidentally got sick and lived in the hospital. The stunt man began to tell the story in his hopeless mind, and the lovely girl was attracted by the fantastic drama. Obviously, the story is the reflection of the stunt's life, there were dreams, although it came from resentment. The girl also made herself into the story, the happy ending is her dream. So two strangers came together with their dreams, their own dreams or their common dream. Furthermore, imagines definitely get relationship with reality. It seems that the stunt man's story is coherent, but actually the story can be different everyday when he told to the girl. For instance, when he met the girl for the first time he is happy maybe because the lovely girl brought his life a piece of bright. So the beginning of the story are filled with hope, although it came from hate as well. However, the day-by-day story jumped a little bit too far, some plot suddenly came across. Although it is acceptable but it can be seen from here that the emotion of the stunt is the trigger. By this we can say that it is his everyday life influences the plot - his imagination. Finally, the imagination has an impact on the reality. With despair, the stunt wanted to end the story with a tragedy. However the bright little girl dragged him back as well as saving his life. It is the girl's imagination helps to change the story in other words the stunt's imagination and then makes change to his real life in other word brings him back from despair. To sum up, I believe we should live in reality but we can not live without imagination. They like brothers influencing with each other, they both can decide your fate.",The Fall
106,rsa5387,Visual Spectacle,10,23 December 2008,"The Fall is truly poetry on celluloid. The most visually arresting film I've seen since The Fountain is also one of the best films I've seen this year. Take the child-like fantasy of The Princess Bride, add a dollop of the more macabre Pans Labyrinth, and the otherworldly gorgeousness of films like Lord Of The Rings, What Dreams May Come, and Tarsem's own The Cell and you get The Fall. An interesting plot? Definitely. But what really kept my interest was the visual storytelling on display throughout this film. Every frame of The Fall is composed and shot with aplomb. It will literally send your rods and cones into overload with the plethora of colors on display in its opulently designed land and dreamscapes. The acting, tight editing, and moving score also compliment the film tremendously. In summary, this is film is an absolute marvel that screams to be seen on a big screen. Its visual splendor alone is worth the price of admission. Unfortunately, seeing that it fell beneath the radar during the distribution process with a very limited release, its not a well known commodity outside the art-house circle. Strangely, thats a blessing in disguise, as films of this nature rarely receive the type of promotional push required to be a commercial success. I say more power to brave, independent filmmakers who are willing to let financial success elude them so the creative expression of their art isn't altered to suit what studio giants believe will sell to mainstream audiences. This is an epic, engaging, visually astounding film that should be seen by all.",The Fall

The chemistry between Lee Pace and Catinca was magic, and though you see the word roller-coaster used too often nowadays, I have to say that it touched every emotion I can think of, from tears to laughter.It is an exceptional piece of work which caters to every generation and one of those family films you can go to without worry.If Hollywood and all the other huge cinema chains throughout the world were to advertise it as it deserves, this film could and should be re-released and become the major distribution success it so absolutely needs to be.

But I found this films to be incredibly disappointing. It never embraces the metaphorical possibilities of the script, and considering how interesting its fantastical premise is, it plays it pretty safe with a mostly safe and conventional narrative. The acting is fine, and the visuals are beautiful, but I was just left empty by this movie, and considering what it could have been, that is a tragic disappointment. I would still say that this is a film that might be worth checking out, just for the experience, but I would suggest going in with low expectations. Don't expect anything amazing.",The Fall
110,barendbkj,The perfect EPIC! bedtime story...but it's so much more...WOW!!!!,10,12 July 2013,"The Fall...Basically about a stuntman who injures himself and a little girl how becomes involved in his life, both of them with some heavy personal baggage. He starts to tell her an amazing adventure with five lovable heroes.I have to so while I watched The Fall I was chained to my seat just to find out what will happen next in Roy's story. I even cried when Alexandria told him to ""let him live."" But afterward I was a bit confused but a few hours later it started to make sense to me.Alexandria, lost her dad, but she doesn't quite know what happened, and Roy, a suicidal stuntman, who uses her to get Morphine so he can kill himself because he feels there's nothing left for him. In the end she opens his eyes and forces him to accept that he has to live, that she needs him to live. And in a way she faces the fact that she misses her father and she can't stand to loose Roy to. And it's about letting your imagination go, to let it run free, to forget about any pains and just realize that the answer to all that pain lies in the most unexpected places.At some stages you can't quite make out what Alexandria says, but it's really easy to follow, and her acting gives a certain innocent feel to The Fall. But it's anything but innocent. It's a grown-up fantasy with beautiful and unexpected twist and turns to leave you guessing what will happen next. This movie is as original as can get.Not only is it a deep and moving film, but it looks magnificent, it feels like your part of the adventure, and just like Alexandria you want Roy never to stop.You might not get it when the end-credits come up, but you'll definitely want to try and make sense of it and when you've done that you'll feel completely blown away....",The Fall

And add to all this, the astonishing visuals from documentaries like ""Baraka"" and ""Powaqqatsi"". Sounds crazy, right? Well, it is crazy, but the good kind of craziness.""The Fall"" is a very special kind of movie: It can be very innocent and lighthearted at times, but it can be dark and intense as well. That is one of it best qualities of this film: The way in which the director manages to combine the innocence with the brutality, (Both in the reality and in the fantasy) in order to give us a fascinating tale, where the tenderness and the joy to live are combined with the blood and the despair.Unlike the previous film of Tarsem Singh, ""The Cell"", the strength of ""The Fall"" not only lays on the visuals, but in the story and the characters as well. Sure, at first sight those elements seem to be very simplistic and typical, but as the story advances, it gets more and more captivating. The imaginary world could be an escape from harsh reality, but also it could be the place where someone has to challenge one's personal demons. The death and the sadness quickly invade the fairy tale, changing the course of it. But there is also the hope and the light. And this movie manages to combine very well all this characteristics without using stereotypes or forced situations. And the performance of Cantica Untaru only helps to make this film an unforgettable experience, the kind of film that leaves you with a smile in the faceAnd probably some tears in your cheeks too.",The Fall

She nailed it, she got me fall in love with her. Cantica surely plays her really well!Furthermore, the story with transitions from reality to fantasy and so on is ultimately enjoyable, the dark side of the issue in the movie is covered in mesmerizing colorful way.

114,VoiceOfEurope,Visually compelling,8,14 October 2008,"Tarsem Singh, hands down, is one of the most gifted directors in today's Hollywood combining traditions of Eastern film-making with vital elements of the ""movie picture Americana"". But folks, why did it take eight years for you to recognize this? The Cell, his first feature-length movie, was just as perfectly crafted as The Fall. Both of them, with their unique color schemes, bold set and costume design, have since inspired innumerable visual artists, from fashion photographers to haut couture designers. And if I got started I would never get to the end of that list, believe me.The Fall is the embodiment of visual perfection. Mesmerizing and blood curdling. The colors are complementing each other like never before in movie history. They are a treat to the eyes like Mozart chocolate is to the taste buds. Copycats might have followed, but this is the real thing. Or, was it The Cell where it all began? What better answer to find to this question than the fact that Tarsem is caught repeating himself a hefty number of times in The Fall - some frames are like they were direct outtakes from his previous work. The emerging head from the water, the dunes and the dried out desert lake, the horse-riding - I have seen them all in The Cell. However, this time, the twenty-something countries that had served as shooting locations are really making your jaw drop to the floor. All my respect goes out to the location scouts and location managers. Marvellous job! What an inconceivable logistic nightmare it could have been. The plot, however, left a few question-marks in me. I saw a few loose ends left hanging in the air. Well, I did not seem to quite understand the role of the women in the story, in the first place. At times, it seems that everything revolves around them, then, all of a sudden, they become secondary to the revenge oath. I do not understand why Roy changes his mind about the fate of his Blue Bandit character either. It is inevitable, the change I mean, from our point of view - otherwise we would not be able to learn where all the characters originated from -, but it does not come naturally from his predicament. Also inconclusive is the act - in the first half of the film - of the five sworn men to free the slaves in the desert as well as the princess but leave her 10- year-old nephew behind to die.All in all, this is a really spectacular movie of epic size, with a few minor inconsistencies.

115,KoalaBear33,Spectacular special effects and cinematography with very unique plot,8,3 November 2013,"Regardless of one's interests, I think The Fall is one of those films that everyone should see in their life. I wouldn't quite say it is a masterpiece that should be near the top of everyone's list--it isn't--but it is so unique that you will probably not see another film like it.The special effects, costume design, style, and cinematography is unlike anything you would ever see. When people praise special effects, some people think of the modern blockbuster with tons of explosions and collapsing cities; yet, that is not the case here. Great care has been taken in this film to bring unique environments to life. Some of the Eastern-influenced scenes are remarkable.Although the plot follows a traditional arc, the scenes depicted are very unique and memorable. Everything is just so styling and unlike what is seen in most films. Having said that, the somewhat predictable story weakens this film. I think Tarsem Singh should spend more time on the plot (or work more closely with a better screenwriter--same weakness exists in his other films). What could have been a spectacular film is reduced to merely very-good because of the plot.This is the type of film that isn't ranked very high by me (8 stars) but is so unique that it is worth seeing over some of the other higher ranked films. If the film didn't lose some marks for its weak, somewhat clichéd, plot, I think it would deserve more stars.",The Fall
116,hazel-752-685975,Was nobody else depressed by watching this film?,8,11 October 2010,"Please tell me I'm not the only one. i had no idea what I was in for as I'd only seen some of the effects explained by this special effects guy at a science-fiction convention. My mum later watched the trailer for it and my family found a way into watching it. It was absolutely breathtaking but reduced me to tears several times, I mean seriously: the stunt guy's committing suicide or thinking about it every few minutes and the beautiful innocence of the little girl is almost painful in comparison! She has no idea what's going on in his head. The plot I found quite hard to grasp but you really have to pay attention to the opening credits and the seemingly unimportant conversation inbetween scenes. The actors are amazing, and impossible not to believe. As you progress through the film you notice how the girl's imagination and the broken stuntman's are using reality in their story to help it move along, you begin to recognise many of the characters they talk about in the story in the hospital.Sure it has explosions, beautiful scenery and awesome acting but that doesn't stop the psychological side of things hitting home. I'm still thinking about this film a day afterwards. What really saddens me is that every film has a down point but it took so long for it to start turning up again in this one. The stuntman was only starting to get better at the very end of the film and I didn't find that satisfying enough, I wanted to KNOW whether he'd be okay or not. I know half of the people dying were just part of the story but that couldn't stop me feeling for them too.

The main argument was not clever as i though, and due the obvious lack of empathy for the imaginary characters of the narration, you expect an exceptional fictional history and a big development of the characters, but it wasn't like that.
The movie has nice landscapes and the use of visual effects are excellent and very original for this kind of middle budged film.

118,ellieforpeace,The Fall is no less than an accomplishment.,9,13 July 2009,"If you haven't heard of the The Fall, you are not alone. Chances are, you would have a hard time finding someone who did see this movie. I know just in central Virginia, it played for exactly one week at an indie cinema. Well, what you (and I) missed out on was one of the most cinematic movies of the past few years.The Fall is about a little girl named Alexandria (Catinca Untaru) stuck in a hospital with a broken arm who finds a paraplegic man in another ward. This man is a stuntman named Roy (Lee Pace) who tells her a marvelous story. However, to continue hearing it, she must do certain things for him sometimes. Anymore I think would spoil the plot, though it's not really about that.It's a brilliant premise, and wound up in the hands of a brilliant director. Not because of his direction, so to say, but for his idealism. The Fall was filmed over four years in eighteen countries. I don't know why awards don't touch this movie. Are the Oscars afraid of going too indie? Was it not broody enough for the Independent Spirit Awards? The cinematography was perhaps the best I have ever seen. It was the best of the year, Slumdog be damned. I just don't understand... the Academy is movie critics. They had to have seen this movie, right? Isn't that what they're paid to do?Anyway, the movie is a movie-making marvel. The little girl (and most of the cast and crew) thought Pace was paraplegic. Imagine the shock when he got up to film the action scenes. The little girl is also not an actress. She is so obviously not an actress, that at first it's hard to adjust to her. In a movie, you're used to seeing people acting, not just going around like normal. It works amazingly at the end, and when she does actually start acting and feeling more normal in front of the camera (much of the film was shot chronologically), it works very well.The first part of the movie is a little awkward as you're trying to movie between the story and the fantasy. It's not as seamless as, say, Pan's Labyrinth or Secondhand Lions. It's more like an editing room flaw. I feel like, after all the time spent on this movie, the beginning could be better. After all, not too terribly much is going on in the hospital at first. When there's a story within a story, and both need to be told, it's hard to find the proper balance, and that is where The Fall may not shape up. It's also hard, once the names of David Fincher and Spike Jonze were brought up as producing the spectacle, to keep yourself from speculating on what could have been. Both are genius directors, and I kept wondering if the beginning would be smoother if they had been employed to make it.However, the balance gets better as the movie progresses and reality and fantasy converge. It's mesmerizing, though it, too, has its rough spots. For example, I zoned out for maybe a minute or two and when I started focusing again, it appeared a baby was being tortured. I had to go back and focus again, and in context, it worked, though it's a very, very bizarre additive. In fact, looking back, there is little reason so far to give it over a three. But then the fantasy comes to a climax.It is one of the most brilliant scenes in of 2008, I have to say. It's like the scene at the end of Benjamin Button. It uplifts the movie to a spot where it wouldn't be otherwise. It's classic film, cinematic, and dramatic. The oral story climaxes in a sadomasochistic, torturing, depressive way, as the world spirals to an end. It truly is tortuous, but so brilliantly so. And though I am not a huge fan of the ending, it works, and I am better for the experience.The Fall, more than anything is an accomplishment. It's a triumph of cinema. It's a rousing adventure, and an emotional trip.",The Fall

If you want to know if you should see this movie, just read the titles of the 9- and 10-star reviews. This movie IS epic and mind-blowing and I feel like I can only repeat what others have said. It may not appeal to everyone because some people will think it's a movie for kids. They don't understand it as a fantasy for adults with a profound story that touches the heart. But don't read it as 'sentimental' - it isn't, it's just such a breathtakingly beautiful story you won't be able to take your eyes off it. The directing is fantastic, the visual side of the movie is unbelievable, the actors have such great chemistry that they transport you to a different world. A lot of the scenes between Lee Pace and Catinca were improvised (she was a little child so they couldn't teach her lines because she wouldn't act natural) and you can see it in their interactions. She's acting so great because she's just herself and the director simply captured every ounce of her childish charm. And those missing teeth and the cast on her arm, and how she cries in one dramatic scene, and every gesture she makes ... oh my God, you have to see this child. I've seen this movie two times so far, and I was spellbound both times. I only got to see it thanks to an acquaintance who recommended this movie no one has heard of before, and I'm so grateful to him for that! 'The Fall' is in my top ten movies that have had the biggest impact on me, maybe even in the top three. It's definitely the most stunningly beautiful movie I've ever seen.I get that it does n't work for some people, but I think that when it works for others it's because it really touches them. This movie makes you feel something, it finds your soft spots. It brings you back to the time when you were a kid who believed in fairy tales and that the world was a certain kind of place. The imagery, the ideas in the story, the choreography, the locations, the depth of emotion in the characters - everything about this movie is perfect, and it's for you, it's made out of love so that you'd fall in love. I saw this movie a few years ago and I still sometimes rewatch some scenes. Sometimes it's a place I want to see again, sometimes it's a piece of dialogue I want to listen to again, sometimes a little song.Just watch it. Don't question its logic, it does make sense.

I am astonished that a couple reviewers referred to ""The Fall,"" which was such an obvious labor of love and dedication on the part of Tarsem, as ""garbage,"" or ""the worst movie ever."" Of course one is entitled to one's opinion no matter how misguided or incorrect, but for someone to express it in such inappropriate, immature terms saddens me. I am, on the other hand heartened by the majority response to great little film, a film that has a growing following among people who appreciate the value of what Tarsem has made here.

However, after the Alexander scene the story and characters picked up pace and the relationship between the stuntman and the little girl developed very naturally and believably. Combined with an imagery that incredible, the black and white sequences came together like a puzzling and slightly sinister dream. The two main actors, the director have done an incredible job of grounding a very conceptual and visual film into a believable drama about friendship set in a period California.This film is a work of love and passion for stories, dreams, legends and cinema.

The main story with the heroes was boring and the story with the little girl was even more boring. Obviously the looks of the film deserve my 5/10. Costumes, locations, art direction were stunning. As in Cell the story doesn't pay off and is naive. I wish Tarsem next time will pick up a not only visually interesting project, but also something that matters and has something to add in our cinematic lives.",The Fall
126,augurar,Not good,5,25 February 2012,"As a work of audiovisual literature, this movie was an utter failure. The plot, such as it was, was not particularly interesting. Characterization was minimal, a fact which was worsened by several very poor acting performances (especially from Waddell and Pace). The narrative pacing was uneven and the direction felt cluttered and at times incoherent.That being said, the visuals of this movie were truly wonderful. The environments were dreamlike, evocative, beautiful. Really the only thing that gave the movie any structure at all were the visual motifs linking people, ideas, and themes. But unfortunately visuals alone were not enough to save the movie.",The Fall

It's a whimsical, engaging picture with a simple premise. We're at a hospital in LA during the 1920s. Among the patients are a handsome young stuntman and a little girl who is the daughter of orange-pickers who immigrated from Eastern Europe. Both have been seriously injured by falling. As they try to climb back up again (or not), the stuntman entertains the little girl with a fantastic adventure serial set in the Mughal palaces and forts of India. The tale features no deep meaning or shocking plot twists, just some gorgeous scenery, some appealing characters, and a few laughs. If you're nostalgic for old-time Hollywood spectaculars with more than a dash of Mumbai, this one's for you.",The Fall
128,d_generation_x-1,Who was this aimed for?,1,17 September 2008,"Im sorry to say this, and I know people will hate me for it, but this must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen.Visually stunning? Yes it is, for a very short amount of the film however (which makes up for very little of this mess called a film).The plot is fairly simple, I will not get into that as it has been mentioned before. Simply put, it's a children's tale told through the words of a hospital patient high off morphine to a little girl. No jokes, the plot line has been described as ""a hospital patient, who's health is gradually getting worse"" and as his ""health"" deteriorates his story gets increasingly absurd.The script is very poorly written, before I get into the script however I will talk about the acting, and more importantly, the actors/actresses. In a movie, it's alright if someone has an accent (which is hard to understand, but forgivable as it's not their fault), it's alright to stutter (depending on the role), it's all right to mutter, but when you find a girl (the main character at that) who not only has an accent, but mutters AND stutters while acting out a poorly written script, it just spells TROUBLE. I'm sorry, but I COULDN'T understand what she was saying, no matter how hard I paid attention, I just couldn't. I know it sounds harsh, but if you do decide to watch this disaster of a movie, put on subtitles as you WONT understand the girl. As for the other main actor (I never remember names) he did a very MEDIOCRE job at acting. Although most of the time it wasn't his fault; it was the scriptwriters. Seriously, how do you expect a guy to act a role where he's high off morphine for 90% of the script, and do it to a good standard? Also the chemistry between the two main characters wasn't there, the male actor looked really weird, and really did nothing but give an impression of a pedophile. There was one scene when the little girl is sitting on his bed and he gives her this look, the sort of look a man would give a woman who he lusts (p.s the girl is 6 and the man in his late 20's). Directing was done very poorly and at times you get frustrated with the little girls acting, it's as if she isn't even paying attention to what she's doing, sometimes muttering while the other actor is talking to her etc. it just felt to me as if the script writers just told the actors to sit there and talk about a topic and just wing it, without a script.Now for the script, oh the script, the script the devil himself wrote, this script could be passed of as a satanic bible, it really could. I don't know where to being, confusions left, right and center came when watching this film. I was still left with questions, from the beginning to the very end. It made no sense, the whole movie gave the impression that the man had injured himself to the point where he couldn't walk anymore (which leads in an attempted suicide), then at the end of the movie it's revealed his legs got better and he can walk again (so what was the point in suicide if he just had broken legs? Or whatever injury he had would heal?). Then there was the whole ""what happened between him and his girlfriend?"" question that really gets me, anyways I wont bore you with all the questions I had while watching this movie (I'm sure the word limit would not allow it even if I could).I'd just like to say, the movie IS visually stunning for about five minutes (that's about the only positive..), HOWEVER it doesn't grip you from beginning to end.I was under the impression that this movie was suited more towards adults (because of it's R rating, and obviously the plot line which seemed fascinating to all ages) instead it turned out to be a children's movie with several scenes which couldn't be deemed 'suitable for children' along with themes such as: murder, suicide, drug abuse etc etc, putting it under the ""R"" category, even though 90% of the film is for kids.To sum up:This film is NOT for children, and NOT for adults. Its for nobody. Watch this 2 hour movie with caution as it WILL waste your time.1/10",The Fall

It does not drag or become tedious, but it still very thorough at exploring the very interesting dynamics that the story and it's characters offer. It flows very well through a range of emotions and can be just as funny as it is dramatic. There is action, adventure, romance, comedy, drama, and even gets a little spooky a couple of times. This is a film that hard core film buffs could thoroughly enjoy as well as your average moviegoer. I am sad to see that this didn't get a larger theatrical release cause I believe it could have done quite well. Regardless it is now on DVD and if you have not yet see it, you should make a point to as soon as you can. It truly captures the spirit of the classic adventure tales, like few movies do.

Which means it joins the likes of ""The Third Man"" and ""Citizen Kane."" As many others have commented, it is visually stunning, with images you will never forget. But equally unforgettable are the performances--all of them. The interplay between Catinca Untaru and Lee Pace is extraordinary, created a genuine warmth and mutual appreciation on the screen. Her performance is probably the finest acting by a child that I have ever seen on film--right up there with Margaret O'Brien in ""Meet Me in St. Louis"" and Christian Bale in ""Empire of the Sun."" But Pace should be credited for the nuances of his performance and creating the atmosphere that facilitated their marvelous ease with each other. I do have one caution, though: PLEASE DON'T RENT THIS FILM OR BUY IT TO WATCH ON A TV. IT REALLY MUST BE SEEN ON A BIG SCREEN TO BE APPRECIATED.

134,iso-kincses,Eye Candy (in a good sense),10,27 October 2008,"I loved 'The Cell' so much that I was utterly disappointed by its reviews and the lack of afterlife. There are just so many talentless, or burnt out directors these days who can get their hands on relatively good scripts and mess around with them, while Tarsem was nowhere to be seen for long years.So I've been waiting for this film so long (it was only released in Hungary recently) and it hasn't let me down. I've read some bad comments, going about it'd be nauseously colorful and it's art for art's sake, etc, but I never minded. One can rarely see a movie as a motion picture or as I'd like to think of it: pictures put after each other to create the illusion of movement. This one does so: almost every cut is a painting. These paintings are well composed and you can take your time to consume them as the pace corresponds the natural limits of perception. What is worth seeing is not thrown at you like an explosion in one tenth of a second but it's either a still-life or a slow motion action.I have to admit the script has it's flaws. The frame story is too simple and the tale within the story lacks the moral or the epic in it. It's like any story we could make up under a bit of a pressure to improvise. But we couldn't paint such good illustrations to our fairy tales and this is the issue here. Most directors would have messed it up by choosing the wrong actors and scenes never mind costumes and shooting angles. Tarsem delivered the best the script allowed him.He should be directing comic book adaptations, science fictions and any movie that has something to do with dreams, fantasies or hallucinations. Francis Lawrence was decent with 'Constantine' but Tarsem could have been better at it. I love Guillermo Del Toro (especially Pan's Labyrinth) but Hellboy could have been a bit more saturated with Tarsem behind the camera. 10/10 to Terry Gilliam for The Brothers Grimm, yet he messed up Tideland, and Tarsem Singh could have pulled that off, too. Not to mention Aeon Flux or the completely screwed up Alexander (sad but true: Oliver Stone has been just lame for the past 10-11 years).All in all: hope the seven scant years are over with 'The Fall' and I really do hope the movies marked here as announced or in-production will be completed in time and they'll get the chance to recruit more fans to this cinematographic style.",The Fall

However, the director decided, besides the inception of the friendship between the young girl and the stuntman, to focus the ""dream"" part on a story of bandits and revenge. this, to my opinion, was not the most appropriate choice to make. If the landscapes are truly stunning and a rare visual sense is proposed with this movie, I found the story extremely slow and senseless. Revenge, battles, travel, brotherhood, all of this with the speed and the intensity of snail. As the ""real world"" part made more sense as this happens in a hospital I somehow appreciated more what what they are.I would only recommend this movie to peoples in search of artistic visual experience while watching a movie, that are ready to sacrifice their interest with a plot.This movie started greatly for me but turned out to be a true deception after 25mn.",The Fall

I felt similar sentiments with his earlier film The Cell. Pretty pictures - that what The Fall has to offer. His four-year odyssey across more than two-dozen countries pays dividends in the way the movie looks. It's too bad there's not much to go along with all those arresting images. The way in which the story unfolds evokes The Wizard of Oz and The Princess Bride, but the synthesis of the elements marks The Fall as vastly inferior to either. Sometimes, looking good isn't enough. Lee Pace is alright and the ladies will love his fashion sense here but the script is the main culprit.",The Fall
138,ncolborn-1,Sublime beauty - shame about the story,6,19 June 2009,"The strength of Tarsem Singh's remarkable film lies in its visual artistry. Multiple locations in some of the world's loveliest places - Southern Africa, China, Spain - were just the beginning. This was so much more than just a fantasy with lots of exotic scenes. What made each scene so memorable was the use of contrasting colour combinations, geometric shapes against natural backgrounds, stark scenes with simple lines which looked drawn, rather than photographed and fascinating, mesmerising movements. The human bodies were beautiful, but mainly because of how they were dressed and positioned; the actions were balletic and choreographed to fill the entire visual space and the sound worked beautifully with the whole.There were visual 'in-jokes' and references which kept jolting one's attention. Darwin's pet monkey was called Wallace, for example, after Alfred Russel Wallace, the man who contributed the keystone - Survival of the Fittest - to Darwin's theory of evolution. The monkey reaching for a butterfly recalled a scene from the original All Quiet On The Western Front. Even the butterfly itself was, I believe, a false Monarch - an example of insect mimicry - rather than the true species. I'd watch this film again and again, for all that beauty.But, as film expert Robert McKee would probably say, 'the story sucks.' The plot lines, both of the fantasy tale and of the real life narrative hobble along with little pace. The child actress, Cantinca Untaru is wonderfully natural, though frequently inaudible, and draws much sympathy. Lee Pace, however, has the most clunking, unconvincing lines and scenes and despite acting superbly, simply hasn't enough material to be able to construct a role. The pacing is all wrong - erratic, at times, frequently stagnant and by the end of the film, one feels sorry not to see more of the breathtaking scenery but relieved that the whole limping narrative has finally bumped blindly into the buffers.",The Fall

Not a fan of the cell, (the previous movie this director )i was a bit skeptical but i decided to be patient and see. And let me say it was worth it. Tho i wasn't paying full attention for some of the movie, the last 30 minutes even though i wasn't fully watching i could almost feel myself about to burst in tears, the visually stunning cinematography and gripping imaginative script , the emotions on screen , i could not contain myself, it was so beautiful it just hurt. Add to that some excellent acting ( the finest young actress I've seen in a long time - dakota fanning could learn book loads from this girl!) and you've got a littl gem of a movie . It was easy to say i liked the movie, but i definitely have to see it again for a total synopsis. I read earlier that this movie is a sort of remake from a Bulgarian movie 25 years ago, but ill bet that movie didn't have the cinematography and music of this one, which were the most important parts of the music ( and the little girls acting).This is the second time i write a review for a movie, and the first was for Jesus Christ Vampire hunter. If you haven't seen that movie yet , go and see it. Its a love it or hate it thing, like fear and loathing or the big lebowski, like Britney or Bush, like diet Coke or Pepsi max. And so is this movie, but the general opinion swings towards the love. Its one of the most original movies i have ever seen, and i watch a good 2 to 3 movies a day , and originality is the hardest quality to find in a movie,especially with all these garbage remakes and endless sequels coming out.Ill leave it at that.

However, the beautifully photographed inner story starts out promising, but was not as good as it should have been and went on too long .... the plot was only superficially reflective of and intertwining with the outer story, and just not very interesting (my companion got bored and fell asleep). Other story-within-story movies have had much richer and more involved inner plots that interplay better with the outer plot (e.g. the Little Princess). This inner plot was rich only in the visuals. There is a section of the inner story which includes an amount of mostly gruesome violence that becomes tedious. Additionally, there were some promising threads in the outer plot that were not followed through on. So it was amazing on a number of levels, but flawed and ultimately unsatisfying, though I think still very worth seeing.",The Fall

The compelling way in which Tarsem Singh manages to weave the two storylines together, until the lines between fiction and reality blur more and more, is really amazing.The settings, the colours, the score, it's all a feast for the eyes and ears. It's a pleasure to see Lee Pace interact so naturally with Cantinca Untaru, who delivers a superb performance as Alexandria. Everyone down to secondary and tertiary characters are well cast and the movie keeps its gripping pace until the end.
The heartbreaking scene between Roy Walker and Alexandria after her accident is one of the best moments of movie history and truly deserving of an Oscar.Still, this may not be a movie for everyone, as it might appear strange at first and many scenes only reveal their hidden meaning upon a second or third viewing, but I can only highly recommend it to those who enjoy the magic of stories!",The Fall

Especially great, real acting, heartwarming moments, creative dialogue and don't even get me started on the visuals.I have been a fan of visually artsy movies for a long time.There is great movies out there, that give us glimpses of the visual movie magic that is out there. For example, movies like ""The Fountain"".I'd consider myself a movie-buff. Not an expert, but I have seen way more movies than most people in their lifetime and I can't remember a movie with more visual story telling, metaphors, scene-transitions, color work and blending of real sets with CGI.There really is no way to even begin to describe it, so please - for the love of god - if you like surrealism, paintings and artworks that you want to stare at for hours or just beautiful sceneries that just look like there is no way anyone could have captured it back in 2006. This movie is magic, and it baffles me that this one doesn't find its way into many movie-must-see-lists.The only people I would not recommend this movie to are young people that lack the experience in life to relate to the topics and to understand the metaphors and underlying message of the movie.

The parallels drawn between fact and fiction makes the film a magical feast. Belief is willingly suspended and reality is blurred. The characters are very well drawn. Especially Alexandria is perfect. I am familiar with Lee Pace from ""Pushing Daisies"" and there he looks like a good character player, but here, in ""The Fall,"" he is brilliant.

Now with the Spike Jonez and Fincher names attached, I was able to see it on the big screen today.My friend and I went to see it at a very good theatre in the outskirts of Hollywood. While it has some fantastic shots... not just some but nearly all, the story left me asking ""what did we just see?"" as I really did not care for ANY of the characters by the end apart from the girl.The few moments where there is human emotion, are excellent and can bring a tear, however the horribly clichéd lines that break any seriousness aid the downfall that is added to yet another tragedy of recent films that are sub par HINT: See this on a friend's LARGE SCREEN or PROJECTED IMAGE.

146,ostergaardof4,Beauty Incanate -- and not just in imagery,10,3 July 2010,"Mr. Ebert says you should watch this movie just because it exists. Mr. Wilde says that art exists only for this reason. As an addict of aesthetics, especially when they agree with my own sensibilities, this movie is far and away the most beautiful thing created in the last ten years. Actually, I'll get back to you on whether its the most beautiful thing from the last century. What comes close? Hmmm... a couple Picassos, Maybe some Miles Davis. Henry Fonda's face? Well, if you combined these things and added the cutest child ever to act and strung them into a complexly plotted and tightly executed conglomeration of sight and sound, you'd get Tarsem's movie here. Plot: girl breaks arm picking oranges in orange county. Hospitalized. Man paralyzes himself jumping from a moving train to horseback as he is a stuntman in early Hollywood. Hospitalized. When bones are broken and people are confined, unlikely friendships form and stories are told. The movie follows two plots: the story that he tells her and the story of their interactions with various doctors, nurses, priests, other patients... As the two plots intertwine, we learn more about each of their lives. As with all friendships, the more we learn of each character, the more complex plot. That is, he decides to commit suicide and enlists her in smuggling him morphine pills. I mean, you just don't get more original or interesting or complex than that! But! Its awesome does not end there!Filmed in over 20 countries with a minimal of computer imaging, The Fall questions the power of imagination in a time period where people decided that moving pictures were both the new life and ultimate death of imagination. While it makes no effort to assert philosophy, The Fall exudes simple, childlike morality which is actually refreshing in our super gray world of ambiguity. What is bad? What is wrong? Manipulating children into aiding suicide: its bad, its wrong, it may be the ultimate bad wrong you can exert with your power as an adult. What is selfish and useless? Suicide. Period. Tarsem sees little point lollygagging about thought-heavy things once these black and white morals are dealt with. Because of its moral simplicity the story becomes doubly potent and heart breaking—you as viewer are sucked into the child's earnest perspective, pretty much regardless of how cynical you may think you are. To make this all the more realistic, our lead actress, Cantica Untaru, is a young Romanian lass who actually barely acts. She was told ""this is a movie set, this is your co-star, this is the story."" Beyond that, most is ad-libbed. Her costar, Lee Pace, who I hope to see in many more things, knew what he had to say and where the story had to go, but beyond that... They even went so far as to not let him out of character the whole time so they were constantly interacting, as his character is paralyzed from the waist down, this includes him being in a wheel chair for the whole of filming. It comes through most poignantly. Love it. Lemme see... Special effects are minimalist. It's one of the main appeals of the film as a whole. That fade from butterfly to island? Done the old fashioned way-with splicing of gelatin, not with photo-shop. I don't even want to try and comprehend how long it took them to set up the one desert shot that segues between the marriage and the death sentence scenes. Colors are all more vivid and enhanced, but not annoyingly so. Wash out filters are only used subtly, most glaringly in the last scene where Orange County and Alexandra's experience of it are nostalgia-ized with a sepia hue, but again, its acceptably subtle. Black and white is used only because it has to be in the plot. Slow motion is used perfectly – not too much. Supporting cast, supports. Everything that seems out of place or odd is only as such because it fits the mind of an 8 year old in a foreign country imagining a story being told to her by an almost stranger. When you're finished watching this the first time, you are nothing but stunned. Done the second, you start thinking about it, realize there's nothing to think about beyond the mastery of the film-making itself. Every detail your over analytical mind tries to pick apart and apply some obscure philosopher to just points back to the plot. Third watching, you start wondering how the hell long the story boarding must have taken. Yea. Damn.",The Fall
147,Ampero,Breath of fresh idea,8,27 January 2010,"The Fall is probably one of the best examples of Art Nouveau on film. The director knew what his vision for the film was and he executed it wonderfully. Set in the 1920's at a Los Angeles hospital, we're introduced to Alexandria, a young patient with a broken arm and a penchant for mischief. By chance she gets to meet with Roy when a letter that she wrote for one of the nurses finds its way to his bed. Roy is a broken man, all puns intended, submitted for a broken back due to a fall in his line of work as a stuntman. To add to Roy's broken persona, he's also having a hard time dealing with a break-up and is brought to suicidal tendencies because of it and being potentially paralyzed for life.The friendship between Alexandria and Roy buds when, for need of company it seems, Roy starts to relay a fictional love and revenge story of a bandit, The Blue Bandit, seeking to rescue the love of his life (Justine Waddell) from an evil governor, Governor Odious (Daniel Caltigirone). The story piques Alexandria's interest as she likes bandits and the quest for love. The narrative is read to us as a mutual imaginative journey filled with lush landscapes and beautiful architecture told by Roy then illustrated and not-so-subtly directed by Alexandria. The story takes the helm for most of the movie and we grow to appreciate some new characters. We see the Blue Bandit joining arms with four new heroes- an Indian swordsman (Jeetu Verma) that seeks revenge with Gov. Odious for the kidnapping and death of his beloved squaw; an explosives expert named Luigi (Robin Smith) who wants to kill Gov. Odious for shunning him from his hometown; a former slave of Gov. Odious named Otto Benga (Marcus Wesley) that swore revenge when a co-slave died in a plantation fire; the esteemed Charles Darwin (Leo Bill) who wanted revenge for Odious sending him a dead specimen of a butterfly he chased after and a mystical, well, Mystic (Julian Bleach) who wanted justice when Odious was responsible for destroying his native land.Needless to say, the characters are all interpretations of people Alexandria encounters and knows. While the narrative takes on a film of its own, it does weave in a parallel manner to the real-life aspect of the movie. As Roy's sanity worsens the narrative gets darker, much to the dismay of Alexandria. As a notion to keep the story positive, Roy tricks Alexandria into stealing medication for him and things escalate into an intervention of sorts, leaving Roy to sort his life out.The Fall is a brilliant movie and will surprise you with its story and the depth of its characters, especially the acting chaps on Catinca Untaru Romanian-tainted English adds a bit of cuteness to her lines. I envy anyone who may get to watch this in HD because the cinematics really stand out in this film and when you learn that none of it was special effects you grow to appreciate it that much more.Standout Line: ""What a mystery this world, one day you love them and the next day you want to kill them a thousand times over.""",The Fall

And it does. I don't know how much of the budget was spent on filming at all those spectacular locations, but it sure was worth it. Anyways, that's what is usually praised about the film, so let's talk about other major positive aspects.Very rarely can you get to see such touching and real main roles played by children under ten years old. Maybe Dakota Fanning in ""I am Sam"", or Jacob Tremblay on 2015's ""Room"", but I most certainly could count them with one hand. Her interaction with Lee Pace (Roy), whose performance shouldn't either to be overlooked, is adorable and convincing. There are many sad moments, but it also didn't fail to make me laugh at times. You actually feel for the people in both the fantasy and the real worlds. I specially liked that you could notice how the characters and story changed when the little girl had her input on the storytelling, or when Roy had a different mental state. The only reason I gave it a 9/10 was because some of the revelations (and aspects that it might be just me who failed to understand from the start)were a kind of disappointing. But it shouldn't keep you from enjoying the whole thing. I would specially recommend this film if you have a thing for relationships between broken adults and the kids that fix them.",The Fall
150,nicovdk-54575,Inspiring and mesmerizing,8,3 October 2019,"This is a colorful and original film in the fantasy genre that uses your imagination to take you to grand places and different times beyond your reach.With the storytelling scenes the film show wonderful extravagant and colorful scenery, it tries to make the scene as big as possible and make this imaginative world larger than life. Thus dragging us into the beautiful tales and making us stare in wonder and glee. The characters are just as colorful and diverse making the tale even bigger for us. The scenes following the young girl is intimate and close creating beautiful innocence in contrast with the adults despair.All this combines to show an absolute beautiful picture about storytelling with all its highs and lows and with its imperfections but also its power on individuals.This film was a wonder to look at and exiting to follow. There was some great acting from the lead actors, especially from the young little lead actress.Recommend this film for anyone who wants to see beautiful film making and a heartfelt story not bound by time and generational differences.",The Fall
151,lilgra1,Cute Fantasy Film,7,7 June 2008,"The Fall is a simple story about an imaginary tale being told by an suicidal stunt actor to a 5 year old girl. The visuals are very creative and very colorful,very much like how a young child would imagine a fairy tale. The story however was not very creative, very simple and sometimes boring as it has no twist or suspense or comic relief. I agree with some of the reviews that the story is not very engaging or emotional. The story does not really come together at the end with a big epiphany or great conclusion. The best thing about the film is the little girl, she is so cute. She made everyone in the audience smile! The Fall is not a great film, it doesn't have the core of a good story but it is a very good film to watch. Something different, visually creative and colorful, with a sweet funny little girl.",The Fall

153,PhoebeDay,The Fall - A heartfelt movie for those who give it time.,7,19 August 2016,"The Fall was a well put together movie with great acting that tied it all together. It flips between reality and a story – promising an interesting watch for those who can follow the plot. Following the story of Roy, a man in his mid-30s who suffered a broken back in a fall and a little girl, Alexandria who suffered a broken arm in a fall as well. They both find solace in each other (for different reasons) and Roy transports Alexandria into a fantasy world full of characters he created through story-telling. Catinca Untaru, who played Alexandria, provides a stellar performance - especially for somebody her age. Her portrayal of the character allows the audience to feel the emotion blanketing the movie. If you're looking for a light-hearted movie this isn't the one to watch. It's full of real, raw emotion and tear-jerking scenes. The characters are really what ties the whole movie together. Roy and Alexandria's relationship really provides that platform in allowing the audience to connect and relate to the movie. All in all, it was a heart-felt movie that provides emotional realness, but hints of fantasy thrown into the mix. I would really recommend it.",The Fall

I can see, though, why they couldn't, because it's a difficult movie to describe: some of the whimsy of Princess Bride, some of the tragic depth of Pan's Labyrinth, and a visual and storytelling sensibility unlike any film I've ever seen. It's about lies and fiction, which are in some ways the same thing -- the ways they seduce us, the ways they empower us, the ways they betray us. And yet it's absolutely accessible, completely entrancing; I actually found myself literally biting my knuckle at the climax.You don't know me and have no reason to take my word for anything, but I guarantee that you won't be sorry you saw The Fall.",The Fall
155,ramblersm,"""Expressionism , creativity , art of story-telling wrapped up with the qualities of a child's sheer innocence and the flare of a suicidal heart-broke...""",8,29 June 2011,"First of all, let me tell you: the line written above is just not enough for praising a film like this. If you are into art-films , then you can't just avoid this one(and i wish you won't).This is not a movie which is like many others which inter-twin complexity with passion...nor is it like those movies which portrays daily happenings in a different way....this movie succeeds because it has a story to tell that we don't come across generally...and yet succeeds in binding you till you see the end.I have always been supportive of and recommend my friends those movies which has a plot to watch out for.And after watching this movie I realized that how simple the director Tarsem Singh made it look like , and managed to uphold such a strong plot! It is true that imagination can heal your sufferings , with the susceptibility it possesses. And this is the basic idea of the plot. Our protagonists,Alexandria (Catinca Untaru) , a five-yr old girl who is admitted to a hospital following some mishap is a daydreamer who finds companionship in Roy(Lee Pace) , a movie-star who is in the same hospital, bedridden and possibly paralyzed after a jump he took in his first film.He tells her a tale of five heroes who all have a common enemy , Governor Odious , and vow to avenge him together. Owing to her vivid imagination , Alexandria starts visualizing the tale and takes deep interest , which Roy cashes to gain his own motives of attempting a suicide , even as the story of the characters start resembling Roy's life and the lives of people around him more and more , thus resulting into the thin line of fact and fiction dissolve and become blurred in due course of the movie , with an interesting ending.Not much of the performances to look out for, except that Alexandria was played earnestly and with utmost simplicity by Catinca . Actually , the story-telling through lenses is done in such an amazing way by the director, that you feast on the beauty each scene has to offer.Some scenes were pretty appreciable(""Wallace with the Americana exotica"" scene , ""Otta Banga on a bed of arrows -a rendition of Bheeshm Pitamaha from Mahabharata dying"" scene , ""The Stony-faced Priest(sic) dissolving to the landscape"" scene , ""Alexandria regaining senses from the fall ""etc.) , and for this reason, i am watching out for Tarsem Singh's upcoming movie : ""Immortals"" . An encomium!Lastly, the silent movies shown in the end is a symbol of tribute being paid by the makers to the era that started all this whole idea of movie-making and watching them!So i am not promising you a movie full of entertainment, but for the qualities it possesses , this movie surely must not be missed.",The Fall
156,peckham-angela,A climax of a film,9,15 January 2012,"This is a climax of a film. And you can absolutely watch it for the knockout punch of its graphic audacity - this film will bring you to your knees, it's so beautiful. But Tarsem is also a filmmaker's filmmaker, a James Joyce of the big screen, who seems to create films not only for the sake of film criticism but also wildly for the sake of cinematic gluttony. His films are like feasts, they spare nothing; but, like Joyce, Tarsem's extravagance is also mitigated by clear, didactic expertise. This film knows its own references. With lavish certainty, Tarsem gives deference to his predecessors while, politely, blowing them out of the water. Can we recall a richer treatise on the psychology of cinematic narration since Kurasawa? But Tarsem's is also a bent genealogy. We see the traces of ancestors as remote to cinema as they are bravely imported the animation of Escher, the phantasmagoria of Dali, the gravitas of Matta-Clark and yet plainly we submit to the particular hex of Tarsem. The cinematic medium finds new lineage and new expression in his hands. And this film demands that recognition, unapologetically. Here's a director who emboldens the profession with his excesses while he whispers in the ear of his audience watch closely",The Fall

This was the first movie that I was watching in that class so I was kind of excited and I had lots of expectation. When I first watched it I was kind of shocked at the acting skill of the little girl. (Well She was still young so I think I should understand, I hope no one feels offended by this) Also the story was kind of weird at first. The character's first meeting was quite not real and it was too unnatural. Dialogue was unnatural. I want to give 8.5 because it was a great movie with great behind meaning but in the beginning, the movie was a bit confusing. Some meanings and symbols were hard to understand but some were easily understandable. It would've been better of a rating if it had a better actor scouting. However, I liked how the director solves the curiosity that beginning of the movie creates. Also it was cool to see the scene change between reality and the story of Roy.",The Fall
159,Gandhi2,Sumptuously mesmerising,9,1 July 2009,"This film literally washes the world around and about you with the most striking and stunning colours, a depth of field that almost blinds; you cannot help but let your jaw drop.If there is a film to take you places and stretch your mind and visually stun you, The Fall will manage that and leave you slightly numb with how varied and spectacular it is.Tarsem Singh has managed to evoke a sensibility of awe in the viewer that I myself have not felt over a film in quite a long time.From a vibrancy to a subtlety, the tale of the five heroes on their quest to oust General Odious, as envisioned within the imagination of the young leads imagination, tempered all the while with the words of the paraplegic male patient - they take themselves from the drab white and gray of the hospital and explode into the exotic land. As the tale progresses and it becomes more evident why this friendship has been struck - he seeks a release from that which ails him, whilst she yearns for the fulfilling life she sees in others around her - the climax and turnaround literally surprises in a clever yet satisfying way.If you are unsure of whether this film is for you - clear your doubts! This film is a pleasure from intro to end credits!!!",The Fall
160,blinky1986,A visually stunning movie - one of a kind.,9,7 January 2010,"You know when a movie finishes and the final credits roll, and you sit there in a semi-stunned state trying to absorb and make sense of everything you just saw? That's the feeling I was left with after this film. The Fall was reputedly shot in 26 locations in 18 countries over the course of 4 years, it's a true movie-making epic and might be worth seeing for that reason alone.The movie is based around stuntman Roy Walker who is paralysed and bed ridden in hospital after his first movie stunt goes wrong, he manages to befriend a young child called Alexandria and seizes the opportunity to use her to get him the drugs he needs to kill himself. Now that concept may be able to make for a film in itself, but in this case there is more and a fantasy aspect is intertwined. Whilst he gains her trust and friendship he tells her of a mythical tale of 5 bandits; the explosives expert, the runaway slave, The Indian, Charles Darwin and The Masked Bandit. They have each sworn to be the man who kills the evil Governor Odious. The fantasy element serves as an insight into Roy himself, and as the story progresses the lines between reality and fiction blur, with characters from Roys real life entering the tale. However even though Roy tells the story, he is not in complete control of it. It seems we are seeing this story through the eyes of Alexandria. For example at the start the Indian is a Native American, but his appearance quickly switches to that of an Indian donning a turban and robe (who we later see is identical to a worker in Alexandrias fruit picking orchard), since that is the only image of an Indian Alexdandria can comprehend.A lot has to be said about the visual aspect of the film. The opening scene involves a horse being dragged out of a river to Beethoven's Symphony No 7, it's beautiful and surreal but because we have no comprehension of what the scene actually means, it's only after watching the movie you will understand and be able to appreciate it fully. That is half the enjoyment of the film, aesthetically it stands out as one of the greatest I've seen. The five main characters are each brightly coloured and uniquely costumed, and as they tour the world in search of General Odious you will find yourself trying to guess where these parts where actually shot, the sprawling deserts and butterfly island feel as if they can't be real places. But they must be, since the film also insists that absolutely no CGI was used during it's making, which makes scenes such as the death of a man by a 100 or so arrows all the more impressive.After watching the movie you might be tempted to look up Catinca Untaru, the little girl who seems as much in awe of the fantasy tale as we are, and be very surprised to learn this is her only movie role to date. How did Tarsem get such a performance out of her? I'm almost certain the little girl was half convinced the story was real herself. There is one scene where she tries to bring Roy Walker back from the brink of death that is very touching.I can't really summarise The Fall as being about anything specific. Roys story is about accepting past defeats and moving on with life, but I think maybe the whole thing is just a celebration of movie making.8/10",The Fall

We were very excited because the movie started out with such promise. Since this is a story that is made up as the teller tells the tale, which had its cute moments, and the outfits of the five journeymen were very interesting and the locations - I guess it was shot in 18 places around the globe were very exotic and lets not forget the amazing Miss Alexandria the film did nothing for me.

163,berno-08610,Let the Images Do the Talking,8,11 May 2017,"Tarsem Singh is the kind of film director most moviegoers label as off-putting because of his emphasis of image before plot. I would agree with this argument, and I would back it up completely with the haste of an objective, logical movie critic. But, that's not my style. I go with how the movie makes a logical or illogical impact, and if the ""how"" is fascinating, then I am fascinated.The Fall is an original film because it does what most filmmakers yearn to do: it creates images and visionary landscapes only our imaginations can produce. A year ago, I mentioned the same traits seen in Pan's Labyrinth. This time, Tarsem's vision overtakes the plot, and as risky as that may be, its pictorial energy wins you over.Around the 1920s, we find ourselves in a hospital in the desert outskirts of Los Angeles. An injured movie stuntman, Roy (Pace), is visited by Alexandria (Untaru), who has a broken arm and an eager imagination. To keep each other company, Roy tells a story about five mythical heroes who have one thing in common: they all want to seek revenge upon Odious, the evil dictator who took a particular piece of freedom away from each man. Roy is the storyteller, Alexandria is the story visionary, and we see everything she sees. Eventually, Roy's fictional story parallels with his real life, and Alexandria interprets both.We have two worlds working here: one between two unlikely friends and the other created by the co-existent imaginations of the two. As the little girl, Untaru's performance, is unfeigned, natural, and endearing.This is certainly the movie to leave you speechless.",The Fall
164,snowmalamute,Visually stunning,8,27 June 2008,"I watched it at the Edinburgh International Film Festival, the UK premiere. It was wonderfully shot, the interaction between Lee Pace and the little girl is amazing. I don't think the little girl is acting, I think it is her as a real person just being a kid. Although the imaginative story is an epic in its own right, the intervals of light comedy moments are equally good.Once again I think I set my expectation too high, I wasn't disappointed with the movie, but I just don't feel I am fulfilled.The character of British naturalist is the most comical one, with all the colourful characters I find myself enjoying this film very much. The only thing I don't understand id why does it take so long to released. The film finished in 2006, but it 2 years to get it out to the British audience. Why?",The Fall
165,Braddigan,"Pretty, self-indulgent, moralistic... excellent!",7,28 November 2008,"Directed and Produced by the mysterious and elusive, ""TARSEM,"" this movie must have been baking in the mind of somebody or some bodies for some time. It is one of the few films that qualifies as epic. The story-line is simple in the way that a hot, diner-served breakfast is simple; plain and familiar and enticing. The film-making is unabashed and boisterous embellishment, turning the simple into the gourmet. It is colorful, multi-ethnic, hodge-podgedly historical, violent and beautiful. That it maintains a semblance of morality and social commentary and subtlety, in addition to being a visionary epic, is quite an accomplishment. In sum it is about good and evil (isn't everything), saints and sinners, and the depth of character and force of will that makes good go on fighting. The ending is interesting, if nothing else. This movie might make you cry.",The Fall

The story of the suicidal stuntman who meets the curious little girl is far beyond anything I have ever seen. He has lost his will and love but in every darkness there is a crack, unusual as it is it turns out to be the girl who unknowing of the consequences gets him morphine. He tells her stories and bonds with her. He builds confidence when he tries to abuse it and she gets hurt he cannot turn his back on her.The colours, acting and filming is breathtaking.

It's almost like you are just sitting there waiting for her to tremble her way through each sentence and hope you understand what she is trying to get at.Secondly, The sinister looking bad guys (who look exactly like The Dark Knight from Monty Pythons Holy Grail) bark like a dog in almost every scene they are in.

The story is a wonderful tale of fantasy and friendship, the actors pulled it off superbly. While there are no real twists in the plot, as the film progresses the viewer is made aware that some things that were seen previously and passed over as usual and insignificant were, in fact, important to understanding the story. In some of these scenes, as realizations came to me, my emotions were at once happy, sad, and angry, and that is testament to stellar writing and directing. See this movie.",The Fall

The case cover's description was intriguing so I brought it home and set it aside. As I was working this morning in the room, I decided to watch something peripherally while doing some general chores. As the film started, I continued to go about my business, watching bits and pieces. As it progressed through the tale being spun by ""ROY"", played by Lee Pace, I was further drawn to the screen, particularly as Catinca Untaru, ""ALEXANDRIA"", drew more of the story from Roy. Without trying to give away the plot or story line, I can truthfully say that the emotional connection between these two performers was spellbinding. The range of emotion developed by Lee Pace in his characterization, and Catinca Untaru's resolute and empathetic demands upon his storytelling had me seated and involved within the first 30 minutes. It lead me to check out IMDb for more information about the film, and to give my review. Phenomenal story line, acting and cinematography. BRAVO! I would be honored to play a role against either of these talents.",The Fall
173,DansLaLuna,Visually Stunning!,9,16 May 2008,"Because ""The Fall"" is out in very limited release, and because it has not had any type of marketing or promotion that I have seen I feel it is my duty to get people out there to see this lovely, but injured, film. This film was apparently first released in 2006, won a few awards and just kind of disappeared. This was not going to be a blockbuster by any means, with a virtually unknown cast and a somewhat skewed genre. It is not a kid's flick by any means. It is a bit fantasy, a bit reality and a bit sci-fi. The story circulates around a young immigrant girl, Alexandria, (Cantinca Untaru) who is in a Los Angeles hospital with a broken arm. She befriends another patient, Roy, (Lee Pace; ""Pushing Daisy's"", ""Soldiers Girl"") who is bedridden after attempting a stunt for a Hollywood western movie that went terribly wrong. There is no actual time given but it appears to be early 1920's. Roy begins to tell Alexandria a twisted tale about 5 heroes and their plot for revenge against the evil Govenor Odious (Daniel Caltagirone) who has wronged each of them in one way or another. The girl is immediately submerged in the strange tale and her imagination begins to lend to it's characters via the residents of the hospital. Now that Roy has the girl drawn in to his story, he will only continue it if she provides him with Morphine from the dispensary. At first she's not sold on the idea but is eventually convinced that it would be best for the sake of the ""epic tale"". The story continues, influenced by the severely depressed Roy's drug usage and various observations on Alexandria's part which changes her opinions of both the people around her in real life, but the outcome of those in the story as well. When Roy put's himself into peril, Alexandria becomes a part of the epic as well, and the lines of the story and reality began to blur. The tale is spiraling to a morbid ending, reflecting Roy's own plot of self-destruction, with Alexandria pleading with him to save himself, in and out of the story.First the Good: The cinematography in this film is beautiful. The contrast in stark landscapes and color is breathtaking. The go between of the very neutral ""reality"" and the bright, colorful and over-the-top ""fantasy"" mix well, and keep the movie going at a good pace. The plethora of locations is like a best-of for National Geographic. The wardrobe was great for each of our five heroes, especially The Indian (Jeetu Verma), Charles Darwin (Leo Bill) and Otta Benga (Marcus Wesley). This is sensory overload in a good way! The Best: The work between Pace & Untaru is magical. You can tell that there was a lot of improvising on his part, to keep the girl focused and yet the finished product is so natural and sweet. This isn't a girl just repeating lines. He kept her in the now, let her wander off a little, as kids do, and brought her back seamlessly. There is not a scene between them that doesn't ring true. Seriously, hats off to Pace! And he's hot, which is like an added bonus! The Notsogood: As much as I loved this movie, I thought the end was just too violent. I understand we are supposed to feel Roy's hatred of himself and his life and wanting to bring everyone down the hole with him. What I didn't understand was why there was a scene that intimated 2 people having sex simply by sounds earlier in the pic, which was fine, but the blatant morbid killing off of people in the end was so over the top. If anything, I would have preferred half blatant sex and half morbid killing, if we needed to see that much of any of it. But that's my POV. Also, using the name of one's production company as a key-word in your movie is a big no-no in my book.Overall, a great flick. I really wish more people would go and enjoy this in the theatre, where it should be seen in and really appreciated.",The Fall

It was so terrible! I can't even say it was amusingly terrible. The best part of the film for me was quite honestly the 'Buster Keaton' clip at the END. The casting was terrible... the costumes were cheap and tacky. The ending was a disaster. I really do not have much else to say just do not watch this film.

176,teknozen,wildly passionate love letter to the magical mystery powers of The (capital C) Cinema,9,19 May 2012,"Only once in every generation of filmmakers, there appears such a wildly passionate love letter to the magical mystery powers of The (capital C) Cinema. Tarsem Singh's insanely idiosyncratic phantasmagoria The Fall makes such justly celebrated films as Day for Night, The Stuntman and most recently, The Artist look pale and languid by comparison. The cinematography in The Fall is as dazzling as any you'll see, and keep in mind there's zero cgi slight of hand. It all happens in the camera on gloriously color-saturated film. If you are a filmmaker yourself, you've got to grimace imagining what that crew endured to maintain something resembling continuity when a single sequence can stretch across three continents from locations in South Africa to Jodhpur, The Blue City of Rajasthan, onward all over India, China and beyond to include Buddha and Allah and Krishna only know whatever other ultra-exotic locales snagged Tarsem's huge and generous heart in a total of twenty countries. It's an extravagantly ambitious feat of seriously hard work by a cast and crew who clearly loved the movie every bit as much as Tarsem, who, by the by, prefers just his first name. Plus, if you know the film business at all, you'll appreciate that Tarsem has got to be a shaman with some serious ju-ju to have successfully persuaded somebody to keep signing the checks to bring this wild, unruly movie across the finish line after he'd already turned his own pockets inside out. Astonishing work, everyone! I know I am far from alone in my gratitude.",The Fall

I soon recognized the style of cinematography, the same director as 'The Cell' - Tarsem Singh, who seemingly funded this movie on his own.Two stories intertwined, the hospital where the bedridden storyteller Roy and the little girl Alexandria meet, and then the fairytale come to life in beautiful detail. The actors were brilliant and the locations were out of this world! The screenplay was so tight and only after the end credits did everything fall into place. Superbly done! The sinister tension near the end was almost unbearable, reminded me of Gillian's 'Tideland'.The interaction between the two leads is fantastic. It is the injured stuntman's story (a way for Roy to entice the girl to help him obtain some pills) but it is from Alexandria's perspective and imagination that we see the fairytale blossom. And what an imagination! Set in 1920s Los Angelus, it was the time for advancement of the moving picture. Alexandria is fascinated by light and photography without even knowing it herself. She had never seen a movie. The inverted image of the horse through the keyhole onto the wall intrigues her deeply. You will hope she eventually escapes the grove and follows this path for a few days after watching this one, so much is the impact.A must see for any decent movie lover!",The Fall

If you go to see this film for the visuals, you'll definitely be amazed, which I was, but the story is just a complete and utter failure. I think I can best describe it as The Princess Bride meets Pan's Labyrinth, however it doesn't work out at all. The fairy tale story just isn't engaging at all, and neither is the ""real world"" storyline that just seems to annoy you when it pops up every so often and takes you out of the beautiful, colorful fairy tale world back into the drab, ""where the hell is this going"" primary plot line. Of course the two intertwine, which is horribly executed in my opinion because you never really get to know the characters, they're just there so that they can fit into extremely clichéd roles for no explicable reason. I'm really struggling to come up with anything good to say about it, other than the locations and shots are amazing, but even that wasn't enough to keep me from considering walking out at several points.",The Fall

I don't recall where The Fall is on that list, but I assure you it is the most beautifully photographed film I've ever seen. The plot is clever, with a curious, creative little girl meeting a young silent film stuntman while both are laid up in hospital, a century ago. He spins a yarn that enthralls the girl (and us), and we see her visualisation of his story. Music is excellent, acting is quite capable. As a period film, the ""real"" scenes in the movie re- envision an early 20th century Los Angeles hospital quite well, and the ""fantasy"" scenes will leave you speechless. But the stars of the film are the photography and locations. It's one of those films that hooks you just from the breathtaking quality of the opening credits.

It's nice to see Romanian actors being appreciated and Catinca Untaru did do a good job, but it was completely unnecessary (and rather illogical given that the action is in the '20s). It only made the girl harder to understand, as she mumbled a lot (I know the accent and I still had difficulty following what she said).Then of course there are all the other things that don't make sense.

I'd like to think that Tarsem has made The Fall a deliberately hollow piece of showboating in order to say something about the art form; but alas i think he was just out to massage his ego after the critical supernova that was The Cell.Unfortunately the visuals do not drive the otherwise substandard Gilliam homage.I implore you to avoid this title.",The Fall

For me, this film was the latter.The Fall incorporates phantasmagoric imagery, ridiculous plot points, and occasionally garbled dialog. Yet all these elements are brilliantly merged to convey a simple story about a suicidal man and an innocent little girl who meet in the hospital where they are patients and occupy their time by improvising a story together. As they tell this story, it transforms them. You might even say it heals them. The Fall is, in its essence, a tribute to the healing power of the imagination.For me, this movie strikes truth as it conveys its thesis. It strikes beauty as it takes us inside two imaginations unbound by geography, time, or physics. That the film failed to strike gold at the box office is deeply saddening.",The Fall

The film is beautifully boring. I was sad to find that out after I waited so long for it. I am sure the audience loved the visuals and understood half of the story and felt almost nothing.

190,giger_fan,A Visual Masterpiece,10,1 June 2008,"Just watched this last night with a Q&A with the director, Tarsem. Every single shot location was real! This film was shot in 28 countries over the course of 4 and a half years! And it paid off! Tarsem began location scouting 23 years ago, while traveling the world for commercial shoots. Seventeen years ago, he began casting across the world for the role of the little girl Alexandria. Once he found her (which took 13 years), he began to weave his amazing tale. This obsession of his to make this film perfect should be a real inspiration for people who want to make it in the business. This movie was 100% self-financed- which is one of the reasons why it took so long. The director filmed all of the shots with the six-year old actress and then the other scenes were scattered throughout the world. He would look for commercial work in those countries and then get all of the actors to fly in from across the world to film their shots. This film is bound to win something. As amazing as everyone keeps saying the visuals are, I truly believe that it has to be experienced on the big screen to truly be appreciated. They are much like moving paintings. By the way, the cinematographer- this is his first time ever doing it! He was previously the camera loader (the guy who puts the film in the reels for the camera bodies). Go see this film.

The cinematography is superb and the (for me unknown) actors are very good. It's sad that the Academy had ignored this movie at least in the categories: (BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY), (BEST ART DIRECTION),(BEST COSTUME), (BEST DIRECTING),...

Our stuntman Roy manages to keep little Alexandria interested in his story by conforming it to her imagination. Everything is not as it seems with Roy, however, and we learn quickly that he has his own reasons for spinning this tale for his pint-sized audience member. Tarsem manages to pull wonderful performances from his two leads. Catinca, especially, is so adorable that one cannot help but fall in love with her.Its engaging and it pays off several steps of the way through. 'The Fall' is a much more visual trip though, as opposed to its much more emotional and darker cousin, 'Pan's Labyrinth'.",The Fall

I would say this is reasonable comparison as both these movies (Baraka being a visual documentary without narrative) are all about style over substance.Tarsem pays little attention to character development and although the film is intriguing at first, the lack of plot build up leads to a loss of interest. One could be forgiven for saying that the world of the story lacks a certain depth as it is secondary to reality.

I enjoy cinematography, which can either be art, often capitalized, or not art. This film is Art. I also like to see the budget captured on film. This did it for me. The editing had a few things I could quibble with, but that is often too subjective, unless there are glaring errors we've all seen before, such as inadvertent inconsistencies from one cut to the next. The script was excellent. And as to the music? The use of Beethoven at opening and close with the movie motifs were just a fabulous homage to the movies from someone who must be a genuine admirer of the craft of film-making and the stories they can tell. The rest fit the scenarios well. Story telling was a theme of the film, switching back and forth from the various tales of the present, the past and the fantasy tale of the bandits. The actors were superb, and even though the adults all had to contend with the dreaded acting with an adorable child issue they carried it off. And the child was adorable and totally believable flitting about the hospital and being the new best friend of some of the characters. Innocence captured on film is not often seen, but there it was. Obviously this took years to make, so the youngster's scenes must have been shot early or she would have visibly matured. It was lavish and large and beautiful to watch and a nice story, well executed, with a travelogue included of every continent.

198,terremotoe,Good movie!!,8,5 September 2016,"After a few months not watching movies, The Fall has been the first one I have watched, and I have to say that it welcomed me back into the movie world in pretty a good way. At the beginning of the movie there are a couple of scenes that have confused me and made me wonder why the producer put them there, but after a while things started making more and more sense and I started understanding the producers choices. The movie is not one that you can understand if you are not really paying attention to the details. It gives you enough information to understand what happened and what is happening in that moment, but it doesn't tell you every single detail on the situations, in fact, it doesn't spoil at all the fun on watching it and it keeps on making you wonder what is going to happen next. The way this movie explains things is a really subtle one sometimes, and the actors did a great job on making it that way. Although some of the situations were not really realistic, the producer made really good choices on how the information and scenes are shown, in fact, I really appreciated the way it switched between the story that the main character was telling and real life. The way the actors performed was not an amazing one all the time, but it was as good as it needed to be to make this a good movie. Probably one of the best acting was the little girl's ( Alexandria ). She knew how to express her self and how to act a second language learner. This surly wasn't the best movies I have ever watched, but I would absolutely recommend it to anyone.",The Fall
199,tired_cornelious,Instantly one of my all time favorites!,10,25 March 2009,"Last year a man known only by the name Tarsem released his visual masterpiece of celluloid known as The Fall. Four years in the making, this imaginative acid trip works as a re- imagining of the Wizard of Oz but plays more like an artist with multiple sets of hands painting on an endless canvas. Claiming to have not used any computer graphics, the images presented in The Fall are so stunning no modern day eyes will believe it. Tarsem was able to produce landscapes and colors that at times appear to be physically impossible to produce on film.The story of The Fall can appear contrived but ultimately ends with satisfaction. With the main plot line taking place during World War I, the main characters are both patients trapped in their injured bodies and in a small California hospital. The main protagonist is Alexandria, a young immigrant with both a broken arm and a natural precociousness that has not been seen in a child since Shirley Temple. The second lead role is Roy Walker, a stuntman for the Hollywood ""flickers"" that had been disabled while on the set of his latest film. Becoming suicidal after his girlfriend had left him for the star of the picture, Roy captivates Alexandria's imagination with a tale of five heroic men who seek revenge against the man that did them all wrong. An ex-slave looking for his old master, an Indian searching for the man that kidnapped his wife, a mustachioed Italian bomb expert scouring the world for the man that had him exiled, a fictitious Charles Darwin and his monkey sidekick that dreams of killing the man that sent him a dead exotic butterfly, and finally a dashing masked bandit wanting retribution against the man that killed his brother. Between Roy's enthralling story telling sessions he convinces Alexandria to break into the pharmacy to bring him morphine, which he hopes to use to facilitate his own death. By following the five fugitives, the viewer is transported on an eye-popping expedition through beautifully exotic locales. In the beginning of their story, the men are trapped on an ocean oasis at least a mile from any shore. In an act off screen, Darwin is able to conjure a large African elephant to aid the masked bandit to land, because he is the only one that cannot swim. By employing underwater, aerial and level shots, Tarsem ably captures a scene of such ocular tranquility it can almost not be considered real, but instead somehow conjured up in the director's mind, mystically projected onto the screen. Generously the movie is filled with these panoramic spectacles. There has never been a film like this, completely dedicating itself to having random outbursts of beauty in every scene, but never so much as to make a disturbance. The critic Roger Ebert said it best in his review: ""You might want to see The Fall for no other reason than because it exists. There will never be another like it.""",The Fall

It is certainly a very well-made movie with beautiful sceneries across the world and intriguing stories. Some of them even make you feel like it's abnormal because it's too imaginative. Half of the movie is made of Alexandra's beautiful imagination, and we can only have a peak to the true sad story behind those beautiful scenes, musics and dreams.

The Fall is a fantastic analysis of the relationship between storyteller and story, between story and audience. Every character in the epic and absurd fable is related in some way to Lee Pace's tragic Roy Walker, and the eventual outcome for so many o the characters is heart-wrenching. I heard one complaint about the fable being too far removed from the hospital scenes. Far from it. The fable says as much, and possibly more, about Roy Walker's mindset that his scenes in reality. For example, the hanging of the Red Bandit is practically a punishment for Alexandria for lying. The use of cliffhangers in particular was used in a hugely impressive manner, saying a lot for how a story can be used to manipulate the audience. Speaking of the audience, Catinca Untaru also puts in a pretty phenomenal performance for a child actor, and in general (the accent is just great). Even the final storytelling scene, which could have come across as very melodramatic, totally worked for me. The way the people and places in the hospital so clearly influence the story (the villains are based deeply around the X-ray costume the doctors have to wear) was also very impressive. I basically can't really fault it. It helps that it seems a lot like a Neil Gaiman Sandman arc in film form, and Sandman is my favorite work of fiction ever.",The Fall

Neither storyline was good enough to be a movie on it's own so they decided to combine the two, hoping one would balance out the other. It didn't work.The costumes in the fantasy portion of the movie were so CHEESY and cheap looking! They looked like costumes rejected by the Village People. The cheesiness of the costumes really detracted from any artistic visual merits this movie may have had. Some reviewers have compared this to Pan's Labyrinth, it's NOTHING like Pan's Labyrinth. Although this is another movie I wasn't crazy about, Pan's Labyrinth is a masterpiece compared to this budget renta-costume, weak, good-time-to-take-a-nap movie.

A girl in a hospital is told a story by a grown up patient (an injured stuntman) in the same hospital and she imagines it's real. We see her 'imagination' (presumably).I'm clearly in the minority here but none of the characters in the ""story"" made me feel empathetic, and nor did either of the ""real-life"" patients.Sure, in places it was pretty to look at, but you won't find a more shallow storyline anywhere in cinematic history. The visuals make me give it a 2, but otherwise it would struggle to score even 1.It possibly might keep the kids interested, but if you're an adult watching on your own, forget it. I wouldn't waste your time if I were you. If you want to see a better version of the same story watch The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, (but be prepared for a rather dull opening 25 minutes after which it improves immeasurably).

210,meetingivory,Painfully enchanting.,10,18 July 2011,"I have seen a good deal of movies in my life and never felt a need to write a review but this takes the cake, it must be the best film I ever saw. May be it just rings a (many) bells in me, but it is touching, beautiful, emotional, wise, infinitely brave. It has action, adventure and even sentimental scenes, in amazing balance, always on the edge of going overboard and yet always soaring at the last moment to a peak of unexpected purity. 
It shows a relation out of the norm between an adult and a child and for that alone, these days, it should commended as courageous. The child (Alexandria-Catinca) is tender, annoying, lovely, amusing as only the very best specimen of real children can be, and cinema children very seldom are. The embittered young man that befriends her is the most unlikely, most heartbreakingly magnificent friend such a child could meet. 
Whoever says that this movie has no plot utterly misses the point (and the plot that *is* actually there), which is, the redeeming power of stories, or rather the power of storytelling, even when the story is unfinished and changes in the telling. The way the fantasy adventure changes as the two friends work at it together from vastly different angles is wonderful, often amusing, often touching.
It's a movie that bears viewing again and again and always reveals something new.
There are cute funny scenes that will make you laugh (and cry). There perfectly bloodcurdling parts where the writers most definitely did not pull punches.

I just saw this movie and can hardly wait to see it again. It beckons you to return, perhaps over and over. My only complaint, the too-tied-up ending giving little credit to the intelligence of the audience. Since this takes less than five minutes of the film's duration, it is scant criticism. The title characters draw you immediately into their lush mental fantasy which serves one's purposes and allows the other to be transported. Together they lead the audience on a journey spanning the globe and their disparate mental landscapes.",The Fall

Also the magic of stories and how they are told is more palpable here. The little girl is also much more convincing in her role than the boy in Hugo.Comparisons aside, the captivating natural beauty of the locations where the movie was shot has opened my eyes to the many wonders of the world that are far more arresting that any special effects.

All i can say is spectacular. Excellent visuals and breathtaking scenes and wonderful story-telling lays the foundation for this blessing in disguise kind of movie.I didn't expect much from this movie when i started but in the end, all i could do was a smile and say ""MAGNIFICENT"". The Lead characters to be precise the child Alexandria is who takes the film throughout.Her Innocence and brilliant acting will surely stand as testimony for all the child artist to come. She was near brilliant.Director and cinematographer are the one who have excellent work. But here visuals speak.Keep the movie in mute and still it emotes.

This is a film unlike any other and one that kept me thinking about it for days afterward. Director Tarsem Singh, as expected,delivers every scene as a work of beauty, and peppers the film throughout with visual surprises. But The Fall is about much more than eye candy. High adventure, spectacular vistas, love, betrayal, and two lead actors who develop a relationship that is actually moving in more than a superficial way. Think David Lean as filtered through Jean-Pierre Jeaunet. The Fall is simply Tarsem Singh's love letter to cinema.",The Fall

218,steve619202,Visually intriguing but grows tired and pretentious,4,13 September 2008,"Tarsem and crew deserve a lot of credit for traveling the world to produce a movie with stunning visuals, shot on location in many different countries. The initial premise is a story told by a man to a girl in a hospital (this isn't a spoiler, it comes clear in the first few minutes). This is a clever device and the movie proceeds by jumping back and forth between the girl's imagination of the story and the real setting in the hospital. However, as the ""real"" story in the hospital develops, it starts to seem too self-indulgent, much like something written by a screenwriter for an audience of screenwriters. It didn't resonate with me, but if you are a movie buff or Hollywood insider, it might work for you.",The Fall
219,slavetosamsara,Is it possible for a movie to be TOO artistic?,6,13 September 2008,"Having seen The Fall, yes, I believe so. Before I talk about what was wrong with this movie, I want to make it clear that I really did enjoy it, and with a few changes it could have been a 10 star movie for me. The art direction and cinematography were some of the best I've ever seen, and really overall the visuals and the acting/writing really make this a movie to remember.That being said, it was disappointing that it still managed to fall short. This movie seems to forget that it's telling a story at many parts, and while it starts off easy enough to follow, about half way through I had no idea what was going on and that just continued to grow worse and worse, leaving me with a very unsatisfying conclusion since I had no idea what happened. I recognize that a big part of the movie is blurring the line between the actual story and the one Ray is telling Alexandria, however I never quite understood what was going on in either of them. In a movie like this, generally characters in the made up story would be significant characters in the film's ""real world"", however the only two significant characters were Ray and Alexandria, creating a sense of disconnect between the two that really is never rectified.I think Tarsem was trying to give us a story through the eyes of Alexandria, only showing us things she would know and allowing us to interpret it as we decide. This is a good idea, however it was frustrating having no firm idea as to how Ray was injured in the first place. The story he tells provides no help in that either. Really, all you learn about Ray is from the story he tells, but the problem is that people who have a significant impact on his real life are really only seen in the story and not in the ""real world"", so it's hard to really care about that kind of stuff.Now, I don't mean to sound arrogant, but I'm a pretty bright guy and can usually understand these kinds of weird movies. The Fountain and Eyes Wide Shut come to mind as two I feel like I managed to get a firm handle on after seeing them once, despite their depth and complexity. I didn't get The Fall at all, I really just flat out didn't understand it.If you're thinking about seeing this film for the visual effects, you will not be disappointed. Tarsem honestly puts Guillermo Del Toro to shame in this department and really presents you with one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. All the acting is top notch as well, Untaru is absolutely adorable and Lee Pace gives a fantastic performance as well. The dialogue is well written and it's a technically flawless film. If you were a fan of The Cell or any Guillermo Del Toro movies, I strongly recommend this one, but overall I really think it sacrificed basic plot for artistic value.",The Fall
220,aesthetic_factor,Expected more from a 8.0 no Princess Bride.,5,2 May 2009,"I have never seen a trailer or heard anyone of my friends comment about this movie. Considering that it was a 2006 film with a appeal similar to ""Princess Bride"" I decided to watch it with enthusiasm. The visuals were an 8.0 plus the cute little girls performance, but that's about it for me. The characters of this story lacked personality. You could not really get a feel for their individual motives creating their quest better yet, enjoy their screen presence . Although it has the same theme about an elder telling a child a story about love,adventure, and fantasy, If your expecting it to out do ""Princess Bride"" or be just as good you may be disappointed.",The Fall
221,Petter_Bergmar,Beautiful,9,10 November 2008,"Tarsem Singh's first feature ""The Cell"" always leaves me wanting to see more of the dark, beautiful fantasy world and less of the boring and flat back story. And less Jennifer Lopez. ""The Fall"" left me applauding. (Which was kind of awkward since I was home alone)The story is very warm yet very dark. Two parallel stories of fantasy and reality interact and lift each other. The clever writing spans from the naive and playful to the grim and serious.I was extremely impressed with child actor Catinca Untaru playing Alexandria. I'm guessing she was about seven years old when the film was shot and her performance was amazingly natural and believable. The dialog between her and Lee Pace, playing the stuntman, felt almost disturbingly real at times.The fantasy sequences are true works of art. They were shot in 18 countries around the world and the fantastic locations were puzzled together to build a fascinating fantasy world. The entire film matches the style, mood and perfectionism of my favorite minutes of The Cell.Great story, great acting and the visuals are absolutely amazing. See it!",The Fall
222,strange_steve,don't waste your time - I'd skip on this and make it a blockbuster night.,1,11 May 2008,"Id have to say that this was a total waste - the worst movie ever -- no story, no plot, no direction - the ""trailer looked good"" and coherent and being a fan of kinda bizarre movies such as 'the cell', 'mulholland dr', 'memento', 'fight club', and 'jacobs ladder' - 'the fall' sounded interesting especially with all the great reviews here (ie. ""haunting undertone"" etc...).A few people also commented that the film had ""High adventure, spectacular vistas, love, betrayal, and two lead actors who develop a relationship that is actually moving in more than a superficial way."" And I'm thinking other than the vistas - how could this whole movie be any more superficial! Perhaps if i was on LSD i would have had a better time - but was clearly not on par with ""the cell"" - in any way shape or form.Perhaps I was envisioning a more adult/twisted 'neverending story' but NO - this movie really sucked! A reviewer said ""Its been 5 days since i saw this film now, and I'm still thinking about it."" Well yeah it hasn't been more than a day for me and will be a movie i never forget - unfortunately. Picking up trash on the side of the freeway for 2 hours would be a better allocation of my time, and to top it off i had to pay to see this crud.

Its told like a fairy tale told to us by our parents when we were children.The fall is a beautiful story of a little girl. A girl who lives a tough life. She meets a stunt man in a hospital after her hand gets fractured. The man is in pain and wants a cure for his pain and the girl wants hope in her life, so she asks him to tell her a story.

Although the story is a bit thin in my personal opinion the cinematography is fantastic, the attention to detail is unbelievable, the best part of the whole film would have to be the opening sequence as the detail of each frame is completely faultless. Tarsem Singh has managed to create many characters which the audience can believe are real.

I watched it over three evenings, wanting to savour every moment and was so charmed - particularly by the acting and direction. Of course the architecture, psychological scenery, costume and sound are stunning and richly reward the viewer but the immediacy of the story that centres around the friendship between a young girl and a film stuntman, both recuperating in hospital (set in 1920s LA), serves as a basis to explore the complexities of loss and hope/lessness that ranges across fantastical worlds. In so many many ways this film is a banquet - a feast with friends who bring all the realities of their own lives to the occasion, a recognition of those gone before us and a remembrance of the vital need to imagine.

231,nhakimi,A Story about Stories,10,2 June 2008,"""The Fall"" is a story about stories. At its center is the fantasy, a story told by one of the characters to another (somewhat a la Princess Bride, and sometimes to similar effect). The fantasy is set in exotic locations, featuring archetypal characters and gorgeous, lavish visuals. It works on several levels, which multiply as the film progresses. The story Roy tells Alexandria does more than impress visually. It interacts with their world. It responds, often quite humorously, with their needs and their emotions.Do not believe the poor Rotten Tomatoes rating, or the professional reviewers who feel that ""The Fall"" is strong visually but lacking in substance. Such an assessment misses the point entirely. Yeah, this film is visually impressive. Its vivid colors, elaborate costumes, and sweeping landscapes can be likened aesthetically to the work of director Zhang Yimou (Hero), or even to the surrealist paintings of artist Salvador Dali. (And sometimes M.C. Escher.) For me it is reminiscent of Moulin Rouge, if not exactly in its tone, in its exhilarated freedom.Anyway, make no mistake: the images are beautiful. Furthermore the editing style has a refreshing uniqueness. Reviewers seem to enjoy dismissing these achievements as self-indulgence, or utter pretentiousness. This is bunk. Tarsem has more talent than just about any 10 directors put together and there is nothing wrong with his exercising it. Most importantly, the result is truly a pleasure to watch, and isn't that what's important?As a matter of fact, though he is a real visionary with a camera and apparently a genius with narrative structure, Tarsem does not take himself too seriously. For one thing, he lets the impossibly charming young actress playing Alexandria shine. She fumbles with her lines in English, tools around with props, plays with her adult costar, and bares her emotions with a true child's honesty. Furthermore, the exaggerated stereotypes and events within the fantasy world are not ironic. They are silly. And most of all, you can trust that Tarsem believes in this project, and he means every frame of it. Having labored over it for roughly two decades, shot it in about 20 countries, financed and distributed it himself, he certainly has no one's expectations in mind but his own.What really fascinates me is how the fantasy world is imagined through the eyes of the child and the stuntman jointly, and re-imagined through our eyes, and re-shaped in retrospect. That stories have three natures - intended, created, and remembered - is one of this film's pillars. (Others being the child and the vision.) Storytelling as an art is not meant to be static, sterile. In this film the stories that are told, and the concept of storytelling itself, are manipulative; responsive, deliberate, interactive, subjective, and truly, completely creative. I mean that fully. So, no, the film is not one of conventional ""plot structure."" And yes, it is in this respect a somewhat difficult pill to swallow. To be fair, The Fall does have a plot and does has its share of turns. But what happens in its reality world is less important than how that interacts and entangles itself with what happens in the imagined world. There are layers in the invention that come from the reality and affect it and are affected by it. These machinations do not satisfy the traditional script-formula, because its nature is more complex than that, and ultimately it will challenge and satisfy you in a totally different and very satisfying way. Sorry if that sounds lofty or pretentious... its simpler if you see it yourself, and if you let it take you.Bottom Line: very beautiful, very ""meta."" Emotional and visual. Structurally complex. A collage that builds itself. Worth seeing more than once. I certainly intend to.Oh, and try to see this while its still out on the big screen. You will enjoy it more in a communal setting. If you don't have that opportunity, then I assure you, you are supposed to laugh.",The Fall
232,ltsh91,A child's wonderland,10,15 February 2015,"It's the best movie I've seen in month. Roy was a stand-in actor(substitution for famous actor in dangerous situation).He had an accident in a scene that he was supposed to jump from high bridge and land on a horse,he landed into the river instead of the horse and broke his leg.It was his first trying in acting in fact,he wanted to impress the actress in the film,his girlfriend.After the accident,Roy found his girlfriend left him for a famous,rich actor.He was so despair facing the possible limb paralysis and broken heart that he wanted to commit suicide.A foreign 5 years old little girl named Alexandra came to his room one day by accident,the little girl had lost her father in a mob rebellion.When he talked to her,he came up with a plan in mind.He made up a dramatic story that interesting Alex very much,when he was almost reaching the most exciting part in the story,he would stop,and Alex would do anything he told to know what happen next. She helped him get enough morphine without knowing what it is for.She just thought it could help him sleep.But he couldn't complete suicide successfully by many coincident chances.Alex valued Roy very much,he was like a father who could tell her a bedtime story to her.When Roy found himself not dead,he was furious and depress,Alex hoped he could sleep well and get better,so she went to pharmacy to get the morphine voluntarily.But this time she fell down from the shelf and bumped her head.When she woke up,Roy was beside her bed with tearing eyes.She asked him to finish the story,he changed the tragic ending into happy ending because of her existence. I can't tell the story perfectly,because there are too many things in the film which can't be told by words but only can be felt.The scenery is so beautiful and gorgeous.Splendid mixture of different culture gives audience novel experience.The descriptions of emotion with well selected background music is very delicate and heart-warming. What's in a child's mind?Every adult was a child once,but few people can remember how they felt back then.What they might recall is the things they had done,not they had felt.Something that an adult would neglect easily could means a lot to a child.There is a wonderland in their mind.When they get in trouble,there will be a magical hero showing up to rescue them.When they fear of darkness and feel lonely,there will be a beautiful shining fairy singing them a lullaby.Every story will have a happy ending,every princess will get a true love kiss from her prince.But when we grow up,we found out everything is not just like our imagination.Betrayal,injustice,frustration,it's a world of sadness.We fall down over and over until one day we never want to get up and experience all that over again.When that day comes,think of the magical hero in our young dream,think of the song that fairy used to sing.We have protection from our own,a child's innocent heart.It can only be disappointed,but never will it despair.",The Fall

Thought her stay at a hospital, Roy Walker (Pace) tells her a beautiful tale about bandits and them defeting their mutual enemy.

Not only is this film a visual masterpiece, but it also tells its story in a unique way that I have never seen before. The movie also has a soft side and I have to admit that there were several places in the film when I was about to cry. I'm really amazed that this movie hasn't made it big and I just read about it on some random website, but I have to encourage everyone who reads this review to go out and watch this just to show your support for this great work of art.

235,UltimateCow,Simply Stunning and Drastically Underrated,10,18 September 2021,"Upon several watches, The Fall has developed into my favorite movie of all time. This film captures both the excitement and adventure of an action movie and the heavy emotion of drama. The two main characters: a young girl and an injured stuntman, find their paths intertwined and develop an interesting dynamic in a 1920s hospital relating to their traumatic pasts. The movie shifts seamlessly between reality and fantasy, and in very deliberate ways, and the excellent cinematography and aesthetics help with building that wonder and interest. In order to truly appreciate the movie, one must focus on the ""real"" storyline first, and the ""fantasy"" storyline follows. Those looking for an action-adventure movie, which I think the trailer portrays this movie as, may be disappointed. Otherwise, the acting is excellent and the dialogue is both well-executed and natural, the pacing is on the slower side but enjoyable throughout, and ultimately this is a very memorable and creative film.",The Fall

It has one curse word (damn), no sexuality of any kind and the violence is even more mild than what can be seen on any night of the week on network television. The only think that can remotely make it R- rated is the seriousness of the subject of death and suicide, but that should only make it PG-13.

Imagine ""300""'s picture having one of the deepest plots that have ever been made and having the independence that even the most indiest indie film would have times ten. Imagine the stories that you made up and lived in under the blanket of your bed at night when your parents were asleep. Imagine that you still have an imagination of a child and an experience of a grown-up who had been struck by the truth that usually breaks people's dreams and illusions. This is ""The Fall"". Honestly, I have never seen anything like this before. Being all obsessed with movies and watching every single one that seems interesting, I have never ever seen such power and independence in a film. Independent films usually have their common indie feel - a crooky picture that shows protest to all the camera glamour that most of Hollywood films have, lack of dialogues filled with deep thoughtful pauses and this pretentiousness that screams ""this is a masterpiece protest to Hollywood!"". Hell no - ""The Fall"" has nothing of that at all. Having a breathtakingly gorgeous picture, it has smart dialogues and striking truth that is being told by a broken man to a little dreamful girl. This is not a protest - this is just a story one man named Tarsem had courage to tell. I may call it a genius piece of cinematography, a masterpiece and something like that, but loud words like these doesn't fit this experience that you will have to encounter by yourself.

Look here - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0278827/plotsummary , based on the screenplay of the Bulgarian writer Valeri Petrov. So any influence on the script must be traced before 1981, not after. For me, the 1981 film is a favourite classic, and I am waiting impatiently to see ""The Fall"". Given the movie making technologies from 1981 in Bulgaria (communist and behind the Iron Curtain then), the film could hardly be seen beyond the borders of the so called ""socialist world"". Also, there is an important story line of the boy growing without a father and looking for a father figure, which has been replaced in this film by the milder relationship little girl - older man, which I am really curious to compare.",The Fall
242,mperez,Such stuff as dreams are made on,8,17 May 2008,"I just saw it in NYC. And I decided to write a comment about it since it deserves a wider success and a wider distribution. It's a very good movie indeed. Pace, imagery, characters, plot (both in the""real"" story and in the stunt man's tale) are such stuff as dreams are made on. Things may seem to be thin but everything is always deeply evocative. Storytelling and imagery are often touching something of our unconscious. The acting of the little girl it's unbelievable. All her scenes rings so true. I found extremely true and touching when the girl starts to reject the stunt man tale and asks him: ""Why are you killing all of them?""; he answers: ""It's my story"" and she responds: ""It is mine too."". A storyteller can't skip responsibilities towards his audience. I felt often Krishna Levy's music score too heavy. Staging and camera are baroque, but Tarsem manages to keep them light. Here and there I felt that the score was kind of sinking the movie. The final montage is a moving letter of love to the stunts,the freedom and the art of early cinema.",The Fall

I don't understand why this film is not being distributed properly. First of all I loved it. I think it's a real masterpiece especially in term of its visual aspect, original narrative, ingenious and original camera-work and great casting. I found it different and magnificent. It also looks like a rather expensive film for its category, so I'm wondering if anyone knows what's going on with it.

244,E-Gonzalez,Stop wasting your time and watch Baraka,1,26 November 2008,"This movie was a waste of time... If you want a film with beautiful scenery, watch Baraka; that's where they got the 'Monkey Priest' scene and the big 'Well' shot from, just to name a few.The little girl is cute and funny, but the rest of the movie is so creepy, in the end you don't care. It's trying to be really artsy and profound but there is only disappointment waiting behind a odious mask of pretentiousness and ego masturbation. If you remove the 'plot' dialogue and general confusion from this picture, you have... yes, I'll say it again... Baraka. So giving this film just a single star for technique in terms of photography etc., would practically be applauding plagiarism. No f@#king stars, G*ddamn you! I wish I could or would write more about this movie, but I suddenly find myself dumbfounded that I actually took time out of my precious daily joint smoking schedule to comment this copy cat b-movie. Again, watch Baraka if you want beautiful scenery and thoughtful, inspired natural and human symbolism... instead of this almost-piece that forgot the true soul of film making! Sounds familiar....Let the last word be one you've read earlier, epitomizing this movie: Ego-masturbation! 0/10",The Fall
245,mandobekah,The Fall was one of the most intriguing works of art I have seen in years.,10,9 March 2009,"I'm sure that if you have come upon this review you have already read the summery from at least 3 other places on this site. Because of this, I will save you the time of summarizing the movie, and get right to my feelings about it.I feel as though this movie is one that you will not watch for entertainment. It is far too emotional to watch for a ""Saturday Night Fun Activity."" To clear the air, the only reason I rented this movie in the first place was because I am a big fan of Lee Pace. Once the movie started, however, the love of the film became much more than that. And once again, I'm sure you have heard about the breathtaking cinematography. The movie is BEAUTIFUL. Once again, that is not the reason I want to tell you about this movie.The thing that captured me was the insights into one man's view of his own mortality. Catina is one of the best child actors I have ever seen. She can bring more emotion to the screen than MOST adult actresses I have seen. However, she is not the lead character in this movie. Or she is not the one that this movie is about. It is not her life journey that is in question. It is not her mortality that the movie is following. The true point to this movie was the life and issues of Roy, the man who, after loosing his girlfriend and the use of his legs, believes that there is nothing to live for.Alexandria is a vehicle to see further into the mind of Roy. When the film starts, it is easy to see that Roy does not have the welfare of the girl in mind, but is using her for his own silent agenda. By befriending her, he uses his intricate and intoxicating stories to bribe her into getting medication so that he may end his own life. As the stories he is weaving for her progress, we can see that Roy is beginning to feel for Alexandria more than he believed he would. After we are led to believe that he has taken a handful of morphine, he begins to realize what his death may do to his new young friend. He tells her that he wants her to leave and not come back. He wants to protect her from what she may see, and we protect the people we have grown to love.In the final scenes, we see a broken man. He feels so responsible for the damage done to his little friend. He sees that he has hurt her. He wants to simply stop seeing her. He wants to stop hurting her. He wants to kill himself even more, because he sees the damage that he is creating. When the girl insists that he finish the story, he resists. He tells her to get the story from other people. She insists that he finish it, so while in his own misery, he begins killing off the characters. He tells her that they are all cowards. That they have all lied. As she sobs and begs him to stop, he begins the slow death of the main character, the character who represents him. When he states that there is nothing left for him to live for, Alexandria reminds him that the character still has his daughter. The child is understanding the parallels between Roy and the Bandit, and herself and the daughter. She states that she loves him, and that she doesn't want him to die. Roy states that it his own story, and he can do what he wants, to which Alexandria reminds him, that it has become her story as well. She makes him promise that he will not kill his main character, the bandit, but in doing so, she is making him promise that he will not take his own life.A small girl has made him realize that there are still reasons to live. That no matter how bad the situation is, there are still reasons to live, because you continue to touch the lives of those around you. A small friendship that Roy didn't even intend to create becomes his reason to live.I don't understand all of the people can be so critical of a film that through it's beauty and simplicity teaches the value of life. It teaches that the things than can change who we are come in the most unexpected places. Sure the movie doesn't have the action or fast paced plots of other cinema greats, but that doesn't mean it is any less of a cinematic adventure.I HIGHLY recommend the movie. I have seen few other films that travel to such emotional depths in such beautiful and heart wrenching ways. The film will make you change the way you view movies.",The Fall
246,escarduzio,"A Review of ""The Fall""",9,1 April 2009,"""The Fall"" Directed by Tarsem Singh is a cinematic masterpiece. Throughout the film, he takes you through 18 countries, creating a unique, dream-like setting for Roy's story. From desolate, orange sand deserts to lush, emerald rainforests, Tarsem shows he has a remarkable talent for awing his audiences with fantastic scenery.This film was received lukewarm by most critics. It was said to be a fragmented story that was overly sweet with scenery. I disagree with this assertion. I believe that the story was creatively put together, and that the cinematography helped this film, and never hindered it. The story was also a unique one. It is the story of a man who has lost his faith essentially uses the innocence and naivety of a child to kill himself.",The Fall
247,matrixie,Not what i expected.,9,3 September 2008,"I had never heard of this film until yesterday. I found a piece of artwork dedicated to it and decided to look into it. When i found the trailer i was reminded of a film called The Adventures of Baron Munchausen. I believe if you like this film you would like that but i will warn you that Baron Munchausen will pale in comparison. I couldn't believe the whole way through that mostly all the scenes were as they were shot. The scenery is beautiful; its like seeing artwork come to life, which is what films like this are for. Far from being as abstract as most films would get when being 'artsy' the scenes in the hospital were just as beautiful as the exotic locations in Alexandria's mind. Not just that it looked authentic but it was such an emotional place.Which brings me to the acting. I have never seen a child act so well as Catinca Untaru. I could almost believe that i was watching something real, not something scripted. It was the same with all the other actors. This film was a snippet of life, not a whole story which is why i give it a 9. I was not satisfied with the ending, i wanted to see that Roy was alright and that he visited Alexandra regularly. But i suppose, like Roy did with Alexandra, the writers wanted us to use our imaginations. But thats just me, i like truly happy endings. I hope Roy was wrong about his ending.",The Fall

249,thekingoftaisho,If you liked Cinema Paradiso and the Princess Bride then you will also love this film.,9,25 September 2006,"I saw this movie at the Toronto film festival, the Elgin Theater.First off, it was nice to see a film where the director had complete creative control to execute his vision. This film does not suffer the fate of marketers or no talent Hollywood producers who think they are artist or visionaries.If you liked Cinema Paradiso and the Princess Bride then you will also love this film. Tarsem's lavish imagery and fantastic locations create the atmosphere for an epic adventure, while the acting of Lee Pace, Justine Waddell and especially, Cantinca Untaru provide the drama and laughter.First, Cantinca Untaru as Alexandria is superb. I normally avoid films with children as they are usually cheesy or groan worthy. Cantinca, however, is much like the little boy in Cinema Paradiso, a natural child. When Alexandria says things we believe her, when she does things it is her child like nature we are watching come out. There is nothing stiff or unnatural about this young actress and it is a great credit to Tarsem as a director that he was able to pull this level of acting from a child. While watching the movie, I was amazed at how Tarsem and Cantinca were able to move the audience from laughter to tears and back to laughter so fluidly. Lee Pace puts in an excellent show and does a great job as a suicidal patient in the hospital, but Cantinca is definitely the star of this show.Tarsem has a great eye for location and he exhibits it well in this movie. It truly was shot all over the world. Along with all the great locations are the beautifully colorful costumes of fashion designer Eiko Ishioka. The costumes are larger than life and beautiful in their symbolism.So having said all that, I would highly recommend this movie. This is one of those rare films that actually does have a bit of something for everyone yet keeps its integrity.",The Fall

I'm looking now for the same person's review of Wizard of Oz. If that isn't flagrant Scarecrow abuse I don't know what is. Somebody call the Tin-Man Anti-Defamation League! What a maroon.The Fall is nothing short of a masterpiece, in the strictest sense of the term. Brilliant, inventive, breathtaking in its visual scope and in its simple human story as seen through the eyes of a child.Hey ""child abuse"" guy in Baltimore: If you think ""irony"" is how your smock feels after it's been pressed, the next time the orderlies take you on a movie outing you should probably consider something like ""The Love Guru"".

Moreover, this film could be watched on mute and still make a lasting impression on the viewer through its striking imagery. The Fall is the story of Alexandria, an injured immigrant child wandering the hospital where she is being treated. The viewer is drawn, with Alexandria into a dark and extravagant world through the story of a maimed stuntman who she befriends. The skilled interaction between the finely divided reality and fantasy is reminiscent of David Cronenberg's eXistenZ. I can not recommend this film any more strongly.",The Fall

You watch it, then you forget it. Not so, with The Fall. I saw this film almost a week ago, and I cannot get it out of my head. There are now faces in every rock formation;red dunes when I close my eyes.Of course, everyone raves on about how moving the imagery was/is, and rightly so. What I fail to understand is why everyone is so incredibly disappointed with the story underneath it all. The Fall speaks of such raw human desperation, greed, and pain (seen in Lee Pace's character, Roy) that it was almost unbearable. This coupled with the sweet, loving, innocence of Alexandria makes for, I thought, quite the dynamic pair.The story within the story was equally as intriguing. Each character was so different, so intricate, so lavish...I suppose my conclusion would be to warn viewers that this is not your average mindless Hollywood flick. You may be blinded by the stunning imagery, but pay close attention! The interaction between characters is just as beautiful! The Fall may seem muddled, but it is actually quite simple. So simple, perhaps, that some would mistake it as folly?",The Fall

A story told in such a way as to become a part of your awareness, a gentle reminder of the fantastic, mythical and magical components of what is best in humanity whilst not forgetting what it means to be human.Breathtaking does not even begin to describe the cinematography. The colors, the framing, costumes, lighting, and the backdrops are gorgeous; like something out of a dream. If this was just a visually moving film, that would be enough but there is so much more.Tarsem Singh's direction is possessed. He manages to capture a kaleidoscope of emotion as diverse and generous as the tones and colors that deliver this movable feast for the eyes. His motley casting of relatively unknown actors is inspiring and refreshing.The acting is extraordinary. Both poignant and comical, this journey of heartbreak and revenge, of discovery and friendship is conveyed with joy, witticism, curiosity and a vulnerability that is so rare in life, never mind in movies, it left me humbled. Especially the young Romanian girl, Catinca Untaru, who, not only made her big screen debut in this movie but is the heart and soul of the film in a breakthrough performance that I am sure will garner rave reviews.It is my sincerest hope that you find this movie as emotive, tender and touching as I.",The Fall

Her relationship with Roy (Lee Pace) is touching to behold and more importantly, entirely believable. Of course, as expected with Tarsem Singh as a director the film is visually stunning, featuring Baraka-like eye candy, which in itself deserves rave reviews and as a subsidiary to the story creates something quite spectacular. The use of worldwide locations allowed Tarsem to share some truly beautiful images with the viewers, and teamed with Catinca's acting left the audience as putty in his hands, laughing and crying as he wished.",The Fall

There have been good looking guys in centuries, yet he added colors & bewitchments to the character. There he blinked only to blush to enchant. There he pretended only to beguile further imagination.

258,caughtinpossession,"Not Art-house, But An Excellent Film.",10,20 February 2007,"I have just seen this film in Berlin and I felt it my duty to comment on reading some comments made here about the film.One person wrote: ""To paraphrase, Hudsucker Proxy, ""The Fall"" fails because there are 2 stories,one based in reality and the other fantasy. And they are equally important. One take you away visually without connection to any of the characters or emotions. The reality takes hold to your emotion but it can not hold on for long as the fantasy part resumes. That was the problem for me.""I disagree completely, the fantasy scenes have a very significant connection to the characters and emotions, the inconsistencies in the story told by the crippled stuntman Roy, played by Lee Pace, reflect his unstable mental state and the dark ending portrays his disintegrating sense of morality. The story is told by Roy: we see how his character develops through the plot of the story he tells, for example, in the closing scenes when he is manically depressed,he starts killing off the beloved characters, conveying his extremely pessimistic attitude towards life in general as a result of everything that has happened to him.I found the two stories equally gripping, and was engaged emotionally throughout. I found that every time it switched from fantasy to reality i desperately wanted to know and see more, and vice versa. The acting was superb, from both Lee Pace and also Catinca Untaru. The interaction between them was not, as it usually is with child actors, wooden, but completely believable and natural. I wonder how Tarsem coaxed such a genuine performance from someone so young. I have never seen a movie like this, and I doubt there has every been one made quite like it. The visuals are literally breathtaking, i was not aware such beauty exists and it is criminal that it has not been filmed before. At the same time, this film is actually quite funny, i laughed out loud on a few occasions. I dismiss claims that this is an art-house film; yes, the visuals are stunning but the film has to be recognised as not only a collection of beautiful images but a heart-warming, epic, wonderful film.

Granted, I'm a sucker for films with a ""visual"" style, but this film takes the term to a more realistic style. Everything about this film seems real, even the fantasy element. It's as if the director tapped into the imagination of a child and brought it to the screen. The film shows the relationship of an girl who's injured from working in the orange fields and a stunt man who's lost his will to live because of a broken heart. In order to achieve his suicide, he befriends this girl by telling her the story of 5 bandits to gain her trust in order to have her steal morphine for him. Throughout the story he incorporates a lot of his actual real life problems and includes familiar faces from his surroundings, yet the girl is drawn into his story and learns to love him. Because of this, she saves him from himself and the character in the story. I greatly enjoyed this movie because it draws you into the story as if you were a child yourself. Every time wondering whats going to happen and when tragedy hits it actually hits you in your heart.

Here is why:The movie is a story of the inner life of one man, seen through the eyes of the little girl to whom he is telling this fantastical story. Note the term ""inner life"": the director is showing us, through the imaginative eyes of a child, the anguish that is going on in this man's mind. Taken as such, the simple plot allows us to dwell on 1) the progression of that inner life, and 2) the progression of the relationship between the two lead characters.I heartily agree with those reviewers who have found it recalled to mind days after viewing.

265,mkat_tdc,Excellent Movie 10/10,10,9 June 2008,"To start, we couldn't figure out why it was R-rated either. Perhaps suggestive drug use, but the violence was not overwhelming and well under the PG13 guidelines. The Fall was a 10 star feast for the eyes and should you only expect that, you will likely be impressed at the warmth of the story. It is a fantasy story because (you should be able to tell this from the trailer) Lee Pace is telling a (an obvious) fantasy tale. It revisits a lot of fantastic elements like the ones that kept The Cell interesting. Vivid color, wonderful costumes, but without J-Lo, we arrive at characters you can tell had good chemistry with each other and the director. All of their interaction leaves you to believe they wanted to be in the movie - we're not talking Nic Cage putting out 5 movies at the same time - this is a real film. Anyone going to see this movie should expect a story much like that of Adventures of Baron Munchausen. Perhaps A Little Princess fan might benefit from watching this wonderful film, but a Gilliam fan for sure. Where Gilliam uses grit and dirt to intrigue you, Tarsem commands attention with vivid color and several epically scaled shots. All of the monuments of interest in the film are as intriguing as they could be made. The imagination is evocative and the comedic relief is as heartwarming as can be. I would not compare this to Pan's Labyrinth - I'm suggesting people do because they are both fantasy movies with an appeal to your inner child that both happen to be rated R. No part of this film disappointed me. A must-have on Blu-ray when available, but partaking of it in the theater is highly recommended.

The similarities are great but I'll list the differences: - different movie names: ""The Fall"" vs. ""Jo-ho-ho"" - 1920 Los Angeles vs. 1970-1980 Sofia, Bulgaria - 10years girl vs. 10 years boy. - the girl sends a message to the nurse vs. the boy sends a parachute note. - the Indian is Malaysian in Bulgarian movie - the story in the Bulgarian movie is about ""The Black Pirate"" - the story starts with the Malaysian swimming to the ship - since it is about pirates, most of the scenes are in the sea/ocean in the Bulgarian movie vs. the desert in ""The Fall"" - the girl tests the toes behind a curtain vs. the boy tests them when the guy closes his eyes. - the name of the biologist in the Bulgarian movie is not Darwin and he is looking for a differently named butterfly - the fishes used to enter the fortress are 4-5 ft. long in the Bulgarian movie vs. 18in in ""The Fall"" - they use some other painkiller in the Bulgarian Movie - morphine is not that commonly used in 1970s Bulgaria. - plenty of other similarities. Enjoy the movie",The Fall
270,getouttameweekend,"Fantastical, moving and all so very surprising!",9,26 February 2009,"I really didn't know what to expect with this film. The only review i read was on this very site. I only got a copy of 'The Fall' from one of my friends, he didn't even watch it so i had no info from him. I'm delighted i watched this without knowing what to expect, it added to the film's impact. I had no preconceptions, or bias views to take into it, which proved worthwhile. The film is set in a 1920's Los Angeles hospital. Our two protagonists are complete opposites; a crippled stuntman with a deteriorating mental state(Lee Pace) and a young girl with a flourishing, imaginative mind(Catinca Untaru). Obviously there isn't much to do in a 1920's hospital and so Roy(Lee Pace) begins to tell Alexandria(Catinca) a mystical, fantasy tale of five 'bandits' on a globe-trotting quest. The film contains some of the most amazing visual imagery i have seen. And for that alone i would have rated this movie highly. However, it also has a moving subplot to compliment the fantasy, one of a very adult nature. Its almost like a gritty Tolkien tale. I also must take a moment to praise the acting of the fantastic Catinca Untaru. It was one of the most believable performances i have seen from a child actor since Danny Lloyd played 'Danny Torrance' in 'The Shining'. I'm sure Lee Pace had no problems working with this child actor, Pace also gave an excellent performance. The two were cast perfectly. When the end credits rolled, i found myself feeling empty; but not because the film was poor, the complete opposite. An emptiness brought on by loss, i was missing the film already, it felt like a friend had left. I had laughed and cried throughout the film and was now distraught to have seen it end, and really, isn't that the best compliment you could pay to a movie?",The Fall
271,imogenfolland,Stunning,10,15 March 2009,"I never would have heard of or noticed this film had I not been an enormous fan of Pushing Daisies and therefore Lee Pace  this is lucky, as in discovering this film I have found one of the most strikingly original movies I have ever seen.The Fall is the story of a girl (Untaru) in hospital who visits an injured stuntman (Pace) on another ward. He tells her a story but gradually the story starts to become ""real"". Hard to say much more without giving the plot away, but Tarsem as director ensures a smooth yet also surreal transition between the hospital and the stuntman's story throughout the film. Visually, it is an absolute masterpiece. Filmed in 24 countries, some of the scenery does literally take your breath away, but it is essential to the tale the stuntman spins.All the actors make the film completely realistic. Catinca Untaru, playing the girl at the hospital, is so perfect and childlike that any other child actor would seem faker than fake. Her relationship with Lee Pace's stuntman is believable from start to finish, and they carry the film brilliantly.For me it is a crime that this film did not receive wider advertising and distribution, particularly in the UK, where although I was following reviews at the time, my attention was never drawn to this film. If you liked Pan's Labyrinth I would definitely recommend this  it is not as dark, but equally compellingPan's Labyrinth is the only film remotely similar that I can think of. To conclude, The Fall is enigmatic, stunning and utterly unique, so far that for movie lovers, it should be unmissable. I cannot recommend it too highly!",The Fall
272,nozomimura,Really great movie,7,22 July 2009,"I saw the movie in ESL class in July. I have to say that I enjoyed watching it immensely.To tell the truth it was difficult to understand at first because I sometimes was confused between the mythical story and the actual story. Once I realized that both stories were connected with Roy, a hero's life, It was easy to follow these stories. Specially, I liked the little girl who saved his spirit.This film taught me many things. For example, our life is very hard sometimes, like betrayal, sickness, poverty and so on, but if someone really cares about you, you can save yourself. I recommend that those people who have lost their hope, it may be worth seeing it. I'm sure it will make you feel better.Next, I liked every scene because they were very beautiful and clear pictures. Each scene brought me to many different countries, and it reminded me of the places where I traveled before. Anyway, I enjoyed it and am thankful that this film was made.",The Fall
273,BillyHussa,Amazing...except for the parts that aren't,7,3 June 2008,"Shortly put, this movie is about a little girl, Alexanderia, who's been hospitalized and meets a grown-up patient who tells her wild fantasies using familiar characters to lore her to steal him medication.Cinematically (visually, artistically, aesthetically, etc.) this movie is one of the most pleasing I've seen. It generally revolves around the use of vivid colors filmed on location in a long list of exotic locations (Bali, India...). The directing, acting, and dialog I thought were done exceptionally well. Alexandria could not have been done better. These things were done so well I think the average viewer will forgive the fact that the story line falls short big time.I'm hesitant to use the word 'slow' when describing this movie because that implies there are scenes that should have been cut out or that it's too long, which isn't true at all. I'm going to say that this movie lacked a certain intensity that hooks and captivates and audience (save for a couple short parts). The movie revolves around a fantasy story that comes off flimsy as it is seemingly made up as the storyteller relays it. The result is a storyline that doesn't make you wonder at all where it's going because you know it's no where.I'll end it by saying this: Had the storyline been as good as the rest of the movie, there's not a doubt in my mind that this movie would easily reach IMDb top 50.",The Fall
274,josefceciliano,this was a good movie,8,19 July 2009,"I had to watch this movie as a homework assignment for school. i liked the movie because it was very creative, and it made you use your imagination. Everything was so colorful, the costumes and the scenery were very bright.I thought the actors were amazing and the little girl who played Alexandria was very cute and believable. everything from the actors to the scenery was very well put together. Although at times i found it hard to follow the storyline due to English being my second language i was always able to find my way back to the story. Overall i think this was good movie and very different than any movie i have ever seen. Since this movie is rated R only adults 18 years and older should watch this movie. Children under 18 should not watch this movie. I am not that big of a movie watcher so i cant recall another movie that is similar to this one. people should go see this movie because it opens up your mind and lets your imagination grow.This movie made me feel like a little boy again.",The Fall
275,leosophy,Don't miss it!!!,9,27 July 2009,"If you haven't seen The Fall, you are missing a great movie. It will keep you thinking for days. I saw this movie as my school project, and it's a film unlike any other that I ever seen.The Fall takes place in Los Angeles in the 1920's and follows a young girl, Alexandria recovering from an injury in a hospital. While in the hospital she befriends a stuntman (Roy Walker) who is paralyzed after a grave accident while filming a movie. Their relationship grows as Roy begins to tell her unbelievable stories about love and adventure that keeps her intrigued and coming back for more. All a while Roy has an ulterior motive for keeping Alexandria fascinated by his stories. The color, the framing, costumes, and visual effects are stunning. The actors are extraordinarily good and funny. Alexandria's charm really shines as the movie progresses, which will definitely keep the viewers wanting to see more. The dialogues are remarkable; the movie is heartbreaking, shows how an odd pairing of friends can develop into a life changing experience. Honestly, I have never seen anything like this before. I honestly think that is a great movie for the whole family. There are some scenes with creatures and kind of scary looking things but I believe older kids should be able to watch it. I would highly recommend this movie; it's one of those rare movies that actually keeps you awake and thinking. I cannot wait to see this movie again.",The Fall
276,Kannno,top ten,9,27 July 2009,"The fall The fall is an extremely spectacular movie. I love it! I has a little of everything. It has some action, sadness, happiness and other things. The movie teaches us about different people in the world and in own countries.In the world you can see people who don't want to live, like Roy. He never thought he could have friends who like him. Roy is this type of guy who is frustrated because he doesn't know what he wants to do with his life. He thought everything was over. Alexandra is a girl who shows us life. Her family works on farm or plantation. Then, she has an accident the farm and gets injure. She has to go to the hospital. At the hospital, Alexandra meets a new friend call Roy. They start telling an epic story and about his and her life. This is how everything starts and the emotions star comings. In the epic, they start to do things the way they feel. So, all the time Alexandra wants life and Roy wants death. She is going to teach him how to live. She will express their affection toward one another he never gets it. In conclusion this is how Alexandra and Roy are involved in the movie. He shows the sadness and her the happiness. We always have these kinds of people in the world. Some people want to be alive and other want die. The story is based in this. It is awesome story. I would recommend this movie for the people who love true life. The movie will show a lot of sentimental effects. It's going to teach you something of the real life. Some people didn't like it, but my opinion it is a realistic movie and I love it. This movie reminded me of a lot of things, like when I was playing all the time with my niece and other things but I'd never kill myself. If you really get in the movie you will laugh and cry, too. By the way is a spectacular movie .",The Fall

I liked it very much because it connected the young man who had broken heart and the innocent girl. It is very expensive for me to buy, but I did it.This story had told you about the young man names Roy had broken his leg from movie acting and his heart and wanted to die. The girl's Alexandria had fell from the orange tree and broken her arm. They met together in the hospital. He tries to tell her to bring the morphine medicine for him. He told her the story that he made it himself from the people around him and her. She tried to tell him to change at the end of the story. Because it was too sad to make the person who she loved die. She tried to get the medicine for him, and she fell down again.The actions, the story, the location and the movies stars are very excellent. I like the girl who acted like a real story.

The scene has much violence and blood.When I saw this movie the first time, I don't understand anything, so i have to saw the movie again. This movie was boring, because when Roy is telling the history to Alexandria stopped a lot, in this part i felt boring and confuse.But not all was boring and confuse. I like when Alexandria did funny things. When she touch Roy foot, and when she talk, because when she talk say the works two or three times.

279,aindri-chakraborty,"How does a beautiful film, such as this, escape public attention?",8,22 December 2009,"This film has a much wider audience than his previous endeavor, The Cell-and also his usual cinematic homage to great pieces of art is less subtle and more wittily put, specially in a certain transition in the film. What I like about the film, is that it plays with the narrative, cuts it up, changes the point of view, and yet maintains to lift the storytelling with visually stunning cinematography. In an age, where most films are visualized digitally, this film is unique that it has managed to capture fantasy with locations that are still exotic and out of the world even today. The characters put together seem random at first, but when you start to put the pieces together you realize that each has a connection not only to history but to the story of the film as well. Darwin and his monkey Wallace for example. That Darwin did have an aide called Wallace who helped him with his research work but remained uncredited in history is beautifully put in the film, where the monkey dies trying to retrieve this exotic butterfly for his friend. That Darwin's then ""anti-establishment"" theory of us originating from apes could be the reason why Wallace is a monkey? Maybe, which is why this film succeeds in the fantasy genre but it is not so trivia heavy as say a Star Wars or a LOTR. I could identify the locations in India, since I was born there, and every breathtaking architecture is captured so beautifully it makes you wonder why Indian film makers shy away from using these locations and would rather shoot in a London mall instead. The film is operatic, in terms of styling and movement, the dialogues I thought were a little lame, but overall, it is a bigger achievement than the Cell! The little actress is better than any I have seen on screen! I wish to see more of her in the future. The costumes for Roy's love interest loses it's character after the introduction. Towards the end of the film she looks like someone walking the red carpet in LA.",The Fall

282,michmex1,The Fall,8,16 October 2009,"The Fall This movie shows the creativity and imagination of the human mind, both of young and old. Though this movie is thought to be a drama, there is comedy laced throughout. It displays the innocence of the young, and their simple thoughts that are often forgotten by adults.The movie is based in the early 20th century at a L.A. hospital. A man, Roy, who is an actor, had a accident and is now paralyzed. Unable to deal with his current situation, he decides he wants to commit suicide, but he would need the help of a little girl. This little girl is at the hospital because she broke her arm by falling out of a orange tree. Together they create a fantasy story that has taken them to a different time, in different countries, as the ""Masked Bandit"" and his partners try to kill the evil ""Opius."" The girl, Alexandra, does help Roy, unknowing that he is trying to kill himself, by getting him Morphine, but she never gets him enough to kill him. During one of her attempts to get him Morphine, Alexandra falls off a stool and ends up getting hurt. Roy is upset about Alexandra's injuries, but continues on his path of trying to kill himself. While they continue their fantasy, Roy begins to realize that through all of Alexandra's injuries, she is still a happy child. Roy decides that he, too, needs to be positive and be grateful for what he does have.This movie will take viewers through all of their emotions, from anger to sadness to happiness.

283,mexico04,The Fall,9,16 October 2009,"The FallAn outrageous imagination and sense of colors combine to make this film beautiful. I think the story is too thin for adults, and a little too dark for kids. There is death a violence and terrible sadness, but it's also an interesting movie, rich in ideas and humanity. It reminds us that fiction is real to the one who imagines it. An adult might read with detachment, but kids know the truth. This film takes place in Los Angeles hospital in the 1920s. Alexandria is a curious 5 years old child with broken arm, and she meets a friend named Roy Walker. He was a movie stunt man with legs paralyzed after a fall. He tell Alexandria stories including one about Emperor Alexander, and the second story of six men: Lury, an explosion expert, a Native American Indian, a runaway slave, an East Indian swordsman a masked bandit, and Charles Darwin. They want to kill the oppressive Spanish Governor Odious for all the injustices on each of them. This is an epic story of love and revenge. This film capture each amazing setting, architectural oddities, and every kind of epic landscape, long, long trip through the museum. This film jumps from humor, comedy to documentary to wrenching drama. There's no real sense of suspense in the plot beyond wondering what setting we'll arrive next. When Roy Walker asks Alexandria to steal morphine for him so he can commit suicide, she steals the medicine for him and as a result he continues with the story. I think Alexandria was little confused about the morphine because she doesn't have clear idea of how Roy is going to use the medicine. When she was looking for the medicine last time she has an accident, but she didn't realize the dangerous. She only wants to give the morphine to Roy because he was in depressed. All of the actors in story represent characters in Alexandria's real world. The Magic is an orange picker and the princess is a nurse. The movie also has a double function, capturing both the brilliant vistas of Alexandria's fanny and the duskier, shadowed limits of a hospital. Became it is something close to metaphor, it's a fictions within a fiction about the curative power, and possessive attract of fiction. Who own a tale? The one who tells it? Or the one who is listening? Both became invested in the telling. This film shows how you can play with your imagination, and how it doesn't have limits. It also shows how you can change.

There was a few things that I like and a couple of things that I didn't like for example I liked the different views that they show from  a few different places. I also think the little girl character was funny sometimes. I wont say that this movie is bad..I just think it is for a younger audience. That's why I think this movie didn't catch my attention.

""Alexandra and Roy"", they were really talented, I really loved them. Alexandra had a disability on her arm, but that did not impeded her life, she was always full of joy. Watching this movie I realized that people of all ages do anything for a friend, it doesn't matter what it takes and no matter which obstacles you have to go. Alexandria's house was burned, she was living in the hospital. I liked her because she helped in the hospital translating the patients, but she did it without expecting anything in return, therefore all wanted her. That is a good example to follow. I got connected with Alexandria because children like fantasy stories and they imagine many things always with a happy ending, just like when I was a child. Children are innocent, they do things without harming anyone. In this film I saw awesome locations such as a sea, desert, great mountains, and a palace in the middle of a lake. The movie is entertaining, it makes you laugh and sometimes you feel melancholic, it makes a profound effect on the viewer.

Also this movie is very creative and they wear good costumes. For another thing, I like the scenery where they filmed the movie. I love the little girl's performance. She is so sweet. She really is wonderful actor. I do not like the scenes that have violence or when they killed someone. I disagree also with the way he was telling the story to the little girl, because he was telling the story an installments I also disagree that he was telling the story to the little girl to use her to get his medicine that he needed.

I Alexandra appears to be nice and innocent and acts like a mishievous child. I also like when Roy begins to tell her a story, he started as tale but in fact it was part of his own story. Mostly, because we can compare those stories with the real life. For example, Roy had a tragic accident in a movie scene. But when he knew about his real condition, he felt miserable and feeble. He had started to give up and take a wrong way. He wanted to give to both stories a fast and easy ending. Sometimes, adults act the same way as Roy. We forget to be positive in our life. Instead, Alexandra had her arm broken, she always enjoyed her life facing it as she was. Her act was positive, nice and funny. But the most positive and touching part is when Roy shared the tale and his own story with Alexandra and he was able to vindicate his errors.

I like how the little girl acted. I like her face when she laughs and I can see the little windows in her mouth because she is missing teeth. She looks too sweet. She reminds me my older daughter. She looks like her age. Also when the guy narrated the story to the little girl named Alexandria based in his own life using his imagination with different characters. They both were in the hospital but one was more critical than the other one. Like the guy that was paralyzed from his waist to the bottom. I think that for one person is really sad to know that maybe you are never going to walk again and more when his girlfriend live him because she was a selfish person. That makes him feel more depressed and without illusions. Alexandria didn't look sad. She was more curious about everything around her. When she met Roy she looks like she is scared of him, but when he start to narrated the story, she liked him and she became his friend. Every time he stops to narrating the story she wants to know more. I feel like her I want to know what is going to happen at the end of the story. Another thing that I like is the place and the year that they choose to film the movie. I'm always thinking if the life in the past time was better than now without all the technology that we have. I think that the kids were more healthy before and that they used more their imagination to play games. The scenes that I don't like was when the characters of the story start to die, and more the way that Mystic died. When the mean guys chopped him. Also I didn't like to see the human chandelier and the blood in the blanket. It was too much violence for a kid story. I thought that Roy is going to died when he drink the pills. I didn't like the scene because Alexandria was next to him. She didn't know that he wants to died, but I like the funny faces that she did trying to wake him up.

When you fall and see that everything became dark, look around and you will see a light far away so you have to be strong and follow that light otherwise that light is not going to come to you. Every fall in your life just makes you strong. I liked all the architectural structures that they show; they make you feel like in the movie, most because of the scenes they present. The movie basically makes you wonder how would it be to live in that time. I recommend you this movie because it has everything action, romance, fun, and cultural content. I think it is good for some family members to see it because it doesn't have sexual content, but it shows violence in some parts of the movie so it might be not appropriate for children under 13 years old.

295,prencik,Average movie,3,29 April 2010,"I watched this movie as a part of my English class assignment, and I would have to say that it was an average movie. It is about young stuntman Roy who tells imaginary story to little girl Alexandria, her role is playing Catinca Untaru which performance is outstanding. They meet during their stay in hospital. Core thread of the story shows real live drama. Main character struggles with addiction to prescription drugs and alcohol – this part of the movie I enjoyed. But most part of the movie is that strange story which I have to say has stunning visual effects, but it is too violent to be told to a little girl. It is also completely unrealistic, foolish and way too long. It's probably so crazy because of Roy's addiction problem and mixing reality with his delusions.I think this film has a deeper overall meaning that shows human tragedy, and this fantastic story is supposed to highlight problem with addiction, that's why title ""The Fall"" you can interpret as Roy's fall-accident as a stuntman, Alexandria's fall (also accident) which caused a lot of changes in theirs lives, or Roy's fall as a human.The only thing that I don't understand is; what was the purpose of using the name of great scientist Charles Darwin as a part of that fictional story with other imaginary creatures for me it was bit degrading and insulting. In my opinion using a name of that particular scientist couldn't be a coincident. I would recommend that movie to someone who likes fantasy stories. Overall I love movies that are deep and show real life drama, but this one concentrated more on illusion than real problem, I would like it much more if they show more relationship interactions and problems between main characters.",The Fall
296,mmendoza-705-78533,It could be more attractive,6,15 April 2010,"What I really like from the film was the photography, the ability to recreate those dresses and scenarios. The little actress is fascinated; she has a pretty face and even that gap in her teeth makes her character look angelical. I think it was an interesting proposal but it could be more attractive; in some points the movie is really slow and almost boring. I think The Fall could be watched for kids I don't agree with the rating. It calls my attention how the fantasy gets close to two different people suffering in a hospital and how they live between the reality and the no real life. I may recommend the movie if you enjoy fiction stories",The Fall
297,trompas,Beautiful scenes,6,27 April 2010,"I strongly recommend this movie. The movie is a fast paced fantasy. In this film you can realize that an event can change your dreams and the way you look at yourself in the future. Relationships like those of Roy and Alexandria's is what can make you go away or keeps you back from leaving and growing the way you look at things after a big tragedy. It is different from everybody else, for example: some people will study the problem and find something to make it worth a while to stay and fight for what they believe. Others need a quest or a make-believe world. To keep away the pain and the sadness of what they were able to do, but cannot do it any longer, like Roy did. Alexandria came into Roy's life and showed that life is not only about taking advantage of people, it doesn't matter if we are young or old; there is still feelings that if you are not careful you can hurt them for life. Roy did not realize how important his life was to other people, until Alexandria told him how she felt about it. In this movie, they both realized how important it was to have friends during hard times. Another interesting fact is that this film was shot in 18 different countries.",The Fall
298,danmexsur,My view of the movie The Fall,9,28 April 2010,"I watched the movie on April,6,2010 for first time, before I watched the movie I thought that maybe it was not a good idea of watching it. When I started to watch the movie the first thing to came to my mine was get up and ran out of the room and do something else, but minutes later I started to find the idea of the story that the man was telling to the little girl, and I started to enjoy the drama of the movie, and I decide to watch all the movie.The best aspect of the movie was watching the little girl acting because she was so funny and excellent actress. The best part of the movie in my opinion is when she finally makes her friend find the hope that he needs to stop thinking at suicide, and also the scene on where she thought that he is death that part was very sad, but also was an excellent scene to. One of the weakness aspect of the movie was the beginning because it was very confuse and difficult to guess what the argument was about.Finally, the movie was very good, if I have the opportunity to watch the movie again I will do it. I think this movie is very good to watch with your family and excellent for all those who need hope because the movie showed that when we think in death like the only way out, but it showed us that we can find hope in a place we never though. I recommend this movie for all those who need hope on their lives.",The Fall

It is very pleasant to see a film like this kind funny and sad at the same time. To me that was a good combination because that made me to reflect, and showed me to laugh, learn and think in consequences of our acts all at the same time. The film has impacts scenes in precious places, and great music I mean the best. Some scenes are difficult to explain it, so they are just watch them to feel the essence. In my opinion talking about the actors, the little girl was perfect for this paper. I liked the other actors because they were perfectly connected one each other. To be honest the only scene than I did not like it was the wedding one because they were turn around, and I felt dizzy. I think this movie could be for every one, can do to the kids dream because It is magical and interesting too. I think this story has an amazing education to people who think than they lost every single thing or for any reason they are thinking to put a stop in their life.",The Fall
300,jaivo,The Fall Review,9,26 April 2010,"I really enjoyed watching this movie. Everything about the movie I liked especially the scenes, they were shot in a very epic form. I was also pleased with the acting as well as the overall story line of the movie. The best part of this film was when Alexandrian was tricked into stealing Morphine pills for Roy. I have seen a lot of movies, but this one is very unique because the little girl, Alexandrian, shows her tenderness and feelings for Roy. I don't think this flick had any particular bad aspect, like I said earlier; I enjoyed the entire film form beginning to end. People who take pleasure in fantasy movies will find this film a real joy to watch. Otherwise you'll find this particular film a bore. I would recommend movies like the Matrix, Lord of the Rings Trilogy and King Kong simply because they all share great epic scenes. Like I said before, if imaginary worlds are not your thing, don't watch this movie. People should watch this film because I think it's a movie that can be watched with the entire family. It has action, romance, drama and suspense; all the qualities of a great film.",The Fall
301,fdito,Low Interest point,5,28 April 2010,"Personally, I consider that the movie has an interesting story. Some times it's funny and other times it becomes aggressive making your imagination fly for instance. It's very creative when it transports you to imaginary worlds. Practically we witness two stories at the same time. It's a little cruel at the end, but I think we can judge some of the main characters' behavior. For example, one of them tries to take advantage with lies, and the other friendly and innocent. This movie can be rated pg-13 and not pg for the violent scenes that would be inappropriate for kids under 13 years old.In conclusion, I consider the movie very entertaining because I enjoyed it.",The Fall

I give three stars.Why? well, sometimes I felt bored watching the movie,and when the scenes changes it makes me pay attention to see it. The most important was the scenes how change the green places to wilderness scenes or sometimes we are watching the sea and a minute change to other like a dry place. It is incredible how you can travel for more than one country in two or three hours! In this movie the people can see nice landscapes in deferents couturiers.The worst part is the violence.I do not think this movie is good for a very young audience. It is better for young people, like PG-13 audience.The drama for this movie is OK because it touches your feelings and sometimes maybe you want to cry.For these reasons I gave the movie The Fall three stars.",The Fall

304,eml08,Great movie... amazing visuals!,7,28 July 2010,"I enjoyed this movie very much. The parts that I enjoyed the most were the different scenarios and the beautiful gamma of colors that this movie has. The visual part was amazing. The movie caught my attention from the first minute, until the end. I really liked the way Roy was telling the story to the girl. He caught her into his story and made her feel so excited and made her want to come back every day to continue the story. It is also very interesting how the way Roy was telling the story depended on his feelings. They were both immersed in it.The dialogue and the cast were excellent. Especially the character of Alexandria, it seems like she wasn't acting, it felt so real. She was adorable. I loved the fact that she couldn't understand English well; her different accent and her innocent character make her even more adorable. Also I loved the directing part; it was really different from other movies. I really enjoyed the camera shots a lot; the way they play with the scenes was pretty amazing.However, I think the end of this movie could be done better; that would be the weakest part of the movie. I didn't like too much how Roy ends his story. At the end, he made the girl suffer telling the sadness story ever. I know that it was because he felt really bad, like the worst person ever, but he killed a great story. In somehow, it was like a quick end and the story was running well.This movie has a mix of emotions and is pretty interesting because it is really different than other movies. It is a kind of original and I think the creators are creative. I think that people who love cinematographic films should see this movie because they would enjoy the settings.",The Fall
305,coke86,Do not get in an orange tree,8,28 July 2010,"My first feeling when I saw this movie was different than many others and that is good. I like this movie, because it speaks about two stories at the same time, one real and other fantastic. But probably, other people didn't like the movie, because they prefer other genres of films. The best aspect of the movie is that you have in the same film two stories at the same time, one real and one fantasy. The quality of scenes and actors is very good. Above all the little girl does a great job in the movie; she is the focus of the movie. The director had a good idea for this movie and he has done a good job mixing the two stories. The worst aspect of the movie is in the second part of the film, because suddenly the movie becomes a run. However, the first part of the film gives you many details. Scenes are very good and different, and the costumes are very colorful and special. I think this kind of movie can be seen by everyone who wants to. Maybe kids won't like this film because there is a lot of death and blood. This film has reminded me other films such as ""Alice in Wonderland"" or ""Narnia"". If you like ""The Fall"" you might also like these movies because they have adventures, fantasy and war. Finally if you have the opportunity I recommend you see ""The Fall"".",The Fall
306,isabelita_89,"Interesting story, amazing cinematography.",7,28 July 2010,"This is definitely one of those films that captures you with the introduction being that it is really detailed and well done. If you feel attracted to cinematography, this film is definitely for you because the visual effects are eye drops for your eyes. It is just as the way a simple detail with the use of abstraction can be something so amazing.The performance of each character is really good. With just a simple description and few, but enough information, you get to feel an immediate connection with each of the characters. You feel that there is nothing more to know about any of them.You are getting two stories in the movie, a real one and a fantasy one. You might find the latter one a bit strange as the events are developing because it varies depending on how Roy's feeling throughout the movie. The two stories are good, but in my opinion, the fantasy ends up being what you did not expect it to be. I mean, you expect a better finish. I think he could have given better closure to the film, one that fills you more as a spectator.In the movie you will find several genres: drama, fantasy, adventure, and even a little comedy. This makes you have mixed feelings throughout the movie. I really enjoy this movie; it is very creative and quite original. Although the ending was not the best, I would say it is a movie you should see.",The Fall

Both of them talk to each other in a way the creates very good feeling. I love how they each tell the other their history. The little girl is so adorable. And she talks as if she was an adult. The way that the little girl acts is interesting. Also the man is interesting in the movie. I like how every character was dressed for the movie. It was nice to see how different personalities were friends. The story that he tells the little girl is very entertaining. Every actor for the movie is good. It makes me feel like if I was on the movie. I like all the places where the movie was made. All the places are spectacular. I think that high school students would be the best people to watch this movie. They are more able to specifically understand this movie. I don't think that kids should watch this because they won't be able to understand. I haven't watched a movie like this one before. This movie carefully explains what is it happening in every story.

So we can see the world in a different way. The parallel stories are the most interesting part of the movie. I like the scenes of the movie. I think this is a very good movie. I can't find a weak aspect in it. I think there is no single audience for this movie because it shows us different aspects as I said before so each spectator can rescue something of the movie. I think it has a bit of everything. Maybe it is not a movie for impressionable people because some scenes are a little strong and show people fighting and dying. Consequently, this movie is for people who like to play a game during the movie trying to figure out how it will end; at least that happened to me. If people like drama and good endings, this is a movie for them. They will really enjoy the movie. I think people should go to see this movie because it will really inspire them most of all at the end of the movie and show how people overcome their fears. On the other, hand this is not a safe movie for people with depression especially some people who think about suicide. This movie provokes the most interesting combination of emotions like innocence shared with a principal character and other kinds of strong emotions which each character brings to the movie. This is a very strong movie to see.",The Fall

The loss of a great love and the imagination of a kid make this movie perfect for a family time. Although there are some parts that might be scary for little kids. This is a great story that changes from a tragic accident to a wonderful story told by Roy and the charismatic role of Alexandria makes this movie a perfect one to watch. Based on friendship and determination The Fall covers all aspects of a good movie giving the audience the perfect message at the end. The great scenes and acting of these two characters give a touch of sorrow and comical feelings making the story go according to the place and time.In my opinion, The Fall is a good movie to watch because of the story; it has a lot of mood changes that get you really into it. It made me realize how friendship can be found at any place and how a problem can be solved just by using imagination. I liked all the different settings where the story took place, they really captured my attention and how the story turns out well at the end.

I've read some of the reviews and I would only end up repeating whats already been said. So why do I even bother writing? Well, I see that many of you are criticising the costumes, seeing them as tacky, cheesy etc. Did it ever occur to you that the costumes was made like this for a reason? Roy tells the story, but as I see it the visualization is done based on Alexandria's imagination: So of course the characters costumes would appear cheesy and ""childish"" .....just as if it was the result of a child's imagination.

316,daniduck1,I just now finished watching it for the umpteenth time and I'm still blown away.,10,11 July 2011,"""The Fall"" is absolutely a one-of-a-kind movie that, in my opinion, should be viewed by pretty much anybody and everybody.Of course, we notice first with our eyes, and the fantastic visuals (and by visuals I don't ONLY mean the handsomeness of our lead role Lee Pace) are there to draw us in. Albeit not immediately, but once the story being told is on its feet, you are taken away to a different world rich with adventure and imagination. It truly is, as previously noted by other gushing reviewers, eye candy. It was, after all, shot in about 20 different locations around the world (including beside a riverbed behind the Taj Mahal), give or take. Filming this movie was simply an adventure of its own. However, it is not only candy for the eye - it is candy for the ears, imagination, emotional spectrum, and any human experience one engages in.Sure, a lot of cynics like to assert their opinion as the storyline seeming cliché and unoriginal, but only if you get down to the basic BASIC story and strip it of all the ingenuity, twists, and imagination that which it has been adorned with for the pleasure of the viewer, then yeah, it's your garden variety fairytale, big whoop. If you are even remotely paying attention, you'd figure out the point of this movie is to see an epic tale through the eyes of an imaginative little girl. That is something truly unique and beautiful. And if you appreciate art, you'll see it, as did I. And even after watching this movie more times than I can count, I still see it, and still enjoy it as much as the first time I watched it.You've probably already come across this particular speculation in other reviews as well, so I'll say it again, and I'll provide some information I've fished up from interview-stalking this movie: Lee Pace (""Roy"") and Catinca Untaru (""Alexandria"") indeed share a beautiful relationship on this film that evolves from the moment they meet, when she walks in his room and grumpily snatches her note right out of his hand. You watch as he captivates her with his storytelling, while you (and not Alexandria, due to her childlike obliviousness) are made aware of Roy's inner turmoil as he suffers from a bad stunt and a consequent relationship's abrupt end, with suicidal intentions. And you, along with Alexandria, are captivated by Roy and his story. Lee plays his double-persona part flawlessly, as does his co-star, little 6-year-old Catinca. FUN FACT: The reason why Tarsem Singh (director) is able to have Catinca act so brilliantly natural in her part is because he and Lee Pace actually made her believe that he was a paraplegic in real life, and many of the little details incorporated into the movie are built around the improvised dialogue between Roy and Alexandria. After the movie was filmed, Lee and director Tarsem told her the truth, and poor Catinca was in complete shock - it was hilarious.And of course, another note worth noting (forgive the pun) - the perfect choice of classical literature for this movie: the 2nd movement of Beethoven's 7th Symphony. Being a classical musician, I support and appreciate that beyond what I would had I not become one.Okay, so with all that being said - go watch the damn movie, and come thank me later.",The Fall
317,madlawzy,A work of art,10,9 September 2011,"I think I am in love with this film. Whenever I go to the cinema, or watch a DVD I hope that I am going to be changed by the experience; by the story, the cinematography, or the acting. I am often disappointed which considering the amount of films I watch is a sad indictment of what is on offer. In the case of The Fall, it touched me for its beauty and it excelled on all levels, something that happens extremely rarely. Firstly the story is a simple one, but beautifully acted; the 'real' plot is sad, touching but funny at times; the 'fantasy' plot is perfectly pitched. Outrageous and eccentric; heroes are gallant and villains are dastardly and intriguing enough for the young Alexandria to be hooked (as I must admit, was I). Untaru's Alexandria is so natural and touchingly complements Pace's Roy. The direction by Tarsem Singh is second to none; his ability to get the best out of such a young actor should be commended. Another thing I loved is the fact whoever wrote this story and bought it to life (I'm assuming this is also Tarsem Singh) remembers what it was like to be a child, and includes errors in perception that only a child could make into the imagined fantasy scenes. From a visual perspective, I cannot remember seeing such a beautiful film before. The cinematography is breathtaking; I wish I could have seen this film on the big screen. What I want most from a film is to be transported into the story and feel what the characters experience. This film is pure escapism; it is utterly captivating and shall live long in my heart and memory.",The Fall

From the very first second to the last drop, you are captivated into events that feed your imagination and all your sensory perceptions.It's embellished, lavish, brilliantly emotional; with cascading layers of the lessons of love laced with all the shades of heartbreak. You draw meaning from it and into it wile it almost takes you into another realm that you will not want to leave.Every character is nurtured with meaning and depth. The style is quite parallel to movies by Wes Anderson. The use of colors, silence, laughter and sadness, all in perfect doses to complete this exquisitely stunning story.",The Fall
320,rnerb,The Fall,10,20 January 2012,"Racheal ErbDr. SheaEnglish 110Paper 3 The FallThe Fall is a (2008) visionary adventure film by director Tarsem Singh. The film was shot in over 20 different countries, and the effort to capture the beautiful scenery of each of the individual countries is evident within the film. The film covers the interaction between a severely injured stunt man, Roy Walker, and a young injured girl, Alexandria, who is also staying at the hospital. The film follows the character's interactions both within the hospital and in a story that Roy is telling Alexandria. As the film progresses, it becomes clear that the director intended Roy to be both the antagonists and protagonists of the story. The lighting around Roy's face changes with his intentions with his interactions with Alexandria. During one heartbreaking scene where Roy is trying to convince Alexandria to steal morphine from the hospital to use in a suicide attempt, the lighting in the entire room goes much darker, except for around Alexandria's eyes. The light from Alexandria's eyes was used to demonstrate the innocence and general trust that she has for Roy's intentions.The film also reflects on how our past knowledge is used in our imaginations. While Roy is telling the fantasy to Alexandria, the costuming for his otherwise partially historical characters creates a futuristic feel to the film. Darwin is the scientist of the group, and acts like an observer to the character's movements, but he wears a red, white, and black furred coat with a bowler hat and black boots. Another character, Otta Benga, a fit former slave has what one would anticipate for traditional garments, but has a hat more recognizable in Hellboy then in a historical image. Certain props within the film also show the mixture of futuristic and historical, such as the space-aged car in front of the Taj Mahal.The setting of The Fall creates an adventure within itself. The heroes of Roy's fantasy must battle their way through a desert to an insane maze, and back to the riches of royalty. As the characters face each new physical area, it becomes quite clear that certain characters are not as readily able to adapt to the new setting as others. Roy's fantasy character responds the same regardless of location, but as Darwin moves to the palace it is clear that he is outside his realm of comfort.An incredible feat of the movie is that it was done entirely without any computer, CGI, support. While watching the film move across the fast land of the desert to the close shots that stare directly into the character's eyes, I realized just difficult the movie was to create without computer support. To think that all the shots in the film had to be created physically, and then captured at the precise moments to visual the true artistic mastery it's a phenomenal success. Due to the amount of time the director committed to the film, there is a certain expectation that the viewer will also dedicate time to the film. Therefore, the story moves rather slowly. Everything from the camera's flow over the individual characters, to the speed that Roy speaks is done in a slow fluid movement that captures the beauty of the scene. This does detract somewhat from the core story of Roy's journey from dark to light. Yet, certain scenes would not have an impact for Roy's character if they were rushed through; in those cases this technique was vital for creating a masterful film.One moment, in the movie, that is very memorable is during one of Roy's earlier fantasy stories. The fantasy army is found trapped within a desert after just escaping the opposing army with no supplies and no map to show them the way home. A messenger sent out to look for water, who carries a single helmet of water, reaches the commander. The commander takes the helmet and slowly pours all the remaining water onto the burning sand, giving hope for any of his men to survive. The negative outcome of those men reflects Roy's loss of hope for his own personal survival and lack of will to live. Roy's story reflects the film's almost desperate plea for hope. As the characters make their way through each fantastical image, there is an undertone of man trying to find a reason to live. With each prop, whether it's a futuristic car or a burning tree, Roy is trying to distract himself from his reality. He is looking for not only a reason to save the characters in his story, but also himself. Alexandria's blind belief that the heroes of Roy's story reflect the little hope Roy has in within him for a better life. Alexandria's challenging childhood, but perseverance for hope in Roy and herself, demonstrate to Roy the hope he could have if he chooses. At the end of the story, when it is only Roy's character and Alexandria left alive, Alexandria cries out in desperation ""why is everyone dying?"". Roy realizes that Alexandria is asking why does he have to die? He finally succumbs to the girl's wishes that he lives, because he realizes that Alexandria loves him. He has to be bigger than his own personal demons, to spare Alexandria from developing her own, through his death.The Fall is a quirky film that shows the darkness found within all people, but also the light and courage to survive that lives within the very young. The subtle changes of lighting give great support to the emotions of the characters. The actions of Roy's fantasy characters and their personal appearance reflect Roy's incapacity to see the light himself. The images are used to not only tell the tale of Roy's fantasy, but also provide insight into the thoughts of Roy as a character himself.",The Fall

323,soundaround,Got Googlied,9,9 June 2008,"Tarsem's new movie, The Fall, is THE Art film every art film student would want to make. Visual puns in a postcard like landscape suddenly spring to life in the most surreal and humorous way. For example, the evil Odious is bleeding his last breath as he floats among the green pads in a Zen pond of lotuses, to which a comical postcard caption could read, ""I don't feel so good"". The humor even has a Pythoneque quality, where the character Darwin, wearing an exotic plumage fur coat, has to die at the hands of the Black Knights because ""it would be the natural order of things"". Nudge-Nudge. Furthermore, the Jetson-like retro red sports car parked at the foot of the Taj Mahal made me think of the quick path to spiritual materialism. Perhaps he has hung out with Terry Gilliam and Douglas Adams at the ""Restaurant at the End of the Universe"", where all good Think-Tankers go for a worthwhile ponder  like how Santa Claus gets cancer, a remark made during director's Q & A.On the surface, Roy's melancholy marks an ordinary loss, a broken leg at work, a girlfriend who has gone to another man, yet just underneath lays a casualty of greater dignity, loss of self identity and spirit. While some film reviewers claim to see a pretentious panorama, others glimpse a world of magic realism. Archetypes become tongue-in-check, subverting the cliché, and allow one to enjoy the suspended animation, right down to the stop-motion sequence, an homage to Brothers Quay. Likewise, the inspiration for the playful sound design may be homage to Jacques Tati. Wink-wink. These surreal indulgences Tarsem captures thrust us into a majestic daydream, revitalizing the sedate viewer from potential storyline ennui. Dazzling portraits of art in motion become our morphine as life and art unfold a parallel universe. At one point we find a dead brother in a large bloodied shroud stretched like a canvas across the landscape. This death scene could counter pose a metaphoric resurrection, masters of film and art. We find throughout The Fall film references to familiar scenery, like the formal garden snapshot in Last Year at Marienbad, the beauty of the harsh desert in Sheltering Sky, or reverent moments from Cinema Paradiso as we watch along with the hospital staff and patients at the marvelous stunts from the silent era of Westerns. On another level, the blank portion of the shroud could be a tabla rasa, a canvas, a postcard, or a movie frame for the next master to fill. It is perhaps for the filmmaker or even for the viewer to fill in. As one meditates at the foot of the wonder, inspiration arises, and then one's own wonder of the wonder is expressed. One that is a vision, capturing a glint of human grace.Through and through, Tarsem transforms a traveler's paradise into a global theatre of the mind and used a unique visual style to channel the darkness and delights of his lead characters in portraying an internal battle between emotional destruction and noble attainment. Food for thought? It's very possible I've gorged myself at that café of pondering. Either way, Tarsem succeeds in his personal Blood of a Poet quest.At the end of the ride, I began to wonder if this is the kind of 21st Century cinematic poetry Cocteau would have made, infused with a darker romance written from the unpublished lines of Rumi. Having accepted the red pill of Wonderland, hopping down the hole, and reciting the mantra of Alexandria's virtue, I experienced a dandy cinematic ""googly"". In such adventures, I prefer this delight of self-indulgence to Hollywood's popcorn. Thanks Tarsem.",The Fall
324,jirzacal,I haven't cried 3 times in a movie until this one,10,24 June 2008,"I saw this movie on Sunday and for the past 3 days now, all I've been doing, as sad as this may sound, is read reviews on this masterpiece. It's such a surreal feeling to have seen a flick so grossly satisfying that I need confirmation that it really is as good as it was and that I didn't inflate the emotions I felt because of what happened on that date. I wondered whether the evening made the movie better or if the movie made the night. As exciting as it is to find the prospect of love, it's even more exciting to find a film whose merits lay solely on the intrinsic value of a movie and not on the monetary scale, which is the street standard judge of a film's success. Tarsem's ""The Fall"" revolves around the friendship and contrasting personae of the hopeless stunt man (Pace) and the adventurous little immigrant girl (Untaru). This motif of contrasts is carried out through the entire film as you will discover beautifully twined transitions from somber gloominess to a flood of colors, dull mumblings resembling terrible acting to captivating stage-like performances, youth and innocence to the harsh realities of cruel life, and, most importantly, the ultimate antithesis: to be or not to be. The range from simple to grand so tightly packaged in this wonderfully served feast of a movie makes even the highest grossing films taste like soil on a sweaty sock.",The Fall
325,tyler-theshore,Disappointing Fall,4,5 December 2012,"After being recommended to watch this on Netflix by a friend; reading a few of the thoughtful reviews on here; and seeing the same praise by reviewers on Netflix, I thought for sure this would be excellent. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case.I don't really know where to begin. On the plus side, this film is visually a masterpiece. It is very beautiful to watch the landscapes vary from deserts to a secluded island, to a magnificent city. On the other hand, it's so disjointed, I was unable to get into the film. I actually endured the entire thing just because I felt given the praise that's the least I could do.The story centers around a little girl, Alexandria, who takes interest in an injured man, Roy Walker. He begins to tell her a tale that is deceiving her to procure morphine. The story includes five mythical men seeking revenge on Governor Odious as he wronged each man in a different way.I'm an adult and love using my far too active imagination, and I'm happy to let it ride and explore where films take me. The thing is, this film just felt slow and boring. I was rarely surprised, and when I was surprised, I felt apathetic though the film was going for a heartbreaking/enlightening perspective.Princess Bride and The Fall have no business being discussed in comparison, so I'm just going to end that right now. The film was so disappointing I created an account to (hopefully) help someone avoid this film. The Fall is a love it or hate it film experience. I gave it 4/10 because the visuals are too beautiful to discredit but in terms of my enjoyment this is legitimately a 1, which is uncommon for me. I hope this finds you well friends. Cheers!",The Fall
326,rabichko,An absolute joy,8,2 November 2015,"(This is a spoiler free review) This movie now features as one of my favourite, and I'm pretty sure anyone would be as moved as I was watching it. 'The Fall' has brought together many elements from innocence to fantasy, conflict and love together and these recurring themes are almost dancing hand in hand throughout the entire movie as it has been meticulously planned out. This movie is truly enchantingly beautiful, Lee Pace and Catinca Untaru do a great job at making fantasy something real and not just a by product of the character's mind...I would recommend this movie to anyone who searches for something different and well out of the norm with shocking twist.",The Fall
327,rajen-ashmarine,The movie that will change you,10,14 January 2013,"I can't remember the last time a kaleidoscope of emotions engulfed me in less than 2 hours. I was laughing, crying, anxious, distraught, harrowed, awed, triumphant and joyous all in the span of that movie. This movie could just as well have been named ""Return of Innocence"" for it was the innocence of the protagonist who played the small girl Alexandria that was the soul of the movie. The glorious visuals were the spellbinding magic that bound the story together. The beautiful music gave it life. The characters gave it meaning.While Alexandria (Catinca Untaru) lulls me into nostalgia, I question my own innocence. I beg anyone and everyone to watch it. You will never forget.",The Fall

I watched it on a plane flight to New York last week with very little idea of what to expect and have not been able to get it out of my head since.I found it both uplifting and poignant, and the visual imagery and acting was excellent and mesmerising. The performances were so natural that it was difficult to believe it was scripted.I specifically made a trip to an internet cafe in Manhattan so I could pre-order myself a copy before the UK release on 26 January.I wanted to watch it again on the flight on the way back too but was just too tired - but I'm sure some of the images have invaded my dreams.A wonderful movie.ac",The Fall
329,arepole,The Fall - Great mix of reality and fantasy,10,18 May 2013,"I found The Fall really easy to watch and understand. Reality and fantasy being completely separate at the start and then being almost melded into one at the end makes for a relate-able movie for teenagers and adults alike. The friendship between Alexandria and Roy, although obviously fake at first, grows into one you almost don't want to end. The story Roy tells is an even and well depicted story of action, adventure and love. The little violent imagery that is shown isn't life changing and is nothing that most teenagers and even some children haven't experienced in movies before. Overall The Fall is definitely a must watch for its well filmed and well-thought-out plot and story line.",The Fall
330,kindredspirit-637-587159,Beautiful cinematography but overall thumbs down,2,14 April 2013,"While I have to say the cinematography is excellent, and clearly they had a huge budget this movie is mostly just eye-candy and has no depth. The film is way too long and drawn out and morphs into a melodrama with a very feeble plot. We saw the high ratings on IMDb and here and figured it would be a good movie - wrong ! We watched it all the way through hoping it would get better - it didn't ! If you like story-telling movies like Big fish and great Labowski this might be your cup-pa tea, but otherwise I'd say just watch the trailer, it pretty much contains everything you'd want to see all conveniently condensed into a few minutes, then with the time you've saved find something that has real acting and a decent plot !",The Fall
331,eruditing,Visually and emotionally beautiful,10,14 June 2013,"I was unsure about this movie at first, mostly because word of mouth made me dread what is now one of my favourite movies of all time.It's hard to actually convey the subtlety and beauty of every level of The Fall and do it justice. The multi-layered storytelling aspect sounded clumsy and potentially confusing. The way the movie was described to me, it sounded as if it had no point. That it was art for the sake of art and looking pretty and deep.The Fall is visually stunning, yes, but somehow even the cinematography takes a back seat to the calibre of acting and the chemistry between the characters, especially Roy and Alexandria. What I love the most about this movie is how restrained it is. Child actors and actresses can vary between being wooden or over the top, but Catinca Untaru is one of the best I have ever seen.Her chemistry with Lee Pace (as Roy) means that the characters are able to perform with more than just words and add layers to this story that make you emotionally invested. It's what I call a negative space performance - Lee and Catinca paint you a beautiful and at times painful picture with what isn't there. They bring out the best in each other, the worst, and through this create the pulse of the entire story.The Fall has really put Lee Pace on the map for me. I enjoyed him in Pushing Daisies but wasn't moved by him like I was here. Roy could easily have been frustrating and over-dramatic but instead the subtlety Pace brings to the role makes his pain seem deeper and somehow relateable - as if in the areas where he is silent, I could hear him the loudest. It's this level of film making that makes it hard to describe to others just how good this movie is and why they should see it. I definitely don't regret taking the time to watch this.",The Fall
332,SamuelNeff,Exquisite storytelling,10,30 June 2013,"When my friend recommended this movie to me, I didn't know what to expect. No preconceived notions--no hype. I came away floored.The Fall is completely gorgeous, with breathtaking locations and shots that all feel bigger than life. (And all of the locations are real, none of them were CGI!) The music, acting, and pacing are all just as refined with intricate focus paid to each. Director Tarsem Singh has my utmost respect for this project.In summary, this movie embodies beautiful imagery, entrancing tales, and hard realities as a man and a girl bond through their telling of an epic story together. A must watch.",The Fall
333,coopersmithers91,If you liked this movieyou kind of watched another movie,5,11 April 2014,"When I first watched this movie, I thought it was remarkable. The cinematography was amazing and the direction was uniqueremember this is when I first watched it. But then I stumbled upon a movie made in 1992 called ""Baraka"" Directed by Ron Fricke. 80% of Ron's Fricke's ""Baraka"" is pretty much the ENTIRE movie ""The Fall"".Don't get me wrong, I like ""The Fall"" but don't consider this movie flawless because it's simply copied from Ron Fricke's underrated film. But Tarsem isn't the first director to copy from another director. To be honest, most films aren't that original anymore and it's kind of sad in a way. But I encourage everyone to watch ""Baraka"" if you liked ""The Fall"".",The Fall

It hooked me up the moment the intro started. This film is ART! It really played with my emotions. Made me feel good, and made me feel sad. Not necessarily in that order. It explores a wonderful theme of friendship, love, mystic, fantasy and the acting is very well done too! The story-telling is amazing cause it evolves and develop very well. I can't really describe it without giving spoilers, but you become really immersed in the story-telling that it really impacts you when the story-line develops. This films also beautifully explored the minds of an adult and a child.Really something you have to watch before you die.",The Fall
335,danigarvire,"A slightly dark, visually stunning Princess Bride. Isn't that awesome?",8,16 September 2016,"This is absolutely a hidden jewel amongst the vast world of blockbusters and superhero-make- money-machines. Alexandria captivates you right from the start giving an unbelievable performance considering she was 6 at the time. This little girl opens a window to the magical world of imagination when she meets Roy (a stuntman who may have gotten crippled) and quoting the flick they are really an ""strange pair"" but thankfully it pays off when the movie changes abruptly its tone from a Princess Bridesque adventure film to a gutsy drama that explores the concepts of death and suicide in an absolute surrealist world. Don't be alarmed, even though it is right on the edge of going full drama it chooses wisely to befriend our protagonists innocence and gives us an according ending. And i won't even start with the cinematography. Just watch it for yourself. Each frame could be hanging in the wall of a museum. Sorry for my bad English i hope i was clear enough (its just a great movie)",The Fall
336,sarabeara86,One of my favorite movies of all time,10,8 October 2010,"I had this movie recommended to me a while ago, and I quickly fell in love with it. I watched it (or a large portion of it) every single day for a month, which is very unusual for me. I normally can't stand watching movies over and over. I read a handful of the ""hated it"" reviews, and I'm surprised. Most of them seemed to focus on the fact that there was ""no plot"" and that it was ""totally unrealistic"". This movie is about a man telling a little girl a story. Children's stories often contain elements of the fantastic, and they often are completely unrealistic. To complain that the movie has Charles Darwin running around with a Russian explosives expert and an African warrior is to miss the point entirely. The man is taking elements from the real world and twisting them so that they will be more interesting to the little girl and us, the viewers. The cinematography is absolutely astounding, the colors lush and the landscapes breathtaking. The little girl's acting is, in my opinion, the best example of child acting I've ever seen. The absurdly insightful child, spouting off clichéd dialogue and basically acting like a small adult, is absent from this film, and thank goodness. The acting is superb. There are moments that other reviewers commented on, saying that the actors were guilty of overacting, but I think that was the intent of the director. I hope this review has been helpful, I can understand if it has not, but I would definitely recommend giving it a shot, especially if you think you can handle losing yourself in a fairy tale for an hour or so.",The Fall

Suddenly I found it online so me and my partners took a couple of hours to watch it and we all agree that this is an amazing piece of work. The script, the acting and the art is so incredible that it makes a perfect movie.I just would like that the music was as perfect as the rest, so it could be a 10. But still...

Tarsem Singh directs, and Lee Pace(of Pushing Daisies fame) stars as Roy Walker, a ""moving picture"" stunt man in the 1920's who is hospitalized after a near-fatal accident on set of his latest film, and heartbroken when his girlfriend leaves him in the process. Bored, depressed, and bedridden, he meets a fellow patient named Alexandria(an amazing, and believable performance by 10-year old Romanian actress Cantica Untaru), a little girl with a broken arm. He decides to pass the time by telling Alexandria a whimsical tale(which he makes up along the way...) of 5 adventurers that band together to take down an evil tyrant who has taken something special away from each of them. Literally shot all over the world in true high-definition, from India, to the South Pacific, Argentina, Chile, Indonesia, Brazil, Cambodia, South Africa, Prague, China, Egypt, Fiji, Nepal, Italy, France, Romania, Turkey, and then Los Angeles, CA, this film is personified by one word: GORGEOUS.Tip: If you own a Blu-Ray player, or better yet, a PS3, than rent or buy this movie on Blu-Ray and watch it in high-definition!

339,itchybitz-1,Wonderful story of two damaged people...,10,21 October 2008,"First of let me just say I loved this movie and plan on watching it again very soon. There is so much symbolism and so many cultural references in this story, I need to take a closer look at it. But at the heart of the film is a very simple story of an injured stunt man and an injured little girl, each of them the victim of a fall. Of course, Roy has fallen emotionally as well as physically suffering from an incurable broken heart he seems hell bent on self destruction and tries to trick Alexandria into procuring Morphine to find this end. But in doing so embarks upon a wild story which we, the audience, see through the eyes of this little girl. She interprets everything into the things she's familiar with in her own little universe. Like, when he mentions an Indian she visualises an Asian Indian like the one who works on the orange grove. At first the hero of the story is seen as her father but soon, the masked bandit, becomes Roy and so Roy becomes her father figure. The one thing that did confuse me a little in this film was the inclusion of the Charles Darwin character and his pet monkey, Wallace, who's idea's he steals and passes off as his own. This is obviously a reference to Alfred Wallace, who wrote about natural selection around the same time as Darwin and that many believe to be the true father of natural selection. Okay, but how does this fit in with Roy, what does it represent? Incidentally, I thought that the death of Wallace was the saddest part of the picture or flicker as Roy may have called it. Another thing I'm wondering about is, did Roy become a drug addict because of his broken heart or was he already one and that's how he lost the girl? Then there's Alexandria's past and the ""angry people"" that destroyed her home in Romania. The vision we see when she falls trying to get Roy more drugs is quite disturbing and it's then that we realise that she is almost as damaged as Roy is. The little actress that played her was amazing. The only thing I knew about this movie before I saw it was that the director filmed all the scenes in the hospital in chronological order. Because of this we watch the child grow slightly, the gap in her teeth change and her English improve.",The Fall

It perfectly juxtaposes the innocence of childhood and their beautiful imagination with the harsh realities of adulthood and the knowledge that comes with it.

343,Cocca-El,An Amazing Film!!!,10,20 January 2011,"Imagine yourself in one of the greatest adventure stories of all time with swashbuckling bandits, enchanting princess' and grandeur landscapes. This is exactly how director Tarsem Singh brings forth his epic masterpiece The Fall. Released in September of 2006 by Sony Pictures, this Fantasy Drama stars not so well known actor Lee Pace and child actor Catinca Untaru. Winner for Best Cinematography by the Austin Film Critics Award, this film has been hailed by critics alike. This film takes you on a grand journey that is not only visually spectacular but is filled with an emotionally engaging plot and has a lot of heart.The Fall takes place in the 1920's when the knowledge of film had begun to expand and cinema took a turn for the better. The lead character Roy (Pace) is a stuntman working on a film where he has to jump from a moving train onto a horse. While performing his stunt, Roy falls and ends up a paraplegic and he is sent to an infirmary where he meets young imaginative Alexandria (Untaru). Alexandria is also a patient at the infirmary for she also took a fall and broke her arm. Either by accident or fate, Alexandria stumbles into Roy's room where they begin to form a friendship neither of them saw coming. At first Roy has alternative motives as to why he is befriending this young girl. Because he is incapable of walking he begins to tell Alexandria a tale of splendour and excitement about 5 warriors who must take down an evil dictator. He tells her this story in order for her to trust him enough to break into the medicine room and steal a bottle of Morphine so that he may commit suicide. As the story progresses and Alexandria's mind begins to form a reality from Roy's stories, they form a closer bond and Roy must rethink everything he has done in his life. While Roy is telling the story, Alexandria interferes and helps shape this thrilling epic to its climactic and very touching conclusion.Not since along the lines of The Wizard of Oz or Princess Bride has a fantasy story been so engaging. I'm not saying that any other fantasy films aren't engaging but it is engaging in a different sense. The plot really plays on the emotions and makes you really feel compassion and affection for the two main characters of Roy and Alexandria. The two playoff each other so perfect, that the acting just seems truly genuine. Just as a side note to the acting of Catinca Untaru, she believed that actor lee Pace was in fact a real paraplegic. The cast and crew dwelled on the matter and decided to let Catinca think he was so that they could really get an astounding performance from her. Also during the hospital scenes where Roy is telling Alexandria the story, the filmmakers settled on the fact to cut a hole in the drape that surrounded the bed. Here, they placed just the lens through the hole to film the scenes so that young Untaru wouldn't be distracted by the lights and film crew and give a realistic performance. Also, because Untaru was growing up as the filming took place Tarsem Singh decided to shoot all of the hospital scenes in chronological order. He came to a decision when Untaru lost her two front teeth while filming and wanted the realistic approach of showing her teeth slowly growing back as if it were in real time.The cinematography in this film is magnificent. From every camera movement to every lighting technique, The Fall is flawless. Filmed in over 18 countries and 26 locations this is a film with an awe-inspiring scale of immenseness. Because the scenery is so gorgeous and riveting with its Indian deserts and European cities, the costumes must be as well. The costume designers don't hold back one bit to make this film visually stunning. Every piece of clothing worn has a very other worldly luscious splendour to it.However, a film as vast and impressive as The Fall failed to reach an audience. Grossing a merely $2,280,348 worldwide, this was a major letdown for Sony Pictures and of course director Tarsem Singh. Singh blames it on the poor marketing of the film which is true, but it also didn't get a wide release and was only shown in select theatres. One major letdown was the fact that we only feel sympathy for the two main characters. When Roy tells Alexandria the story, we want to be emotionally involved with those characters as well but they fall flat and become stock characters in which we could not care less for...except the Monkey (watch and you will see what I mean).In conclusion, The Fall is an extravagant and touching journey filled with stunning cinematography, costumes, scenery and performances by the lead roles. This is a film that comes along once in a lifetime and sticks with you for its wonder and amazement. I will remember this film, for it brings me back to my childhood when my imagination soared higher than any bird. So, I highly recommend The Fall to anyone who still believes in those days when they were a child and still believes that their imagination can take them anywhere. Take the fall and see this film for you will not be disappointed.",The Fall

345,Indiefilmbuff,"Spectacular, Arresting Visuals and Clever Storyline",10,26 April 2008,"I saw this film two weeks before its scheduled release at the Los Angeles Indian Film Festival at the Arclight Cinemas in Hollywood. The film saw a surprise premiere after another in the festival was canceled. The visuals are like nothing I have ever seen before: spectacular, epic, ... words cannot describe this masterpiece of cinematography. Every scene is a work of art. The color palate is so rich, from the bright orange of desert mountains, to the vibrant red of a blood-soaked sheet, to the opulent green of the Indian's attire. The first five minutes of the film were arresting, the haunting soundtrack, the beautiful black and white images, I had goosebumps.The acting seems very candid, very real. The young Romania actress playing the role of Alexandria is adorable, and Lee Pace as always is superb as the hospitalized, paraplegic stuntman. The characters were absorbing, and the story captivating. And where many films were unworthy of the title of ""A Fairy-tale for Adults"" this film truly is. It is about love, death, adventure, responsibility, and growing up.The sheer magnitude of this film is unbelievable, shot in 18 countries, spanning many years (for the director to scout locations and cast appropriate actors) it is a true work of genius and a commitment by all cast and crew. I just hope that the filmmakers get enough out of the commercial end of this movie, to compensate them for the great effort that so obviously went into the making of this film and so that we might possibly get another like it in the future.",The Fall
