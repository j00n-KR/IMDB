0,TheLittleSongbird,"Sorry, I think this is the weakest of the Roger Moore Bond movies",4,8 August 2010,"I have no intention of insulting anybody who likes this film, but I disliked this film. The Bond series may have a couple of bad eggs as well as some golden treasures, and I am sorry to say I consider Octopussy one of the bad eggs.First off, it starts off brilliantly with a great opening sequence, while the locations and cinematography are suitably exotic. Roger Moore is decent as James Bond, apart from some very bizarre moments which I will be describing later, he seems to have toned down a bit, and Steven Berkoff and Louis Jourdan make for a pair of intriguing villains. Oh and Octopussy is sexy.However, plot wise it is probably the most careless in the series. The plot meanders all over the place and lacks focus, complete with some truly bizarre scenes such as Bond in a clown suit(???) and the Tarzan yell in the jungle was for me unintentionally hilarious. The script is also paper-thin save for a few fun one-liners and the direction is disappointingly flat. The film is also too long and is fairly pedestrian, and I admit I have a love/hate relationship with All Time High. Personally I think the one sung by Madonna is the worst Bond song, but this one is for me one of the least melodious or memorable.All in all, pretty disappointing and although a lot will disagree I do consider this the weakest Roger Moore Bond movie. 4/10 Bethany Cox",Octopussy
1,bkoganbing,No Stopping 007,4,15 January 2009,"With his usual sophisticated aplomb Roger Moore saunters right through another way out adventure as 007. A man with a license to kill, James Bond should have given serious consideration to shooting the writers of this film.Granted that Bond films are not to be taken seriously, I found Octopussy to be completely ridiculous. I'm still not quite understanding the connection between some Russian general played by Steven Berkoff stealing a nuclear weapon and plotting to set off an explosion inside a US Air Force Base and the stolen Romanov Faberge eggs that another agent died investigating. But Octopussy has the usual Bond gadgets and Maud Adams in the title role as one beautiful Bond girl. The location cinematography, especially in India where the biggest portion of the film takes place is located is stunning. Then again I've always considered India, a visually stunning country from all the pictures I've seen of it.Octopussy also has Rita Coolidge singing above the titles An All Time High. Why that was not nominated for Best Song of 1983 totally baffles me.Louis Jourdan plays Bond's adversary, a millionaire of mysterious origins from the mysterious east. The final scene with Moore after Jourdan in the final chase borders on the ridiculous.I won't say more, but literally it can be said that on land, water, and midair there was no stopping James Bond in Octopussy.",Octopussy
2,Leofwine_draca,An underrated treat,8,15 November 2011,"Roger Moore's penultimate outing as Bond is, like A VIEW TO A KILL, a surprisingly enjoyable treat. By this stage, Moore's Bond was a long way from the cold, ruthless killer devised by Fleming; he was an outlandish superhero, engaging in all manner of supposedly humorous, superhuman feats and dealing with every situation with his trademark quip-and-twinkle. As such, many fans feel, with good reason, that Moore's later outings are silly, even unwatchable in places. They are silly – but as a piece of '80s comic cinema, I can't help but feel this film works a treat.The plot takes in the usual globetrotting antics as it sees Bond on the trail of a fake Faberge egg. Eventually, such diverse plot elements as an Indian island stronghold populated by a female mastermind, a nuclear bomb on a train and a circus acting as a cover for a Soviet psychopath are woven together, none of them making the least bit of sense. Oddly, though, the silly action scenes work, whether it's a ludicrous rickshaw chase or Bond finding himself pursued by elephant-riding henchmen. The stunts are spectacular, the cheesy gags endlessly dated (although some of them, like the bit with the bed of nails, still raised a chuckle) and the racism casual. I especially enjoyed the lengthy set-piece aboard the train, as a stuntman gets put through his paces (and then some), followed up by the clichéd but amusing against-the-clock ticking time-bomb climax.Moore sleepwalks through his part but the supporting cast is fairly varied. Steven Berkoff is extremely hammy as the Russian villain, Louis Jourdan smarmy as the supposed Indian mastermind. Kristina Wayborn is an arresting but rather wooden love interest, but Maud Adams is good value as the titular character. I particularly enjoyed Kabir Bedi's tough henchman, recalling the good old days of Oddjob and the like. George MacDonald Fraser's screenplay can be fairly witty in places and delivers at least one classic Bond set piece – the bit with the plane right at the end. With John Glen's assured direction and lots of outrageous bits (with the buzzsaw-on-a-string recalling the glory days of MASTER OF THE FLYING GUILLOTINE), this is a big step up from the somewhat dreary FOR YOUR EYES ONLY.",Octopussy
3,SnoopyStyle,The best Roger Moore - James Bond cheese,7,20 February 2014,"009 is killed in East Berlin while undercover as a clown. With his dying breathe, he brings a fake Fabergé egg to the British Ambassador. This leads 007 (Roger Moore) to questionable antiques seller Kamal Khan (Louis Jourdan). Meanwhile war hungry Russian general Orlov (Steven Berkoff) wants to invade the west. He's behind the fake Fabergé egg. Now Bond must uncover how it's all connected with the circus run by Octopussy (Maud Adams) and a first strike against NATO.Roger Moore is having fun with a more campy Bond. I love the exotic Indian location and the sarcastic Vijay Amritraj. I like the jokey exchanges, and I love east Indian/circus motif. As Roger Moore Bond cheese, it doesn't really get much better. Although the Tarzan yell is a bit much.",Octopussy
4,Horst_In_Translation,Bond in the circus - underseen and underrated,6,9 June 2020,"""Octopussy"" is a British movie that runs for over two hours and includes all kinds of languages with the one that is used most frequently being English of course. Here we have another James Bond movie. This one is from 1983, so not that long anymore until it has its 40th anniversary. The director is once again John Glen, who was a prolific editor before he started directing several Bond movies. As for the writers, you can check out the names yourself. There is three of of them plus Fleming of course. One of the three only worked on this Bond movie, but the other two worked on several others as well with one of them even continuing the job to be part of the Craig movies. But the star here is once again Roger Moore. No hesitation in saying so. This was his penultimate turn as Bond and he was in his mid-50s already at that point. I wonder if there will ever be an older Bond. Connery was younger by the way when he returned to the franchise. Fittingly with Moore's age, the Bond girl at the center of it all this time is not a spring chicken either. Well, the one we see initially is, but she just turns into more of an observer when Octopussy enters the picture. There you have the name of the title character. But I personally would say that this film is more named after the circus that is included on many occasions here than really after Maud Adams' character. Debatable though. One thing that is safe, however, is that they went with the tradition of naming the film after one central character. With ""Dr. No"" and ""Goldfinger"" it was clear that these were main antagonists (an honor Blofeld never received), but with Octopussy you can never be too sure if she is good or bad although her father's connection with the entire story makes it easy to guess. And even without her, this film has enough antagonists for sure. Two of them are key you could say and here and there I struggled with deciding whom to consider the main antagonist. Unusual for a Bond film. Most of the time there is just one and his henchmen. And the fact that Orlov is killed before Khan is not necessarily a giveaway because the key henchman frequently survives the villain in Bond movies. However, what can be considered a giveaway is that Orlov does not die through Bond's hands. And that Louis Jourdan (who reached an even older age than Moore) is credited before Berkoff who is still alive in 2020. So even if Orlov is the one who comes up with the plan, I would say that Khan is the main villain. He also has his army and gang around him while Orlov is a lone Soviet cowboy if you want to say so. He does not even have the support of his fellow communists. I must say initially I found him too irrelevant with how he had that introduction scene when his folks say they do not want his nuclear attack and then he is gone for a long time. He shows up again later on and makes up for it, but he is never as memorable as Jourdan. Probably I am biased here because I like the actor. But Jourdan's character's team also brings some nice interesting fellow fighters. The two people with the knives, the one who throws that very sharp round object from above and of course the really big dude with the hat, Gobinda is his name, an Arab poor man's Jaws pretty much. None of these are extraordinarily memorable compared to the most notable henchmen from the Bond franchise, but they are all fun. Also the introduction was good, for example with the knive throwers taking care of another agent and you wonder initially why he is wearing clown make-up. Then you see him fight, then you see where he is heading with his severe injury and quickly afterwards you know who he is. In reference to that scene, I also really liked Moore showing us his more serious Bond for once when he takes care of the second knife thrower and the latter says that he does it for his brother when he is about to kill Bond, but 007 has a comeback, verbally and physically, that is one of my favorite moments from this film, maybe even my number one favorite. It was that good.Other than that, there are several light moments too as always with Roger Moore's take on 007. I liked them. At the end I am not sure with how his leg rises, if this was supposed to show us something else was rising. Definitely possible, he is very much on the cheeky side (even if he makes no (in)appropriate jokes about the last five letters of the female protagonist's name), but maybe I am also thinking too much here. Before that, Moore's interactions with Llewelyn's Q are fun as always with the latter being mad at Bond as always too for destroying his stuff. Q was a bit unusual here, not just in the fishing scene, but he is really indirectly part of the action when he finds the Indian friend and even is in charge of steering a balloon near the end. You could almost say he is an agent this time. Moneypenny also brings some fun when she introduces us to her potential successor and the latter knows all about Bond's mannerisms, but is attracted to him nonetheless. To me personally, it felt interesting that this movie took place partially in East Berlin, very early on and also again at the end. The other crucial location here is India and while Bond keeps running into snakes, tigers, elephants and crocodiles (real ones, on one occasion Bond dresses up as a fake one), he is never really endangered by them. The bigger danger comes from Khan for sure. Bond sure makes him mad, already at the auction with the famous egg (that was fun), but also afterwards when they play Backgammon (finally one I knew and not an obscure card game). Again a little gambling involved here like in so many other Bond films. What else is there to say? Ah yes, the prologue is really action-packed and aviation plays a big role here as we have Bond up on planes at the very beginning and very end this time. Early on, he is saved by Penélope Cruz' 80s equivalent, even if this actress is not known to anybody anymore I believe. The Indian helper I mentioned early on was played by Vijay Amritraj. That one is also still alive today (in contrast to his character) and it was his first of not too many film performances. His introduction with the Bond tune being played on a flute was a lot of fun for sure. What I find especially interesting about him is that he was a professional tennis player before starring in this film and so was his son later on. So you see I am talking a whole lot about many characters, but not too much about Octopussy. I was not that fascinated with her character. She is alright at best. So is her story. But the moment when we have that octopus from her chamber glued to the face of a bad guy was another fairly fun moment, pretty shocking in fact, but somehow also dark comedy how the animal keeps the bad guy from breathing. One of the funniest moments of the film. Another funny moment was the human cannonball stepping outside at the end and what he says after the danger is gone. As for Octopussy, the idea of her gang of females was not one I enjoyed too much, especially when these even manage to take out Khan's folks at the very end. That was clearly exaggerated in terms of realism. Also this is a film for which the Bond song had a totally different name than the movie, which did not happen too often. ""All Time High"" is perhaps the least remembered Bond song these days. It's okay. Nice tune, but not one of my favorites and singer Rita Coolidge deserves to be remembered for it. In the intro music sequence, you already see circus references with the acrobats performing there. No animals. For a circus, there is surprisingly little animal action. Those animals that do show up stem from the Indian wilderness.Finally, this film is from the days of the Cold War. Bond never made anti-Soviet statements and this is true here as well. Orlov is much more of a psychopath than a communist and his leaders do not support him. Still a Soviet general being (close to) the main antagonist is more than they did in other Bond movies. There we mostly had a neutral psychopath trying to trick the global powers. Oh and these Fabergé eggs were surely beautiful. All in all, this was a good watch and one of the better Moore Bond films I think. This movie has a great deal of action (planes, trains, automobiles), but does not sacrifice the key spy story at the center of it all luckily. And there are again entertaining funny moments for sure. You always get them with Moore. Oh and you see Bond dressed up as a clown and also wearing the appropriate make-up. One thing you sure don't get to see too often. Also shows that Moore's take on the role was a bit of a Joker, or anti-Joker as he is about to save the world from chaos. Here and there he relied a bit on the help of the girls (Cruz' equivalent, Octopussy at the very end), but overall, he does a good job and won't be stopped by anybody as usual. Khan should have killed him when he had the chance. Then again, no mercy for him. How can he eat a sheep head, especially the eye?? Yuck! Time to finish. India has not been a location used too frequently in 007 films, but here it gets more than its fair share. Nicely done again. I hope everybody that is not with us anymore and worked on this nice film rests in peace and I thank them for using their talent this time. I sure enjoyed the watch. So should you. Maybe not a great film to start into the 007 universe, but if you like the genre and/or James Bond, then this is a movie you definitely want to see. No hesitation for me in giving ""Octopussy"" a thumbs-up. Go for it. They made good use of some formulas that have proved successful in the past, like for example the Bond girl's connection with the villain(s), but not their loyalty. This time, they do not have to pay for it with their lives though. On a completely different note, there are not really any (East) German actors in here despite the location where it takes place. Unthinkable today, but made sense because of the Iron Curtain back then. Enough now.",Octopussy
5,classicsoncall,"""It's not really in the wrist, you know.""",7,23 December 2018,"I wasn't a Bond fan back in the day, but when the movies came out, I always wondered what the titles were all about. ""Goldfinger"" is an example, but ""Octopussy"" really threw me for a loop. I was never curious enough to find out, but I've taken up watching the films in series order recently so now I'm in the know. Maud Adams portrays the infamously named Octopussy of the title, heading up a band of female jewelry smugglers whose insignia is modeled on the blue ringed octopus. I couldn't resist checking to see if there is such a thing, and now that I know, I think the filmmakers missed a huge opportunity to make more of the creature in the story line. It turns out the blue ringed octopus has venom a thousand times more powerful than cyanide, enough to kill up to twenty six humans in a matter of minutes. What possibilities for a Bond villain to exploit.Well, I don't know. I was paying pretty close attention to the story and I have to admit this one went off in a number of different directions that made things difficult to follow. You have to give Roger Moore some credit for putting up with some of the nonsense Double 007 had to go through here, like the crocodile get-up and the clown suit. The vine swing with a Weissmuller Tarzan tribute was notable for me only because of my fondness for all those jungle flicks back in the day, but really? And I don't know about you, but the stuffed sheep's head might have looked interesting in it's own way, but come on - who would eat anything like that? Like the poached monkey brain in one of those Indiana Jones pictures.So if I've got this right, the lunatic Russian General Orlov (Steven Berkoff) had this plan to have all of Europe unilaterally disarm after a nuclear bomb goes off 'by accident', with no one to blame because it wouldn't have been able to trace back to the Russkies. But the guy is shot by his own soldiers for turning into a common jewelry thief. All of this following a set up that involved the theft of a priceless Faberge egg, recovered by Bond and returned to the Russians, lent back to the Brits, and stolen from Bond by wealthy Indian industrialist Kamal Khan (Louis Jourdan). Adding a little color to the story, the Octopussy Circus becomes ground zero for a deadly atomic bomb explosion unless James Bond can defuse the device just in the nick of time with one second to spare. Sounds like par for the course to me.And by the way, anyone else wondering about the Faberge egg? Anybody care?",Octopussy
6,gavin6942,"A Strange Bond, Though Not Unique in That Respect",7,26 June 2017,"A fake Fabergé egg and a fellow agent's death lead James Bond to uncover an international jewel-smuggling operation, headed by the mysterious Octopussy, being used to disguise a nuclear attack on N.A.T.O. forces.There are many strange hings that happen in Bond films. The villains are often strange, with Jaws being the first obvious example. Here we have murdered clowns, sword-swallowers, a bed of nails... and a guy who has a yo-yo with a saw blade on the end. Not your typical spy versus spy action.There is, unfortunately, no single villain who stands out the way Jaws or Blofeld do. The problem is a rogue Russian general whose name is not very memorable and has nothing really unique about him. A good villain, to be sure, but Bond's other random antics are what really keep us going.",Octopussy
7,jboothmillard,Octopussy,6,12 September 2005,"This was the penultimate film for Roger Moore before he was going to quit the role of favourite action hero James Bond. Basically Bond is assigned both to stop some jewellery smugglers, but more importantly to stop a bomb that threatens many innocent lives at a circus playing at a military base. Through the process Bond meets smuggler and love interest, the mysterious Octopussy (Maud Adams, who appeared in The Man with the Golden Gun) and also pretty mean villain Kamal Khan (Louis Jourdan), along with henchmen Gobinda (Kabir Bedi) and twins David and Tony Meyer. Also starring Kristina Wayborn as Magda, Steven Berkoff as General Orlov, Desmond Llewelyn as Q, Robert Brown as M, Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny, Walter Gotell as General Anatol Gogol and introducing Vijay Amritraj as Vijay. It was number 22 (I like it more than that) on James Bond's Greatest Hits for Rita Coolidge's All Time High (the first Bond song that didn't feature the film title in the lyrics, and Casino Royale does the same). Good!",Octopussy
8,ccthemovieman-1,Bond As Indiana Jones,10,23 March 2006,"Was there ever a James Bond like this one? Oh, there were better Bond stories, no doubt, but I do doubt there were any more entertaining than this one.In ""Octopussy,"" we get more of an Indiana Jones-type adventure story than the usual spy farce. In fact, there is so much adventure in here it gets tiring, to be frank. It's almost too much....but it is a lot of fun along the way.The best part of the film isn't the wild adventure, either: it's the humor. This has more laughs in it - stupid and clever - than any Bond film I can recall.Roger Moore, Maud Adams, Louis Jordan, Kristina Wayborn, Steven Berkoff and Kabir Bedi must have had a lot of fun - and been worn out - making this film. By the way, itt's always interesting to see the intriguing Adams.This and ""Goldfinger"" are my two favorites of the Bond series, and I'm glad to see so many others here share that opinion.",Octopussy
9,Tweekums,Silly but fun,7,25 April 2012,"After the opening credits we see a clown being pursued by a pair of knife throwing twins in East Berlin; they hit him but he manages to stagger to the British embassy where he crashes trough a glass window clutched a high quality fake Faberge egg. It turns out that the real egg is due to be sold at a London auction so Bond goes to see who turns up to buy it; suspecting correctly that with the fake lost the somebody may be willing to pay whatever it takes to retrieve the original. The buyer is Kamal Khan a wealthy Afghan prince living in India. When Bond gets to Delhi he soon gets the attention of Khan which leads to an entertaining rickshaw chase through the backstreets. It becomes apparent that Khan is involved with jewel smuggling with a woman known only as Octopussy. Of course there is no way that Bond would end up investigating something as trivial as smuggling; it turns out that Khan is using Octopussy's smuggling operation to help a rogue Soviet general to smuggle a nuclear bomb into West Germany! It must be said that this is one of the sillier Bond films; with Bond crossing a lake in a 'crocodile submarine', hiding in a gorilla suit and defusing a nuclear bomb while disguised as a clown! Still it is silly things like this that add some laughs to the rather thin plot. As one would expect of a Bond film there is plenty of action including the aforementioned rickshaw chase as well as fighting on the outsides of both a train and a plane! Roger Moore continues to do an entertaining job as Bond and Maud Adams did a good job as the eponymous Octopussy; at almost forty she may have been a bit older than most Bond girls but she still looked great and brought some maturity to the role. Louis Jourdan was suitably suave as the villain Khan and Steven Berkoff was delightfully over the top as the somewhat barmy Soviet General Orlov. For the most part the silliness added to the fun but occasionally it when too far; for example I could have done without Bond swinging through the jungle complete with 'Tarzan screams'! Overall it is still worth watching if you are a Bond fan and I suspect younger fans will get a good laugh from the silliness.",Octopussy
10,ma-cortes,"Funny,excitement ,thrilling new entry with a brilliant villain, Louis Jourdan",7,12 June 2007,"Bond again in an electrifying movie that scored a new hit at action genre.The immortal agent 007,whose deadly precision,sour irony and irresistible attractive is perfectly portrayed by Roger Moore.This time he investigate the killing of one his colleagues who appeared dead with a Russian egg Faberge of incalculable price.

Before essaying the role Bond, Roger Moore honed his suavity in the series ¨The Saint¨,hence he adds a humorous-tongue in check dimension to Ian Fleming's famed creation as the connoisseur(women and wine especially) spy hero,starting his role Bond with ¨Live and let die¨.Film displays gimmicks and silly set pieces that usually marred the best Moore outings.In spite of an exciting opening sequence and some thrilling scenes along the way the Bond-Moore series is starting to look a little tired, just its star protagonist.John Barry's music is unforgettable ,as always and colorful cinematography by Alan Hume.An agreeable screenplay and more believable exciting with cliff-hangers situations come to mind;still,this solid outing isn't bad Bond and it does star the best sympathetic OO7.This is one of the more watchable entries based on a short book by Fleming with the same title with Roger Moore in top form as 007 and assured direction by John Glen.",Octopussy
11,BA_Harrison,A low point in the Bond series.,4,25 February 2012,"This is the Bond film that sees Roger Moore doing a Barbara Woodhouse impression by telling a tiger to 'sit!'. This is the Bond film that has a crowd watching 'Wimbledon' style as secret agent Vijay (Vijay Amritraj) beats a baddie with a tennis racket. This is the Bond film that has 007 swinging through a jungle on a vine while Johnny Weismuller's famous Tarzan yodel plays on the soundtrack. This is the Bond film that sees James getting fully made up in a clown disguise in under two minutes.With all of that, plus a boring baddie in the form of Steven Berkoff, a dull and overly complex plot, uninspired direction from John Glen (a shame, after the excellent action scenes he gave us in For Your Eyes Only), embarrassingly stereotypical depictions of Indians and Germans, and a forgettable theme song by Rita Coolidge, and this is the Bond film I doubt I'll ever bother to watch again.",Octopussy
12,BandSAboutMovies,Head to head with Connery,5,13 April 2020,"When Octopussy came out, I was 11 years old and in full James Bond fever. I'd been watching all the old ones on ABC and HBO whenever they were on and playing the Victory Games James Bond 007 role playing game. I was probably more excited for this movie than anything else that year.That same year, Bond would also be back - as would Sean Connery - in Never Say Never Again. This is the 007 movie I saw in the theater. I saw that one on HBO.British agent 009 is killed, but abe to reach the British Ambassador, where his body shows up dressed as a circus clown and carrying a fake Faberge egg. This draws 007 into the orbit of Afghan prince Kamal Khan (Dr. Arcane from Swamp Thing), who has been smuggling Russian treasures to the West with the help of a circus owned by Octopussy (Maud Adams, who was also in The Man with the Golden Gun).The title comes from the Ian Fleming short stories compendium Octopussy and The Living Daylights. Hardly any of the plot of the short story Octopussy was used, with the auction scene taken from The Property of a Lady and other parts from Moonraker.Much like Connery, Moore began to tire of playing 007. His original contract had only been for three films, which ended with the The Spy Who Loved Me. The producers even started looking for a new Bond, with Timothy Dalton as a suggestion and tests being filmed with between Maud Adams and both Michael Billington and James Brolin. Yet once Never Say Never Again was announced, Moore was brought back.Octopussy herself was supposedly going to be played by Sybil Danning, Faye Dunaway, Barbara Carrera, Persis Khambatta and Susie Coelho. Seeing as how Maud Adams was already doing those screentests, she was brought in and darkened her hair to play the Indian-born Octopussy, despite being Swedish.This movie is also the first time I ever saw my father swear. We took one of our neighbors to see it, who may have never even seen a film in the theater before by the way he behaved. He kept asking my dad if James Bond was going to die, until completely infuriated, my father blew up. It still makes me laugh to this day.",Octopussy
13,Coventry,Bond Henpecked Bond!,6,21 November 2015,"If I personally rank all the James Bond movies from best to worst, this ""Octopussy"" would end up somewhere in the middle section or even slightly higher; in the upper half of the list. By this I mean that it certainly isn't an extraordinary Bond-movie that blows you away like some of the oldest (like ""Goldfinger"" or ""You Only Live Twice"") and newest (like ""Casino Royale"" or ""Skyfall"") did, but that it's a more than entertaining entry in the franchise. The ingredients that I particularly like in this film are the strong feminist undertones, the presence of a couple of less flamboyant but ultra-menacing bad guys, the Indian setting as well as the eerie circus finale and a handful of impressively staged sensational action sequences. The plot is good old-fashioned and stereotypical ""all-Reds-are-evil-bastards"" guff again, with villainous Russian military men hooking up with nasty Eastern millionaires in order to nuke American/British targets like air force bases. To achieve this they use the international smuggling network of the irresistible Octopussy, like for instance her world-acclaimed traveling circus. For the first time in Bond- history, the name of a female character forms the title and there's quite a bit of girl- power in the film overall. 007 ""only"" sleeps with two women here (whereas, in other films, it can go up to four or five) and they're both strong and independent women that don't seem all too impressed by his lucky charms. Louis Jordan depicts a charismatic bad guy, and he has got one of those indestructible henchmen in the shape of Bollywood actor Kabir Bedi. I always determine my James Bond movies based on how appalling the enemies are, and apart from these two, there are a couple of more like the sadistic Russian general Orlov (Steven Berkoff) and eerie knife-throwing twin brothers. Naturally Desmond Llewelyn is present as ""Q"" and he provides 007 with a handful of lovely and imaginative toys, like a realistic crocodile diving suit. But here also the coolest gimmick belongs to the bad guys, as some of Bond's opponents use a freakishly nasty type of buzz saw on a wire to attack. There are chase sequences with hot air balloons, homemade miniature airplanes and traditional rickshaws through overcrowded Indian marketplace streets; good Bond stuff in other words",Octopussy

16,hitchcockthelegend,"Englishman. Likes eggs, preferably Fabergé, and dice, preferably loaded.",7,19 June 2012,"Octopussy is directed by John Glen and adapted to screenplay by George Macdonald Fraser, Richard Maibaum and Michael G. Wilson. It stars Roger Moore, Maud Adams, Louis Jordan, Kabir Bedi, Steven Berkoff, Vijay Amritraj and Robert Brown. Music is scored by John Barry and cinematography by Alan Hume.Bond 13 and 007 is assigned to find the link between the murder of 009 and the Fabergé egg found in the slain agent's possession. His investigation leads him to uncover a fiendish plot by a rogue Soviet General to detonate a nuclear device that will leave Western Europe vulnerable to a Soviet attack.Undeniably the film that should have been Roger Moore's last as James Bond, Octopussy contains both the best and worst of the James Bond franchise. On the plus side is a very good core story that encompasses intelligent political overtones that were prevalent of the time period. A nuclear crisis is in the air and the East and the West, who have until now been casting suspicious eyes over each other, must co-operate to avert disaster. This closing down of the Cold War is nicely etched into the plot structure by the makers. The cast assembled is mostly impressive, with Adams and Jordan doing great characterisations, the photography by Hume makes India look like a paradise, Glen orchestrates some excellent action set-pieces, including one of the best pre-credits scenes of the series, and Barry's score is a swirl of romanticism and invention. The title song, All Time High sung by Rita Coolidge, is magnificent and this writer's personal favourite of all the Bond theme songs. While there's a new man enviably following the much missed Bernard Lee by playing M (Robert Brown) and Q (Desmond Llewelyn) gets a bigger role to play in the story.Sadly, even though Moore is continuing the good acting of Bond he achieved in For Your Eyes Only, he is looking his age and not physically suited to the action. He is also saddled with having to do moronic things like swinging on a vine whilst doing the Tarzan jungle yell. It's pretty painful to watch and you have to wonder who on earth thought it was a good idea? There's moments when a silly bit of humour undermines the good plotting, while Berkoff and Amritraj are in turn over the top villainy and scarcely believable as a field agent. The film looks cheap, a rarity for a Bond film, and the smartness of the story often gets buried beneath the weight of convolutions. Most galling is that we should have had a classic Bond movie, a gargantuan feast of sets and tough secret agent shenanigans, for this was the year when Bond as we know it was facing off against the Kevin McClory rival Bond movie, Never Say Never Again, and that had Sean Connery in it; though he was also like Moore in his early 50s and too old for the suit.The two films never met head to head at the box office, because McClory's was delayed. Both films made monster cash, with Octopussy grossing $184 million and Never Say Never Again copping $160 million, Bond, and the two actors playing the role were enough to ensure the cash tills rang loud and proud. But both films were solid rather than special, the profit margins were high but the quality wasn't. Octopussy has a bit of something for all types of Bond fans, but they just can't make a successful whole. From the Eon side of things there surely had to be a new direction, some decision making assertiveness instead of fluctuating between earthy Bond and ridiculous button pushing Bond, it needed some vim and vigour brought back into the fray. Moore planned to retire, and rightly so, was we about to see the dawn of a new Bond era? 7/10",Octopussy
17,Theo Robertson,Had potential,6,31 July 2002,"Plotwise OCTOPUSSY had the potential as being one of the very best Bond films , the idea of a rogue Soviet general exploding a hidden nuclear bomb inside a NATO base in order to win the cold war is something out of the very best Frederick Forsyth novel , but why oh why did the producers decide to ruin this almost credible and clever idea by having the plot jump from location to location in a completely superflous manner and add so many silly scenes ? Director John Glen is regarded as the weakest director in the series and watching OCTOPUSSY ( Or any of his bond films ) it`s easy to see why , Roger Moore hangs off a mode of transport in a close up that fails to disguise the fact that he`s in a studio doing the scene against back projection , then the director cuts to a long shot showing a stuntman hanging from a real mode of transport on location , which fools absolutely no one . Glen uses this unconvincing technique several times in every Bond film he has made",Octopussy

19,CinemaSerf,Fabergé would be proud....,7,23 November 2020,"This is my favourite Roger Moore outing as Ian Fleming's ""007"". A good, solid adventure story with Louis Jourdan as the ruthless, scheming ""Kamal Khan"" and Maud Adams as the equally ruthless, but far more glamorous ""Octopussy"" who are both involved in some seriously high-end jewel smuggling to fund a Soviet nuclear attack on NATO by the rogue Steven Berkoff (Gen. Orlov""). The action flows quickly and smoothly, with some fun cameos from a racket-wielding Vijay Amritraj and Albert Moses as a sort of lethal ""Oddjob"" in a turban. Sure, there are plenty of double-entendres but there is also a much better cohesion to the story than with many of the others, less crass innuendo - actually a decent thriller lurking underneath the traditional ""James Bond"" wrapping that is largely down to strong, characterful, performances for the quartet of baddies and a good script for Moore to deliver with more than a soupçon of glint in his eye. An under-rated theme song from Rita Coolidge (via Messrs. Barry & Rice); some decent aerial photography at the start and cracking locations all contribute strongly too.",Octopussy
20,zardoz-13,"A Sweet Distraction, 007 Style",9,27 July 2010,"The thirteenth James Bond thriller, director John Glen's ""Octopussy,"" pits redoubtable 007 against a conniving renegade Soviet general who is conspiring with a mysterious female smuggler and her army of agile babes to dismantle détente between the East and the West with a nuclear warhead which they plan to detonate on a U.S. Air Force in West Germany. This colorful, atmospheric, often exciting international actioneer boasts several memorable scenes. The mini-jet flight in the pre-credit sequence is awesome. Like the best Bonds, however, ""Octopussy"" doesn't trump itself with this hair-raising stunt sequence. Later, a sequence aboard a railway train tops similar fights on trains in both ""From Russia with Love"" and ""The Spy Who Loved Me."" The ultimate scene involves a battle to the death between Bond and a villain as they cling to the fuselage of a propeller driven plane. This scene is reminiscent of the opening credits aerial stunt in ""Moonraker."" Glen, who had previously directed ""For Your Eyes Only,"" stages several good fight scenes. Interestingly, when the action lands in India, Bond finds himself jumping from one frying pan to another as if he were Indiana Jones. The villains provide Bond with a considerable challenge. On the one hand, Bond must contend with the maniac general, while on the other he has to defeat another equally wily adversary. British actor Steven Berkoff is superb as the traitorous Soviet general, while smooth-talking Louis Jourdan registers memorably with the Russian general in a performance that is nasty enough to make you hate him. Maud Adams portrays the eponymous character that aids and abets the Soviet general who has been looting the Soviet archives of Faberge eggs to finance his skulduggery. Mind you, the Rita Coolidge theme song that Tim Rice wrote is one of the more lackluster of the franchise, but veteran Bond composer John Barry is back after being replaced on ""For Your Eyes Only"" by Bill Conti. The location are as usual scenic, the girls sexy, and action on the level of a spectacle. Bond gallivants from the Berlin Wall to India and back to West Germany. The only flaw is the army of women that the title villainous assembles to assault a fortress in the high-octane hand-to-hand combat sequences. The villain sends a group of killers after Bond and his leading lady with a unique weapon that resembles metal saw that the bad guys can deploy with devastating effects like a yo-yo. Although he is still debonair, Roger Moore had grown a bit long in the tooth and the producers momentarily pondered replacing him with ""Marcus Welby, M.D."" co-star James Brolin. This served as Robert Brown's introduction as M's replacement. Clocking in at 131 minutes, ""Octopussy"" runs out of momentum occasionally, but recovers until the finale where the army of gals tangle with the bad man's army.",Octopussy
21,Boba_Fett1138,Decent Bond,6,1 August 2003,"Of all the Bonds that has been made, this one is far from my favorite. But that doesn't mean it's a bad movie.Still I must admit that this Bond has some excellent villains although general Orlov (Steven Berkoff) is highly underused. Still, Kamal (Louis Jourdan) alone is an entertaining villain. I also like the bond sidekick Vijay (Vijay Amritraj). The Bond girls on the other hand aren't the best of all time.The story however isn't the best. Maybe because it's a bit too complicated for a Bond movie? The movie also lacks memorable scene's that almost all the other Bond movies have. The story is even silly at points, yes, even for a Bond movie.Still the movie has a high entertainment level thanks to Roger Moore who portrays Bond perfectly with his typical humor.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Octopussy
22,gridoon2021,Roger Moore's second best James Bond film,7,5 August 2008,"Roger Moore may not have been the most physical of the Bond actors (although he was adequate in that department), but he is most likely still the best when it comes to delivering dialogue, either funny (""Double sixes! Fancy that!"") or serious (""I'm not for hire""). Casting the similarly sophisticated and witty Louis Jourdan opposite Moore as a villain was a smart choice - the two actors play well off each other and their first two meetings (the auction and the backgammon match) are two of the most memorable ""quiet"" sequences in the series. The other main villain, a war-hungry Russian general, is played by a terrifically over-the-top Steven Berkoff. The main girls are Kristina Wayborn, sexy, ambiguous & acrobatic, and Maud Adams, looking and acting much better than she did nine years earlier in ""The Man With The Golden Gun"". The film has a memorable roster of supporting characters - henchmen, sidekicks - and even Q's and Moneypenny's scenes are among the best in the series. The breathtakingly exotic India makes a striking contrast with the more ""prosaic"" Germany, while John Barry works his magic with the melody of the wonderful title song ""All Time High"". The film does have its flaws: the pacing lags somewhere in the middle (especially during the scenes where the jewels are being transferred from one train to another), and the plot is a bit vague at points. Even with its flaws, however, ""Octopussy"" is one of the most entertaining - and re-watchable - James Bond films, and Moore's second best after ""For Your Eyes Only"". (***)",Octopussy
23,Uriah43,The First of Two James Bond Films Released in 1983,6,14 January 2016,"This movie essentially begins with a special agent for MI6 acquiring what appears to be a jeweled egg which had belonged in Russia for over a hundred years. Upon closer examination the egg is discovered to be a fake. At the same time the original Fabrege egg is up for sale in London and ""James Bond"" (Roger Moore) is sent to investigate whether the death of the special agent is somehow linked with the timing of the auction. His investigation then leads him to India and from there to Berlin with assassins trying to kill him at every turn. Anyway, as luck would have it, this is the first of two James Bond films released in 1983 with the other being ""Never Say Never Again"" which had Sean Connery reappraising his iconic role in that one. Now, as far as this particular picture is concerned, I especially liked the scenes in India which I thought lent an exotic flavor to the movie. I also thought that Louis Jourdan (as ""Kamal Khan"") turned in a pretty good performance as one of the main villains. Likewise, even though Maud Adams had played another character in the film ""The Man with the Golden Gun"", she was definitely a welcome addition as the jewel smuggler known as ""Octopussy"". However, there were some weak areas in this film as well which seemed to become more noticeable once the set moved to Berlin. Not only did the pace become more chaotic and confused but having Roger Moore dressed in a clown suit just didn't seem quite right to me. It's almost as if the director (John Glen) failed to understand the general criticisms associated with ""Moonraker"" and repeated the same mistake of his predecessor by going for cheap laughs at the expense of good drama and suspense. Naturally, a little comedy here and there is all well and good. But there is a fine line that separates ""James Bond"" movies from those of ""Matt Helm"" and the issue is one of quality. So having James Bond dress up in a gorilla suit or a clown costume just doesn't make sense. But that is just my opinion. In any case, while I certainly don't think this is one of the better James Bond films ever made, it was decent enough and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",Octopussy

The missile is traced to a circus(!) so Bond must go undercover to retrieve it, and defeat the general(played by Steven Berkoff). Story also takes him to India, where he meets up with the title character(Maud Adams) and her circus performers, staying with villain Kamal( played by suave Louis Jordan) who is involved with the evil plan.Despite the sight of James Bond dressed as a clown(!) this entry is still a lot of fun, striking the right balance between seriousness and high adventure, resulting in a satisfying film, though it does go on a bit too long!

Orlov's plan involves smuggling an atomic bomb into a U.S. Air Force Base in West Germany, in the hopes of crippling the country. Bond's investigation of Khan leads him to India, where he meets a mysterious woman named 'Octopussy' who is connected to Khan. The bomb is smuggled aboard a circus train, and Bond must race against time to stop the bomb from exploding and killing thousands, then stopping Khan before he escapes.....Easily the poorest Of Moores outings, this is the one where they jumped the shark with the franchise, and relied on visual humour to cover up the lack of coherent narrative, and pantomime villains.Jordan, despite having a great screen presence, isn't a convincing villain. When watching his character, I was reminded of Ricardo Montalban in the first Naked Gun movie. And Moore is blatantly becoming more lethargic as the series went on. And despite his best efforts, he's not convincing as Britains' greatest spy.But the opening is brilliant as usual, and the final battle on the plane exterior with Gobinda (the poor mans Oddjob) would make Tom Cruise balk.But despite all this, whenever I think of this film, I think of the chase through the crowded streets, with the tennis racket fight, which had actual ball to racket sound effects, and crowds moving their heads as you would expect.One to avoid unfortunately.....",Octopussy

This Bond for some reason features more comedy than any other Bond flick except for ""Casino Royale"" which was more of a spoof.  There are still great action sequences though.  The highlight of this one is the action on the train and race to get to the nuclear bomb.  Well I should say this movie starts out with Bond trying to find out why another 00 agent was killed and apparently had a forged peice of jewelery...this leads him to India which leads him to this circus which is really into smuggling and this leads to Germany and the above mentioned nuclear device.  The villan is really good...Maud Adams is the title character and just let me say it...she was not the first Bond gal to be in two movies.  There is a gal in Dr. No and she returns as the same character in From Russia with Love (I heard she was the only one on some special, but I knew differently).

28,Wuchakk,"Roger Moore, Indiana Jones, India, Germany, Circuses, Russians, Trains, Time Bombs and Babes",8,13 March 2014,"Roger Moore's stint as James Bond lasted a whopping 12 years from 1973 to 1985. Moore started as Bond when he was 45 years old and ended when he was 57. The seven films he did are as follows:LIVE AND LET DIE (1973), THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN (1974), THE SPY WHO LOVED ME (1977), MOONRAKER (1979), FOR YOUR EYES ONLY (1981), OCTOPUSSY (1983) and A VIEW TO A KILL (1985).All seven were hugely popular at the box office, which explains why they kept making 'em every two years.Many Bond fans curiously look down on Moore's stint, no doubt because there was a little too much silly humor in his films but, to me, the Moore entrees are the most consistently entertaining. There's not a dud in the bunch; even the heavily maligned ""Moonraker"" is phenomenal. The Connery films were a little more serious, with the exception of ""Diamonds are Forever,"" and Sean is the quintessential Bond figure because he expertly established the role, but I ENJOY Roger Moore's stint more than any of the others. His movies have the most re-watch merit for me.Some argue that by the time of ""Octopussy"" Moore was too ""long in the tooth,"" but I don't see that. He may have been 54 years-old when ""Octopussy"" was shot and 56 in ""A View to a Kill,"" but it didn't matter. Moore ALWAYS looked perfectly convincing as James Bond, whatever his age.As to the story, is it really necessary to go into detail about the convoluted plot of ""Octopussy""? Every Bond film features a main villain and a few accomplices/subordinates who want to cause great havoc; Bond defies death at every turn and runs into numerous beautiful women as he moves from one exotic locale to another trying to figure out the villains' scheme and stop it.""Octopussy"" was filmed on location in India, East Germany & England, with the closing aerial scenes shot in Utah; these settings are fabulous as usual. We also get circuses, clowns, trains, mad Russian militarists and bombs-about-to-explode.One thing that distinguishes ""Octopussy"" is that it has more of an Indiana Jones appeal than any other installment, which stands to reason since Indiana Jones was hugely popular at the time (""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" came out two years earlier while ""The Temple of Doom"" would come out the year after ""Octopussy"").The ""Bond women"" featured in ""Octopussy"" are Sweden's own Maud Adams (who previously appeared in ""The Man with the Golden Gun"") and Kristina Wayborn. I personally never found towering Maud very appealing, but Kristina has an exotic charm, although she needs to gain like 10 pounds. There are numerous other peripheral women in the film like Midge, the short brunette with full hair, and the East Indian beauty that aids Bond during the opening teaser, not to mention several circus babes.You either like James Bond films or you don't. You either like Roger Moore as James Bond or you don't. Although, their plots will often make your head spin, these movies are nothing deep. You won't derive many nuggets of wisdom. They're essentially mindless adventure flicks with political intrigue highlighted by exotic locales and beautiful women. Their express purpose is to entertain, not enlighten. It's escapist fantasy/adventure, pure and simple.""The Spy Who Loved Me"" is usually cited as the best Moore-era Bond picture, and I agree that it's a great Bond flick, but ""Octopussy"" ranks pretty high as well and is arguably the top one. As with most of Moore's Bond films, ""Octopussy"" throws in a bit o' goofy humor, but it's basically a serious story. It has a little Indiana Jones flare and features India, Germany, scheming Russian militarists & Afghan princes, gorgeous women, incredible action sequences, circuses, clowns, time bombs and trains. What moore could you want in a Bond pic?The film runs 2 hours, 10 minutes.GRADE: A-",Octopussy

So unfair, as he was a cheerful and loyal sidekick who helped 007 navigate his way through India, which at the time was governed by Indira Gandhi. In real life Vijay Amritraj was a professional tennis player who parlayed his skills into acting, and I would think he's the highest profile Indian to be in a James Bond movie, but I stand to be corrected.Another gruesome death occurred when a bad guy slammed head first into an aquarium and a small octopus suctioned itself on his face.

31,SimonJack,"Trains, planes, automobiles and more in this Bond thriller",9,4 May 2018,"After the last slow James Bond entry in 1981 (""For Your Eyes Only""), it was a pleasant surprise to find out that Agent 007 wasn't dying. Roger Moore in the Bond role in ""Octopussy"" comes back to life in grand style. This film has all of the trademark aspects of the Bond franchise, and then some. It has a new main playwright since the last outing. Usually there's one specific hair-raising scenario when Bond might fall to his death, become chopped liver, or float off into space. Here, Bond has three harrowing and nail biting escapades. The first is dodging a missile in a special jet plane made for him by Q's shop back at MI6 labs. The second is clinging to the side and then roof of a rail car on a fast moving train. And, the third is holding onto the top of a prop plane as the pilot tries to shake him off. In between these, Bond has some scrapes with assassins, other bad guys and is hunted and has encounters with tigers and crocodiles. This is one fast-paced thriller, and Bond returns to form, winning all of his fights but one. Of course, that one leads to his next escape. Bond gets some new gadgets from Q, besides the compact jet plane that doubles as a car. And, a double plot adds more intrigue and interest. Part of this story involves the Soviet Union, and a rebel general within the Soviet military who has a dastardly plan to cause a nuclear explosion in West Germany. Even though it's a far-out piece of the story, I enjoy the Bond thrillers more when they take place within the aspects of the Cold War. That was a very real time in the lives of people around the world after World War II and until 1990. This film has more unique and hair-raising scenes than usual, to the point that the plot bounces around a great deal. But, it is interesting and keeps one awake and glued to his or her seat. The story is set mostly in India and Germany, which at that time was divided into East and West. In a scene where M sends Bond into East Berlin, Bond goes from the American zone to East Berlin through Checkpoint Charlie. That probably was the most famous and well known of all the Berlin crossings during the Cold War. This film is somewhat different in that it doesn't have a woman agent as a nemesis to Bond. Instead, a network of women have been trained by the daughter of a former Secret Agent in physical skills as well as business and professional fields. Toward the end, Octopussy, played by Maud Adams, leads her ladies in a raid on the evil Kamal. It's a far-fetched battle, but it's a fun spectacle to see how it was staged. Louis Jordan plays Kamal. This is a very enjoyable Bond thriller with lots of action and far-out scenes. It's the best Bond played by Roger Moore, and one of the best of the entire series. Not only does it have trains, planes and automobiles, but it also has boats, horses, elephants, and a hot air balloon toward the end. There's much fun in this film. One very strange thing occurs in the opening scenario. Two armed guards are watching Bond in the back of a moving truck. When a woman agent distracts them, Bond hits releases on their chests and parachutes open and they float out of the truck. These were freefall chutes used in sky diving, not regular Army parachutes. But, even then, no one would ever be wearing a parachute until just before they boarded a plane for a jump. Here are some favorite lines from this film. Bond and an MI6 art expert attend an art auction in London at which an original Faberge egg from the Russian royalty is put on the auction block. Bond, ""How much should it fetch?"" Jim Fanning, ""Oh, 250,000... 300,000 pounds. Anything more would be crazy.""When Bond arrives in India, he finds his contact to be snake charmer. Vijay, ""This was the wrong cover. I hate snakes."" Vijay tells Bond that he plays cricket. Vijay, ""As a matter of fact, I've got a part time job as a pro at Kamal's club."" James Bond, ""What have you learned so far?"" Vijay, ""Well, my backhand's improving.""",Octopussy
32,JamesHitchcock,Clowning About,6,13 February 2014,"When a British agent is found dead in East Berlin carrying a fake Fabergé egg, James Bond is sent to investigate. In the course of an adventure which takes him not only to Germany but also to India he initially discovers a jewellery-smuggling racket involving an exiled Afghan prince and a renegade Soviet general. He quickly realises, however, that more serious matters are afoot as the general also intends to explode a nuclear weapon in Germany as part of a plan to provoke a war between the Soviet Union and NATO. Roger Moore had intended to end his stint as James Bond after his fifth entry in the series, ""For Your Eyes Only"". 1983, however, was the year of two rival Bond films, because this was the year when Sean Connery returned to the role in ""Never Say Never Again"", made by a rival consortium. The producers therefore persuaded Moore to stay on, feeling that an established star would do better at the box-office against Connery than would a newcomer. I have often felt that it would have been better for Moore to have gone out on a high- ""For Your Eyes Only"" is one of his best Bonds- and for Timothy Dalton to have been given a chance to establish himself in the role earlier. ""Octopussy"" is certainly better than Moore's feeble last outing, ""A View to a Kill"", but not as good as ""For Your Eyes Only"" or some of the earlier episodes in the franchise. The film's two main advantages over ""A View to a Kill"" are a decent villain in the shape of Steven Berkoff's barking, power-mad General Orlov and a decent Bond Girl. In order to head off accusations of being anti-Russian the script makes it clear that Orlov is acting in defiance of orders and that his extremist position is repudiated by the country's leader- obviously based upon Leonid Brezhnev, who had actually died by the film was released- and the official Soviet military establishment, represented by the relatively liberal, pro-détente General Gogol. The Bond Girl is Maud Adams who plays the title character. Octopussy (presumably not her baptismal name; we learn that her surname is Dexter- Smythe) is a wealthy and mysterious Englishwoman living in India who has founded the ""Octopus cult"" as a cover for her smuggling operations and who joins forces with Bond when she discovers exactly what her former associates Orlov and Kamal Khan are up to. This was Maud's second Bond film; she had earlier appeared in ""The Man with the Golden Gun"". She was not the first actress to appear in different roles in two different Bond films- that was Martine Beswick who appeared in both ""From Russia with Love"" and ""Thunderball""- but her roles were both rather larger than Martine's. At 37 she was, along with Honor Blackman in ""Goldfinger"", the oldest Bond Girl. There is also a good contribution from another Swedish actress, Kristina Wayborn, as the seductive villainess Magda. As leader of the Octopus cult Octopussy commands her own private army of young women, so this film seems to have more credited Bond Girls than any other. Just about every British glamour model of the period seems to have been pressed into service, along with gymnasts like Suzanne Dando. Another of the film's strengths is Rita Coolidge's excellent theme song, ""All Time High"", one of the best of the series. I also liked the fact that Desmond Llewelyn's character ""Q"" played a larger role than normal in assisting Bond to thwart the villains; normally he was only given a brief scene in which he explained his latest inventions. The film does, however, have its weaknesses. The French actor Louis Jourdan, as the other main villain Kamal Khan, is no more an Afghan prince than I am a Dutchman. Apart from the pre-title sequence set in some nameless Latin American dictatorship, and the final scene aboard Kamal's plane, where Bond performs feats of derring-do implausible even by the less-than- realistic standards of the series, the action sequences are not particularly memorable, and I felt that more could have been made of scenes such as the fight on the roof of the train or the tuk tuk chase through the streets of Delhi. (This last features a cameo from Vijay Amritraj, better known as a tennis player). The most important weakness, however, is that, despite its potentially serious theme of a looming nuclear war, the overall tone of the script is just too tongue-in-cheek and lighthearted, epitomised by the scene in which Bond dresses in a gorilla outfit. In another he disguises himself as a clown. This possibly affected Moore's performance as he seemed to be clowning about and slipping back into the tendency, already shown in ""Moonraker"", to stroll through a film without putting in a lot of effort. ""Octopussy"" is generally a watchable film, but not one of the Bond classics. 6/10",Octopussy

The women in this film are to me the most beautiful ones of the Bond series. Not only is Maud Adams just wonderful, but Kristina Wayborn looks great too. The action sequences in this one are among the best of the series & the humor is great. Louis Jourdan is a great bad guy & the film based upon 2 of Ian Flemings short stories put together by George MacDonald Fraser works well. This film has a pace to it, & you just can enjoy the ride when you watch it. The opening sequence has nothing to do with the rest of the film.I often still imagine Kristina Wayborn as my girl instead of a Bond girl. The brunette in the opening sequence is a looker too. What I love about the opening is that it sets the tone for the rest of the movie. While the stunts look awesome, this film is played for a lot of laughs along with the action. It succeeds on both counts, & truly is the ""Property of a Lady"" with so many good looking Bond Women.Rita Coolidge had her all time best song with the theme song for this film which seems to have been written for her voice. It's an all time high from Louis Jourdan (Kamal) to Bond in a gator tuxedo!",Octopussy
35,KineticSeoul,Roger Moore's portrayal of Bond finally became a clown,4,6 February 2016,"With a title like ""Octopussy"" I was expecting something more unique and different, perhaps bizarre. However this is another movie where Roger Moore plays James Bond in a way that is full of silliness although the plot tries to have that Indiana Jones vibe going for it. It just seems that the Bond franchise tries to emulate films that are popular films around that time. So in this Bond goes swinging from tree vine to vine in order to escape the bad guys while yelling like Tarzan, to him using the street entertainers equipment to fight of the bad guys, to him being inside a mechanical alligator in order to disguise himself (which is something that inspired Hideo Kojima for ""Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater"". It even goes as far to break the barrier when it comes to lameness by getting Bond to dress up like a clown. Like the past Bond movies with Roger Moore, it's a movie that you just can't take seriously. The plot can be difficult to follow, except that it revolves around some prized egg jewel and a detonator. When it comes to the battle of the Bonds, between ""Never Say Never Again"" and this. I think the reason this made more money when it came to box office was because of this was a official canon movie in the Bond franchise while ""Never Say Never Again"" was a rehash and is not officially a Bond movie in the original franchise. So although ""Octopussy"" won when it came to the box office numbers, but I personally think ""Never Say Never Again"" is the better Bond film and not just because of Connery. I give this one a 4.5 out of 10 because it does have the best intro scene compared to the previous Bond films.4.5/10",Octopussy
36,OllieSuave-007,My favorite James Bond movie!,10,25 June 2007,"This is my favorite James Bond film, a story where the death of British Secret Service Agent 009 and an auctioned Faberge Egg lead Bond (Roger Moore) on a mission to India to uncover a jewel smuggling operation involving tycoon Kamal Khan (Louis Jourdan) and the mysterious Octopussy (Maud Adams). Bond must also find out what the connection is to Soviet General Orlov's (Steven Berkoff) plot to blow up an American Air Force Base to grasp untold power. This all leads to an exciting race against time to stop World War III from happening. This movie has a very riveting story and screenplay written by George MacDonald Fraser, Richard Maibaum and Michael G. Wilson, and solid direction by John Glenn - making this an enjoyable 007 adventure from start to finish. There are plenty of action scenes to keep the movie's momentum going, from the high-speed car chase between Bond and Indian agent Vijay (Vijay Amritraj) against Kamal's top henchman Gobinda (Kabir Bedi) in the busy streets of India, to the thrilling jungle chase as Bond tries to elude Kamal and his men towards the middle of the movie). The cinematography and sceneries are beautiful, elegantly detailing Octopussy's Floating Palace and Kamal Khan's Monsoon Palace.The acting was spot-on, with the debonair and suave Moore having great on-screen chemistry with the sultry and beautiful Maud Adams. I've always liked Moore's more comedic approach to Bond, giving his films including this one more humor, blending it in with the right amount of drama and action in making it a balanced film (not too dark, not too funny). It also was good to see Q (Desmond Llewelyn) take on a larger role for this film as well. I also very much enjoyed the opening song ""All Time High"" by Rita Coolidge, which I thought is a very serene and smoothing song, and also thought composer John Barry gave some of his best musical scores. With all the drama, fights, chase-scenes on cars, trains and airplanes, and Bond's dry humor and witty remarks, this is one entertaining feature that will surely remain my favorite Bond adventure ever. Grade A",Octopussy
37,bensonmum2,"""Pay attention, 007!""",5,30 August 2007,"I'm a James Bond fan from way back. Some of my fondest memories of growing-up are James Bond movies on the ABC Sunday Night Movie. If Bond was going to be on, I couldn't wait. So it pains me to give a James Bond movie anything but a stellar rating as I've done with Octopussy. I saw it in the theater in 1983 and was terribly disappointed. Watching last night, my opinion has not changed in the 24 or so intervening years. It may not be the worst Bond movie ever made, but it comes close.To write in detail about all of the problems I have with Octopussy would be unwieldy to say the least. Instead, I'll mention two examples that nicely encapsulate my issues with the movie. First, as many have mentioned in comments and reviews on the internet, Octopussy begins with a very well done pre-title sequence. The aerial chance sequence is a rip-roaring success. Bond lands his plane and pulls it up into a service station parking lot. It's unfortunate that the director chose this moment to have Roger Moore open his mouth and destroy the great start. Bond looks at the gas station attendant and in the smuggest manner possible says, ""Fill it up."" That's right, ""Fill it up."" Give me a break! I'm cringing all over again just thinking about it. I suppose that at the age of 56, Moore could no longer pull off the James Bond role physically so they resorted to comedy. Well, the quipping, one-line machine that James Bond became during the time Roger Moore played the character is not the James Bond I enjoy. Sure, Connery used comedy, but it was more of an after thought. In contrast, I sometimes get the feeling with Moore that the elaborate stunts and special effects were done just to set-up a one-liner. I realize that this is an exaggeration, but it pretty well sums up my feelings on the matter.The second example I'll cite occurs very near the end of Octopussy just as James Bond arrives at the circus with the intention of disabling the nuclear weapon. The chase between Bond and the clueless authorities takes him in and around the circus performers' trailers. Seizing an opportunity, Bond ducks into a trailer to avoid being caught. Now, grabbing something to use as a disguise makes sense, but does Bond do that  No! He actually takes the time to put on full clown make-up complete with the tear on the cheek! Huh? He has something like less than five minutes to disarm an atomic bomb and he stops to put on clown make-up! Again  give me a break! And exactly how did he put on that make-up in less than a couple of minutes? James Bond movies have always asked the audience to stretch believability, but this is utterly ridiculous. He can do a lot of things, but James Bond cannot stop time. I suppose the whole point of the scene is to get Roger Moore into the goofy clown make-up. James Bond  the Clown. Kind of gives some insight into what the producers, etc. thought of the character.There are other issues I have with the movie that I could write about including the ridiculous crocodile boat, Roger Moore's all too obvious stunt-double, the incredibly lame title theme song, or Kristina Wayborn's weak attempts at acting. But I've already concentrated enough on the negative aspects. And it's not as if Octopussy is all bad. This is James Bond after all so there is some fun to be had. But if a fanboy like myself can rate a James Bond movie a very pedestrian 5/10, well then you know it has problems.",Octopussy
38,Lejink,On the squids,3,8 September 2020,"This is Bond running out of steam faster than a leaking kettle. Sometimes a film title gets the movie it deserves and that is certainly the case here. The first thing you notice, after a rather tame pre-credits super-stunt involving Bond piloting a small jet plane, is that the producers didn't even try to co-opt the outlandish title into the theme song, nondescript as it still turns out to be. The title sequence is dull too and things don't improve with a set-up scene involving the death of a clown (cue for a song) which could have come from an old Steed and Emma Peel ""The Avengers"" TV episode. If it had, I could have looked forward to 50 minutes in the suspenseful and entertaining company of a suave, sophisticated and witty secret-agent but no, all I got was over two hours of Roger Moore going through the motions in a flabby, barely creditable plot which adds very little if anything to Bond lore.It's known that Moore had wanted to retire from the role but stayed on as a favour to the producers to go up against Connery's returning Bond in ""Never Say Never Again"" which was being made at the same time. John Glen had directed the previous Bond film ""For Your Eyes Only"" and here gets another chance in the chair but watching this you feel as if he's learned precious little from his experience before. The film is slow, the characterisations are thin and cliched and the action sequences strangely inactive. There's some poor back projection work, plus I'd wager Moore's stunt man did more work than the star himself, so obvious is the frequent doubling here.Louis Jourdain makes for an anaemic baddie who is given a swarthy Indian henchman who bears no threat at all to our hero, there's a stereotypical mad Russian general who naturally goes rogue while Maud Adams makes for one of the most forgettable Bond girls I can remember if you follow my drift.I'm struggling to think of the worst bits, there's such a lot of competition, Bond's Barbara Woodhouse impersonation when trying to tame a rampaging tiger, old Q getting randy around a group of young females he's just rescued, Bond dressed as a gorilla or a clown, Bond's George of the Jungle routine or just the sight of Octopussy's girl army all dressed up like the D.C. super-hero The Flash.There's usually something memorable about even the weakest of the Bond films, a witty line, an exciting action sequence, a good baddie, but there's nothing here that stays in the memory.I guess what I'm saying is that this just might be the weakest of the Bond films. With that title, it probably never had a chance.",Octopussy
39,bowmanblue,Moore of the same,7,2 August 2017,"Growing up in the late seventies and early eighties, it's fair to say that (despite the numerous amounts of evidence to the contrary supporting Connery) Roger Moore is my favourite Bond. I watched (the absurdly-titled) 'Octopussy' when it came out in 1983. I was six at the time and I loved it. However, now many decades later I can saw that there are Bond films that stand the test of time and will be enjoyed by future generations just as much and there are Bond films that only appeal to you as a child. Now, I can see that Octopussy is probably the latter. Even as a cynical adult I still watch it and enjoy it for what it is (plus the nostalgia it induces in me), however, it's probably the (first) best example that those who like to criticise Moore's interpretation of Bond use when they say how much better Connery was as the superspy.Many liked Connery because of his darker take on Bond. People felt that Moore was often too silly and self-knowing to be taken seriously. As I said, I personally liked Moore best and he probably peaked during 'The Spy Who Loved Me,' after that it was a slow descent into a little too much reliance on glib one-liners and parodies that would make Austin Powers blush. It focuses on a Soviet General who is trying to finance a new European war via purchasing rare jewellery. Naturally, Bond must stop a few bombs going off along the way.Along with the obligatory car chases and punch-ups we see the first ever instance of a Bond girl returning for a new film. Maud Adams plays a different role than the one in 'The Man With the Golden Gun,' but I'm not really sure why she was chosen as she's hardly the most memorable Bond girl of the franchise. Plus the villain is kind of weak, too. Gone are the days of 'Jaws' or 'Blofeld' and in their place are a forgettable Indian bad guy and the generic Russian general who's always out to crush the decadent West.Overall, I enjoy the film because I pretty much will watch anything Bond-related and I have a soft spot for the campiness of the Roger Moore era (even when it does come across more like a Flash Gordon movie during some of the climactic fight scenes!). However, I do appreciate that 'Octopussy' will not be for everyone. If you lean towards liking 'dark and gritty' Bond then you're really going to have a hard time taking Bond seriously when he's swinging through the jungle while they overlay a 'Tarzan-like' noise over him.Perhaps the most pertinent thing to point out is that Bond has to infiltrate a circus and, in doing so, decides to (perfectly) disguise himself as a clown. He then flaps and waddles in his oversize shoes past all manner of guards in order to stop mass genocide. It's a daft sight, but then it's a pretty daft film. If you're okay with that, then you'll hopefully get some enjoyment in this over-the-top spy film (and not think that it's a complete horse's a$$ - as depicted in the opening stunt!)",Octopussy
40,ThomasDrufke,Octomiss,5,25 October 2015,"Of course, I wrote in my For Your Eyes Only review that I appreciated the tongue and cheek being toned down a bit, only to be overwhelmed with goofiness with Osctopussy. There's a lot of entertainment to be had with this film, but sadly I felt a ton of opportunities were wasted.It seemed as though the plot was going to shift the motivations of the lead villain from craving world domination down to simply a jewel thief. To me, that was intriguing. Bringing the stories to a more realistic focus would have been compelling for this film. But instead we got a mess of a film. I'm just very tired of the use of nuclear weapon's for the lead villain. It's been used over and over again. Not every bad guy has nukes. I also felt they took the setting of India and abused it a bit. I'm sorry but how many different animals were used as spectacles or traps for Bond? Bond literally tells a wild tiger to sit down, and it listens. It got a bit ridiculous, especially knowing how noticeably fake most of them were. Certainly some of the sequences can be entertaining, but when a professional tennis player's cameo turns into him beating villains over the head with a tennis racket overpowering machine guns, you know you've taken it too far.But it's disappointing that this film didn't take advantage at having a female antagonist. The series thus far hasn't had a lead female villain, and I thought for awhile it would be the first. She was hidden from the audience for a good portion of the film similar to Blofeld which made for an interesting proposition. Sadly, 'Octopussy' turns out to be just like most other Bond girls. On the flip side, Q gets to play a bigger role which was a good change up from being back at MI6 all the time. There's no denying this film's entertainment, but there's just too many missed opportunities.+Q is a bigger part+Very good first half-Missed opportunities-Yet another nuclear obsessed villain5.5/10",Octopussy
41,cricketbat,"A strange chapter in the Bond franchise, but still entertaining",6,25 February 2020,"Octopussy is a strange chapter in the Bond film franchise. This movie tries to be more serious and grounded in reality, but then it sprinkles in some crazy stunts, goofy costumes, and outlandish moments that feel out of place because of the tone previously set. It also suffers from being too long with an overly complicated story. All that being said, it's still a pretty entertaining film.",Octopussy
42,lesleyharris30,"A Fun, Albeit very Forgetful, Bond,",6,10 November 2015,"Octupussy is a decent movie with a reasonably well written storyline and a talented cast. It's an enjoyable Bond film, mostly because of Roger Moore, who is still terrific in the lead role in his sixth outing as 007, he's cool, slick and very funny, his one liners here are particularly excellent and it's what makes him stand out from other Bond actors, his scenes with Maud Adams are the best as the two have undeniable chemistry. It's biggest problem is that it never takes itself seriously, Moore is fine but other characters have comedic lines and it dosen't suit, I liked how it worked in previous movies, where every other character was dead serious while Moore made jokes that they didn't respond to, it almost feels like a parody of a Bond film at times instead of an official entry in the series, seeing Bond dressed as a clown is simply ridiculous. The story is also far too predictable, you can tell every move that is going to be made ten minutes before it happens, it's formulaic and never really tries to stand out from other Bonds, it's also very slow moving with too much dialogue and not enough action. It has many flaws, if you're a fan of James Bond, and particularly Roger Moore, then you should certainly watch Octupussy, but if you're looking for a genuinely good adventure film, give it a miss. James Bond is assigned to solve the murder of an agent who was killed while clutching a fake Faberge egg. Best Performance: Roger Moore",Octopussy

44,callanvass,One of Moore's best!,8,18 November 2014,"(Credit to IMDb) A fake Fabergé egg and a fellow agent's death lead James Bond to uncover an international jewel-smuggling operation, headed by the mysterious Octopussy, being used to disguise a nuclear attack on N.A.T.O. forces.This is one of Roger's best outings as Bond. It's a shame that Roger was getting a tad too old for the part, because he was growing into the role nicely at this juncture. It has plenty of exciting action and a solid story as well. Maud Adams is very sexy as Octopussy and definitely one of my favorite Bond girls. Her chemistry with Moore was a lot of fun. As long as you don't question why she's back after being killed off as a different character in the Man with the Golden Gun, you should be fine. The finale is jam-packed with action and kept me on the edge of my seat. Louis Jordan makes an effective bond villain as well. I know this is compared to Never Say Never Again...since it opened against that film, but in my mind there is no contest. Despite Connery's valiant comeback attempt, Moore reigned supreme with a much superior Bond movie. Bond fans will love this one! Chances are, you've already seen it8.2/10",Octopussy
45,kenjha,Great Fun,8,2 August 2009,"In his 13th outing, Bond gets involved with the eponymous character, Faberge eggs, and an atomic bomb. The action is relentless as in previous entries in the series, but this time there's a nice flow to it. Add in the colorful setting of Udaipur, India, and a bevy of butt-kicking bikini babes and one can't go wrong. This is not only Moore's best Bond film, but also the best in the series since ""Goldfinger."" Jourdan makes a suave villain while Adams and Wayborn are easy on the eyes. There are some funny moments but the humor is not forced as in earlier films. It does overstay its welcome with too many climaxes but is great fun.",Octopussy
46,The-Sarkologist,Another Fine Bond Film,7,12 December 2019,"The bond films around this time seem to be taking more a detective sort of theme than some of the earlier ones, namely those that happen to have these huge super-villain hide outs and plans to take over the world. Okay, they also have Russian agents, and Russian plots as well, but a lot of it seems to have more to do with maintaining the balance of power than anything else.So, there is this Russian general who basically wants to invade Western Europe, and the Russians think that this is a pretty bad idea. However, being the lone wolf that he happens to be, he decides that he will implement his plan anyway. This plan involves some jewel smugglers, because it appears that jewellry is being smuggled out of Russia to be sold on the black market, and the reason Bond gets involved is because they find a Faberge Egg in the hands of a dead agent.Okay, there does happen to be a base that the bad guy lives in - sort of, because the bad guy is not as clear cut as is evident, and it is clear that not everybody actually knows what is going on. Sure, we have the jewel smugglers, but we also have this plan to invade Western Europe, and to also put the United States to shame.I liked this film, but then again I do tend to have a soft spot for the James Bond films. This one does stick out in my mind namely because I still remember when it hit the cinemas, and it was basically one of the first that I remember hitting the cinemas, since I saw the posters all over the place. Yeah, that is sort of showing my age a bit.It's still a a pretty good film, quite action packed that certainly doesn't let up, and we also have Bond traveling to exotic places as well, this time it is India. Mind you, looking at the credits roll at the end, I sort of noticed that a lot of the Indian characters were played by British actors, which was a bit of a shame, but that has changed quite a lot in the ensuring years.",Octopussy

As gorgeous as Maud Adams is, her returning as a new character is as silly as when they did it with Charles Grey. Louis Jourdan is a dull villain and Steven Berkoff hadn't quite learnt how to be the fantastic villain he would be come. Possibly worst of all, the awful humour is back during action set pieces!! Yelling like Tarzan, telling the tiger to ""Siiiit"" and men looking at alcohol bottles in disbelief etc.There are some things I like, I love Rita Coolidge's title song All Time High, there are some seriously impressive stunts, although it's hampered by the greenscreen/projection every time Moore's face is shown. It has some stunning locations, but the matte paintings and miniature's stand out a mile. Vijay Amritraj is a joy as Bond's sidekick and Octopussy's girls (whilst I don't like their inclusion in the movies finale) are fun and one of them Carolyn Seaward (the busty blonde) certainly leaves an impression.Octopussy grossed $67 million at the domestic box office to end 1983 as the 6th highest grossing movie of the year.",Octopussy

50,didi-5,Cold War thriller: height of camp,7,5 May 2009,"'Octopussy' is an entertaining Bond film from the Roger Moore era - although this 007 is a little long in the tooth to cavort with the lovelies! Starting with a man in a clown suit rushing in terror and leading into one of the best action scenes in the cycle, the film takes in power-crazy Russians, Faberge egg auctions, an Afghan Prince and his castle, and an island of Lycra-clad ladies led by Octopussy herself, Maud Adams.Naturally, there are murders and deaths, innuendos, great stunts, and more than one raised eyebrow. It is derring-do for the boys, lots of fun and more than a little camp. After one more film in the series it was a time for a change of Bond and a change of direction, but this film certainly passes the time and, muddled plot aside, is a satisfying, if a little over-acted, saga of East-West relations.",Octopussy
51,johnnyboyz,"In spite of having a certain roughness around its edges, Octopussy isn't an all that bad-a spy thriller - a good enough entry with enough to get caught up in.",7,5 October 2011,"When Octopussy begins, James Bond wasn't told that there would be as much security as there actually is once he's at the Latin American airbase that he's about to infiltrate. There is a sense of uncertainty, of unease; the stakes have all of a sudden been raised and sure enough, he is caught. As is commonplace with any Bond entry for those new to the series, it is established during these precredits sequences that the man is able to deal with mostly any situation - often possessing the ability to turn things around and into his favour. He does so here, albeit with the help of a female accomplice - without whom he would have found himself in a tough situation, in what is an early representation of a female character with certain abilities and qualities away from being stock Bond-franchise objects. The sense throughout the opening, that it possesses an engaging and burning sense of development combining with degrees of thrills and spills more predominantly put across via exciting action, sticks throughout 1983's Octopussy; the entry that is probably second only to The Spy Who Loved Me in terms of the best of Moore's tenure as the dogged British secret agent, and a wholesome adventure film all by itself.Octopussy's events are sparked into action with a clown's departure from a travelling circus, a man in disguise and actually a British double-0 agent fleeing the place. The circus' jovial background ambiance juxtaposes the sense of chase and danger as he's pursued by two expert knife throwers whom have mean looking intent etched onto their faces; it dissipating with the deathly popping noise that a balloon the clown had attached to him makes upon snagging a branch - the danger escalates, and the scene changes tracts. Escaping them, he stumbles into an Allied embassy and dies on arrival – only to reveal that he was carrying a fabergé egg. Baffled but somewhat alarmed, the British secret service assign Bond to the case and charge him with finding out precisely what's going on. The egg is more broadly linked to that of Louis Jourdan's villain of Afghan descent, Kamal Khan. Khan is royalty in his neck of the woods and a man of whom comes equipped with a hard-as-nails body guard named Gobinda (Bedi), whose own strength is put across via a sequence in which he crushes some dice in the palm of his hands – allusions to Goldfinger's henchman Oddjob, and his uncanny ability to do likewise to golf balls, here rearing up.A fair few miles away, Steven Berkoff's Soviet General, Orlov, is engaged in a heated debate with half a dozen of his compatriots. In reaction to another General's peaceful ideas about surrendering to the West and ending Cold War hostilities (dialogue playing out to a fitting background of a world map, inferring unity) Orlov outlines a plan built on the notion of full scale warfare which will result in the occupying of most of Western Europe out of an enforced Capitalist disarmament. His methods and attitudes are played out to a very different backdrop, that of a large image built on the iconography of a dictatorship-come-propagandist infused piece of artwork, something reiterating an aggression or a thirst for conquest.But most of that stuff comes later on; primarily, it is about the duelling between Khan and Bond, a duelling which begins at a London auction in which Bond outbids the man for another fabergé egg and then continues on to an Indian-set casino when either man, respectively clad in white and black reiterating this sensibility of there existing conflict, do battle over a game of high-stakes Backgammon that again, sees Bond win out. When Bond is in India, Khan's nation of residence, it is to attempt to uncover why it was Khan desires the egg; a mark around which we encounter the titular Octopussy (Maud Adams, redeeming things somewhat for her turn/presence in the underdone The Man With the Golden Gun). We observe how Khan appears in the service of her and her palace-set island dwelling; conditions housing circus performers whom dominate a female-only zone. The women on Octopussy's island have purposes or roles; there is a sense of positivity where she dwells, that of taking people in and turning them into someone rather than nothing. Her abode, while very much similar to Khan's in appearance, is the polar opposite to his, in which plans for destruction and harm come to fruition, while attitudes of greed dominate proceedings and the lone female presence is that of the initially somewhat flimsy Magda (Wayborn), of whom is not particularly empowered and employed only as a seductress.The film has a merry, outgoing quality about it; it is good, clean adventure imbued espionage fun – an honest romp with a likable degree to it. When allies in the film die, there is pause for thought and we sense their lack of presence; there is a sense of great travel throughout, characters are shooting from one corner of the globe to another but are discovering new things that actually total up into something. As the film builds to its finale, intrigue often intensifies rather than merely dissipating; clues are dotted around that we, as must the characters, have to make sure we observe: we overhear the names of certain German cities in distant conversations and that of dates, the names of these places rearing up later on in print furthering tension as pieces of a puzzle come together. We enjoy the intrigue, the mystery surrounding each movement and nuance as things develop – things are not spelt out to us like they might have been. While easy to criticise, the casting of a then-tennis pro and the taking of events to India in order to pine to a new audience seemingly rife enough, Octopussy holds up as a taut; coiled, involving spy thriller which works a lot more than it perhaps has any right to.",Octopussy
52,filipemanuelneto,"A good movie, destroyed by the scenes where Bonde panics",2,1 April 2016,"Directed by John Glen and produced by Albert Broccoli, it has script by Richard Maibaum and George MacDonald Fraser and is the thirteenth film in the franchise. In this film, James Bond investigates the death of another British spy. The trail leads to India, where he allies with Octopussy, a daughter of a former enemy who want to save her own skin. The action takes place in the context of ""détente"", a policy of appeasement between the USA and the USSR.Personally, I consider this film as one of the worst in the entire franchise. I appreciate the scenery and the exoticism of the scenes in India, where part of the film took place, or the trip train to West Berlin. All these scenes help, in fact, to make this a very nice film. The script is also good: the theft of Soviet artworks, a nuclear attack on West Berlin are strong themes. The great sin of this film are some scenes that ridiculed the main character. Its sad to see James Bond disguised as clown or gorilla, but even that could be understandable depending on the context. But see 007 to panic, start screaming and running from one side to the other in the middle of a circus tent... I wasn't able to recognize Bond, nor understand how Roger Moore allowed his character was the target of that laughingstock!In this film, besides the central cast inherited from the previous films and the continuation of Roger Moore in the role of 007, it participated Maud Adams in the role of Octopussy; Louis Jourdan gave life to the villain, Kamal Khan; Kabir Bedi played Gobinda and Robert Brown assumed the role of M, left vacant by the death of Bernard Lee.",Octopussy

The mission leads Bond to cross paths with an exiled prince n his associate, Octopussy and later Bond discovers a plot involving nuclear weapon.The film has one of the best pre credits scene of an aerial chase.For a change, Bond does a Tarzan stunt, dons a gorilla outfit n also of a clown.There is a lovely train sequence and a lol scene of that of a car being run on tracks by Bond.It has a jungle chase sequence involving elephants, tiger, leeches, spiders n crocodiles.But the best is the climactic aeroplane sequence which is tension filled n well shot.Bond's sliding on the rail of stairs n shooting villains is epic and he riding a horse n catching up an aeroplane is amazing. Both the scenes are copied by the Bollywood spy film Ek Tha Tiger but done in a good way by Salman Khan.This film has some very weak villains but a mighty strong n loyal henchman known as Gobinda played by an Indian actor Kabir Bedi.This time Bond faces knife throwing assassins, a deluded General Orlov, an exiled prince Khan, a strong henchman Gobinda with an intimidating glare that causes Bond to lose his appetite, lots of thugs, guards, hunters, Colonel Luis Toro n his soldiers n a very ruthless contract killer with a yo-yo saw.This time Bond gets to cool off with a sultry Hispanic female agent played by Tina Hudson, another hottie Kristina Wayborn and once again Maud Adams.This film is the only one with a Bond Girl whose name is used as the title of the film.Also Maud Adams played Bond girl in two different films, The Man With the Golden Gun and this film.Watch out for poor Q getting seduced by a bunch of females to which he replies, ""later perhaps"".",Octopussy
55,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"One of the Bond's most colorful and imaginative missions, and just avoids going over the top",7,11 April 2019,"The title alone says a lot about the 13th entry in Eon Productions' ""James Bond"" franchise. ""Octopussy"" leans into the camp and silliness that had become associated with the ""Bond"" brand in the Roger Moore era. It's one of the most colorful and inventive films in the series, brandishing a certain audacity that's as endearing as it might be eyeroll-worthy.After a clever pre-title sequence sees Bond flying a Acrostar mini jet, 007's latest mission goes into motion due to a fake Fabrege egg and the death of a fellow 00 agent. The trail leads Bond to India, a private island home to a female cult leader named Octopussy (Maud Adams) and even a circus in West Berlin.Most of the movie takes place in India, allowing the film to include a number of places and people that teeter on the line of offensive these days, but it does achieve the desired effect of imbuing ""Octopussy"" with its own flair. Compared to 1981's ""For Your Eyes Only,"" which borrowed a lot of concepts from previous ""Bond"" films and failed to stand out, ""Octopussy"" offers a lot more visually engaging material, even if both films feel obligated to formula.""Octopussy"" stretches to offer something completely different from past ""Bonds"" in the form of circus acts, elephant hunts, yo-yo buzz saws, death-defying train and plane chases and even a woman in a position of power. The movie even stoops to dressing Moore in a sad clown outfit. Regular writers Richard Maibaum and Michael G. Wilson (with George MacDonald Fraser), whether under strict orders of Albert Broccoli or of their own volition, craft the story and events in such a way that it's so obvious what parts of a ""Bond"" movie are immutable versus where fanciful, creative liberties can be taken. For example, every dashing Bond villain (Louis Jordan) needs a physically imposing or otherwise memorable henchman (Kabir Bedi)-this one has a turban and a curved sword.There is plenty to groan about in ""Octopussy,"" but it's rarely boring. Even director John Glen steps up his game in this his second ""Bond"" outing, getting tons of shots that drive home the magnitude of the stunt work and even some first-person perspective. These ""wow"" moments help to justify the simplistic motivation behind them (let's have Bond hold on to a plane in midair!"")""Octopussy"" exposes in a new way the fine line Bond has always walked between clever and cheesy, inventive and outrageous - and in this particular instance, he manages to keep his balance. That said, there's a sense upon finishing this film that there couldn't be much room left for Bond to grow given these formulaic restrictions. Moore is a fabulous Bond, but six films into his tenure (and 55 years old, to boot), perhaps his hanging on was restricting Broccoli and Wilson's vision of what else Bond could be, and that the trajectory that nearly ended cinema's greatest character by the end of this decade had already been set in motion.~Steven CThanks for reading!

And the special effects are rather cheaply done.Also, Moore was pretty old already when he started these films and it shows. He was a good actor, but being The Saint doesnt qualify him for Bond. He's just not spry.He also acts the role for humor which just isnt Bond either.So this movie is watchable but it just doesn't compare to Connery or Craig. Not in the slightest.",Octopussy
58,Anonymous_Maxine,How did they get away with that title?,7,8 November 2008,"The title for this movie is the biggest mystery to me in the entire James Bond saga. It is so tasteless and trashy that it's astonishing to me that it was ever chosen as a title. What the hell were they thinking? And to make matters worse, it seems that the reason the main villain in the movie is called ""Octopussy"" is not because she has a pet octopus but because ""Octopussy"" was the pet name that her father called her when she was a kid. Can you imagine? What kind of father would call his daughter that? No wonder she grew up to be such a well-balanced adult!It was while I was watching this movie the other day that I realized that Bond must get some kind of preferential treatment from MI6, because even now, after 23 movies, he has never been put in a position where he runs the risk of dying like one of his fellow 00 agents dies in this movie  in a clown suit clutching a fake Faberge egg (I'm assuming this doesn't happen in Quantum of Solace). Bond's investigation into the mystery behind the fake Faberge egg reveals an elaborate smuggling operation in which the Russians are counterfeiting Faberge's in order to raise the value of their currency, and also a plot to detonate a nuclear bomb in an American Air Force base and ultimately bring about world socialism peacefully or, failing that, start World War III. The movie has good action and is a lot of fun, although doesn't always make sense. At one point, for example, a woman pulls on a rope, yanking a man down off of a tall fence, and then she effortlessly catches him when he falls, as if she was catching a pillow. I didn't know Superwoman was in this movie! But on the other hand, Bond gets into a fight on the outside of a plane in mid-flight in this movie and that's just always exciting. There are a lot of cheesy sex-jokes that lack the subtle cleverness of the older films, but the movie still comes off as better than expected, if only because a title like that can surely not give you high hopes",Octopussy
59,GOWBTW,More comedic than the others I've seen!,9,15 September 2014,"After the last mission, this one has taken the turn for the silliest...in some parts. In ""Octopussy"", consider this Bond film, a ""handful"". Here, James Bond (Roger Moore) is back again. This time to avenge a ""00"", and unlock the secrets of an all-women group that deals with certain ""businesses"". It all started with a counterfeit Faberge egg found by 009, which resulted in his death by knife-wielding twins. Bond heads out to India, meets Vijay (Vijay Amritraj), along with a exiled prince named Kamal Khan (Louis Jourdan), who plays a crooked game of backgammon. After smoking him out from the auction, Bond possess the real Faberge egg, and the games really begin. The streets of India was more funny for me. Especially, the fight scenes. Like the hot foot, the tennis fight, and throwing the enemy to the bed of nails. After entering the all-women palace which housed the clever Octopussy (Maud Adams), Bond realized that he was meeting the daughter of a disgraced agent. More honored than angry, Octopussy found a partner. Rarity. Protected by her and her crew, Bond gets the upper hand. You gotta play your cards right if you want to be a success. Even ""Q"" (Desmond Llewellyn) gets his lucky charm on. Even if he didn't appreciate the ""zoom in"" made by Bond. A very good movie there. Very intriguing to say the least. The beginning of the film was just the kicker. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",Octopussy
60,generationofswine,An Honest Review,1,3 November 2020,"I don't mind Moore as Bond, he's certainly not my favorite, I'm not the biggest fan of the silliness, but he has some 007 films that would make my top 10 list and...... this is NOT one of them.In the only thing I want to write in this review is ""It is so unbelievably bad."" And not like Moonraker way to over-the-top even for a 007 film bad, but just absolutely horrible bad.And Moore was clearly a bit too old to play 007 at this point. So he kind of looked like Grandpa 007. And that doesn't work too well for stunts (ask Liam Neeson), it sort of makes it unbelievable.And then there is the plot that was a little too.... done before to be really good. It took elements from several other 007 films, strung them all together, and hoped no one would notice.And by Octopussy, the Moore era silliness was starting to wear thin, especially after films like The Spy Who Loved Me and For Your Eyes Only, that underplayed that aspect enough to make truly great installments to the franchise.",Octopussy

He fights on top of a swaying train and clings to a plunging aircraft,no doubt dreaming about his retirement package.He romances the ladies in a half - hearted way,dismantles a nuclear device with one second to spare and seems quite distressed when a circus knife thrower tears the sleeve of his blouse.

63,drqshadow-reviews,"A Transitional Chapter for the Franchise, Caught Between Two Distinct Eras",5,23 March 2019,"Roger Moore's back again, after a bit of uncertainty about reclaiming the role, for his sixth turn as the British super-agent. Following in the trajectory of the preceding For Your Eyes Only, Octopussy is far more grounded and human than some of the franchise's more eccentric entries, more focused on technique, cunning and intellect over wild risks, dated special effects and bravado. It's a suspenseful spy movie that doesn't also yearn to be a wacky, winking blockbuster. Apart from one vine-swinging jungle scene, that is, in which producers couldn't help but superimpose an embarrassing stock Tarzan scream.It's the next step in a slow transition for the Bond films, from the slapstick silliness of the '70s to the grim tone of the '80s, and as such it endures a few growing pains. The more restrained action scenes work very well - a pair of intense chase sequences atop a moving train and mid-flight aircraft, respectively, are excellent - but they're too few and far between, and the requisite story-building chapters are dull, convoluted and drawn-out. Octopussy herself has the makings of a deeply interesting character, an in-betweener with a personal connection to Bond himself, but Maud Adams is too subdued in the role and doesn't have much chemistry with Moore.I like where the franchise is headed, appreciate the motivation, but caught myself staring at the clock almost as much as the movie.",Octopussy
64,Fluke_Skywalker,Eight? I didn't even see one...,5,26 August 2021,"All you really need to know about Octopussy is that it ends with Bond disarming a nuclear bomb dressed as a clown. If you didn't know that it starred Roger Moore before, you probably do now.Octopussy is a turgid and overly long affair, with a few nifty action scenes--the best of which is the pre-credits airplane stuff--sprinkled throughout. The story is a baffling clusterfoozle that comes together with all of the grace of a drinken hippo, lead by some of the most generic and boring Bond villains of the entire series.Moore is as charming as ever, but whatever action hero credibility--if he ever had it to begin with--is long gone. The stiff and charmless Maude Adams actually works as the main Bond girl, if only because she's at least within spitting distance of Moore's age.This is a mission for only the hardest of hardcore 007 fans.",Octopussy

66,sauravjoshi85,One of my favorite Bond Movie,8,24 December 2020,"Octopussy is an action spy movie directed by John Glen and stars Late Roger Moore, Maud Adams, Late Louis Jourdan and Kabir Bedi.Personally i enjoyed this movie a lot and this is one of my favorite bond movies. The movie is really fast paced and is supported by few comic and funny scenes.Acting is great and almost all the characters impresses, screenplay is very fast paced and will keep you glued to the screen, action scenes are great but in my opinion misses that pure bond hallmark and could disappoint some viewers.One of the best bond movie and a must watch",Octopussy

However, I got enough enjoyment from the beginning and ending of it. There's one scene involving Roger Moore travelling down a banister which I found particularly entertaining.It could've been better, but I've seen worse productions from this series.",Octopussy
68,slokes,Bush League Bond,4,12 July 2010,"The 13th official entry in the James Bond series features limp characterizations, dull action sequences, and lousy puns.The puns are really lame, too. How lame? It stoops to one so bad it was mocked the first time it was used, in the worst Bond movie before ""Octopussy"", 1967's ""Casino Royale"". Q demonstrates a fountain pen that drips a corrosive acid. ""Wonderful for poison-pen letters"", Bond (Roger Moore) quips.I like Moore, I really do, so it was painful seeing a film that plays so much to the shallower side of his portrayal. For much of the movie, which involves a plot to detonate a nuke in western Germany in order to trigger World War III, he ambles about tuxedo-clad in the custody of head baddie Kamal Khan (Louis Jourdan) and his accomplice Octopussy (Maud Adams). When things get more serious, he changes into something more befitting an action hero, like a clown costume and a gorilla suit.Previous Moore Bonds played with fire mixing comedy with suspense, but usually with good results. Here the whole second half of the film degenerates into one bad gag after another. In one scene, Bond flies to the rescue in a hot-air balloon with the Union Jack on its envelope. In another, he actually fakes out a gun-toting guard by throwing up a tiger-skin rug.The supporting players are a particularly dicey bunch. Jourdan does quite well as a louche villain, and Adams looks delectable yet age-appropriate for 50-something Moore. Yet there's also Steven Berkoff's excessively hammy turn as psycho Russian Gen. Orlov, and tennis player Vijay Amritraj on the other end of the spectrum as Bond's chief contact in India, sheepishly overgrinning at Moore's fatally bad puns. Kristina Wayborn plays a girl in a sari who combines the hottitude of Ginger Rogers with the stiffness of a Ginger Snap.This could and should have been much better. It follows another John Glen-directed film, ""For Your Eyes Only"", which got the comedy and suspense for a Moore Bond just right. The Orlov subplot is daringly topical for the Bond series, suggesting a mad Russian might take advantage of the anti-nuclear protests then raging across Europe and the United States. An early scene where Bond catches out Kamal cheating in backgammon is successfully underplayed by both actors. The pre-credit sequence is one of the cooler ones in the series.*Spoilers ahead* But why does a Soviet general need to steal from his government's treasury in order to finance simple sabotage? If Orlov is a rogue operator in his own country, why does he think the U.S.S.R. would follow this sabotage with a full-scale invasion of the West? Why is Octopussy so trusting of Kamal after he clearly tries to kill a guest in her house? How do a band of scantily-clad women overpower men with automatic weapons? And then there's Bond quick costume changes already mentioned in other reviews here. *Spoilers end*It's fun to pick at this movie until you realize you are committing an even bigger goof by taking it seriously. This is a movie featuring a man who says of Octopussy that her jewelry smuggling is ""only the tip of the tentacle."" Or when a rope trick goes awry: ""Having problems keeping it up?""It's not the nadir of the Bond franchise, but ""Octopussy"" is when the series began to cough up fur. Uh, sorry. It's contagious.",Octopussy
69,I_Ailurophile,"Flawed, but unexpectedly solid",8,17 July 2021,"I last watched this a couple years ago, and at that time its faults stood out to me so prominently that it spoiled the film for me. Yet I've just given it another try, and I find myself surprised. There's no question that it has its problems, but upon reconsideration, 'Octopussy' is much better than it has any right to be.Roger Moore isn't my favorite actor to play Bond, but he's a swell performer, and committed to the role. That makes it all the more unfortunate that during his tenure as 007, the producers drastically increased the schlock and playfulness in the series. This is especially so because the narrative in 'Octopussy' is actually rock solid, and the only significant detractions are those same excesses that plague the franchise in general.The title alone - the name of the eponymous character - is a cringe-worthy indication of just how shamelessly self-indulgent Eon had turned (to say nothing of Ian Fleming). It's a red letter that mars the viewing experience before it's even begun. Add in plentiful annoying innuendo; many women, unnecessarily scantily clad; kitschy sound cues so aggravating one is compelled to yell at the screen - make no mistake, Moore's Bond films were designated a very particular and juvenile flavor.This is to say nothing of dubious treatment of a culture outside the series' primarily British-American purview, reeking of exploitation. Too many scenes and moments of the film take place in India that, beyond establishing shots, convey not a sampling of another rich culture, but a sense of othering, and gawking -""Haha! India! Just look at this place, am I right?!"" It's a rather grotesque commonality throughout the franchise; 'Octopussy' is hardly alone in this. That it also stereotypes even Germans is frankly mind-blowing, and the way the film insists on arbitrarily forcing Bond into encounters with the variety of wildlife on the subcontinent strains our disbelief, too.These characteristic problems of the 007 franchise are very notable in 'Octopussy,' and detract from it. Yet at the same time, Bond's womanizing is marginally more restrained than in other entries. Of the two women he goes to bed with - in a welcome break from the usual objectification - one is on the job working against him and up for a bit of fun, because ""why not""; the other has an actual reason to like Bond, and seems interested in developing a real relationship. The action sequences and more suspenseful moments, in an unusual move for Eon at this point, aren't particularly over the top in their construct, and silly only insofar as their context - wardrobe, setting, characters involved - deviate from the classic battles involving uniformed spies, armies, security, henchmen, etc. Even Q's gadgets are less flashy than in other Bond films.More significantly: despite details that give the plot a unique, superficially farcical flavor, overall it's actually among the better stories of the series. What appears at first to be a splintered villainy, with disparate threads of no apparent connection, gradually gels into a grand overarching plot that's more believable, and somewhat more realistic, than many of this feature's brethren. A zealous Soviet general, counterfeiters, and a smuggling ring operate in concert in a scheme with much more far-reaching ramifications. Most action sequences are relatively limited in scope, and they're minimized compared to classic cat-and-mouse contests of wit, sneaking and gathering of information, and the like.For that matter, 'Octopussy' gives us another welcome change of pace for the franchise: Fine as the costume design may be broadly, the choice to pointedly insert a large group of minimally clothed women as tertiary characters is... well, less than great. Yet in an uncommon move, these women are actually given quite a bit of agency in the narrative, and one of the best action scenes in the film falls entirely to that ensemble. For all those things this movie got wrong, it's refreshing to see something done right, bucking the expectations Eon has implanted in our minds.If there's any flaw specific to this movie alone, and not just a pattern within the series - it does feel a bit like the screenwriting energy for this picture was poured into the narrative, leaving the characters a little bereft. It's not that anyone is written poorly per se, but none of the characters are as immediately memorable or enduring as those from other Bond features. When is the last time someone in 'Octopussy' topped a list of Best Bond Anything? Similarly, the performances are all fine, but with roles so underwritten, not one actor appearing in the cast - not even recurring co-stars like Walter Gotell or Desmond Llewelyn - lights up our imagination in the way they should. In a suite of sagas renowned for popping personalities, the deficiency here is regrettable, and bizarre.And that ho-hum hue extends even to the music. ""All time high,"" the theme for 'Octopussy' performed by Rita Coolidge, isn't a bad song. But compared to any of the electrifying ballads or rockers that draw our attention in the series, this tune floats along so peacefully, without any dramatic chord to be found, that it feels middling. Even composer John Barry, whose scores were often a highlight of Eon productions, seemed to have a bit of writer's block. Again: His music isn't bad. But it's weirdly forgettable. That, above all, is the last word that should ever be used to describe an aspect of a James Bond film. Yet here we are.At length, what it comes down to is that 'Octopussy' is a mixed bag in which a strong narrative serves as the anchor. Elements that are usually high points for 007 features feel a bit lesser, while the problematic commonalities are direly striking before fading to the shadows cast by the light of the plot. It's an unsteady balance ever in danger of tipping to one side or the other, but I think the story is so well written that it manages to carry the feature through. In fact, on that strength, I would dare to say that this may actually be second only to 'For your eyes only' in ranking the best of Roger Moore's Bond films.If the franchise finds no favor in your eyes, there's little to especially change your mind here; if you're an enraptured fan, this won't dissuade you. 'Octopussy' occupies an odd space in the 007 oeuvre, but so long as you're keen above all on the tale being told, it's a worthwhile watch.",Octopussy

It doesn't go the same route as Lazenby's picture, though. It's more of a straight forward action mystery, but it does it with more style and clarity than any other Moore film.This is what Diamonds are Forever wanted to be, except that this film actually gives us a good excuse for Bond to investigate diamond smuggling while also providing an interesting series of clues that add up to an actual adventure. We start with two main actions, the killing of a clown outside of a circus in Germany where he delivers a Faberge Egg to a British official in his final moments, and a crazed Soviet general outlining his plan to send a couple dozen tank divisions into the West, confident that there would be no counterattack. The general gets dismissed angrily by General Gogol, but it's obvious that General Orlov isn't going to stop there.The death of 009, the clown, is the exact kind of hook that would send 007 into the field to investigate, and the investigation quickly takes him to India. The movie uses the colors and visual flavors of the country really well as Bond navigates backgammon games, chases with auto rickshaws, and even a hunt that includes elephants where Bond himself is the quarry. It's well filmed and exciting stuff that gets Bond one step closer each time to what he thinks is the center of the mystery, an island populated by young women and the eponymous Octopussy, a slightly older woman who runs a jewelry smuggling ring whom Bond immediately beds because he's James Bond.The mystery continues, though, because there has to be more than just jewelry smuggling and, as Octopussy points out, jewelry smuggling isn't the concern of the British secret service (a subtle dig at Diamonds are Forever, perhaps?). Bond keeps following the trail and finds that there is more, and it involves that Russian General Orlov. He's used the jewelry smuggling operation by stealing precious Russian jewels and selling them in order to buy a nuclear weapon that he will detonate at an American military base in Germany. His hope is that the explosion will look like an accident and drive the West towards denuclearization, which he'll be able to use back home as justification for a more aggressive approach towards dealing with Europe.For a movie that's talked about as inherently silly, that plot by Orlov is surprisingly grounded. It's not about neutering the human race like in Moonraker or making life unlivable on land so people will move to the sea like in The Spy Who Loved Me. It's about triggering an explosion that will create a political environment for the Soviet Union can take advantage of. It's still about bombs, spies, and chases, but the basic evil plot feels surprisingly grounded and real. I've never minded the sillier aspects of Moore's run as Bond, mostly objecting to the fact that they're poorly constructed, but this plot feels like something Connery's Bond would have dealt with.The silliness is there, though. The famous Tarzan yell is a headscratcher at best. The alligator disguise isn't really that out there, but it's definitely weird. However, in particular with the Tarzan yell, that happens at the end of a compelling chase where Bond has to escape captivity in an Indian mansion where his host is readying a hunt on his elephant and ends up chasing Bond instead. It's taught and exciting, and then there's the embarrassing visual and sound, but it's a very small part of the sequence. I don't excuse the yell, but I do note that it's a small part of a sequence that works really well in a movie that actually knows how to unfold a mystery. Oh, and it ends with one of the best stunt sequences in the franchise as Bond fights his way into a plane as its flying.Maud Adams as the titular character has an easy rapport with Bond and fits in nicely with the overall plot, running a circus that Orlov uses to get the bomb into West Germany. When she strikes back out against Khan, the man who got her unwittingly involved with Orlov, she does it from a position of strength, using what skills she has to exact her revenge. Yes, the sight of a series of circus performers descending on an Indian villa and using their skills to infiltrate and fight is a bit silly, but it still works overall.So, yeah, if the movie had held back some of its sillier elements (I guess it could have done with one less bit of Bond dressed up like a clown), I think it would have improved. There's a tonal problem when some of these things pop up, but the rest of the movie around them is really, really good. The only Bond movie under Moore that understands how to unfold a mystery and gives us a compelling antagonist. This movie is really underappreciated and is Moore's best outing.",Octopussy
75,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,One of the weakest Bonds,3,21 March 2004,"Begins fairly well: with an acrobatic, high-flying pretitle sequence, followed by a close adaptation of Ian Fleming's The Property Of A Lady short-story involving the sale of a Faberge egg at Sotheby's in London- which unfortunately goes nowhere, as Bond then ends up on in India on a small island populated by beautiful women belonging to an octopus cult, before relocated to East Berlin and disarming a nuclear bomb in a circus, in a surprisingly serious climax where Bond dresses as a clown as cover.But what's the point? Is the film just an excuse to have endless jokes and inside jokes? (does Bond really recognise his own leitmotif?) Is the film just an excuse to have a lame love story between geriatric Bond and unmemorable Octopussy? Is the film just an excuse to rip off Indiana Jones, uneffectively? Most definitely not an excuse to film stunts and action set-pieces, as the film has few memorable scenes. Although I do enjoy the surprisingly suspenseful climax where Bond dresses as a clown to avoid detection at a circus and disarm the bomb. Bond is not the joke in those scenes, he's merely trying to avoid detection and certain death in the most convenient (and best possible, at the circus) of disguises.Film seems like four or five different short screen-stories (pretitle scenes, The Property Of A Lady adaptation, India sequences, Berlin sequences) rather than a cohesive story with a subplot. Without that, and without any memorable action sequences or memorable characters, film falls apart long before its ending. That's another problem with this one: it goes on forever.This film gets my vote for being the weakest Bond film to date (from the series' beginning in 1962, up to this film's release in 1983) Despite probably featuring Roger Moore's worst turn as Bond, he almost manages to singlehandedly carry the entire film through its lethargic directing, wholly forgettable villain, and awful photography.Almost.",Octopussy
76,screenman,Moore Is less,6,19 September 2010,"It's the dog days of 007. A still-suave but clearly ageing Roger Moore brings his alter-ego Simon Templar to the Bond franchise. It's all the same stuff we've seen before. Exotic locations that - even by 1983 - were no longer exotic, lots of campy wickedness, plenty of slap-stick action. And, of course, the arch-villain never superintends the death of his super-agent nemesis, leaving it to unreliable henchmen who always flunk it. The money is still getting spent, but the recipe is wearysome on the palate.In the 1960's, Fleming's creation was fresh and daring. A generation later it had become passe. Most decent action-thrillers could not only match it in location-work and production values, but offered far more believable plots and characters.The franchise needed re-inventing. Happily, eventually, it was. But we had to wait a few years yet. This is just a decent matinée romp that's too sexually explicit for kids, but to juvenile for grown-ups.",Octopussy
77,brando647,Roger Moore's Most Underrated 007 Film,8,5 September 2015,"OCTOPUSSY, the 007 film most likely to elicit giggles from those who have no idea what it is, is Roger Moore's sixth film in the role. It is also one of the 007 films I've seen the least; I didn't finally see it in its entirety until somewhat recently. I don't know why I avoided it for so long but I suspect that it was because my limited vague knowledge of it seemed to focus on Moore in clown paint. Having returned to it now, I'm kicking myself for missing out on one of Moore's best. It's silly, over-complicated, and, sure, a cultural caricature of India but it's one of the most entertaining, ranking up there with LIVE AND LET DIE and THE SPY WHO LOVED ME. The mission begins as James Bond (Moore) is assigned investigate a peculiar case in which a fellow 00-agent is murdered in Berlin trying to deliver an immaculate counterfeit Faberge egg to the attention of the British government. Bond follows the trail to India where he meets the mysterious Octopussy (Maud Adams), a treasure smuggler and business mogul, and falls on the bad side of Kamal Khan (Louis Jourdan), an exiled Afghan prince overseeing the operation. What Bond doesn't know is that a zealous Russian general has become involved in an attempt to use Octopussy and her resources in an effort to destabilize European faith in nuclear arms and pave an easy road for the Soviet Union to swoop in an gain control of the continent.If you're anything like me, you'll find it hard to follow the general plot of OCTOPUSSY on the first couple viewings. The overall endgame is pretty clear but the whole process of how Kamal and the insane General Orlov (Steven Berkoff) go about accomplishing it seems unnecessarily complex and the inclusion of the Octopussy character feels tagged on merely so the studio could justify using the name of one of Ian Fleming's 007 short stories. Not that I'm complaining because the end result is still a fun movie. Maud Adams returns to the franchise after a minor role in THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN as Scaramanga's doomed mistress. I'm thrilled they thought to bring her back because she's one of the best 007 actresses; she's got excellent chemistry with Moore and they're closer in age, avoiding any of the weird vibes we got when Moore seduced Carole Bouquet's significantly younger Melina Havelock in FOR YOUR EYES ONLY. Adams is a strong woman and a welcome break from the usual damsel-in-distress 007 finds himself paired with on most occasions. Moore brings the usual charm to the secret agent and, despite the fact that his advanced age is becoming quickly apparent, he's still as cool as ever in the role. Louis Jourdan and Steven Berkoff are excellent villains, each of them making their characters a little larger than life. Jourdan's Kamal Khan is a slimy, yet still charismatic, criminal mastermind and pairs nicely with Berkoff's wide-eyed insane Russian patriot. I thought they were both fantastic but there was nothing unique enough to make them as memorable as many other 007 villains.Without a doubt though, one of the biggest stars of OCTOPUSSY is India itself. You can almost imagine producer Albert ""Cubby"" Broccoli waking up one morning with a revelation, ""Bond hasn't been to India yet! There's all sorts of cultural hijinks to be mined there!"" You'll see exactly what I mean as you watch the film and witness it go through an entire checklist of every cliché we would expect. At one point, Bond and his local contact Vijay (played by Indian tennis superstar Vijay Amritraj) are in a car chase of sorts through Indian city streets when it pauses for a melee with Khan's henchmen in which 007 utilizes a sword-swallower, a bed of nails, a bed of hot coals, and a torch juggler. Later in the film, 007 is being chased through the Indian jungle after narrowly escaping Khan's fortress. As he's chased by Khan and his hunters mounted on the back of elephants, we go down the checklist once again as Bond encounters a Bengal tiger, crocodiles, leeches, and tarantulas. And let's not forgot the dinner scene when Bond is served roast sheep's head in a moment that mirrors a similar, more memorable, scenario from INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM. Keep in mind the Indiana Jones sequel came out a year after this movie. An homage from Spielberg maybe? It's all done with the usual smile and a wink and leads us to an extended final act in Cold War era Berlin with some great action sequences (Bond driving a tire-less car down tracks in pursuit of a train) and the occasional eye-roll (the aforementioned sequence with Bond in full clown costume). All told, even with its cheesiness and flaws, I really like OCTOPUSSY. Anyone who's only starting to dive into the adventures of 007 should consider checking this one out. Its plot is a little scatter-brained but I think it embodies all of the best traits of a great 007 film.",Octopussy
78,Gislef,Some be-twixt and be-tween...,7,11 December 1998,"Despite the fact that its predecessor, For Your Eyes Only, was a return to the hard-edged style of Fleming that the movie series had strayed from, Octopussy tries to compromise somewhat between that style and the looser, more humorous style of the other Bond/Moore flicks.  It's an excellent effort.  There is some particularly poor humor early on:  the chase through Udaipor in particular is irritating, without a single Hindu/India stereotype left unturned.  However, once Bond gets to Octopussy's castle and then follows the trail to Berlin, the movie turns deadly serious.  Bond actually shoots people, and sneaks around like a spy probably would.  It loosens up a bit for the climax (and why _is_ Q doing field work), but overall an effective entry in the series.  They probably should have left this as Moore's last film, rather than push on to the far inferior View to a Kill.",Octopussy
79,mike48128,My least favorite Bond film,7,24 May 2017,"British agents including Roger Moore in clown make-up? How inane. It mimics and looks like it could have been filmed inside ""Circus Circus"" in Las Vegas but apparently it was not. Unintentionally funny, especially with an exaggerated ""side show"", again similar to Circus Circus. There is a cheapness about the whole production. The best part of the movie is the title theme song by John Barry. A nuclear bomb inside a circus cannon? Almost an act of terrorism, unheard of in those days. The only saving grace is two bombastic Bond Girls. People who like this entry must be watching a different movie than me. I guess a provocative title goes a long way? That's one reason that ""The Mexican"" and ""John Carter"" were ""duds"" at the box office.",Octopussy
80,cricket30,"Trains, planes, automobiles, jitneys . . .",8,21 July 2014,". . . what's not to like? How many flicks feature a Trojan crock? Who knew Roger Moore was TOP GUN before Tom Cruise? Though Navy SEALs are likely to take out serial jet-liner downer Putin any day now, OCTOPU$$Y shows what might happen to the Russian strongman first. In that respect, this film is fairly prophetic, like most James Bond adventures. When people say ""ripped from today's headlines,"" they might mean OCTOPU$$Y anticipates a 2014 Fox ""Breaking News"" bottom-of-your-screen crawl, with a story so old it's new again. OCTOPU$$Y's plot centers on a rogue Russian with a plan to achieve unilateral Western disarmament as a prelude to his own lightning attack across Civilization. About 90% of this scenario has occurred during the past decade, as today's world cowers, waiting for the other shoe to drop. To paraphrase Simon & Garfunkel, ""Hey, J.B. double oh, a fearful nation turns its hopeful eyes to you, who-who-who."" Or, to put it another way, where the heck is James Bond when we really need him? Since OCTOPU$$Y's villains have sprung to real life, it's only fair to expect a man with a plan--and a ""license to kill""--to save our day!",Octopussy
81,chris_gaskin123,James Bond goes to India,9,10 June 2005,"Octopussy was the 13th Bond movie and as part of his assignment, he goes to India. Although not Roger Moore's best Bond movie, I found it excellent.Bond is sent on an assignment to investigate the death of 009, who drops dead on arrival dressed as a clown at a function, clutching a gold egg, something to do with his death. He discovers a Russian plans to start World War Three and the mission takes him to Europe where a nuclear bomb has been planted at Octopussy's circus which is performing at an American air force base. Bond arrives, disguised as a clown and he defuses the bomb and the world is saved once again.Highlights of Octopussy include the chase involving the three wheel scooters in India, the train sequence including Bond driving a Mercedes on the railway lines and the final aeroplane sequence.The railway scenes were actually filmed in England on the Nene Valley Railway at Peterborough, which has an extensive collection of European steam loco's and coaches.Joining Roger Moore in the cast are Maud Adams as Octopussy, Louis Jourdan, Steven Berkoff, a bigger part than normal for Desmond Llewelyn as Q, tennis player Vijay Amritraj, Robert Brown as M, Lois Maxwell and Andy Bradford as Agent 009.Octopussy is a must for all Bond fans. Great stuff.Rating: 4 stars out of 5.",Octopussy
82,pyrocitor,Typical 007 silliness with a dash of intensity,8,7 April 2008,"After somewhat of a backfired attempt at returning the Bond series which had descended to rampant silliness to a coldly serious polar opposite in For Your Eyes Only, director John Glen skilfully melded a more serious and visceral tone with a return to the more light-hearted Moore touch. The result was Octopussy, which, despite its eyebrow-raising title, proves to be one of Moore's strongest outings, excelling on all the fronts which made the Bond series a skyrocketing success in the first place.When viewing Octopussy in comparison to the Bond series at a whole the light-hearted Moore touch is undeniable, but the film's moments of gritty intensity stand out as all the more surprising in contrast with the more tongue in cheek exterior - a scene with assassins chasing Bond's fellow agent through dark woods is unusually gripping and visceral. Similarly, the film's subject matter remains far more grounded in reality than the standard grandstanding villainous world domination, with Bond's foray into the world of art forgery rapidly uncovering a plot regarding secret Russian border arms dealings and Cold War terrorism, leading for some intriguing topical political ruminations. The sturdy script perfectly balances witty humour with grim seriousness, though certain moments of distinctly overdone silliness (the double-taking camel comes to mind) come across as wince-worthy and out of place in a film of otherwise such staunch quality. Visually the film excels, as the lush Indian locations and skilled cinematography make for a more varied and visually sumptuous Bond outing, well complimented by John Barry's sweeping score. Furthermore, in the contemporary age of CGI bloated blockbusters, Octopussy continues the 007 franchise tradition of being a testament to practical stunt work, with a series of superb action set pieces and chase sequences - the pre-credits plane chase is typical Moore silliness but exhilarating all the same, and later showdowns on top of a moving train, through the Indian jungle and atop a moving plane cement Octopussy as one of the most sturdily action packed Bond films. The uncommonly strong cast, full of memorable character players add to the enjoyment and overall quality of the film. Despite unquestionably starting to look his age (56, portraying a character allegedly in his late 30s), Roger Moore one more captures his typical suave 007 charm, with a touch more of an introspective undercurrent, making his incarnation of the character more interesting in the midst of the superficial silliness. As the mysterious titular character, Maud Adams proves uncommonly dignified and a surprising strong dramatic female lead for the series. Louis Jourdan is cold, smooth and quietly menacing as villainous aristocrat Kamal Khan, and Kristina Waybourn gives a rather flat performance but is typically aesthetically pleasing as his seductive assistant. Kabir Bedi fills out the requisite ""intimidating villainous sidekick"" role in a particularly chilling and effective fashion. Unfortunately, character actor Steven Berkoff toes the line of over the top hysteria in a rather dated (even at the time of the film's release) portrayal of a fanatical Russian general. However it is wonderful to see yet more charming appearances from Desmond Llewellyn, Lois Maxwell and Walter Gotell as the irrepressible gadget specialist Q, consistently flirting secretary Moneypenny and kindly, wry Russian general Gogol respectively, as well as Robert Brown's debut in the role of MI6 head M after the tragic passing of Bernard Lee. A strong script, sumptuous locations, plenty of brilliantly executed action sequences and some quality casting make Octopussy one of Moore's most consistently impressive Bond outings, for those willing to forgive the occasional eye rolling moment of out of place silliness. While not one of the most iconic Bond films, Octopussy certainly stands out as a uniformly laudable piece of work, one which merits seeing by any fans of the series or those who enjoy their action and intrigue with a healthy dose of suave wit, 007 style. -8/10",Octopussy
83,Sirus_the_Virus,"Another bond film, another unknown plot.",8,9 September 2009,"I have reviewed many James Bond films. In a lot of my reviews, i have stated that the film is missing a plot. Or the plot, to me, is a mystery. That is the case with Octopussy, a film that I think is Roger Moore's weakest. I still really liked the film, but again I didn't understand what the plot was about. well, I understand it a bit more than some of the other Bond films. i think that an egg is stolen and an agent is murdered and Bond must do something. That's all I know. There are many scenes in Octopussy that are exciting. Like the last half hour of the film is pretty cool. Where Bond is trying to find the bomb and get rid of it. Also, when he is trying to get on the jet to save Octopussy. I think Ian Fleming must have been a dirty man. We had Pussy Galore(Or Alota Vagina in Austin Powers) and now we have Octopussy. I didn't think Octopussy was a bad film at all. I just think that the plot is kind of out there. well, that is really my fault and I shouldn't be blaming the film for it. I give Octopussy a thumbs up and I think you should see it. There is plenty of excitement in it and will keep you going.Octopussy:***1/2 out of ****",Octopussy
84,Beta_Gallinger,Never really takes off and doesn't seem to know when to stop,5,16 October 2008,"""Octopussy"", the sixth James Bond movie starring Roger Moore, of seven, unfortunately turned out to be another weak one. The Bond movie franchise sadly took a great fall after ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" with ""Moonraker"", and then improved with ""For Your Eyes Only"", but not by much, in my opinion. After that came this film, which sadly turned out to be another step back for the franchise. More than once, I tried watching this, but eventually gave up, feeling I wasn't in the mood, before finally watching the whole thing. I tried to get into it, but rarely succeeded.British agent 009 is fatally wounded during an undercover mission, disguised as a clown in East Berlin, and dies with a replica of a priceless Fabergé egg in his hand! Bond is soon told about the mysterious murder, and informed that the real egg has just made it to an auction in London. This auction is where the British secret agent's mission begins, and he is to find out why 009 was murdered. He witnesses Kamal Kahn, an exiled Afghan prince, purchasing the item (though Bond has secretly switched it with the replica). His mission then takes him to India, where Kahn's palace is located. In this country, Bond meets a mysterious woman known as Octopussy who is close to Kahn, and also finds that Kahn is working with Russian General Orlov to have a nuclear device go off on an American Air Force Base, leading to World War III!This Bond film has some good parts, and I think that includes a reasonable intro, and the scene where 009 is being chased in his clown suit is definitely one that got me excited. More excitement follows after that, but unfortunately, it's only occasional excitement. There's also an occasional laugh, including some scenes involving Bond and Q (no surprise there), but not enough to make up for the lack of excitement. For the most part, I was pretty bored, and may not be able to fully explain it. I just found that it never really takes off, and lags too much. It doesn't help that the film may seem longer than it is. To me, it seemed significantly longer than probably any previous installment in the Bond movie franchise, even though it appears it's not! In other words, another problem I found with this film was that it really doesn't seem to know when to stop. Sometimes, it almost gets frustrating! Watching this movie wasn't the first time I've been bored by a James Bond film overall, but this time, it may have been just slightly worse than ever before for me! This clearly isn't the least popular film in the franchise (it appears ""Moonraker"" and Roger Moore's last outing as Bond, ""A View to a Kill"", have less appeal than this one), but there are definitely much more popular ones as well, and I can see why this isn't one of them. Moore was in some decent movies in the franchise, and I haven't forgotten the fact that he had his 81st birthday a couple days ago, so I guess this is the best time I can find to say Happy Belated. Nonetheless, while I haven't seen most films the veteran British actor has appeared in, I know ""Octopussy"" is not one of the highlights of his career.",Octopussy
85,vip_ebriega,Overlong OCTOPUSSY.,5,30 May 2008,"My Take: Ranks as one of the lesser 007 movies. A campier and more ridiculous tone doesn't help. Overlong running time doesn't either. I don't think there is such a thing as a totally tedious, poorly bad James Bond movie, but there are pretty weak efforts which pale in comparison from better, some of which great efforts. So far, Roger Moore's 2nd Bond effort THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN holds the record as the weakest 007 to date. After GOLDEN GUN, Moore proceeded with THE SPY WHO LOVED ME, ironically the best Bond film I have seen, and also proceeded better in the Bond role. That is, up until OCTOPUSSY, which was in my opinion is, next to GOLDEN GUN, was the 2nd weakest entry in the Bond film canon. Running at just 131 minutes, OCTOPUSSY still seems far too long for something that hardly makes sense, or wasn't its intentions to. The plot is simply convoluted and possibly hard to follow, and for much of the first time, the scenes where Bond courts with the women seems as dry as his Martinis. The action scenes delight as usual, with enough chases and fight scenes to make this one qualify as a Bond entry, but the overall effects makes it one of the lesser entry in the canon, certainly not the promised effort that the path of THE SPY WHO LOVED ME lead to. Still, the action scenes are pretty much the highlights of this lackluster adventure, as there are many. There are fight scenes, one where Bond goes up against assassins with yo-yo saws and the one at the near end on the wings of s flying plane. There's also a number of chase scene, either on the streets of India, or a car chase which later turns into a train chase and later a fight aboard the train. Still, the best definitely is the scene where Bond becomes game pursued by game-hunters for sport. The chase scenes here are a lot of fun, considering that they look so believable despite their unbelievability. But beyond the spectacular stunt sequences, OCTOPUSSY makes a wrong effort at a more wittier nature, and much of the fun has dried out. Comedy is an essential part in a Bond movie, and one of the best 007 movies have benefited well from the fact that it doesn't take itself too seriously and just has fun. It can be said that OCTOPUSSY is having too much fun that it almost wants to be a comedy. Scenes like Bond when faced with a tiger says ""Sit!"" or Bond swinging from treetops with vines while the Weissmuller Tarzan yell is being played are pretty fun, but it doesn't really fit the Bond category. Other than overuse of comedy, there's the plot which ranges from a theft of a Fabergé egg by evil tycoon Kamal Khan (Louis Jordan), a clan of female warriors led by Octopussy (Maud Adams) who also a part of the scheme, and an evil Soviet general (an unconvincing Steven Berkoff) to create a long-running Cold War amongst the East and West. This plot switches from one after the other very confusingly, making it quite hard for the audience to follow. Had it been more fun in tradition of the classic 007 adventures, OCTOPUSSY would have had the potential of being truly great. Instead, it only becomes but another lowlight in the Bond series. Followed by a better entry called A VIEW TO A KILL. Rating: **1/2 out of 5.",Octopussy
86,one9eighty,007 on an island populated exclusively by women? We won't see him till dawn!,5,14 August 2020,"The 13th Bond and the 6th Moore. As before John Glen directs, with George MacDonald joining the already well-established pair of Richard Maibaum and Michael G Wilson on screenwriting duties. John Barry returns to do his 9th Bind score. Rita Coolidge sings the intro song ""All Time High"" - one of only 7 intro songs that doesn't include the title of the film.This one is one of those that people know the title of but ask them what happens and very few people can remember. Let me enlighten you... this is a very cold war inspired version film, grounded more in potential reality than a superhero film where the main star is flying around space (as if). 009 is murdered while dressed as a clown, he's found holding a fake Faberge egg. When the real egg shows up in an auction, Bond swaps the real and the fake egg and then starts a bidding war with Kamal Khan, an Afghan Prince who seems determined to get the egg. After winning it, Bond follows Khan and finds out a few things about his case, importantly though that Kamal is working with a Soviet General (Orlov) who is hellbent on expanding Soviet control of Europe. Advancing in his mission, Bond meets an associate of Khan, Octopussy. She is a wealthy businesswoman and smuggler - and head of the Octopus cult. She has connections with Bond so does not kill him. Bond finds out that Khan and Orlov have been working together, Orlov supplies priceless Soviet treasures, Khan swaps it for a fake, and then smuggles it via Octopussy's circus troupe. The final plan is to detonate a warhead on an East German military base, using the circus troupe as cover. It would look like it was a leftover American bomb, and once exploded it would give the Soviets the wiggle room they need to march into Europe a little more. Bond, dressed as clown, infiltrates the base with the help of Octopussy - who by now realises she has been used and lied to. After successfully sorting out the warhead, Octopussy attempts to take revenge on Khan. It is not as easy as she though and Bond saves the day.Moore does great as Bond, following on from a more serious performance in ""For your eyes only"". The only real problem I have with him here is that he feels a little too old to be doing some of the things the audience is witnessing Bond do. The fights a little too choreographed, a few too many staged/ well filmed/ green screened moments. I love Moore as an actor, but perhaps Albert Broccoli should have been looking for a more youthful lead by now. Despite this, Moore still does well enough for now - I just feel sorry for his aching bones! Maud Adams as Octopussy does a great job, she's better as a the wealthy business woman than a threatening menace. Louis Jourdan does well as Kamal Khan, as does Steven Berkoff as General Orlov. Desmond Llewelyn and Lois Maxwell return as Q and Moneypenny, with Robert Brown coming onboard to play M, a role he would appear again in the future.This Bond films continues the more down-to-Earth theme that director John Glen managed to conjur in ""For your Eyes only"", which is both goo and bad. Good because it is more realistic, the film is wrapped up in a 70's style spy/sleuth mystery adventure using real life fear (Cold War) as a theme. It flows great with a good pace. The negatives though are that it's not that memorable outside its era - there is nothing much memorable about the film beyond the title. Maybe it is a little too authentic and could have done with a little more razzle-dazzle. There are camp and kitsch moments, all you have to do is watch Moore imitating Tarzan or dressed as a clown to see that. There are some plot holes and the whole Faberge egg thing does not strictly make much sense, acting more as a vehicle or McGuffin for the film to advance to the action. There are times where the cinematography seem a little cheap and rushed... there are also moments everything is slick and well-polished (India and Eastern Europe looks beautiful), but the I wouldn't expect the anything less then that for a Bond film, so having less quality aspects is a bit of a let-down. I often wondered if the rushed/ cheapness was down to the unofficial Kevin McClory Bond film ""Never Say Never Again"" (Starring Sean Connery) which was due to be released around the same time. With that on the horizon, perhaps things were slightly rushed and in an attempt to appeal to a wider audience a lot was rammed into ""Octopussy"".So, in conclusion... did I enjoy it? It was ""meh to okay"" on a scale of enjoyment. Is it memorable? ""meh to not really"". Would I recommend it? As a one of film with Bond in it -probably not, there are a lot better. I would only really recommend it to hardcore Bond fans who want to experience the canon through the 80's.This is family friendly enough, there isn't anything that will upset younger audiences, but likewise there is nothing that will keep them fully engrossed throughout.In terms of Bond films this is a 6 out of 10.In terms of movies in the long and illustrious history of film I would give this a 5 out of 10.",Octopussy
87,Bob-45,ENJOYABLE ACTIONER MARRED BY SILLINESS,6,3 October 2001,"Roger Moore, `the inconsequential Bond,' stars in this stylishly produced, action-packed but suspenseless Bond outing.  I loved Roger Moore as the Saint, but barely tolerated him as Bond.  Roger comes across as far too `nice'.  He'd hesitate before using his `license to kill' and wouldn't make it through his first assignment.  Solid storytelling and direction carried Moore through earlier Bonds, most notibly `The Spy Who Loved Me' and `Moonraker.'  Here, however, the story is simply not taut enough and the lapses into silliness too much to generate any suspense.  Further, too much time is spent on the "" ""romantic tryst"" between Roger Moore and Kristina Wayborn (""Magda"") and too little between Moore and Maude Adams, undermining our interest in the fate of our title character. Even John Barry's score is subpar for a Bond outing.  However, NOBODY can fault the gorgeous production design, excellent stunts and special effects.  Of special note is Kristina Wayborn's backflip off the hotel balcony, which she performed herself.  All in all, ""Octopussy"" is certainly worth a look, just don't expect any suspense or ""grit"".",Octopussy
88,DarthBill,Probably one of the better Roger Moore Bond films,7,20 August 2006,"Plot in a nutshell - Bond (Moore) meets Octopussy (Maud Adams), an entrancing beauty involved in a devastating military plot to destroy the peace. But is she the real villain? Roger Moore will probably always be remembered, or at least viewed, as the weakest of all Bond actors, due to his softer, more tongue in cheek playboy approach to playing Bond as opposed to the rougher, tougher, kick them when they're down, two-fisted manner of Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Timothy Dalton, even Pierce Brosnan, who worked so hard to blend the best of all Bonds into one. And by this point in the series, actually by ""For Your Eyes Only"", Moore was clearly getting too old for the role of Bond. But Moore had his moments, and he has some nice chemistry with Maud Adam sin her 2nd appearance as a Bond girl, and no less the title character. Film also benefits from good stunt work and one of my personal favorite Bond themes, sung by Rita Coolidge.",Octopussy

90,stamper,The only thing that works in this films advantage is the Bond formula,6,11 June 2003,"Octopussy is certainly one of the more famous' Bond films, but lately I've found that it has lost appeal to me (I used to love it when I was in my early teens). I mean, sure there are some classic scenes in this film like the one with the dice or the scene right after the introduction credits, but they just cannot make up for the flaws. First of all this film has not enough one liners from Bond. I mean there are a couple, but they are either just slightly funny or they do not work. Secondly it seems as if the director wants the audience to laugh at some facial gestures performed by Moore (the Tiger rug) which I found not funny and honestly that doesn't make the film more enjoyable. Thirdly I must have to point out that some of the tricks' in this film are simply ridiculous (the train tracks thing) and that the action scenes are not choreographed or filmed that well. It almost seems as if you were watching a Matrix like film in which the fights are sometimes in slow motion and sometimes not. Not to mention that they the camera isn't on top of things all the time. Fourthly it was my opinion that there were not enough babes' in this film and that the love' scenes between Octopussy and Bond were a bit wooden. Last and least I have to say that I found the beginning before the intro to be only mediocre (they should have made the scene after the intro the one before the intro). Concluding, I have to say that this is a Bond film, that has more flaws than the average Bond film, but since it uses the same formula it is still able to push itself beyond mediocrity.

91,eminkl,"I like where the franchise is headed, appreciate the motivation, but caught myself staring at the clock almost as much as the movie",5,17 April 2020,"Roger Moore's back again, after a bit of uncertainty about reclaiming the role, for his sixth turn as the British super-agent. Following in the trajectory of the preceding For Your Eyes Only, Octopussy is far more grounded and human than some of the franchise's more eccentric entries, more focused on technique, cunning and intellect over wild risks, dated special effects and bravado. It's a suspenseful spy movie that doesn't also yearn to be a wacky, winking blockbuster. Apart from one vine-swinging jungle scene, that is, in which producers couldn't help but superimpose an embarrassing stock Tarzan scream. It's the next step in a slow transition for the Bond films, from the slapstick silliness of the '70s to the grim tone of the '80s, and as such it endures a few growing pains. The more restrained action scenes work very well - a pair of intense chase sequences atop a moving train and mid-flight aircraft, respectively, are excellent - but they're too few and far between, and the requisite story-building chapters are dull, convoluted and drawn-out. Octopussy herself has the makings of a deeply interesting character, an in-betweener with a personal connection to Bond himself, but Maud Adams is too subdued in the role and doesn't have much chemistry with Moore.

98,timdalton007,"An ""All Time High""? Not So Much...",5,31 January 2012,"With the success of For Your Eyes Only, James Bond entered the 1980s successfully. That success however was soon threatened when Thunderball producer (and rights holder) Kevin McClory having not only gotten his own rival Bond film project, Never Say Never Again, off the ground but convinced Sean Connery to return as Bond as well. 1983 was soon dubbed ""the battle of the Bonds"" as Roger Moore and Connery's films were released just months apart. Coming out first was Moore's, the official Bond film Octopussy. So how did Octopussy stand up in the battle of the Bonds? Is it the ""All Time High"" that the title song alludes to? Let's start by looking at Roger Moore, shall we?Having proved in For Your Eyes Only that he was more than capable of handling a more serious Bond, one might have expected Octopussy to have followed the same course. Unfortunately that was not to be the case. The Bond of this film is a direct continuation of the one seen in Moonraker: throwing out many not particularly good one liners left, right and center while being questionable with it comes to being realistic in the action department. Moore's age also began to show in this film as well, emphasized both in close ups and the almost laughable coupling of a fifty something Moore with a much younger Kristina Wayborn as Magda at one point. While Moore's best moments in the film are in its few serious moments during its forty-five minutes to an hour, his performance overall tries too hard to emphasis the not very well written humor with both the performance and the film suffering as a result.Working out somewhat better is Octopussy played by Maud Adams. Hearkening back to Dr No two decades earlier, she is a title character who only arrives in the film a good deal of the way into it. Having been one of the better things about The Man With The Golden Gun, Adams proves to be much the same here. She shares some excellent chemistry with Moore and manages to give some depth to an admittedly two dimensional character on the page. All told, she might well be the best character in the entire film.Rounding out the main cast are its villains: mainly Louis Jourdan as Prince Kamal Khan and Steven Berkoff as Soviet General Orlov. Khan is the one who gets the majority of the screen time while Orlov is the one who is really behind the plot. Neither of whom are exactly the best Bond villains by any means though. Jourdan tries really hard to pull off the elegant but sinister villain but with no success. Berkoff on the other goes for the over the top and as a result is more laughable then menacing. The most menacing of the villains is in fact the henchman, Gobinda played by Kabir Bedi, who is little more than an Indian take on the Oddjob character (though as least Gobinda speaks). The villain's therefore are just a bit of a disappointment as a result.The supporting cast is rather mixed. Kristina Wayborn as Magda is good but her lack of chemistry with Moore (and a distinct age gap hurts her performance while Vijay Amritraj gives a good performance for what is effectively a cameo turned into a supporting character. There's a new M in the form of Robert Brown but there's no sense of occasion given to his arrival and Brown pales in comparison to Bernard Lee. There's also the matter of Moneypenny's would be replacement who is given a good introduction, but is destined never to be seen again. The results are mixed to say the least.In fact, the word mixed describes the film as a whole. Octopussy is a film that can't decide what it wants to be. Plot wise, it feels like a semi-Cold War thriller in the style set by For Your Eyes Only. It also draws on Ian Fleming's short stories as well, something else keeping in line with For Your Eyes Only. Don't let that fool you, though. Because Octopussy has that campiness that can only be found in the Moore era and that is the film's greatest fault. There are all sorts of bad puns going on throughout from the teaser sequence (which ironically ends on one of the better one liners in the film) to the over the top Tuk-Tuk chase which is followed by a fight in a market that feels lifted from Indiana Jones to every last one liner that Moore spits out in the two hours and ten minutes or so it takes for the film to run. I suspect that Octopussy is a love it or hate it kind of Bond film: if you're a Moore fan, you'll love it while those you aren't will probably loathe it.Where does Octopussy stand both as a Bond film and against Never Say Never Again in the ""battle of the Bonds""? With its mixed cast across the board, the film certainly can't be called one of the better cast Bond films. In all other regards, it is mixed as well as it can't figure out what its tone should be: the semi-Cold War thriller or follow in the tradition of campier Bond films. Against Never Say Never Again, Octopussy is definitely the loser and it seems weird that the rival Bond film should feel more like a proper Bond film even though it lacks all the official trappings of one. Octopussy's legacy is a mixed one then and not an ""All Time High"" by any means.",Octopussy

100,Bogmeister,"BOND#13: Tigers and Elephants and Clowns, oh my",7,15 July 2007,"MASTER PLAN: detonate a nuclear bomb at a U.S.Air Force Base, as part of a radical Soviet agenda. This 6th Bonder with Moore has a couple of similarities to the previous ""For Your Eyes Only,"" suggesting a 'been there, done that' tone throughout. There are no really memorable villains or set-pieces, but it does progress at a fairly good clip while you're watching, even if it does bog down in a few spots during the middle half. The teaser exemplifies those thrilling pre-credits sequences which have really nothing to do with the rest of the film. Yet, even the filmmakers seem to acknowledge Moore's advancing years here, since he needs help from a female agent and utilizes another mini-flier gadget to successfully deliver a knockout explosion. It goes along fine until the very end of the teaser, when Moore grins like a, eh, clown, and there's a freeze-frame; these later Bonders with Moore always tended to throw in this foolish smirking to offset the straight action, for some damnable reason (see also the reference to Tarzan and other examples below). The song over the credits is by Rita Coolidge, a rather tepid piece (of course, it's not named Octopussy, which might have been interesting). Moore here appears to be in a similar position to Connery when he was in his final official Bonder ""Diamonds Are Forever"" - obviously past his prime, but not quite ready to call it quits (Connery did return for the non-canon ""Never Say Never Again"" this same year). This also has the first interpretation by actor Brown of M, quite similar to Bernard Lee's from most of the previous Bonders, though Lee was, again, more memorable. Moneypenny appears briefly with a new assistant, Ms.Smallbone; she was probably meant to replace Moneypenny in the future, but this didn't pan out. Q has more screen time, as is usual with these later Bonders, even becoming actively involved in the action at one point, though it's presented as a joke.Bond's mission involves smuggling and those famous Faberge Eggs from the Russian aristocracy of a past century. He actually takes over a mission from agent 009, who is killed early in the story. The first half of the mission takes him to New Delhi and the strongly-exotic Indian locations. The main femme fatale of the title doesn't appear until an hour into the story, played by Adams of ""The Man With the Golden Gun"" fame. She makes a good fit for the seasoned Bond, but, as with everything else, the filmmakers seemed unable to come up with new twists, including actresses. There's a central action piece where Bond is the object of a hunt and encounters virtually every deadly animal in the region within the span of a few minutes, an expansion of the usual 'deadly animal' scene. But, it comes across as a gimmick and not as an exciting chase, with an inappropriate Tarzan yell to further ridicule the whole concept. A lot of the action also involves a circus, knife throwing by a couple of deadly twins, and an island of women (hoo-hah, just what Bond needs). The smuggling conspiracy is revealed as just a sideline to a crazed Soviet General's plot to expand Soviet control far beyond East Berlin - ah, yes, still the good old days of the Cold War (and some over-acting by actor Berkoff). As the main villain, veteran star Jourdan is suitably classy yet slimy, but somewhat over-the-hill (like Bond), and reminds me of his similar villain in the campy ""Swamp Thing""(82). Bedi, as his brawny henchman, does better, with an imposing presence. These two have their best moment when Jourdan orders Bedi to go get Bond outside an airplane. Moore, in his mid-fifties then, still did OK with the tough-guy stuff, but his scenes with thirtyish ladies were a tough sell. The final chasing in Berlin and in the circus is suspenseful, undone a bit when Bond dresses up as a clown; then, the final aerial combat is pretty exciting, but it all ends on another groan-inducing wink from Bond on a boat.

She would be crushed with severe injuries if she tried that.In another scene, instead of stopping and commandeering a car... Bond rather chooses to hitchhike by putting his thumb in the air (fully knowing that in just a little while, an atomic bomb will explode). That's completely unrealistic and no doubt done purely for comedic effect... the problem is that: Millions of peoples' lives are at stake, so why on earth would the director choose that exact moment to insert some comedy into the movie? (And in the process, waste a large amount of in-movie time by having the character hitchhike).I could go on by describing the other plot-holes in the movie, but most people have stopped reading already, so I'll just rather spare my fingers.Overall it's an OK movie, but jeeze the plot-holes were completely avoidable.",Octopussy

103,Rickting,*Groan*,4,11 October 2015,"Octopussy is another Roger Moore Bond dud. Octopussy is about James Bond, following the death of a fellow agent, trying to stop another deadly plot which could start World War III. Widely regarded as one of the lesser Bond films, Octopussy is without a doubt a 2 star Bond movie. It's far from an unwatchable film. A James Bond film always carries an irresistible sense of escapism and this is no different. The location shooting in India is great and there are undeniably a few electrifying set pieces. A set piece on a train is a particular highlight and the film also features more screen time for Q. The theme song is OK. If you're in the right mood you may quite enjoy it and the plot is moderately interesting. It's also refreshing to see a Cold Ware thriller again, but that's part of the problem. Octopussy is an anachronism and can't decide what it wants to be. It has traces of Ian Fleming, with Roger Moore showing grit and the plot involving the Cold War, but it still goes for Moonraker level silliness. Bond dons a gorilla suit, a clown suit and does a Tarzan yell. With its cringe worthy humour and stupidity, these 2 sides of the film don't fit together at all.As for Roger Moore, he's looking far too old for Bond by now. The 2 Bond Girls in the film are both played by terrible actresses while the villain will be forgotten quickly. His henchman, who is a Bond cliché on legs, is wasted and not used enough. It doesn't even feel like a Bond film much of the time and undoes all of the good work done by For Your Eyes Only although the next film, A View to a Kill, undoes it even more. Is this a good film in the end? No. It's a flatly executed affair although still watchable. I don't hate Octopussy as it is fun at times, but it just feels anachronistic and it's clear the filmmakers yearn for the past but can't resist throwing in the stupidity that defines the Roger Moore era. The 6th worst Bond film overall, though probably one of the most enjoyable out of worst Bond films. If you don't notice its flaws too much it'll be a perfectly harmless and acceptable action film which still has those escapist thrills.4/10",Octopussy
104,grendelkhan,"Series is showing its age, but still entertains.",7,29 November 2012,"Octopussy has a lot working against it. The story is hardly the best and it is a bit disjointed, comedy gets way out of hand, at the worst moments; and, Roger Moore is really showing his age. Still, somehow it's still a pretty entertaining movie.Octopussy has a rather convoluted plot, revolving around an auction, jewel heist, Soviet corruption and aggression, old scores, and the murder of another 00 operative. In fact, it has a little too much going on, which is what gives it that disjointed feel. However, it does have India for the exotic locales and a pretty good cast. Maud Adams returns, though she really doesn't add much more than beauty to the situation. Kristina Wayborn is far more lively and steels all of the scenes she is in. Her escape out of Bond's window is one of the most memorable and sexiest scenes in the series.Louis Jordan is suave and calculating, making for an excellent villain. Stephen Berkoff is once again chewing up scenery as a Soviet general, much like his turn in Rambo. He was far better in Beverly Hills Cop, when playing this area. Vijay Armitraij is OK, for what he is required to do, but he should have stuck to tennis. Kabir Bedi, on the other hand, is great, with almost no lines. he is delightfully menacing and has tremendous charisma. Having previously seen him in the failed TV pilot, Archer: Fugitive of the Empire, I was delighted to be reacquainted. He could have been a great Bond villain in his own right, not just the henchmen.The silliness gets way out of hand in the stuntwork, which is rather a shame after the more realistic turn in For Your Eyes Only. The taxi chase, though exciting, is overloaded with gags. The same is true of Bond's escape from Khan's palace, complete with Barbara Woodhouse and Tarzan impressions. If it weren't for the exciting train and plane stunts, this film would end up even more corny than Diamonds are Forever. They, and the palace assault at the end, as well as a few moments of real suspense (like the bomb at the circus and the cat-and-mouse game on the train) help to elevate the film out of farce.So, don't expect much intrigue when you watch this one but if you want something light, this will more than satisfy.

The plot leads to a mad Soviet general bent on starting World War III.This movie started off pretty strange, and I'm not going to give away too much but the movie opens up with a clown getting chase in the Forrest by some hit men. Is that how you open a James Bond movie, a clown getting chase and then killed?.Octopussy in my opinion is way better than For your eyes only, because this movie at least has a better and more remember-able villain and the movie knows what it is and just goes for it. The action scenes were excellent and fun to watch. The visual effect's to me were just mind blowing, because they is a scene where Bond is hanging on for dear life when he's trying to stop the bad guys in a plane, but the bad guys are spinning the plane around trying to knock him off, and that scene felt so real even my hands got a bit sweating during that scene.Now my only problems with the movie is it's annoying puns and it's WTF moments. If you hate or can't stand it when the character's in movies make unfunny puns then Octopussy isn't the movie for you, because this movie filled with puns like ""That's handle"" or ""There she blows"". The movie has a lot of strange, goofy and weird moments that I keep saying to myself ""WTF?"" Like James Bond dressed up like a clown to blend in with the circus, and yes I'm saying that right. James Bond is the man who made other men jealous, he also is the man who slept with thousand of women, who saved many lives in his days, and now his dress up like a clown... how edger.Overall Octopussy is a fun 80's action flick that was way better than For your eyes only, but it does reach the same level as the other good Bond films.",Octopussy
110,Ali_John_Catterall,Hiss off,1,19 November 2009,"Coming in at unlucky number 13 in the James Bond series, Octopussy is at the scrag end of Roger Moore's incarnation, when it had begun to look like 007 might require liver tablets just to make it out of bed in the morning. Among other embarrassments, it features Moore disguised as a circus clown, sliding down a banister like Inspector Clouseau and informing an Indian accomplice as he hands him a wad of winnings, ""That should keep you in curry for a few weeks."" There's the issue of that awful title too, though admittedly that was Fleming's doing. One to pass quickly over.",Octopussy
111,dfle3,Perhaps the best plot of any Bond movie...8/10,8,19 August 2010,"13th of 23 Bond movies.Having seen most of my Bond movies on VHS years ago, I was under the impression that it was maybe ""Octopussy"" and ""A view to a kill"" which I found terminally boring...did seem to remember falling asleep to at least one of them and not seeing how the film ended. Am glad to report that ""Octopussy"" is a superior Bond movie, having rewatched it recently as part of a Bond movie festival on free to air TV here in Australia. Whereas I found ""For your eyes only"" an exhilarating introduction to the franchise as a child, ""Octopussy"" is more serious, plot wise...perhaps best suited to an adult palate.The major drawback to this film is its length...it's overlong. Notwithstanding this, the movie has a lot of laughs in it. There are some absurd scenarios, but this is a Bond movie after all...what did you expect? The plot actually makes sense too and there is a lot of tension throughout the movie. This might be the first Bond movie where you can say this. Sure, Bond movies have lots of world endangering scenarios, but gee, tension? Hmm...dunno about that. This tension is a major plus for the film.Franchise clichés: Exotic locations: East Berlin, U.S.S.R, India.Plot: Fabergé eggs are being forged (i.e. highly expensive decorative jewelry). The Soviets are presumed to be the culprits with the intent being to finance their covert operations or to pay off corrupt officials elsewhere. Super spy James Bond is brought into the case after 009 is killed working on this case.Inside the Soviet Union, the 'dove' - General Gogol - is shown to be battling for influence with the 'hawk' - General Orlov. Their superior bares a resemblance to a former Soviet leader, I think. Anyway, Orlov wants to extend the Soviet Union's territory and not give away their supremacy in tank numbers in West Germany to the US and West. So, a very Cold War scenario playing out here.Pre-title sequence: Gun barrel sequence followed by Bond impersonating a Spanish military leader...with a Fidel Castro like leader seen making speeches. Roger Moore impersonating a Spanish man is far more convincing than Sean Connery impersonating a Japanese man! Theme song:One of the great Bond songs, by Rita Coolidge. The accompanying visuals are suggestive and nice...a throwback to the Connery sequences.Q: A low point in his relationship with Bond...open hostility towards him. Genuinely unpleasant.Silly female character names: Ms. Penelope Smallbone; 'Octopussy'Sexism/misogyny: some boyish leering by Bond here.Wine snobbery: sort of related...M is yet to stump Bond on any matter whatsoever...he asks him about Fabergé eggs and - sure as death and taxes - Bond gives him the good oil on the subject. Bond is the Huggy Bear of the spy game! End teaser: ""From a view to a kill"". First time the title in the end teaser is different to the eventual title...the next movie was released as ""A view to a kill"".Things to watch out for: * Self-referential...an Indian character plays the Bond theme on his musical instrument. Haven't seen something like that since the greatest Bond movie of them all...""On her majesty's secret service"".* The first ""00"" to get a credit at the end in a Bond movie (apart from Bond, of course)...in this case it's ""009"".* The Chairman of the sitting (with Gogol and Orlov) sounds very Churchillian! That's the Soviet leader, I presume. Gogol is making another appearance in a Bond movie...perhaps his 3rd? * Khan's henchman reminding us of ""Oddjob"" in Connery's ""Goldfinger"".* Octopussy mentions Major Dexter-Smythe and how Bond arrested him. The major was her father. Not sure if this factoid was mentioned in a previous Bond novel...it sort of seemed like we were expected to know this link.* Kamal looking like one of The Beatles when with Octopussy! * A really silly Tarzan call...movie could have done without that.* Bond on an aeroplane...hmm...* note to self...look up phrase ""Diese Englander. Die sind ganz verruckt"".actor Vijay Amritraj...familiar name...look up.",Octopussy
112,willcundallreview,Fun Bond adventure with an ageing agent,6,14 April 2014,"Rating-6/10Octopussy is a Bond movie that people seem to dislike, but hey this is a film and is some good old fun, with a big adventure and more down to basics Bond movie, Moore exudes delight and humour and makes this Bond movie hugely enjoyable, not the best but enjoyable in any case. The film does have it's more dull moments and some people believe it demeans Moore's portrayal of Bond by making him do silly things, just watch it and see what you personally think, I found it to be solidly a OK movie.The story is slower than maybe others and revolves around one location, nevertheless the film has plenty of what we want to see with some great fight sequences and to say Moore was 55 at the time, they seem more believable than many other Bond films. I liked the fact Bond went back to being a good old agent and even got his hands dirty to get out of trouble, this for me is what being a special agent is all about, bar the crazy costumes and stunts. With fun characters too what isn't to enjoy about this movie, definitely a solid story I felt.Moore works hard to churn out this movie and although he is getting much older, he does well to guide Bond through a movie that to be fair is kind of rigid but nevertheless gives us entertainment. I didn't so much like the villain who I felt lacked the quintessential things Bond movie villains have, he isn't actually that evil and seems to want to keep Bond alive more than finish him making for a weaker point of the story. I liked the cameo by Indian tennis pro Vijay Amitraj who's character was fun and always smiling even In dark situations, although the most cheesy part about him is when any reference to tennis is brought up, which happens to happen a lot.John Glen directs OK and although again this isn't his strongest Bond movie, he still brings himself to make it just like the other Moore movies(whether or not that is good, you decide). I particularly enjoyed the stunts and chases with one of the first Bond movie to have big stunts on a very large if not crazy scale, yes we have had super villains but in this we have such things as a car on rail tracks, oh the fun of the Moore chapter of Bond.The film of course has things wrong with it, the cheesy sounds Bond makes(you will see), the demeaning outfits(you will also see) and the crazy sense that Bond isn't bothered with the mission ahead. Yes Bond does act like he really doesn't care a lot and his over use of calmness in a bad situation severely affects him, especially when in action scenes where it seems that no one is shooting at him he is that calm. Overall there are things you could pick at for hours but just try to enjoy it and you should, forget about absurdities for a while.Again Bond fans should enjoy it with it's quirky sense of humour and Moore doing what he usually does, I find fans not of Moore's may dislike this more than many or any of his others as this is the typical Moore we see and he doesn't always take his personality without taking the Mick a little. Those who like good fun and funny adventure should love this, quite long if you do because it could be said it stretches too much but I didn't feel it did, well not as bad as people say it does.Overall 6/10 meaning a Solidly OK movie, closer to being good from me but I know 100% people will differ with there views. I feel most may have mixed feelings on this and some may hate it, it is all a personal view, and what film ever has everyone who saw it loving it and wanting to see more of it. Watch without thinking so much of it and it is highly enjoyable, watch it rationally thinking about film and comes crumbling down, don't take Moore so seriously guys.",Octopussy
113,majikstl,"""A sweet distraction for an hour or two""",6,15 November 2006,"You don't review James Bond movies, you evaluate them, rate them according to how well they meet expectations. There are certain things one has come to expect, even demand of a Bond film and each individual effort either delivers or it doesn't. So, here are ten elements that make a Bond film a Bond film and how OCTOPUSSY rates on a scale of 1 to 10: Title: OCTOPUSSY: I guess this is suppose to be strangely erotic, in a smutty sort of way, but the title is explained innocently enough by the film's femme fatale. Seems it is the nickname her father gave her as a child, because he was a student of octopi. Yeah, right. Whatever. Either way, it's kinda creepy: Daddy must have been very strange. No wonder she turned to a life of crime. 3 points. Pre-Credit Teaser: An elaborate action sequence involving Bond in a mini-jet and a couple of heat seeking missiles in some Latin American country: It is certainly neatly done, but generic and totally irrelevant to all that follows. 8 points Opening Credits: Pornographic ice skating and a pistol that shoots out spinning women seem more like desperation than imagination and Maurice Binder's taste in female models now seems to be less inspired by Playboy and more inspired by Penthouse. Silly and trashy at the same time. 5 points.Theme Song: It is amazing how one ill-conceived lyric can derail an entire song. A casually sexy song about seeking ""a sweet distraction for an hour or two,"" comes to a screeching halt with a cheesy chorus about being ""on an all time high,"" which brings up dopey images in more ways than one. Why lyricist Tim Rice thought this was appropriate for a Bond adventure is a mystery, as to why the series producers didn't veto is not immediately obvious. Nice music, bad imagery. 4 points.""Bond, James Bond"": During the course of the film, Roger Moore is disguised as a Latin American military officer, a businessman, a Russian knife thrower, an ape and a sad circus clown. Oddly enough, he is most convincing as the clown. 5 points.Bond Babes: Maude Adams, whose memorable, albeit fatally brief appearance in THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN was one of the better things about that Bond adventure, is given considerably more to do here as the Babe du jour / faux villainess. Unfortunately, beyond looking great and being the only Bond Babe whose moniker is also the film's title, there isn't much of interest about Octopussy. As a criminal mastermind, one would expect her to be more than set decoration. 6 points.Bond Villain: We're given yet another crazed general (Russian, this time) who wants to push the world toward WWIII in the hopes of getting his side to make a move toward world domination. Not a particularly original idea; crazed power-mad generals of either persuasion are pretty much a dime a dozen. He is given assistance by one-time suave leading man Louis Jourdan as Kamal Kahn, who has sinister plans of his own. Jourdan's charm, a saving grace in many of his younger performances, is on a low burner here and other than playing a ""most dangerous game"" of safari with Bond, fails to make much of an impression. He was a lot more fun as the villain in SWAMP THING. 5 points.Bond Baddies: David and Tony Meyer as identical twin Russian circus knife throwers are a novel twist here, though being practically mute they don't have much personality. They're no Mr. Kidd and Mr. Wint. Steven Berkoff's kooky commie general and Kabir Bedi as Kamal Kahn's mystical henchman are clichés. 6 points.Sinister Plot: The elaborate plot involving priceless Soviet jewels being stolen to finance a plot to blow up a US army base is a bit hard to follow, but it does get Bond traveling around Europe. Make what you will of a cold war thriller where everything leads to a circus full of clowns. 6 points.Production values: The usual slick chases and clever stunts dominate and there's nothing particularly wrong with any of it. Yet, the film is strangely without distinction. 6 points.Bonus Points: Kudos for casting Indian tennis champ Vijay Amritraj, as Bond's ill-fated cohort, but, gee, wouldn't it be nice if just once one of these sidekicks actually survived to the end of the movie. And having Q helping out on the mission is a nice touch, though his arrival via hot air balloon is odd, to say the least. 7 points.Summary: The circus twist alone makes the film worth a look, but appearances seems to be the film's main asset. As slick and professionally done as any other Bond film, the feeling of it being the same-old-same-old is inescapable. The magic just isn't there.Bond-o-meter Rating: 61 points out of 100.",Octopussy
114,michaelarmer,Octoshaggy,6,30 March 2020,"This is a bit of an improvement on the last, better film quality, better photography, better music, but the title song was a bit drab. Scenery was better also, however there were still problems, many locations that were supposed to be ""an unspecified South American country"" like Argentina, East Germany and India were actually filmed in England & USA, particularly the railway scenes which were filmed at the Nene Valley Railway nr Peterborough and looked it, not like where it was supposed to be, so looked fake. India and some shots in and around Berlin were used authentically in other scenes so at least they looked good.Roger Moore was ok as Bond, with Stephen Berkoff (fine English actor) playing General Orlov, he's ok, but does not look Russian. Maud Adams returns with a different character and does not get killed this time, Kamal Khan played by French actor Louis Jourdan acts & looks ok, but only a slight Indian look! The former tennis player, Vijay Amritraj being Indian, pops up as an Indian aide to Bond and he does ok, except for the several quips about Tennis which slightly avert from the story. Water Gotell plays KGB boss Gogol again. We have a new 'M' played by Robert Brown, not as good as the late Bernard Lee though. And a replacement for Moneypenny appears, Penelope Smallbone played by the very pretty Michaela Clavell, but she is not continued with in the next film. Q (Desmond Llewelyn) gets more screen time.Bond Themes :- most are here, a Belly Dancer returns, Train scenes, a Helicopter, several Gadgets, but no fancy cars, no Spectre, no Felix Leiter, MI6 crew, a Festival and the KGB. Henchmen: - the main one is Gobinda played by Kabir Bedi, at least he is Indian, the two twins Mischka & Grischka played by David & Tony Meyer, English supposed to be Germans! And some guy with a Buzz Saw.
Bond Girls:- Just 3 in this, first is Bianca (no.38) played by Tina Hudson in the intro, she's the best looking (its inferred he had already had her). The first of 2 main ones is Magda (no.39 Kristina Wayborn - Sweden) despite her winning Miss Sweden she is a bit odd looking and not the most beautiful, and the other main one is Octopussy (no.40) played by a returning Maud Adams, but a new character so she gets shagged in 2 films by Bond, the only other to do that was Eunice Gayson as Sylvia Trench in the first 2. Another notable was Swedish model Mary Stavin (they loaded up on Swedes for this film) who was one of the most beautiful in the film but only played an extra role as one of Octopussy's girls, they missed a trick there I think, they should of swapped her with Kristina Wayborn.Another thing, there was a racist joke by Bond referring to Curries, not funny.
It might have been an improvement on the last but still a long way from the best, with fake locations, characters being played by other nationalities and daft scenes, like the 'Tarzan' scene swinging through the jungle! A lot to think about.This film was produced by a rival to the official franchise, with the intention to compete with Octopussy of the same year, and although Octopussy made more money, this was actually the better film, well to me anyway.",Octopussy

116,malkane316,Quick reviews!!,7,15 February 2005,"A bit of a downer after Moore's previous outing, mainly because there is not much action. However, it is interesting in at least 3 ways. 1- the title. 2. Maud Adams as the title character has her second part in the series. 3. Q joins Bond on the job for the first time. There are good moments, but the lack of any truly charismatic bad guy means it will be forgotten faster than others. Perhaps hence the title? Bond unravels a plot to start WWIII involving A Russian, an Indian, and the mysterious Octopussy. A fellow Agent is killed, leading Bond to this conclusion, but he is uncertain of whether to trust Octopussy as she has her own agenda. points for the complex plot, and for the knife throwing twins, but the rest of the film doesn't really sparkle. Some of the stunts are good, the cast do well but there is simply something lacking. Q's part is good here, lifting the film, but we sense perhaps the Britain vs Russia thing is getting a little tired, and that Bond is travelling the globe for the sake of it. Wayborn is good though, and the song is OK. It is Octopussy who steals the show, a genuine move towards making more strong female characters, and she is never outwitted by Bond. Oh yeah, that spinning disk is one of the best weapons in the series, and everyone should get one for Christmas.6.5 out of 10",Octopussy

119,mnpollio,Moore starting to show his age in the role,6,29 March 2007,"After a surprisingly adult and successful entry in For Your Eyes Only, the Bond series gets afflicted again with a case of the stupids. Octopussy is more in the range of The Man With the Golden Gun and Moonraker, but is ultimately lifted from their hole by slick, fast-paced direction.Bond: Moore is really starting to show his age in this film and the character often appears pallid and weak. At one point Bond is reduced to dressing up as a sad-faced clown and swinging through the tree on vines giving a Tarzan yell. There is almost no edge to the role, which is a surprise since Moore seemed to be capturing an edge in the prior film. The villains: A typical hodge-podge of instantly forgettable psychos and greedy megalomaniacs, played by the tired Louis Jourdan, Steven Berkoff and Kabir Bedi.The women: Maud Adams makes her second underwhelming appearance as a Bond woman. This time she is the title character and heads a harem of female assassins/thieves/circus performers. Considering the film is titled after her, she is one of the more forgettable Bond women and seems ultimately inconsequential to any of the action.The plot is a mish-mash that only just hangs together. The film cannot seem to decide whether Octopussy and her colleagues are obstacles or allies to the leading man, or what their motivation/roles are in the central plot conceived by the deranged Berkoff and arrogant Jourdan. None of the action scenes really stand out, but the film is pleasant and fast-paced, so it seems strange to quibble too much. Rita Coolidge's title song tries to ape Carly Simon's earlier effort, but is a disaster.",Octopussy
120,EvanKevelson,Moore's 6 definitely not close to Connery's 6,2,27 February 2021,"Moore 55 going on 62.
Personally when I rate a Bond Film I rate it only in the context of all Bond Films. These aren't deep message films they are action films based on a covert MI-6 agent whose missions are to infiltrate, gather Intel and kill when necessary. The Rating also has to be looked at From a historical perspective not only factually but sociological norms of that particular era or decade.
So if I see a review that depicts Bond as racist (not any black characters) or Bond being a sick misogynistic animal... I know the reviewer is ignorant of what audiences where pleased by between 1962-1997 etc... They also are just as fanatic in liberal ideology as a religious conservative fanatic. These films aren't political statements, and until the mid 80s wouldn't be ""date films"". They're mostly rated PG for a reason.
Roger Moore brought a new era of what I refer to as the Adam West Campy Bond targeted for 9-12 year old boys.
Criticizing Bond on a ""morality"" basis is the same as criticizing looney tunes for excessive violence. It's moronic.
The storyline and script were horrendous. The villain cartoonish, both the Russian and Indian not outlandish simply Cartoonish. Never re-utilize an actress (who was Bond's conquest in the Man With The Golden Gun). Roger Moore (on principle I can't refer to him as Bond anymore) doesn't infiltrate the circus but Sir Roger and Broccoli have made a 007 circus movie from Jewels to Clowns to another Nuke being disarmed in the final moments(Goldfinger, The Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker and now). This film in itself was a Nuclear bomb. I honestly don't understand any praise or 5 and over for any Roger Moore Bond film after 1977.
Watching Daniel Craig films and the cracks about his age at least he looks good and is in better shape than most men bt 20-45, yet Moore looks like he can use a transfer to a desk job and he's running all over the place.",Octopussy
121,Thrashman88,Octo-messy,6,20 September 2014,"According to my memory, OCTOPUSSY was a step up in action compared to 007's last installment, FOR YOUR EYES ONLY. I must've been under the influence of bad food or something (I was too young to drink!). FOR YOUR EYES ONLY has aged many times better than this episode of James Bond. Again, it's a ""Cold War Era"" movie, where the Russians are basically the bad guys and NATO and the allied west are the good guys. This time, a freaky old Russian General wants to detonate a nuclear device in the allied-supervised area of Berlin, making it look like a U.S. accident and thus accelerating nuclear disarmament of the west. While the story looks nice on paper, OCTUPUSSY is constantly being derailed with useless subplots and campy action sequences. While mildly entertaining, the ""camp"" element is more prominent here than in FOR YOUR EYES ONLY, which was a far more serious affair. By 1983, Roger Moore was decidedly looking too old for the part, with Bond girls looking more like Bond daughters (or even grand daughters).And the title: sexy Maud Adams is Octopussy, a spiritual guru and jewelry smuggler that somehow (and incredible) has ties to Russian spies. Somehow her story doesn't gel with the core of the story (Russians wanting to take over the world), which makes the naming of this installment rather contrived.Still, OCTOPUSSY is still somewhat fun to watch but by 1983, Roger Moore's best James Bond movies were already far behind.",Octopussy
122,dasa108,The Bond saga begins to falter,5,8 September 2021,"The problem of Octopussy is the lack of fist to direct an action film where the sequences are credible; the case of circus girls smashing supposedly well-trained men is the icing on the cake. That it is a pleasant film to look at is not a problem; the problem is everything else. Moore already looks old, his ability to overcome all kinds of situations is not credible and the villain on duty, very well acted by Louis Jourdan, stands out for his finesse. I must say again that the movie would end in half an hour if the villain just shot it instead of carelessly lengthening the life of the enemy. The peak of Moore so far is Moonraker and it is worth suspecting that at that time neither the writers, nor the producers nor the director were very clear about where to go.",Octopussy

Although I wouldn't dare suggest that Roger Moore is better overall, he nonetheless proved a much better 007 in 1983 than Connery, and ""Octopussy"" is by far the better film.  There's really nothing new here (who would expect it?), but it is all done with a professionalism that seemed woefully lacking from the Connery film of the same year.",Octopussy
124,williampsamuel,A Fun but Rather Middling Bond Entry,6,17 March 2019,"The thirteenth installment in the venerable Bond franchise covers territory both familiar -Cold War intrigues, and exotic- the Indian subcontinent. This installment is notable as the first to be produced without Harry Salzmann, and for having one the most overtly sexual titles of any non-porno film.The story begins with one of the more unusual scenes in the series: a clown being pursued through the forests of East Berlin by a pair of knife throwers. But this is not just any clown. He is British double 'O' agent who, despite fatal injuries, succeeds in reaching the British embassy with a most precious delivery- a near perfect forgery of a Faberge egg. The search for answers soon puts Bond on the trail of exiled Afghan prince Kahmel Khan, whom Bond peruses to India. As Bond probes Khan's connections with the mysterious Queen-of-thieves Octopussy, and the corrupt Soviet general Orlov, it becomes clear that there is far more at stake than diamond smuggling.There are many action sequences, including a chase through the streets of New Delhi on three-wheeled taxi-carts, and a traditional tiger hunt, with Bond in place of the tiger, plus the inevitable final assault on the bad guy's palace. The high point of the movie is the extended train chase across the German border and the circus scene that follows. This section contains the most suspense, and is helped by the more serious tone of the action- bullets rather than fisticuffs.There is of course, the part where Bond is captured, but the villains decide to keep him alive awhile, thus allowing him to make a daring escape. This I do not mind, it is only to be expected in a Bond film. What I do mind is the scene in which Bond swings from vines over the heads of his assailants. Under no circumstances should Roger Moore ever try to channel Johnny Weissmuller. I also object to the unnecessary inclusion of a hot air balloon emblazoned with the Union Jack. A helicopter would have worked just as well in that situation, or a zip line for that matter.Moore still does fairly well with his role, although his age is beginning to show by this point in the series. This brings up another related point, the female lead. Here it is played by Maude Adams, who had already appeared in the Man with the Golden Gun eight years prior. She's still quite pretty, but, once again, her age is starting to show. I also felt her character, being allied with Khan, should have had stronger reason for her affinity to Bond.Overall, EON Productions has done pretty well, but they've left in a few flaws that threaten to undercut this production. Octopussy is still mostly entertaining, but not as much as it could have been with some minor script work.",Octopussy
125,stormhawk2021,James Bond turns to a clown,4,27 June 2017,"What has happened to the James Bond franchise? Sure, Roger Moore has had his ups and downs, but it seems as though he has almost lost his touch as to what makes the Bond character so great! This time, auctions, the circus, and train chases are all present and it feels like the most distant bond film of the entire franchise. Again, the cast and action pieces are what sell these films, but when you do very little to make me care about the characters and come up extremely short on the action, it is quite the bore. I will admit, there is a train sequence in the beginning of the third act that had me on the edge of my seat, until I realize I was watching a film that I was not interested in.

This movie has an almost incomprehensible plot, but it's loads of fun nevertheless, much unlike, say, the Timothy Dalton films. I literally fall asleep whenever I see that guy as James Bond.

128,ThomasColquith,One of my favorite Bonds!,10,1 June 2021,"""Octopussy"" is a sleeper, a great movie which only in retrospect do you realize its greatness. This film along with Director John Glen's other Bonds: ""For Your Eyes Only"" and ""The Living Daylights"" are some of the best Bonds in my opinion, and some of the least appreciated.""Octopussy"" once again features the opening title credits and graphics by Maurice Binder, who did so many of the Bonds and whose output added a lot to the franchise. ""Octopussy"" though features one of the best title songs and graphics of all the Bonds (other favorites include: ""You Only Live Twice"", ""The Spy Who Loved Me"", and ""For Your Eyes Only""). The song ""All Time High,"" sung by Rita Coolidge, and the opening graphics set an airy, dreamy tone for the film, one of sweet fantasy and escapism, reinforced by the pink hues of India, yet still tethered to the reality of the 1980's and its Cold War milieu with bisected Berlin being the perfect place for the film's climax.Louis Jourdan makes a great classy villain, and Maud Adams is appropriately cast alongside the older Roger Moore. It is actually refreshing to see older actors here in age appropriate relationships, as the world isn't solely composed of twenty-somethings. The auction house scene and the backgammon scene are also great and add some class and distinction to this film.The Fabergé egg auction scene is actually based on an Ian Fleming short story entitled ""The Property of a Lady"", while his other short story ""Octopussy"" lent itself for the title and some tangential backstory for Maud Adam's character's father. The Fleming short stories are good quick reads, by the way.While the Roger Moore Bond films with their often lighter tone are not everyone's cup of tea, I find them to be the right balance of action, adventure, romance, and intrigue; all without being too explicit. (That's not to say I don't like the other Bond actors and films. What's great about the franchise is the variety within it. It has a variety of films one can watch depending on mood.)Ultimately, I don't even know why I like this film so much, there are often intangibles at play, and not everything can be deconstructed. Perhaps it is peculiar to my age or life, but this film just resonates with me, almost pulling dreams out of me long since dormant -- somehow giving me a feeling of how I wanted life to be, or what it could have been, but that fantasy world along with the actual 1980's has vanished. All we're left with is ""a sweet distraction for an hour or two,"" as the theme song goes.In summary, ""Octopussy"", silly title and all, is one of my favorite films, so 10.0/10.0.",Octopussy
129,vox-sane,"Not the Best, But Hardly the Worst",7,14 December 1999,"Louis Jordan is a very good actor who was trying to say his lines too deliberately as the villain, and that sapped some of his effectiveness. Maud Adams, making an encore appearance to the series, was less than spectacular.  Arguably the lowest point in the Bond series (listen for the line ""Sit!"") occurs in one of the most dramatic Bond chases ever, where he has become prey on the lam worthy of ""The Most Dangerous Game"".  However, that said, the movie doesn't deserve the bad press it has received.  It ranks closer to the bottom than the top, but has some very good moments, some good laughs, and proves why Roger Moore is a worthy successor to Sean Connery.  The theme song, ""All Time High"", makes fine background music in its many arrangements through the film.  However, it proves that while Sean Connery was replaceable, Bernard Lee was not.  His ""M"", Bond's surrogate father, set the tone for his department -- firm, yet genial;  willing to send a man out to kill a bad guy, yet kind under his no-nonsense exterior. His replacement, a Michael Hordern wannabe, is too fussy, and lacks Lee's authority.  Lee's tragic death from cancer, before filming ""For Your Eyes Only"", was a grave loss to the series, much more than Connery's defection. ""M"" is given more to do in ""Octopussy"" than in many a previous film (""M""'s best scene ever is where he goes to Bond's house in ""Live and Let Die""), but the viewer senses the new ""M"" has to do more and hit the field because he doesn't have his predecessor's strength of character.  He is one thing Bernard Lee never could be:  an ""M"" Bond can dominate.  In his Connery and Moore incarnations, Bond gave Lee's ""M"" a hard time . . . but we never doubted who was the master and who the man.",Octopussy
130,carologletree,"A Good, Solid Entry in the Series",7,8 January 2016,"This film came out in 1983, the same year as the unofficial Bond film, ""Never Say Never Again"" starring Sean Connery. They had a box-office battle called ""The Battle of the Bonds,"" and this film grossed a lot more and was, by a long shot, the better film as well. This is another fun Bond adventure with plenty to like.Roger Moore is starting to show his age a little bit in this film, but he's still has his charm and can still seduce women and deliver the one-liners. Maud Adams, who was previously in ""The Man With The Golden Gun,"" once again is pretty much wasted, which is a shame since she's the title character.Louis Jordan as Kamal Khan is a very smooth and cool villain, and Steven Berkoff isn't as bad as most people say. The plot may be convoluted for some, but it's actually another fairly down-to-earth spy story.The locales in India are very beautiful and the film doesn't disappoint as far as action goes. It has a brilliant plane chase in the pre-credit sequence, a chase through the streets of India, a struggle on top a train, and a nerve-racking climax with Bond hanging on to Khan's areoplane.There are some incredibly silly elements that this film is infamous for. Bond dressing in a clown costume is one thing, but the Tarzan yell is a bit much. You'll enjoy the film if you just ignore those.By no means is this Bond's ""All-Time High"" like Rita Coolidge's theme song says, but this is still a fun, suspenseful, action-packed entry in the Bond series. Well worth a look.RATING: B",Octopussy
131,Ibuk,Octopussy- An all time low,4,5 June 2008,"Firstly let me get this of my chest I hate Octopussy with an absolute passion. What is so frustrating is that it had so much potential and had a very good opening sequence, unfortunately post the opening sequence it all goes downhill. Firstly there was absolutely no plot to begin with, just an excuse for Moore to tell his corny jokes. Next there are several sequences that would make a Bond fan cringe,for instance the sequence in which Bond turns up to diffuse a bomb dressed as a clown. The villains are pretty poor, Louis Jordon fails to make an impact as Kamal Khan and Bollywood veteran Kabir Bedi is equally poor as his henchman. It's funny that when people debate over what the worst Bond movie is and Octopussy gets overlooked when it can easily give them a run for their money.",Octopussy
132,LuboLarsson,Bond Vs Bond,7,6 October 2002,"1983 the year of the two Bond films, Octopussy and Never Say Never Again, Roger Moore Vs Sean Connery, but which was the best? Octopussy by a mile. Despite the fact Sean Connery is by far the best Bond Never Say Never Again lacked just about everything needed in a 007 film, and Octopussy has it all, the amazing action scenes, the exotic locations, the gun barrel into, the teaser sequence (one of the best in the series) and of course a John Barry score. OK Roger Moore is getting too old to play 007, but Octopussy is definetely his second best Bond film after The Spy Who Loved Me. Louis Jordan is great as the Bond villain and Maud Adams is one of the most beautiful Bond girls deserving her unique position of appearing in two James Bond movies. One minus side is the story gets a little too daft at times, and the OTT comedy, Moore saying S-I-T! to a Tiger a la Barbara Woodhouse and his Tarzan yell are awful and made me squirm, but the action scenes and the general rollercoaster feel of the film made up for this. It actually feels like the producers wanted an Indiana Jones feel about the movie, after all isn't Indiana Jones just a Bond copy anyway? *** 7.5/10 ***",Octopussy
133,cosmorados,Roger's last hurrah as Bond should have been the all-time high.,7,27 July 2008,"Bond is coming to the end of a mission to destroy a high tech airborne weapons system in an unknown South American country, after a high speed chase against a missile system and a superb opening scene, we are then thrown into the deep-end of the new mission, as 009 in a clown disguise is killed by two assassins while attempting to deliver a new perfect replica of a Faberge Egg back to his superiors hands. Why he was killed or what he was onto we don't know, but as Bond attempts to decipher more info from the clues available he is dispatched to India and then East Germany and discovers a plot to disarm the west in order to allow a rogue Soviet General to launch a strike to take over the rest of Europe.This, after the masterclass of Bond that was ""For Your Eyes Only"", could have been disastrous as that was a superb exciting and tense film. However, at this time the writers and the director, John Glen, were on an absolute roll and after a start that really gets you in the mood for a great film, the makers cranks it a bit more with the death of 009, the film then goes for a more subdued pace in order to allow the plot to thicken and peek our interest, which surprisingly, works really well.The action sequences in this one are spectacular and while the humour at this stage was starting to get too much, they had still managed to reign it in enough in this film. The role of Octopussy is handled excellently by Maud Adams and giving such a role to an older woman is a smart move by the makers as it also makes Roger look not that old, when in reality he probably was. The roll of villain General Orloff is taken up in pantomime form by Stephen Berkoff and he seems to generally relish his role, when the true nature of his plot is revealed it is a genuinely tense moment.Whilst there are a couple of moments where the effects are visible they are still breathtaking enough for you to give them the benefit of the doubt, this was still the age when they did almost everything for real and I applaud them for that. With a great soundtrack from John Barry who seems to really enjoy the work on this one, producing one of his best later Bond scores this is one of the better Bond films and certainly eclipsed the Connery offering this year of ""Never Say Never Again"".Sad that after this he did the abysmal ""View to a kill"" as he should have ended it here, but it definitely doesn't take anything away from this one.Good addition to the series.",Octopussy
134,C22Man,Bond does India,4,15 July 2015,"Bond Review. Title: A silly title that has a reason behind it but doesn't make it easier to accept.Pre-Titles: Bond fails to plant a bomb in an aircraft hangar, but he escapes in his own aircraft and just about avoids a heat-seeking missile which does the job for him. This is another exciting opening to a Moore Bond film and it is always fun to see standalone action like this open the film. The stunt work in the plane is absolutely brilliant and its intense escape is one of the best parts of the film.Theme Song: Rita Coolidge delivers one of the dullest themes of the series with 'All Time High'. It just moves along so slowly and neither the melody nor Coolidge's vocals are that good. In fact it sounds like something from a cheesy 1970's sitcom not a Bond film.Plot: When a fellow agent is found dead holding a Faberge egg Bond is sent to track its progress and it leads him to Afghan prince Kamal Kahn. Bond soon discovers that Kahn and a Soviet general plan to blow up an American air base, which forces him to team up with the mysterious Octopussy. The story is well told and moves along fine, but some of it is quite illogical. The reasoning for Kahn wanting to harm the Americans is never made clear and Octopussy herself just comes out of nowhere to side with Bond. The film also drags the longer it goes on, everything is set-up effectively yet the final third with the circus goes on for too long.James Bond: Roger Moore is starting to look too old for the role here. His suave personality and witty comments are still entertaining, but it's obviously not him in the action scenes and many of the romantic scenes are rather awkward. However he does just enough to keep things enjoyable.Bond Girls: Maud Adams returns to the series as the title character and she is just okay. She certainly brings elegance to the role and does have a strong screen presence, but the role limply written and she doesn't contribute anything to the film. Kristina Wayborn is very good as Magda. She gets to show off her athleticism and get involved in the action scenes, she also handles her dialogue well and is an entertaining presence when she appears.Villains: Louis Jourdan brings sophistication to Kahn and makes for a charming villain opposite Moore, but he isn't much of a threat. Sure he gets some fun lines and is classy, but his plan is flimsy and you get the feeling that Bond could defeat him easily. Steven Berkoff hams it up as disloyal soviet Orlov and it doesn't pay off. He delivers all his lines like a maniac and his expressions are laughable, he's never as threatening as he's meant to be. Kabir Bedi as Kahn's hulking henchman is simply a bore.Support: Desmond Llewelyn is great once again as we see Q doing some field work here which is fun. Robert Brown plays M for the first time and he is very good, retaining the characters stern attitude. Action: The action again ranges from nicely intense to absurd. A car chase through the streets of India is good fun and making use of their customs is a smart idea. The whole train sequence, though overlong, is enjoyable and well shot. While there is intensity to some parts, such as 009's death and Bond having to defuse a bomb, which is very effective. But the whole elephant stampede is ridiculous, seeing Bond make a tiger sit and doing a Tarzan yell is embarrassingly dumb. The climax on Kahn's plane is sluggish and not very exciting.Score: John Barry returns and his score is very good. There are some different compositions that add a more tropical flavour to proceedings and at many points the score is fantastic as a backdrop to some of the more intense scenes.Production Values: John Glen keeps his more low-key direction here and for the most part it works, however given the films locations and its broader tone it certain would have benefited from more visually impressive directing. The pacing and editing is a mixed bag as stated. The film starts off really well and keeps everything interesting or appropriately mysterious, but things really start to drag once we get to the bomb on the train and it never really recovers. Using India as a location was a good idea as it's always fun to see Bond in a new country and it takes a look at the Indian culture. The writing is hit and miss here. Some of the dialogue is fun and snappy, but other times it just feels silly. The more tongue-in-cheek parts don't work either, the scene with Bond in the jungle is borderline painful for how daft it is.Conclusion: Octopussy is arguably Moore most laid-back and easy to enjoy film. Nothing that memorable happens and it does have many weak points, but it does have a classic adventure quality to it and it is pretty clear that it's simply trying to entertain which it manages to do. By this point Moore looks too old for the part, but he still makes it work. The villains aren't done very well, Octopussy herself is a bit of a bore and there are some annoyingly comic moments. For me it is just okay and on the whole is just isn't very memorable, yet if you take it for what it is then you may well enjoy it whilst it's taking place.",Octopussy
135,Mikew3001,James Bond goes exotica,8,5 April 2002,"""Octopussy"" is a very different affair. One the one hand, the Germany-based plot is a very fine spy story just like in other classic Bond movies like ""From Russia With Love"", ""For Your Eyes Only"", ""The Living Daylights"" and ""Goldeneye"", including a conspiracy of Soviet Russian generals, an atom bomb in a West German circus and some thrilling spy vs. spy action.On the other hand, the film shifts twice to India where it turns to a fifties-like jungle exotica b-movie flick with Indian karate amazon fighters, an evil Emir, ugly henchmen with diamond yoyo killer chainsaws, sailing ships, crocodiles, tigers and lush oriental palaces with octupussy-style water beds.There are some very thrilling moments in this Roger Moore adventure such as a human tiger hunt and the run against time to find the bomb, but also some ridiculous moments like some of the Indian scenes and James Bond being dresses as a clown or gipsy artist. All in all it's good family entertainment with some of the most exotic settings of the whole 007 movie series.",Octopussy
136,movieman-200,Roger Moore's best Bond movie,8,11 June 2005,"Octopussy (1983) is Roger Moore's second to last outing as glib British secret agent, James Bond. On this occasion 007 has been assigned to investigate the sudden and curious appearance of a Faberge Easter egg at a Sotherby's auction, marked 'property of a lady.' What he discovers is that the lady, Magda (Kristina Wayborn) is the property of one, Kamal Khan (Louis Jourdan), a prince of spurious heritage who is using the backdrop of his fabulously wealthy lifestyle to hide a diabolical agenda. Enter Octopussy (Maude Adams in her second appearance in a Bond film); a business woman whose traveling circus is populated by a motley crew of lethal women. But is she Bond's friend or nemesis? Buttressed by masterful set pieces and stunning action sequences, Octopussy was released at the same time as a rival Bond picture (a thinly based and badly updated remake of Thunderball, entitled Never Say Never Again, starring original Bond - Sean Connery). In every way Octopussy outranked this latter entrée and tied Moore's appearances in Bond movies with Connery's legacy.The DVD from MGM/UA is rather disappointing when compared to the stellar efforts represented on Moonraker and The Spy Who Love Me. Visually, the picture elements appear to be in order  for the most part  although fine details are decidedly lacking. Colors are perhaps a tad less vibrant than on the aforementioned Bond titles (both of an earlier vintage than Octopussy, yet oddly enough, looking newer). Contrast and black levels seem slightly weak. There's a hint of grain, dirty and edge enhancement throughout, but nothing that will terribly distract. Overall, the image is just a bit better than average. Extras include two masterfully produced documentaries; some vintage advertising, a theatrical trailer and audio commentary.",Octopussy
137,bushtony,Feast for the eyes...,9,7 December 2012,"Re-watched on Blu-Ray recently and visually it looks even more of an absolute treat. This is perhaps the last truly exotic Bond movie to date. It benefits greatly from some sumptuous Indian locations and opulent cinematography. In fact, this ranks along with YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, THE SPY WHO LOVED ME and MOONRAKER as one of the most visually gorgeous outings in the franchise.Some of the inane tomfoolery that was toned down in the previous adventure, FOR YOUR EYES ONLY, is back in prominence. Cringeworthy fourth wall breaking, instantly dated in-jokes, Tarzan yells, crocodile-shaped submersibles and clown and gorilla costumes. Moore is on the downside of mature and looks a little tired, yet he throws himself gamely into the spirit of things and manages to convince as a veteran agent rather than the ageless superspy he was once depicted as being. There is an early acknowledgement of the ageing process from Moneypenny and the main Bond girl and romantic interest (Maud Adams) deliberately ain't no spring bunny.If you can bypass/ignore the bouts of intrusive silliness, it's a thrilling, satisfying cold war yarn spun around a dense and twisty plot that includes a backdrop of smuggling, antique treasure forgeries and a rogue Russian general's plan to force the west to the point of unilateral nuclear disarmament by means of detonating an atomic device on European soil. Bond's job is to investigate and stop him.The pre-credits sequence with an Acrostar mini jet is a hoot; there are plenty of chases, races against time, stunts, snappy gunplay and general rough and tumble. The script, co-written by George Macdonald Fraser, has some good one-liners and mock-racist interplay raising a guilty smile and everything shifts at a reasonable clip. John Glen remains the most workmanlike of Bond directors, but he orchestrates the proceedings solidly and competently for the duration. He was never going to win any prizes for creativity, let's face it, but he gets the job done. Moore's capacity to offset jocular smarm and reckless disdainful eye-brow-raising with rare isolated moments of surprising poignancy is used to good effect, and once again marks him out as one of the most underrated performers of anyone's generation. Finally, the airborne finale is a thrilling set-piece that concludes with a faint but reverent nod to NORTH BY NORTHWEST. Pleasing stuff.Credit also goes to Louis Jourdan for his hissworthy portrayal of slick, cultured villainy, and Steven Berkoff for a tour-de-force masterclass of how to slice the ham very, very thickly.Good-looking popcorn entertainment at it's almost-best that, when compared to the lacklustre and lacking rogue Connery project released the same year (NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN), shines like a beacon of expensive Bond majesty and taste. Some thought, craft and imagination has at least been expended and they certainly don't make 'em like that any more.",Octopussy

The closest parallel to the Roger Moore days are the Batman films of the nineties. When, after a couple of decades of cartoony films, they finally grew up and produced the Christopher Nolan series the reaction of the audience was ""It's about time."" The same thing goes with every Bond film from OHMSS through Die Another Day. When the Daniel Craig films appeared, the universal reaction was the same.
Octopussy, as with all the Roger Moore films was like a cartoon, with a combination of mediocre story, juvenile humor, two-dimensional characters, a great deal of stupidity, and utterly predictable. This was nothing but a milking machine for generating money for EON.",Octopussy

While this may seem improbable there was a Russian who recently called for an alliance of Russia China and India against the United states. If there is a secret alliance then maybe Condoleeza Rice stands for Russia India China Europe. Anyways I am on the side of the Americans and NATO. At the beginning of the film MI6 Agent 009 dies delivering a faberge jewellery egg to the British. I have met the British Intelligence agent Rudolph Valentine Double oh and he is very good ( just like the song ""Just like Rudolph Valentino Pull up in my Limosine oh wont you come in out of the reign""). He likes to wear pink ties and lift his leg up like Author Ian Fleming did in a picture once. Its unlikely a double oh British Intelligence agent would ever perish. I also met a British Intelligence agent in the Bahamas who Identified himself as 001 to me. Thats an area designation more so than a name. He told me to come back and we would talk and I plan to talk to him some more as a CIA informant. He had a ship designation of a 74 British Ship of the line. I met one British agent who gave me a designation of a 28 gun ship. The question is was it Providence or BOURBON? Desmond Llewelyn as Q makes a trip out of his lab and into the field in this movie. Louis Jordan plays Kamal Khan who helps place the nuclear device at the US airbase for Russian General Orlov in exchange for gems. Maud Adams plays Octopussy and is a capable actress.

I'm not going there.Anyway, I saw this movie because I was curious about the title. I should have guessed it was the name of a woman in this movie. Bond's women usually had some pretty wild names. I was pleasantly surprised. It kept your interest and it was funny. My favorite scene was when Bond was in a freight car on a circus train, and bear with me if my memory is faulty on this. I've only seen this movie once and that was when it first came out. Bond put on a gorilla costume, I suppose to look inconspicuous. He heard someone saying to meet them at a certain time and Bond, in the gorilla suit, looked at his watch. I thought that was hilarious. It had the usual edge of your seat action sequences, the women, and the snappy one-liners, and a sense of urgency to once again stop some madman from blowing up the world. 7 out of 10.",Octopussy

Roger Moore is getting old as Bond. But he still has it. I really liked this one. Seemed light on the thrills (chases) but heavy on the suspense. I'm not sure any 007 film prior to this felt as suspenseful. Still it has its silly moments, almost as if everything has already been done and Sir Roger is having fun with. At first he's sent out on an art forgery caper? Really? But in between it all we get a decent Cold War spy drama. Not sure I like this as much as the previous Bond outing (For Your Eyes Only) but it flows well and kept me thoroughly entertained. And it might seem minor but John Barry returning for the musical score gave it very good feel in that respect.7.3 / 10 stars--Zoooma, a Kat Pirate Screener",Octopussy
145,rjsf96,A Monotonous Bond,7,29 October 2015,"When it comes to consistency Roger Moore is out of luck as James Bond. During one film he is at his peak and then all of a sudden everything around him crumbles to the core. One of the weaker Bond entries in the canon, Octopussy is another troublesome film for Moore. Bond is tasked with uncovering a jewel smuggling operation after the untimely death of 009. His search leads him face to face with the wealthy Kamal Khan who owns his own luxurious palace in India.Strange for a Bond film, even the poor irredeemable ones; but Octopussy drags. Often. It's almost a challenge to complete the film in one sitting. That's because it rarely deviates from formula enough to provide solidly consistent thrills that fans crave from a 007 flick. It's ridiculous and dare I say it boring and I despise the use of the word. The unimagination of Octopussy extends to its Bond girl and villain. Maud Adams makes a reappearance as a Bond girl, this time in Octopussy, last time as Scaramanga's mistress in the painful The Man with The Golden Gun. It's a shame that she never appeared in a decent Bond film and it's not like there is a shortage. Adams hits all the previous beats and her attraction to Bond rings false frequently. Was Bond blind to overlook this? Or was he just thrilled to bed her? Either way 007 you are slipping. Octopussy only really wants Bond's attention so that she is kept safe from Kamal and his henchmen.Oh dear. We have not had an excellent villain since On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Kamal does not pose a threat to Bond so why should we fear him? Kamal is the bottom of the barrel when it comes to Bond villains.That makes it all the more curious as to why the secondary Bond villains and girls this time around work so well. Gobinda is a man to be frightened of, I just wish he was promoted; he could easily take care of Kamal after all.The secondary Bond girl Magda is intriguing; almost the sole high of the film. Moore and Kristina Wayborn actually display chemistry on screen so it was a smart move to have them share a few brief scenes together. The ending of Octopussy does succeed in shaking things up, well the last fifteen minutes or so. The second act set in a circus is excruciatingly tedious, bar a few well-constructed stunts; the whole fiasco goes on well beyond its welcome.Octopussy is another misstep for the franchise. While not as poorly constructed as The Man with the Golden Gun or as ludicrous and hard to buy into as Moonraker it is somehow a duller film than both. As Q says during the middle of the film ""I haven't got time for your adolescent antics 007"". Neither it seems have I.",Octopussy
146,MattHankinson,Exotic and entertaining,7,30 March 2021,Opening scene where gorgeous girl puts off the guards in the truck and bond escapes in his plane is quality. Funny & Original.I really enjoyed some of the visuals in this film for example the circus/clown element and also the scenes in India with the exotic creatures.Some quality Roger moments for example the Dice roll bond won & the 'Thank god for hard currency' line after the stack of money saves his life. His scene with q was hilarious. Bond focusing camera on woman's cleavage is very 80's and unfortunately probably wouldn't be allowed in 2021!Magda was not the best Bond girl ever and her best moment was probably when she escaped the hotel with the faberge egg. I also realised moneypennys age for the first time in this and it is quite ironic that the next film is her last in the role.The scene where bond is clinging to the plane and fighting with gobinda proper gives me anxiety!A decent bond overall.,Octopussy
147,dirtychild,"OK for Moore, Not Great for Me!",5,25 January 2005,"Octopussy is one of Roger Moore's last James Bond outings and for me, it is beginning to show.Of course - like most Bond films, this plot has lots of loose connections and evil people trying to blow up the world. Another 00 agent is murdered, trying to deliver a fake Faberge egg to the British Embassy in Germany. When Bond investigates, he uncovers a plot by a mad Russian General who wants to instigate a nuclear attack on the West.By this stage of Moore's Bond movies, they were getting a bit pedestrian (although I have a soft spot for Moonraker and View to a Kill!). The main female protagonist is a mature, middle-aged Octopussy (maybe something of a feminist revolution for Bond movies?) but she seems so vague and drugged out the whole time so she is a bit ineffectual.Speaking of middle-aged and elderly - Roger Moore is looking way past his used-by date (especially the topless scenes of him - yikes!). Although - he looks much worse in a View to a Kill.The climax of this film is quite amusing (probably in a non-intentional way). I don't think any of those red lycra suits are very camouflage! I think the makers of this were trying to make a gritter, more realistic Bond, but it ends up being a bit spoofy/campy.Pretty pedestrian!",Octopussy

(Well, John Wayne won World War II on his own, eh?).A clown, who turns up with a 'Faberge' egg in his hand and a knife in his back, in the British Ambassador's residency in Berlin leads to an international jewel-smuggling operation led by Octopussy (Maud Adams).However, she is only concerned with jewel smuggling, whereas unbeknown to her, Orlov is using her operation, in fact, her 'cover' for the operations, a circus, to smuggle the device from East to West in the guise of giving her precious gems from The Hermitage in Leningrad. (As it was then) and swapping them for fakes, back to The Hermitage though the Russians discover this. Orlov is despatched by his own lot with his dying words that although General Gogol says he's a common thief, he shall be a hero of the Soviet Union tomorrow.The other bad boy, Louis Jourdan as Kamal Khan and his henchman Gobinda (Kadir Bedi)who are close to Octopussy, are in league with Orlov - they want the jewels for themselves - and as the bomb is planted in the USAF base (in the middle of the circus), they make off, leaving Octopussy to be blown up whilst they hot-foot it back to her Indian palace, nicking her money, counterfeiting plates etc that Bond overlooks in a nuclear clear and present danger.Naturally, Bond (Did I mention it was Mr Moore!?) has countless scrapes escaping/being captured/fighting (You know the score!) and a lot of good stunts including hanging onto an aeroplane etc etc.Octopussy is warming to Bond (of course) when Khan captured him earlier, as she's not a killer but she thanks Bond for giving her father the chance to shoot himself rather than face trial many years earlier as a rogue agent who killed another, feathering his own nest with some gold from an archaelogical dig, or something.Anyway - they're mates, Bond uncovers the plot, disarms the bomb dressed as a clown (Hence the 'clown' '009' agent turning up dead near the beginning of the film) and helps Octopussy go after Jourdan and Co. and as there's no human rights act with the bad guys in these films, they famously always get their come-uppance, dying, than rather than being arrested. Mind you, they would've resisted arrest anyway as all Bond villains do, so quite right too. A good plot, plenty of the usual action and stunts, tongue-in cheek moments and lots, lots of girls in skimpy tight lycra or bikinis, often doing a bit of the martial arts. A role also for tennis pro Vijay Armitraj as, er 'Vijay', one of Bond's agents in India who unfortunately gets despatched with a kind of yo-yo circular saw from one of the bad guy's henchmen. Definitely the one to buy from the DVD collection if you weren't sure about any of the rest!",Octopussy
149,glenn-aylett,Moore's worst Bond film but still OK,6,26 July 2013,"Bond 13 and 007 is assigned to find the link between the murder of 009 and the Fabergé egg which the agent, as he is dying, leaves at the feet of the British ambassador in West Berlin. Bond is assigned to investigate why 009 had a Faberge egg and uncovers a plot by a deranged Soviet general, Orlov, and an Indian jewel smuggler, Kamal Khan, to start World War Three.Sounds ridiculous, then the whole film is,but is actually quite enjoyable. Stephen Berkoff is excellent in his insane general role, but Louis Jourdan is only so so as Khan, and the whole of Octopussy makes the bloated Moonraker look restrained by comparison. The whole film is a travelogue that lurches between Mexico, Germany and India and starts to descend into the ridiculous: Bond puts on a Tarzan yell when he swings across a tree, tells a man eating tiger to sit and dresses up as a clown to go undercover at the circus where Orlov has planted a nuclear weapon. Yet I still watch the film as it's as close to a 007 comedy film as you'll get.In parts Octopussy is good . As Moore was 55 when the film was made, pairing him with Maud Adams, who was in her forties, as the main Bond girl looked more realistic than some 25 year old model. Best parts for me is the teaser in East Berlin, the shootout on the German border, and the final fight on the plae. Gobinda, the giant Indian bodyguard, wasa typical silent and efficient killer, whose role was good. Also Octopussy's female army prove to be effective in fight scenes.On the whole Octopussy is an amiable enough way to pass a couple of hours, but isn't a classic and not one for Bond purists.",Octopussy
150,scott-sw,When Roger Moore should have left.,8,31 December 2007,"It's always best to go out on top. ""While For Your Eyes Only"" is my favorite with Roger, ""Octopussy"" is a close runner-up. Like For Your Eyes Only, the plot goes back to espionage amidst Cold War Politics. General Olaf of the Soviet Union is tired of the Cold War and wants to detonate an Atomic Bomb on a U.S. Air Force Base in Germany. His hope is that they will confuse it with one of their own bombs in order to elicit unilateral disarmament--leaving Western Europe open for Soviet Invasion. To finance his plan, he uses diamond smugglers Kamal Kahn who has a partner named Octopussy (Maude Adams). They weren't counting on Bond charming Octopussy. This is a sexy one with many beautiful women and a great adversary. Louis Jordan plays Kamal Kahn flawlessly. Another great aspect is that Q plays a much larger role in this movie. The only sin of this movie was a bit of campiness and cheesiness. Also, towards the end, Bond gets ""tough"" with General Olaf. Frankly, this was Moore's greatest weakness as Bond. Yes, he could be suave, sophisticated, sexy, debonair, and witty--but he could not play tough. Connery, Craig and Dalton could do both facets of Bond, while Moore struggled with toughness. Still, overall, this is another good Bond for Moore and when he should have stopped.",Octopussy

152,alexx668,Octopussy,6,2 September 2009,"Better than Glen's previous Bond effort (""For Your Eyes Only"") though in a sense a confused and confusing film. This has more style, a more chirpy Moore, but is also overlong, with several scenes a bit too stretched for their own good, and a needlessly convoluted plot. Basically the producers still want to turn Bond to a more basic action film and that's just not what Bond is all about. That said, several action scenes are pretty hot (the intro, the train scene, the plane scene in the end), and the humour's great. Famously, there were two Bond films that year (the other being the unofficial ""Never Say Never Again"" starring Sean Connery), and this came out the winner.",Octopussy

It's George MaDonald Fraser's first screenplay for a 007 film.The film has more humor, and a fine acting from Bond opposite General Orlov. Furthermore, it's a pretty cool move that it's not Bond who kills General Orlov, but a simple border guard.I came to think of something during this movie. How stupid is it to go to bed with the enemy, since 007 is really risking his life, in case he falls asleep. There was also another mention of the truth poison Bond should have had, and then there is a lot of ""overly acting"" done by by General Orlov (Steven Berkoff) As always there are a lot of mistakes, and the 3rd act was actually unnecessary if you look at a sensible position, as Bond could have simply warned instead of having to stop the bomb himself.As always, 007 film takes a lot of liberties, and here is no exception. However, it is a relatively entertaining film.",Octopussy
154,andrewmerritt-31652,You can't make this up,5,8 December 2019,"Octopussy is the thirteenth movie in the James Bond franchise and stars Roger Moore as James Bond. In this mission Bond is sent to investigate a jewel smuggling operation after discovering an agents death carrying a fake Faberge egg. I think what I should address first is the title. Octopussy sounds like the title of a porn movie, but it isn't. And you can't make this up when someone asks you what his or her favorite or least favorite James bond movie is. Octopussy is all over the place. This movie has a hard time figuring what it wants to be as one half deals with espionage and the other half is like an Indiana Jones movie. I'd rather this be a parody of Indiana Jones more than a spy flick because most of the time this feels rushed that it makes it forgettable. But then later on the movie feels less like James Bond and more like Indiana Jones and that's when things get interesting. Matter of fact I was so interested in this concept that I forgot that James Bond was investigating some fake jewelry. It felt like the writers forgot they were supposed to be writing a spy thriller and made it more Indian Jones until someone reminded them that this a spy genre and brought it back in instead of letting it sit in the corner like a shy person at a party. This eventually became embarrassing to watch as James Bond disguises himself as a clown. After that I think its safe to say that everyone including MGM and EON Productions had way too much to drink that it was time to hang up the Walther PPK and the vodka martinis and have this be the last time Roger Moore will be James Bond. Sadly it isn't as his last movie would be a View to a Kill, but Octopussy felt like the last one to me. Roger Moore has his ups and downs with the James Bond movies, but after this one he tried way too hard to be suave and charming that it almost came off as creepy. And even his humor was creepy as well that after that it made me feel uncomfortable and felt like ants on my skin. But if there is a bright side to this I will say that it does have an island full of beautiful women and who doesn't want to live on an island with beautiful women? I know I do. So in the end Ocotpussy felt like a final farewell to James Bond, but they could've improved and edited it a lot better.",Octopussy
155,McBuff,"Shaken, not stirred...",7,19 June 2001,"I hadn´t seen Octopussy since 1983, so I looked forward to rewatching it on DVD recently. I´m sad to admit that I´ve grown older, and that the Bond movie I remembered as one of the best ever is merely OK now. Let´s get the bad stuff out of the way: do we really need a ""funny"" Tarzan yell in a Bond movie, a clown suit (the worst and most clumsy disguise ever for a secret agent, fact!) or Bond in a gorilla suit (this is, after all, not a John Landis movie, right?). Well, those minor details aside, this is still an entertaining outing that has the usual amount of ingredients for a Bond adventure. That title song by Rita Coolidge suffers when compared to other efforts, but Moore is game as always, even though he began to show his age by then. Great villainous turns by Louis Jourdan and Steven Berkoff, that guy with the buzzsaw yoyo, and an exciting train sequence. A great show, but a bit overrated. **½",Octopussy
156,henrymadman,great bond film,10,29 September 2007,"Octopussy, released in 1983, is the 13th film in the James Bond series, and the sixth to star Roger Moore as MI6 agent James Bond. The film's title is taken from Ian Fleming's 1966 short story ""Octopussy"". However, the film's story is original and the short story is narrated as a flashback by the main Bond girl Octopussy. In the film, Bond is assigned the task of following a general stealing jewels and relics from the Russian government. This leads him to a wealthy Afghan prince, Kamal Khan, and his associate, Octopussy. Following captivity and attempts on his life, Bond uncovers a plot to force disarmament in Europe with the use of a nuclear weapon.Produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Michael G.

Moore, though, won the title by playing a better storyline, even if Connery played a better Bond.With a better supporting cast than one had seen in a while, on the coattails of 'Eyes Only', 'Octopussy' sported a mature and more memorable Maude Adams, Louis Jordan in a villainous turn, and a Q who easily branched out even further... with a title alone that begged interest.Moore's second best vehicle, he reaches Bond Epic for the second straight time.If only he had kept this his farewell Bond performance.",Octopussy
158,ericjg623,A convoluted mess,5,31 December 2004,"I'll give this movie its due - it does have great stunts and exotic locations. A good chunk of this film takes place in India, which usually doesn't get much play in Hollywood productions, so that was nice to see. But, aside from that, this thing was a real mess (I was going to say ""train wreck"", but that would be too obvious a pun given the big chase/fight scene that takes place on a train in Germany) in that it's almost impossible to figure out what's going on. The main plot, such as it is, involves a renegade Russian general intent on provoking a war with the West using a stolen nuclear bomb. But this only occurs near the end, the rest of the time it's about the smuggling and counterfeiting of rare Russian jewelry, most notably Faberge eggs, all of which has something to do with financing the nuclear bomb plot, but I was never able to figure out how the two were really connected. True, the plots in Bond movies usually aren't the main reason you see them, but they should at least be relatively straightforward and easy to follow, so as not to get in the way of the rest of the film. In all honesty, Moore should have hung it up before even making this film. He had already established his own legacy in the role, and could have quit on a high note with For Your Eyes Only. This film was even sillier than Moonraker, and much less enjoyable to boot. I would even say it's worse than A View To A Kill, which was also ridiculously over the top, but which was at least saved by Christopher Walken, who made a delightfully evil, psychotic villain. In this case, the villains (the general, and one of the smugglers, Kamal Khan) just didn't measure up. It's the latter who gets most of the screen time, and while he certainly is colorful, he just never seemed menacing enough. But what really hurts this movie is the overall incoherence. The film just moves from place to place (London auction house, India, Germany) and gives us lots of great stunts and action scenes, but none of these ever add up to a complete movie. It's really as if they just came up with a couple hours worth of chases and fights and put together the plot as an afterthought. Perhaps the only good part was the developing romance between Bond and Octopussy, who is probably the best Bond Woman (as opposed to ""girl"") of the Roger Moore series, but that alone couldn't save this film. It's not a complete disaster (no Bond film ever is, though a few of the Brosnan ones have come close) but it wasn't exactly the best vehicle for Moore to use in the closing years of his Bond career.5/10 (And that's due almost exclusively to the terrific stunts and locations)",Octopussy

There are some fun action sequences like the one on the train and I thought the Bond girl was good. I thought the villain and main plot were mediocre and the plot is kind of forgettable. Roger Moore is good as Bond again. As I had said before this film can get pretty goofy.

161,TimBoHannon,A Disappointing Follow-Up to Roger Moore's Strongest Bond Film,4,7 February 2012,"""Octopussy"" is full of mistakes. ""For Your Eyes Only,"" its predecessor in the series, returned to the cold war tensions that dominated two of the first five Bond movies and a number of the James Bond stories. ""Octopussy"" was filmed in the final days of Leonid Brezhnev, the man who reversed previous reforms in the USSR, and was released with the more brutal Yuri Andropov in power. The Cold War was very much on people's minds. The opening shows a lot of promise that the good momentum from ""For Your Eyes Only"" will continue. It does not take long for the wheels to start falling off. What starts as a straightforward story about a Soviet conspiracy degenerates in to silliness and self-parody. Several characters are military authorities, but what ""Octopussy's"" production needed was Graham Chapman to show up in his colonel's outfit and restore sanity.After the lame opening to the last movie, ""Octopussy"" provides one of the series' most exciting pre-title scenes; it is so inventive that I will say no more. Rita Coolidge's title song is among the top five to date. Agent 007 (Roger Moore) is called to duty after 009 turns up dead in possession of a phony Fabergé Egg. Since the real egg is about to be auctioned in London, British intelligence suspect the Soviets are using the jewels to fund illicit operations.The auction scene is brilliant. Bond himself bids for the egg to confirm his suspicion of Kamal Khan (Louis Jourdan), one of two lead villains. Later, in India, James uncovers that Khan is working for a sociopath Soviet general called Orlov (Stephen Berkoff) and that a rich benefactor called Octopussy (Maud Adams) may be involved in more sinister dealings than she realizes.Roger Moore delayed his retirement from James Bond due to Sean Connery's presence in a competing Bond film. He appears to be giving a good effort, but his success is restricted by the frequently humiliating script. Moore is flawless when Bond exposes Khan cheating with loaded dice. The shot where he says, ""double sixes, imagine that,"" without even looking is pure genius. Moore could still make the most of a funny line.Louis Jourdan is not bad as the unflappable Khan. Berkoff, on the other hand, is an absolute disaster. He speaks his lines in furious jerks and streaks of overemphasis. Berkoff moves his body as if somebody is running electricity through Orlov's rear and he is trying to hide it. His introductory scene breaks eggs all over the movie's face. Gobinda (Kabir Bedi) provides the physical presence, and is another failed Oddjob clone. He even crushes the loaded dice, which is far less believable than a hollow golf ball. Bond is too often docile around him, and he never has a signature action scene.Only ""You Only Live Twice,"" ""Live and Let Die,"" and ""The Man with the Golden Gun"" embarrass themselves more often than ""Octopussy."" An action icon screaming like Tarzan while swinging from vine-to-vine crosses very far over the line of bad humor. The movies keystone sequence is a 25 minute chase covering several miles. It is intercut with circus scenes, which are good to narrate the passage of time, but are far too long. The other moments that are supposed to be funny sabotage the potential for several minutes of hair-raising suspense. Seeing Bond teased by teenagers or dressing as a clown, or being stuck behind a long-talker at a phone booth is all wrong. My mind replayed Simon Gruber explaining, ""There was a fat woman on the phone and it took you a minute to get her off!""The comedic approach worked with ""Moonraker"" only because the filmmakers went all out with the concept and never made a mockery of their characters. Trying to graft silliness onto a serious story in the context of a serious world-problem transforms good potential into a clashing, inconsistent mess. Roger Moore deserved better.",Octopussy

The scene in the train carriage where he is in the gorilla suit, and Kamal gets the sword to chop off the gorilla's head, no way did Bond get out of that costume and up the roof hatch in that time., or why was the guys in the army truck wearing parachutes, this is just ridiculous, One of the most stupid Bond movies ever.",Octopussy

Take this hilarious moment for starters:James Bond: (looking at the tattoo on Magda's back) What is that?Magda: That's my little octopussy. James Bond: (faints)Yes, obviously all the great British and American comedy shows of the 80s have had an impact on Mr Bone, such as Cheers Love, Not The None O Clock News, The Younguns, Happy Days, and Saved By The Bell. Aside from this there is plenty (o'toole) of action (Jackson). There is a big sword fight and chase through a circus with clowns, a car chase through India where Jimmy has to avoid being crushed by elephants, poisoned by snakes, and charmed by sultry dusky maidens. The bad guy is a magician who can conjure guns from his pockets and his lead Hench man throws guillotines at people. Best of all is that Bont's partner in crime, the gadget maestro 'R' follows him into the field. This leads to much fun and games between the two, more than is usual for a Jim Bonk film. Take this hilarious moment for lunchers:(Q's mechanised version of the ""Indian Rope Trick"" malfunctions) James Bond: How about some Viagra, Q, my man?The plot follows Double D Forty on the trail of a drug smuggling ring. The bad guy goes to auctions and purchases valuable Fabergé eggs for some reason and brings his woman Octopussy along with him. Bond must stop these evil deeds as The Queen wants all the eggs for herself. Rather than outbid him, Bong decides to kill him. Of course he must get proof of these dastardly actions, so he goes in undercover as an antiques dealer and gets to know the man. This leads to more memorable one liners. Take this hilarious moment for dinners:Kamal Khan: Mr. Bond is indeed of a very rare breed (smears paint under his eyes)... The huntis on!As this is a James Blunt film, and as he is playing by Stacey Moore he is charming and must have sexings with the bad guy's woman and her, it seems, 8 special areas.

Take this hilarious moment for suppers:Kamal Khan: You seem to have this nasty habit of surviving. James Bond: Well, you know. Baby, I'm the best.Yes, Jamie is the best, and this is the best film of the series apart from some that came before and after it.Best Scene: When Borg and 'K' are arguing and decide to fight.

165,cartesianthought,One of my favorite comical fantasy Bond films.,8,11 November 2015,"A very underrated Bond film, in my eyes. Considering all of the films in the series which try to mix humor and frantic action together, Octopussy does it best.It's definitely a bizarre plot, beginning with a 00 agent found dead in a clown suit. Bond hunts down a Faberge egg, leading into a terrorist plot in the twixt of the Cold War. Moore's Bond finally gets a woman his age, with an older Maud Adams playing the ""Bond girl"" who has a degree of authority and likes to stay in charge of things. As the villain, Kamal Khan mirrors Moore's debonair Bond.There's of course plenty of creative unique action sequences all throughout, including a memorable circus scene of Bond saving the world in a clown suit, which may very well be my favorite scene in any Bond movie. Despite all the campy elements, it has one of the more believable plots in a Bond movie (no spacecraft that will destroy the world). Moore plays a Bond who is deeply concerned with the lives of innocent people in danger and, despite the gags, takes his mission seriously.Perhaps this movie is came too late in Moore's career as Bond, with 3-4 campy movies having been already done.

I expected too much from Roger Moore on this one. Octopussy is unbelievably silly, overextravagent, and chock full of jokes and pop culture references it seems like the Adam West Batman-esque camp that was Diamonds Are Forever, while this one is only a slight bit more interesting.The story involves a... it entails a fake Faberge egg... and a circus...which somehow involves a nuclear takeover of NATO-controlled Europe...and Bond must stop it while also protecting the circus. I really can't follow what is really going on in this movie, it seems like a Russian blitzkrieg using Barnum and Bailey as cover for smuggling fake items for some reason or another. Eh..Roger Moore should have really ended on this particular film because he delivers the last shred of any memorability and ""youthful appeal"" as he was described in 1983. All the cast seem decent but are given very silly things to say and do. And just like Roger Moore, Maud Adams looks way to old (and a bit Joan Rivers-ified) as Octopussy. The villains are over the top and overly obvious as villains it would take a complete moron to miss it but Bond lets them almost get away with it immediately.... you know the drill.Now, there are some good action scenes, especially the one on top of the train at the climax, right up until Bond dresses as a clown. Yes that is real, bleah!!! And the pre-credits sequence is very enjoyable with the Acrostar as a very cool Q-branch gadget.Well, for me this one is forgettable, but still somehow sticks out. maybe its that innuendo-inducing name in the title.Now onto the film that is truly weird and earplug-requiring, A View to a Kill.",Octopussy
168,The Spectacular Spider-Man,Classic Bond mixed with an overdose of silliness,8,5 October 2008,"Though it lacks the sheer style and class of the earlier Connery efforts, Octopussy is in many ways a quintessential Bond movie. The film retains the more serious approach of For Your Eyes Only, and combines it with a somewhat more complex plot than usual. The film has Russians, nuclear weapons, the threat of World War III - it all adds to an epic, dramatic, Cold War feel. The film combines a real sense of danger from the outset - the superbly Fleming-esquire scene of knife-throwers chasing a clown - and a very exotic atmosphere, mainly from the Indian locations. There are also more beautful women here than in any Bond movie (almost every woman in the movie), even Moneypenny has a beautiful young assistant.Again, the best Bond films have the best villains, and Octopussy has a real wealth of them. Kamal Khan makes for a wonderfully suave master villain. Gobinda and the knife-throwing twins are effective, and believable, henchmen. General Orlov, though prone to over-the-top ranting, works as a lunatic threatening the fragile stability of the world (back in 1983). Octopussy herself, though a somewhat light character, makes a good romantic interest for the older Moore.The downsides to the movie; Moore gets away with it age-wise, but his magnetic appeal to just about every woman in the film is more of a joke than anything else. Speaking of jokes, there is a clear attempt to add more humour than there was in For Your Eyes Only; some of it is great (""No, ma'am, I'm with the economy tour"") and a lot of it isn't, mainly the endless tennis jokes, Bond's schoolboy hijinks with Q, and a lot of the double entendres.And the crocodile submarine.And the Tarzan yell.And 007 dressed as a gorilla.And the union jack hot air balloon.Octopussy has some of the best action scenes in the series. The pre-credit aerostar chase is well-crafted and the shots of Moore in the cockpit are convincing. The jungle chase is clearly Raiders of the Lost Ark-derived, but it's exciting nonetheless. Bond doesn't escape this without a hair out of place, he shows genuine fear as he scrambles desperately through the underbrush, and emerges shaken and relieved. Then we have the series of action scenes in, around and on top of the train, including a shootout, a punch-up on the roof, finally Bond's showdown with one of the knife-throwers. To cap it off, one of the most overlooked stunts in the series - Bond hanging onto the roof of a plane. Upside down. I've read reviews of the movie saying it's too ridiculous, no-one could ever do that. It's a real stunt! Someone is doing that. Again, like many scenes in the movie, Bond is really up against it and only gets through it by inches. Compare this to the likes of The Spy Who Loved Me, where Bond very rarely feels in any danger. The fact that even the villains are very wary of the bomb adds to the more realistic, tense feel.Khan and Gobinda's reaction to their car not starting at first is perfect demonstration of this. It's darkly amusing, and shows this isn't the perfect world. Even something as mundane as this can happen to the characters. Bond himself has to desperately hitch a lift, and only ends up with a cool car because he steals it. Desperation, drama, no time for Bond to be classy.The best scene isn't action per se, it's pure tension. And it works as pure irony as well. Bond, Moore, dressed as a clown, has to convince a crowd that that he's being serious about an atomic bomb about to explode. This is one of the most dramatic, edge-of-the-seat scenes in the entire series, helped by the normally-unrufled Moore's genuine panic. Also adding to the dramatic feel is that Bond is wearing the same clown outfit as his fellow agent died in at the start of the movie.Octopussy would be a classic if it didn't jar so much between tense thriller and cartoonish silliness. I love the style John Glen bought to the series (at Khan's fireball death, 007 doesn't have a quip to make as his enemies' spectacular demise - he just lies down, completely exhausted), but it was severely weakened here by some of the most ridiculous moments of the series (minutes later we have 'in, out, in, out""). However, Octopussy is still one of the most entertaining Bond movies and deserved to be Moore's swansong.",Octopussy

In some way, it's different and that's it. I can tell, because having watched the whole collection at least three times, there are too many scripts I just don't remember.

174,sterlinrivera-2000,Wonderfully Made,9,23 January 2020,"Octopussy is a very nicely made Moore Bond film with a really nice story and great elements of action.The film is about James Bond (Roger Moore) is given an assignment to solve the murder of agent 009 after carrying a fake Fabergé egg. Kahn (Louis Jourdan) gets in an autiom and Bond becomes suspicious as Kahn plans to blow up a nuclear device on an air force base. He ends up going to India, and meets Octopussy (Maud Adams) who runs a circus, but is also a jewel smuggler and a theft. Bond must team up with her in order to retrieve the egg and save the day.Octopussy was great. The idea of it taking place at a circus may be silly, but it actually worked with an accurate script and a good story. The action wasn't as mind blowing as some of the other Bond films, but was still worthwhile.Acting was great again. Roger Moore did an awesome job as Bond in this one, and Maud Adams was stunning as Octopussy. Louis Jourdan made a decent villan for the film. Not one of my favorites, but still good.Overall, Octopussy is classified as a well made James Bond film.",Octopussy
175,bigwig_thalyi,funniest ever,6,7 July 2005,"Many people don't rate this film very highly but i thought it was okay.I personally think it is the funniest Bond film ever.The one liners come thick and fast especially in the scene in the Indian market.Watch for the scene with the wild cat-superb. Vijay Amritraj and Roger Moore complement each other superbly and show real chemistry .When Vijay dies you feel a personal sense of grief. Roger Moore played it totally tongue in cheek and I thought it was probably his best performance in all of the 7 bond films he was involved with. on the down side-Louis Jourdan didn't really have enough menace to be a Bond villain and when he and his henchman Gobinda finally meet their end the deaths are a bit of an anticlimax. The plot does tend to wander a bit and Maud Adams was slightly bland in the role of a Bond girl.I thought she lacked charisma and was a bit dull. However these small points aside ,Desmond Llewelyn,as Q, Had a bit more screen time, some bits of the film were so funny I laughed out loud and Roger Moore's performance cemented his place as one of my Favorite Bonds. All in all a very enjoyable Bond film. I give it 6 out of 10",Octopussy
176,ohroonoko,Juggling antagonists,6,8 November 2021,"It fits that a circus figures prominently in the story since the plot confusingly juggles three antagonists: Orlov, Khan and Octopussy. It's confusing to say the least. The transactions between the bomb, the jewels, the real Fabergé egg and the fakes, etc. The real egg was ""the property of a lady"", so was that lady supposed to be Octopussy? Was she selling her own egg to her partner in crime, Khan? Was it stolen from the Russian government? If it was stolen, then how could it be sold at auction? If it wasn't stolen, then why was a fake egg necessary? Did Orlov commission the fake egg? I thought he was replacing real jewels with fakes? Why was Octopussy's assistant at the auction with Khan? Why did Orlov chase after the train and return to the bomb before it crossed to the American side? Why was Khan helping Orlov set off the bomb? Well I'm sure there aren't any plot holes in the film, it's just that it's over my head, it's my fault for not understanding what is happening in this movie. I prefer the relatively straight forward plots of basically every single other Bond film. This is definitely the most confused I've been by a Bond film.Still, it has a couple of great action sequences: the Acrojet in the pre-title sequence; Bond firing a machine gun while sliding down the curved staircase rail. I think that's it.",Octopussy
177,connorbbalboa,Forgettable Bond film,4,3 March 2017,"Watching all 24 Bond films, some stand out more than others, and some just blend into the background. Octopussy, the 6th Roger Moore Bond film, just blends into the background. Just to get it out of the way, I'll just highlight the stupid moments Bond fans know: 56-year-old Moore as Bond dressed up as a clown, Bond fighting a bunch of bad guys through (offensive) stereotypical Indian displays like the sword in the mouth, and Bond yelling like Tarzan while swinging through the trees. Yeah, the goofiness of Moore's previous films just couldn't go away after For Your Eyes Only, which was supposed to be a more serious film, despite having a stupid beginning and ending. Besides that, there is nothing really horrendously bad about this film other than the stupid highlights I mentioned earlier; it's just not remarkable. The plot is that a Russian general who just wants power (Steven Berkoff, who was also a Russian bad guy in Rambo: First Blood Part II) hatches a secret plan that involves working with Kamal Khan and the vengeful Octopussy, who later switches sides to help Bond. The MacGuffin in this story is a piece of jewelry shaped like an egg that is recovered by another double-0 agent who is killed...and wears a clown suit. Oh boy. Bond goes to India to track down Kamal Khan, who buys a replica of the egg, unknowingly, and gets caught up in the Russian general's plot to blow up part of India. That is all I could remember from the plot because the film is not memorable in any way. Maude Adams' Octopussy (Really?) isn't as memorable a Bond girl as I thought she'd be; her character in The Man With the Golden Gun (1974) who gets killed stood out more and that was a smaller part. The main villain has one of the most basic archetypes ever in a movie and turns out to be so insignificant, he gets killed quite some time before Bond stops his scheme and the movie ends. Kamal Khan isn't an interesting bad guy either. Moore is alright here as Bond, but one trait of his that I always find annoying is that he knows EVERYTHING about the MacGuffins in his movies, whether it be the ATAC system in For Your Eyes Only or the egg jewelry in this film.I do like the concept of a whole battalion of sensual women fighters who serve Octopussy, but it ends up feeling like the numerous other battle scenes with large forces that have been in previous films.I guess my point here is that this film does nothing new or exciting for the Bond series at that point and is just another basic plot. I actually had trouble remembering some of the details right after I had finished it. If you're looking for high-quality Bond, you won't find it here.",Octopussy
178,EdwardCarter,Crap,1,30 November 2008,"A slow, overlong and boring rip-off of the infinitely better ""Goldfinger"", with Moore at 55 now looking quite ridiculously old to be playing Bond (who is, of course, only supposed to be in his late thirties). After a boring song over the opening credits, ""All Time High"" (definitely the worst song by far in any Bond movie) we have flat direction and ridiculous moments like the infamous Tarzan yell and the clown suit. Steven Berkoff's bad Russian accent is very annoying and the two women are the oldest and least attractive Bond girls. Moore really should not have been playing Bond at his age, a younger and better actor like Timothy Dalton or Michael Jayston was needed. The only good thing about the film is the Indian location. ""Octopussy"" might have made more money than ""Never Say Never Again"" but the latter was by far the better film.",Octopussy

180,KnightLander,Rather underrated Bond flick,6,20 June 2005,"By 1983, it didn't take a genius to figure out that Roger Moore was nearing the end of his time as James Bond. But as ""Octopussy"" demonstrates, at fifty-five years old Moore was still as suave as ever.Referencing Ian Fleming's short story ""Octopussy"", the twelfth screen adventure of 007 is partially based on another of Fleming's tales, ""The Property of a Lady"", and is partially entirely new material. The story involves James Bond investigating the death of agent 009, and the origin of a Faberge Egg found with the body. The trail leads Bond across India and Russia, and Bond eventually discovers a plan to begin a third World War.The Bond adventures had been getting sillier and sillier ever since ""The Man With the Golden Gun"" in 1979 - the peak of the goofy craze being ""Moonraker"" - and in 1981 the producers opted to go back to a more serious Bond for ""For Your Eyes Only"". ""Octopussy"" has the mood just about right - serious, but occasionally silly as well. Only once does it go over the edge - when 007 releases a Tarzan scream in the Indian jungle.There's some good thrills in this film, directed by frequent Bond director John Glen. The best of which is probably the short, but grabbing pre-title sequence, which involves 007 in a mini-plane to escape from an enemy base. There's another score by John Barry - who was also reaching the end of his Bond adventures - which doesn't live up to what we've come to expect from Barry. Louis Jordan makes a very nice, albeit ferret-faced villain, while Maud Adams returns to play the title character.All in all, I find ""Octopussy"" to be a good, quite entertaining, and rather underrated Bond adventure. Next up was Roger Moore's final (and not a moment too soon) outing as Bond: ""A View to a Kill"".",Octopussy
181,tomasg-69814,The 80's Went On.,6,5 February 2016,"I kind of like this Bond movie, I do. Fresh, but the usual patters is still there, well worked in. And the ""Cold War"" theme sort of still hanging around in the 007 films, and wasn't to be scrapped quite yet, either. Fascinating (but expected) stunts, and a trip around the world. Got It before? The greatness is in good, well thought casting; among other well performing guys like Louis Jourdan and Kabir Bedi, there's a warm welcome back to a skilled woman named Maud Adams. The whole ""Octopussy"" part of the movie is a booster when one got a little tired of Russians making evil plans. (Steven Berkoff's performance got him the role in Rambo: First Blood part II ?)The comedy parts is what works best in this movie. Former pro-tennis player Vijay Amritraj and the legend ""Q"" Desmond Llewelyn are brought along for laughs, as I see it. Not to mention the innumerable inside jokes - as of many Bond movies - that fans still searching for today when re-watching it. Roger Moore got bought back for the 007 act in an almost desperate way from the production team. Exchange the now legendary five round, well worked in actor gentleman obviously wasn't done just like that. Rumors (as usual) in preproduction placed some dudes as potential substitutes, but as it seems today, in vain. (One wish-list guy, Pierce Brosnan, was contracted to a half-ass flashy TV detective show straight throughout the 80's.)I personally think that the situation of today's James Bond movie production have some similarity to the mid 80's. I can imagine people got a slight feeling knowing what to expect when going to the cinemas for the 6th Roger Moore-show. I was in exactly that mood before watching ""Spectre"" at the local theater last November...",Octopussy
182,gerard-21,The Producers Were Confused.,6,16 February 2005,"They didn't know what type of Bond film to make: an overblown action comedy best personified by Moonraker or a down to earth action thriller like they had done in For Your Eyes only, the previous picture. Solution: they gave the audience both! Result: this movie is very uneven. There are some great sequences: the teaser featuring the mini jet, the killing of 009, the auction, the backgammon game and subsequent chase scene, the fight in Octopussy's bedroom and the train sequence all come to mind. But there is just too much misplaced humor in between and the rest of the movie after Bond diffuses the bomb is unnecessary and somewhat silly. Moore really shows his age in this one too, as does Maude Adams. Stephen Berkoff is awful, but Louis Jordan is great. Christina Wayborn deserves top marks as well. While not a bad film, and certainly one of Moore's better outings, this could have been so much better. Some of the best Bond scenes ever are present here, but they are overwhelmed by the shear enormity of it all: the producers just tried to put all of the past elements into this movie to please every Bond fan. So while there is something for everyone and it is entertaining, Octopussy is ultimately a victim of it's own excesses.",Octopussy
183,d-apergis,harmless adventure,6,26 December 2009,"The colorful and glittering locations of India just about compensate for an over aged star and a narrative that takes some following. Its livelier moments somewhat atone for the occasional direness, but even the most prominent of script-doctors wouldn't elevate this above the level of a corpse being forced to walk with whatever means necessary. Thus, it plods along as a humorous and harmless adventure, just a way to kill one's time so to speak. Mainly notable for a sequence in which Bond, dressed as a clown, attempts to diffuse an atomic bomb inside a circus; a sequence that can only be read as a deft display of self-deprecation.",Octopussy
184,jackhamel1987,Roger should have stopped here!,6,8 April 2013,"Octopussy was Moore's sixth outing as Bond, and it's a pretty average affair to be honest. There are some decent actions scenes (the opening scene is a great one), and Louis Jordan as the primary villain was a smooth piece of casting. However, there are some holes in this, and it just feels that it's another of Moore's Bond outings where there is too much happening, and no real through line that the plot can follow.When MI6 agent 009 is found murdered holding a Faberge egg, Bond is sent to investigate its meaning. Using the egg as bait in an auction, Bond sees that Afghan Prince Kamal Khan is desperate to buy no matter what the cost. Bond follows Khan to India, where he sees Khan meeting with a Russian General, Olov, and then later on with the mysterious 'Octopussy', a woman who runs a circus. Bond is able to infiltrate the circus, and discovers that Octopussy is being used to smuggle a nuclear warhead into Germany. Bond must stop this.Roger Moore really should have stopped before this, but they offered him a larger pay check so it made sense for another outing in the end. It's just a shame that it's not as strong as his previous effort, For Your Eyes Only. It could have been, but as with several of Moore's Bond films, it descends into a bit of a farce at times which takes away the edge. It doesn't help that Moore was looking a bit too old by this point as well. The plot, much like Moonraker and The Man with the Golden Gun, is simply too saturated with pointless twists, and you always feel that once again the writers, producers and director just threw some limp ideas together and linked them with pointless characters. This film needed to decide what it really wanted to be about - nuclear warfare and the Russians, or jewelry and Khan. It tried to be both, and just ended up muddled.That said, this does have some good, memorable performances. Louis Jordan does purr as the arch villain in this film, and it's a pity the film didn't focus on him more. He is supported by 80's rent-a-villain Steven Berkoff, who puts in an over-the-top but enjoyable performance as the crazed General. And Maud Adams puts in a reasonable turn as the Bond girl, Octopussy. Not terrible, not great either. 6/10",Octopussy
185,chancey-23,Moore's last good Bond film,7,15 July 2012,"Back again as Bond in lucky number 13, this was the last good film for Moore before the atrocious number 14. Octopussy knows that as the thirteenth adventure on the big screen for Bond, the audience probably isn't going to take it too seriously, so it jazzes it up a bit and has fun with itself. And that's the thing that this film is: fun. It doesn't really matter about anything else besides being fun, and when it's time to have fun in this film, it's easy to have fun right along with it. But I accept that to a point. But it must be said that as a Bond girl, Octopussy, for me anyways, doesn't work, and the villains just push my buttons in their ordinary villain ways. So when is the film fun? When it comes to the action scenes, and they are well staged, well played, and while they might go overboard sometimes, so do half the comedic moments in almost every other Bond film. So, fun, but that's about all.",Octopussy
186,A_Friend_of_Sarah_Connor,"Despite a scandalous title, ""Octopussy"" is a fine Bond film (SPOILERS)",7,1 January 2005,"The 1970's were a tumultuous time for the James Bond franchise. While the films continued to make money and they were still popular, the decade only produced two good films; ""Diamonds Are Forever"", ""The Man With The Golden Gun"", and ""Moonraker"" rank in the bottom tier of the series. With 1981's ""For Your Eyes Only"", Albert R. Broccoli, writers Michael G. Wilson and Richard Maibaum, and director John Glen managed to bring the spy back to earth (literally) with one of the best entries in the series. The follow-up, ""Octopussy"", ditched the seriousness of FYEO and returned to some of the usual Roger Moore antics. But while it contains some overtly glossy aspects, the movie's plot is still fairly realistic and not as bad as it's credited as being.By the time ""Octopussy"" was made, Moore's recasting had become more and more difficult. He originally wanted to bow out with ""Moonraker"", but Broccoli was convinced that he had no good replacement and kept on offering Sir Roger bigger paychecks until he agreed for just one more film. Ideally, I would have preferred Moore to step down with the excellent FYEO, but had he not decided to return for ""Octopussy"", we could've ended up with James Brolin in the lead role, a thought I'm sure every Bond fan dreads. As far as I can see, Moore's only mistake was returning for ""A View To A Kill"".The film kicks off with a scene originally planned for ""Moonraker"", in which Bond flies the Acrostar Mini-jet to escape Latin-American baddies. The sequence has nothing to do with the rest of the film, but like ""Goldfinger"", proves to be endlessly entertaining. The actual plot begins with the murder of 009, who was holding a rare Fabergé egg at the time of his death. Bond is sent in to investigate and eventually finds a connection between an exiled Afghan prince Kamal Khan (Louis Jourdan), an insane Russian general bent on taking over Europe (Steven Berkoff), a jewel smuggling ring, and a nuclear bomb in an air force base.While it sounds like combining all of these elements would be a recipe for disaster, it all unfolds at a steady pace and the script allows Bond to be constantly looking for clues and watching his back. Along with 1987's ""The Living Daylights"", it requires multiple viewings to fully understand the plot, but that adds to the complexity of a story where you have to pay attention. As I mentioned earlier, the film is also more down-to-earth for a Moore Bond film; there's no lasers, no space scenes, and the plot is almost entirely plausible. Naturally, there are a few liberties taken here and there, but at least there aren't any invisible cars.The film also contains a few understated performances. Moore manages to make his Bond as appealing as ever, and while his age keeps him from reaching his peak as he did in ""The Spy Who Loved Me"", he still proves to be especially effective in some of the more dramatic scenes; these include disarming a nuclear bomb and chasing franticly after the villains in the movie's climax. Maud Adams, returning to the series for her second stint as a Bond girl, plays Octopussy, one of the stronger female leads in the series. She was one of saving graces in ""The Man With The Golden Gun"" and her chemistry with Moore works in this movie's favor. The usual MI6 team is here, with Robert Brown replacing Bernard Lee as M and Vijay Amritraj as the sacrificial lamb.Fortunately, Bond is pitted against the usual assortment of insane villains who, nevertheless, have much more realistic goals this time around. Louis Jourdan's Kamal is about as slick and cool as one would expect and the actor brings an unusual magnetism to the role that separates him from most baddies in the series. However, General Orlov, as played by Steven Berkoff, is your token Russian psycho and he doesn't really come across as well developed as Kamal. His limited screen-time is also a disadvantage, but Berkoff does what he can with the material. There's also a fine variety of henchman in the film; from the sadistic twins Mishka and Grishka to the giant Gobinda, Bond is always facing worthy opponents.""Octopussy"" also fares well in other departments: the subplot of avenging a fellow agent is handled nicely (""That's for 009"" is the best line in the movie), the locations and ""Bond Girls"" are suitably exotic, and John Barry comes up with some good cues, even if this particular score isn't his most memorable. Finally, the movie also contains a high action quotient; there's the Acrostar jet scene, a chase in an Indian marketplace, a fight in and on top of a train, and the finale in mid-air. In actuality, the final half hour is one of the most thrilling in the series.Of course, not everything comes up smelling like roses. The main faults of the film have to do with the overabundance of slapstick humor that prevents ""Octopussy"" from achieving anything better than an average recommendation. Bond telling a tiger to sit, him swinging from vine to vine ala Tarzan (complete with the Johnny Weissmuller scream), and some of the unfunny one-liners are just some examples of the lame humor (Ironically, the clown costume that Bond dons in the film's climax didn't bother me as much as it does most people). Rita Coolidge's song ""All Time High"" isn't one of the series' most memorable and the similarities between ""Goldfinger"" and Indiana Jones are simply distracting.So despite these reservations, I've always liked ""Octopussy"" and would still give it a thumbs up. The story is fun and involving and Moore creates an atmosphere where all the plot elements gel together. While the film isn't high art, it's still a good middle of the road Bond film and should be appreciated as such. 7/10",Octopussy
187,asdodge,"The Formula works, just not as well as some",6,12 December 2008,"All the ingredients are here for a James Bond Film (at least all those after ""From Russia With Love"")- the big chase, the evil megalomaniac out to rule the world, the sexy women, the bad puns, etc. It just comes off a bit cheesier here than in ""For Your Eyes Only,"" ""Live and Let Die,"" the Brosnan Films, and the Connery films beginning with ""Goldfinger."" EON Films has the formula mastered and the parts are all plug-and-play. Bond is in better shape here than for Moonraker or the later ""A View to a Kill."" However, this movie is Bond-movies at their most chauvinistic and misogynistic. While Bond himself is a lover of women (as toys to play with, mostly), the women in this movie (and there are LOTS of them) are all eye-candy. Sure, they are all talented circus performers, acrobats, and fighters, but they are all scantily-clad and borderline bimboesque. Even Maud Adams (the title character), despite being portrayed as a successful black market entrepreneur and circus owner... she is rather easily duped and misled (then man-handled) by Kemal Khan (Louis Jordan)- not to mention, rather quickly smitten and eager to hop into bed with Bond. The story itself is very good, with one major plot hole that seems to be a bit naive/idealistic (the West's reaction to a nuclear bomb going off in the west leading to total nuclear disarming by NATO)- and yet centerpiece to the the plot of the bad guys. Based in a Reagan-era Cold War arms race, a Russian general conceives of a plan to start World War III and is funding his plan with stolen Russian art and treasures being sold in western markets. Bond must use agent skills to decipher what is going on and find plot within plots. I always love it when Bond does real agent work and not just play superhero. I would easily still rate this movie higher than I gave it, but the formulaic big battle at the final Climax of the story is absurd. While the fight may have been meant to be anti-sexist and empowering of women, it comes off as unrealistic and an excuse to have scantily clad women bounce around. Fun to watch, if you are into women as mere plastic toys- hard to watch if you want something this side of somewhat believable. Obviously, we like to ""suspend disbelief,"" but in the real world itonly goes so far.",Octopussy

The plot of this movie is actually an interesting one , being centered on a rogue Soviet general who has teamed up with an ousted prince who are going to blow up a US embassy to start WW3 but sadly it's undermined by the ridiculous nonsense of this movie at almost every turn, like that horrendous Tarzan vine swinging scene, that horrid clown disguise and the tasteless Indian stereotypes. This movie is also extremely formulaic that it's ridiculous. It adds to how forgettable it is. The 007 formula is a good one but it needs to be done in interesting ways to make the movie more entertaining. This movie just does it in unimaginative ways.",Octopussy

Gorilla, not guerilla, I didn't misspell that.Not to mention the fact that Roger Moore was far too old at that point to be playing James Bond - it's often stomach-churning to watch him delivering slimy innuendo to the female cast, most of whom aren't even half his age, more like a third of it.One could argue that it's all in the name of self-parody, but once a film or TV series ends up making fun of itself, it's usually an indication that it's on its last legs.

Moore vs. Connery. Bond vs. Bond.The ""official"" movie Octopussy starts off reasonably with a decent story, but then careens off-course, and starts to feel waaaay too long. In addition, the movie moved from semi-realistic portrayal of a spy to a cartoonish, unbelievable farse.For example in the final scene, Bond is riding an airplane at 100 miles an hour (impossible---the wind would blow him off), using his feet to force the plane to ground, and then jumping off at some 60 miles an hour (again impossible---try jumping out of your car---you'd end up with a shattered body). How is that octopussy scene supposed to be ""good"" in any sense of the word? Prior to this movie Bond was just a human being with skills. Now suddenly he's got super-human strength & a titanium body. And he does all these stunts at the ancient age of 56??? Complete crap. Unbelievable. Farse.---> Now let's contrast the above scene with Connery's ""unofficial"" Never Say Never Again: The movie starts off with Bond showing his age (he is 50 after all) and being sent off for recuperation. Entirely believable. But of course, there's no such thing as a ""day off"" for a world-famous spy, and Bond quickly finds himself a target, even inside the hospital. From that point the story spins off into another adventure, with Bond trying to locate his attempted killers and ultimately foiling an attempt to steal nuclear weapons.As usual Sean Connery did a brilliant job, and avoids the over-the-top/unbelievable stunts. This movie feels like a natural successor to Connery's last film, 1971's Diamonds Are Forever... the old style of Bond... before the franchise got silly.BOTTOM lINE: Given the choice between purchasing these two 1983 movies, I'd choose the Connery film. Octopussy was a cartoonish farse.troy",Octopussy
192,bsamdahl,One of the best cold war films ever.,9,8 February 2003,Octopussy is one of the best cold war films ever. It really goes into depth with its main plot. Rogue communists are trying to take things into their own hands being dissatisfied with the way the Kremlin is handling arms control talks. The plot is to have a nuclear bomb explode in West Berlin from an unknown source.  The hope is that the Americans and the Germans will call it a nuclear accident and that the already high calls for nuclear disarmament in Western Europe will lead to the dismantling of all nuclear weapons.  This would give the Soviet advantage in conventional forces an opportunity to invade Western Europe.  After you grasp all that you can just sit back and enjoy the film. Maud Adams does a great job claiming to know nothing about what her associates are up to while maintaining a profitable smuggling business. I think that Roger Moore did a great job in this film.  The humor was actually good and not corny.  The East German circus twins definitely portrayed that tough communist loyalty well in this film. Octopussy is a film worth repeated viewing for both the action and the plot scheme.,Octopussy
193,mcfische,Another isolated film,6,13 September 2003,"""Octopussy,"" the thirteenth James Bond film, was going to be facing competition from Warner Bros. ""Never Say Never Again,"" an unofficial James Bond film starring Sean Connery and considerably worrying the producers (why I don't know). The filmakers were determined to prove that no one, not even the original 007, could beat the true Bond films. Roger Moore, who had resigned from the role after ""For Your Eyes Only"" was brought back, and the film went all out to be unique, exotic, and a true stand-out in the Bond films. They got their wish on the exotic part, to be sure, but this film; isolated, distant, and unmemorable compared to the rest of the Bonds, ranks with ""Thunderball,"" ""The Spy Who Loved Me,"" and ""Moonraker"" in the 6-5 out of 10 rating due to isolation and being unmemorable.The film has it's good points. Roger Moore gives a good performance as 007 again, although he is DEFINATELY looking old; he looks older in this film then he does NOW. The character of Vijay is enjoyable and it would've been nice to keep him alive longer. Q is in his biggest role to date, General Gogol is at his best, and setting is wonderful. The suspensful scene in the woods with 009 and the scene in the circus with 007 are also well-done. But there are too many probelms. Moneypenny looks older than Bond, and she doesn't need an assistant. Robert Brown is no Bernard Lee, and his M seems more cowardly and unmemorable. The villains plot sounds unique, but it's obvious it would lead to WWIII and the fact that a Soviet general who can organize an operation such as this never even considers that is idiotic and a result of rushing the plot. The film feels a lot shorter than it is, and it seems to have the least amount of action. Several key scenes are done far too early in the film.This films gets a 6 out of 10.",Octopussy
194,rt-ingram,"Has good moments, but is let down by an overly complex story",6,20 April 2017,"Octopussy carries on with the serious return to the series, and with Roger Moore playing 007 with the seriousness that was evident in For Your Eyes Only, but the film is not entirely successful. However, there are some good moments. The pre credits scene is one of the most entertaining, with the Acrostar mini jet being chased by the missile, and the scene after the pre titles where 009 is hunted down and killed is quite eerie and very suspenseful. There are some good performances from the supporting cast, with Maud Adams, Louis Jourdan and Vijay Amritraj being standouts.The main problem with Octopussy is that the plot line is far too complex for its own good; the best films are when the story is straightforward and easy to follow, but Octopussy has far too much going on. The story does grow on you, but it's not something you take to straight away.The film does have a few silly moments, especially the Tarzan yell, and the part where Bond disguises himself as a clown to disarm the bomb doesn't work; it would have been more tense if he'd have just gone in as himself.Overall, Octopussy has its good moments, but is let down by an overly complex story.",Octopussy

A remake of Thunderball called Never Say Never Again featuring the original James Bond, Sean Connery as James Bond again.Albert R. ""Cubby"" Broccoli and Roger Moore had no choice. They had to make this film bigger and better as highly possible. In the end of the grossing of both films. The 13th Bond film, Octopussy (1983)...

196,MrTaft,Solid Bond,9,15 June 2004,"While not my favourite Moore Bond, this is definately a very good film in terms of quality and substance. The plot is excellent and really quite terrifying when you think about it. While Louis Jourdan is great in his role as the main villian, I thought Steven Berkoff stole the show as the mad Russian general. His scenes with a disgusted Walter Gotell were marvellous!Of course, all the humour is here, and Moore seems to be having a fun time as usual. Great one-liners such as, ""I intend to, Kamal Khan"", ""And that's for 009!"" and ""Well, thank you, sir, that's a great comfort"" give a soft edge to otherwise very dramatic scenes. The rest of the cast is good, particularly a lot of the extras. The action is also of special note, particularly the whole car chase/train fight which is very strong and great entertainment.It's great to see the film live up to the original Bond standards, with the perfect mix of action, humour and romance. I still prefer most of Moore's earlier Bonds, but ""Octopussy"" is always fun when you've nothing better to do.",Octopussy
197,alleywayambush,"""Fill Her Up Please"" ... ""I Need Refilling"" !",8,17 December 2018,"OK, so I'm not normally much of a fan of Bond, nor of action films in general, but this is the absolute exception !For a start, there's a beautiful opening sequence; sensual and classy stills of naked women - cleverly juxtaposed for a family audience, hence nothing's too obvious - accompanied by a beautiful theme song 'All Time High' by Rita Coolidge. On the subject of music, John Barry delivers not only this song but another tender, evocative, poignant and romantic score, instantly recognizable for his own idiosyncratic style.In the tradition of Bond, a set of stunning mature women are present. Similarly to Honor Blackman in Goldfinger, Maud Adams was 38-years-old, playing the title character, while 33-year-old fellow Swede Kristina Wayborn plays the lead female villain. Some enlightening sensual performances by these aging beauties, with a healthy dose of sexual suggestiveness; plenty of exposed knickers and stocking-tops to boot.As for the plot, it's perhaps a bit scatterbrained, essentially evolving around a jewel heist and a nuclear attack against N.A.T.O. There's some extravagant and impressive stunts and effects; a fight on top of an airbourne plane being no exception ! Elephant-mounted villains pursuing Bond was also a well devised sequence !As for Bond himself, a 56-year-old Roger Moore (R.I.P) was a modest choice, reflecting the mature status of the women. With his poncy but charming English accent and his only moderate muscular physique and combat skills, this combination of charm and realism resulted in a Bond you could identify with sympathize for.So, I'll give this film 8/10; sensual, evocative, poignant, extravagant, cutting-edge, and above all, reassuringly uplifting ! This was no ordinary action film !",Octopussy
198,cmt-2,Good entry,8,23 December 1998,"OCTOPUSSY is one of Moore's really great turns as 007 (the others coming in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME and FOR YOUR EYES ONLY).  Chief bad guy Khan (Jourdan) and henchman Gobinda (Bedi) are great, as are the action sequences.  Adams is passable, but Wayborn is hopeless.  As for the theme song, it's OK.  An above average entry into the series.",Octopussy
199,Orpington,Confusing but colourful Bond caper,7,13 April 2004,"1983 was the year of the ""Battle of the Bonds,"" as Roger Moore's Octopussy and Sean Connery's Never Say Never Again battled it out for Box Office supremacy.  Octopussy, with all the advantages of being an official Bond film, predictably won the contest hands down.  It deserved to as well, because not only is it the better film but it is also one of the most enjoyable of Moore's long reign as OO7.After the serious approach adopted in For Your Eyes Only, Octopussy is at first a more light-hearted affair, following Bond to India as he investigates the activities of a smuggling ring headed by Indian prince Kamal Khan and a mysterious woman known only as Octopussy (subtlety is never a strong point of Bond films).  As the film goes on, however, the tone becomes more urgent as Bond finds out that Kamal Khan is involved in a plot with renegade Soviet general Orlov to detonate a nuclear bomb at an American base in Germany, forcing our hero to become involved in a thrilling race against time to defuse the bomb. This is therefore another Bond film with a strong Cold War element and a good dose of espionage, like FYEO before it, and OO7's struggle to reach the bomb in time is tense and exciting.  Indeed, the whole film is very well made, with director John Glen ensuring that there is plenty of incident and spectacle the whole way through, and never allowing the pace to drag too much.  The scenes shot in India are colourful and atmospheric, and Glen crafts the numerous action sequences well, incorporating pretty much every traditional element of a Bond film (the car chase, the casino scene, the train fight, the plane fight and so on).  This is one Bond adventure which certainly aims to cover all the bases, and another box is ticked with the return of John Barry, who provides a decent score.  The title song, All Time High, is performed by Rita Coolidge and as Bond themes go isn't too bad. As well as good action and spectacle, Octopussy also has a pretty decent cast.  Roger Moore was now really starting to show his age, but he does turn in one of his better performances, and it helps that Octopussy, his main love interest in the film, is played by a more mature lady in the shape of Maud Adams.  This was Adams' second turn in a Bond film after her earlier appearance in The Man with the Golden Gun, and she looks suitably mysterious and exotic.  She can also act, and she and Moore work well together.  As for the villains, Louis Jourdan is suitably urbane and sinister as Kamal Khan, and Kamal's huge glowering enforcer Gobinda is one of the more memorable Bond henchmen.  Even tennis player Vijay Amritraj does not disgrace himself as Bond's Indian contact, and it is also good to see Q taking such an active role for a change, as he helps Bond in the field and even gets involved in the action.  Indeed, he is probably more involved here than he would be in Licence to Kill.Inevitably, however, the film has its weaknesses.  Steven Berkoff, sporting a terrible Russian accent, does not convince as Orlov, while Robert Brown, in his first appearance as M,  does not prove himself to be a very inspired successor to Bernard Lee.  The plot is also overcomplicated, and it is never made terribly clear quite how the smuggling ring links in with Orlov's plans for attacking the West; in fact, it might have been better to leave Orlov out of the film and just have Kamal, who gets more screen time anyway, as the mastermind behind the whole scheme.  There is also rather too much lame humour, particularly during the Indian sequences when Bond lets out Tarzan yells and tells a tiger to ""sit;"" I could also have done without OO7 struggling to defuse the bomb in a clown costume.  To be fair, however, Octopussy is generally closer in feel to FYEO than Moonraker, and the comedy is toned down as the film goes on.While not one of the very best, and more confusing than it needs to be, Octopussy is still an entertaining and accomplished piece of Bondage.  It is a pity that Moore did not call it quits here, as he originally intended to do, because Octopussy would have given him a more dignified send-off from the franchise than the one he eventually got.",Octopussy
200,petervee,"Well done James Bond film with sights and sounds and, hmm, women",7,17 January 2000,"This is a nice, easy to watch JB film, following Roger Moore in India trying to stop some jewel thieves turned traitors helping the old USSR blow up an atomic bomb in an American base in Germany. India is an interesting location as are the myriads of women (mostly extras) who are in the cast (casting would have been interesting in this movie!). The plot is a little thin (small General in the USSR against everyone else) but the action great. The alligator sub, the elephant hunt and the chase give this film what JB fans want: action. The name octopussy and the way it is used (and pronounced) in the film is also a little too much for everyone's taste in the world we live in.Overall enjoyable!",Octopussy
201,fullbug,Moore at his prime as 007,10,13 May 2017,"I honestly haven't seen all of the James Bond movies, but this one ranks in my Top 2 of the Roger Moore era (For Your Eyes Only being the other). His character is comfortable and fully developed compared to some of his earlier efforts. Some might argue too much so with the amount of humor in this movie. However, imo it just makes for a more enjoyable ride. In this regard, another review compared this movie to that of Indiana Jones...which I tend to agree. Intriguing story filled with plenty of action sequences in exotic locations, with a light sprinkling of humor throughout. What more could you ask from a movie. Scenes are also well paced, with good direction, camera work, and music score.Most of the critic websites rank this movie near the bottom of all the Bond movies. Personally, I wholeheartedly disagree. Imo, it's a full-on winner, and how anyone could possibly give it less than a 7/10 is beyond me.",Octopussy
202,ymamedy,A film which gets better with age.,10,14 August 2001,"Warning: This review may contain spoliers.After viewing this 007 adventure for the umpteenth time I now appreciate it as one of Roger Moore finer entries as James Bond.  Several picturesque Indian locations add to the resplendence of this film and the high standard of acting makes this film worth watching.Roger Moore returns for the sixth and penultimate time as 007.  We see the audacious secret agent attempting to evade a heat-seeking missile in Cuba during the pre-title sequence.  This is one of the better opening sequences in Moore's tenure as Bond.  It is evident that this movie has a decent musical score and the Bond theme is used effectively to amplify several action scenes.  The plot is quite clever and ambiguous. 
There are several high octane action sequences to look out for.  The taxi chase through the streets of Delhi is a pleasure to watch as is the scene where Bond and Octopussy are rudely interrupted by Kamal's men in the latter's bedroom.  The sequence where Octopussy's girls capture Kamal's palace is humourous.  Incidentally, the witticisms in this film are very effective; many of the puns and doubles entendres brought a smile to my lips.  It is clear that the producers wanted to bring 007 into the 80s; there are TV-watches and acid pens in this film.  Moreover, Roger Moore is not redolent of a 55 year old and he looks in good shape.  It is a shame that this was his penultimate outing as 007 because I would have liked to have seen Moore in two or three more outings as James Bond.",Octopussy
203,pbbuffyhugs,Enjoyable but far from the best,6,11 January 2006,"Original Review.......For me the entire Bond series can be easily split into two groups, Classics and the rest. The 1960's and 70's movies are the classics, Yes I am including 'Moonraker' which in my opinion is cruelly underrated.. it's an exciting, lavishly produced roller-coaster of a film. Somehow since the 80's, Bond films aren't quite in the same league. Although extremely watchable (this one excluded) and fun they just don't have the same esteem as say 'Goldfinger' 'On Her Majestys Secret Service' or 'The Spy Who Loved Me' (Probably the series last 'not a film but an event' movie). The first of the 80's - 1981's 'For Your Eyes Only' is probably the best of that decade as it rebalanced the character of Bond as someone who doesn't just rely on gadgets and at least tried to make the situations he finds himself in believable. OK 'Moonraker' is the exact opposite and I rate that highly but at least that film knew not to take itself seriously unlike this one. At one extreme you have Bond trying to convince everyone that there really is a bomb in that cannon (probably the films finest sequence along with the pre credit scenes) but then they couple that with Bond doing a Tarzan yodel swinging through the jungle and also telling a tiger to 'SIT!'. It seems to me even the film makers weren't too sure what type of film this should be.. all out serious as the previous film or all out lets-have-a-laugh ala 'Moonraker' and as a result this film is a mess. Based loosely on two books ('Octopussy' and 'Property of a Lady') the writers have come up with a plot that doesn't know which way to turn and this film is very hard going to watch. Steven Berkoff over acts, Vijay whats-his-face cannot act and mercifully gets killed after only a few scenes and even Roger Moore appears to be going through the motions. I consider myself a die hard Bond fan and even the worst film (this one) has something to redeem it, the aforementioned circus and precredit sequences are good - hence 3 stars not 1, but given a choice of watching any of the films in the series I'd pick any of the others over this one. Obviously in compiling the best to worst in any series something has to come bottom. For me it's this, however it's not just at the bottom of the barrel, it's actually got out and gone under it. Even 'View To A Kill' is more fun than this overblown, directionless and carelessly constructed wasted opportunity and if 'Die Another Day' (the 2nd worst) had followed it then they would have killed off the series stone dead. Update August 29th 2008..... I started this review by saying that the films made between 1962 - 1979 are the classics.. all 11 films made during that period only had 4 directors - Terrance Young, Guy Hamilton, Lewis Gilbert and Peter Hunt. I personally think that these 4 directors got the concept spot on. Also I have re watched this film since my original review and must admit that perhaps I was too harsh - This time round I found much to recommend it and therefore raise my opinion to 6/ 10",Octopussy
204,a2d_music,Moore's Best Bond Film,8,19 April 2000,"Without a doubt, Octopussy is undoubtedly Roger Moore'sbest outing as Bond.  For one thing, they finally got theblend of humor and action right - a problem with the earlierMoore films.  Moore somehow looks younger than he doesin ""For Your Eyes Only,"" which makes no sense (as FYEOcame before this one).  But with that comes great energyfrom old Roger, which is very welcome.The plot may be insanely complex, but it IS unquestionablyoriginal - it isn't just another megalomaniac who wants toexpunge the earth and start over in the sea or in space orwhatever.Moore may or may not be the best Bond (this is open fordebate - let me just say that Ian Fleming originally preferredMoore over Connery back in the day) - but in whatever case,Octopussy marks a high point in the series, along withGoldfinger, OHMSS, and Goldeneye.",Octopussy

He then outbids a man who looks like Ricardo Montalban in an auction and buys a Faberge egg for some reason.Cut to India. A fat bloke kills Roger's sidekick with a sort of spinning blade thing. Meanwhile, Bond turns his nose up when served monkey brains before (or possibly after) bedding the woman who died in The Man With The Golden Gun (she keeps octopuses). He also rides around in a one man submarine, disguised as a crocodile (unless that's Live And Let Die).Cut to Communist East Germany (the glamour!): Roger, disguised as a clown, defuses a nuclear bomb while Stephen Berkoff shouts a lot in the background. Oh, and there's some twins, but I can't for the life of me remember what they do (it may involve knives, it may not).Anyway, I think that's about it.

207,frannywentzel,OK I'm a sucker for films set (even partially) in the DDR,8,14 July 2006,"Roger Moore's James Bond has always seemed more a broadly drawn comic book character than a plausible human being and at first glance this film would seem to be more of the same but it does have its qualities - once you get past its schoolboy's snicker-provoking title.As usual you get a pre-titles sequence that has nothing to do with the rest of the movie. This is the big gadget sequence so lets take a few minutes to savour it...Bond is in an unnamed Central/South American country to sabotage some sort of weapons system test that happens to be next to a race track.He's caught before his bomb can detonate and is taken off by soldiers but he escapes with the aid of his Latin female accomplice - and a mini-jet she'd kept in a horse carrier behind her truck - lucky the airport was next to the track.Making his escape, he has to dodge some heat-seeking missiles which he uses to finish the job of sabotaging that test by flying through the hanger it was taking place in as soldiers try in vain to box him in by closing the hanger doors at both ends.The closer is that, after all that, he runs out of fuel and has pull into a petrol station after landing on a highway across the border. Just his luck, they don't have S&H Green Stamps.The actual movie involves a clever plot by a maverick Russian general to weaken NATO defences by causing what would look like a major nuclear ""accident"" at a US missile base. To this end he is making use of a jewelry smuggling ring based in India that in turn operates a traveling circus - as well as an obscure religious cult - as a cover for their activities.One of the high points of this movie is in the beginning with the frantic death chase of one of Bond's fellow agents across the Berlin Wall - and I'm pretty sure, past my apartment. The agent is in a clown costume so everyone who enjoys seeing a circus clown get a knife in the back just got their money's worth in the first reel. The clown makes his final exit by - very literally - crashing a party at the British Consulate with a Fabergé egg rolling from his now cold clown hands.As Dieter from Sprockets would say - Exquisite.The scenes in India are fairly hit or miss with a lot of rather clumsy joke scenes inter-mixed with his adventures there. One scene of elegance is when one of Octopussy's girls uses her sari to rappel down from James Bond's hotel balcony with the Fabergé egg he'd swiped in London. The only joke or gag that worked is when Bond staggers to a passing tour boat explaining ""I'm with the economy tour"".Back in Germany the movie gets more-or-less serious again as the mad General's diabolical scheme plays out. Here the comic relief bits work much better and play well into the drama of a countdown. Best scene is the one where the Mercedes is sent flying nearly into the lap of some hapless DDR fisherman.Not so good is when Bond dons clown attire to attempt to get to the bomb. He doesn't get a knife to the back and clowns are really only enjoyable on the screen when dying a slow excruciating death. But that's just me.The film returns to India for the final showdown making the mistake of using a hot-air balloon to spearhead the attack. The fewer movies with hot-air balloons the better. There is some nice stunt-work involving Bond hitching a ride on the roof of an aeroplane to save the girl. What a man won't do to get a little Octopussy.Overall this is not as well-polished as ""For Your Eyes Only"" and ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" but it is one of Roger Moore's better forays in the Bond series.",Octopussy
208,thomas-williamson-ga,another fresh perspective added to the Bond series,8,26 March 2011,"As I have mentioned in previous reviews, Roger Moore might be my least favorite version of James Bond though some of his 007 films have chalked up with the best of them. Octopussy would be included in that category. This is probably Moore's final enjoyable outing in the series but not his final outing total (I will cover that in my next review). This time Bond makes a unique journey to India with unique gadgets and a very suave Indian agent named BJ(?). The villain Kamal Kahn and his brutal turban-wearing sidekick make for entertaining and semi-believable threats to the 00 Agent. Plus, we have the return of actress Maud Adams who plays the central woman though not necessarily the bond girl of this title. As I've mentioned before, the Roger Moore Bond films have brought back returning characters for the sequels though in this case Octopussy brings back the actress (Maud Adams) versus the character she previously played in Man with the Golden Gun. I must add that her character is quite a welcomed change which added greatly to the main plot of this film. There is one very minor turn of events that I wasn't too fond of in Octopussy relating to a particular character's death though I won't spoil that for anyone and I can almost assure it hardly takes away from the overall film. Roger Moore could have gone out with a bang so to say had he ended his contract with Octopussy. This, however, was not the case as he went on to appear as 007 one more time in View To a Kill. On a final note, the theme song 'All Time High' is a good tune worthy of mention. Oh, just a bit of a trivia question: Did anyone notice the matching circus tent in Octopussy in which the character of JAWS might have ""dropped on top of"" during Moonraker before it? I really wonder about that...",Octopussy

Unlike Eyes Only though, which kept the typical Moore Era campiness limited, here it runs amok. I won't provide examples in an effort to avoid spoilers; let's just say there quite a few dumb moments. If you like the Moore Era approach to the series, on the other hand, you won't be disappointed. Personally I could do without the silliness. There's plenty of action and while some find the plot convoluted, it's actually fairly good (by Bond standards). The cast is a mixed bag: Sir Roger is fine as always. He actually has a few good moments where he shows some steel in contrast to his typical light-hearted self. That said; the producers should have moved on to a new actor. Sir Roger had passed his peak. Louis Jordan makes for an excellent villain and Stephen Berkoff, while completely over-the-top is a good secondary villain. The only weak link is Maud Adams who I think is a rather bland actress. Take away from some of silliness and I would have rated this one higher in my rankings.",Octopussy

Roger Moore still has his great class from when he started in 1973 ten years before this film. Octopussy is based in India,with heaps of lovely big wide city shots with a scene showing India's jungle as well.

214,stephengward,James Bond's All Time High!,10,24 March 2000,"Roger Moore's penultimate and best Bond movie. Filmed on location in India the movie has the usual fair share of exotic scenery - commonplace throughout the series. The plot involves Russian, General Orlov (Steven Berkoff), attempting to detonate a nuclear bomb on a US military base in West Germany with the intention that the US will be held responsible for the explosion. As a consequence of this, America will be forced to withdraw its military support leaving European borders open to attack from Soviet forces. Main villain of the piece though is prince Kamal Khan (Louis Jourdan), who is in league with Octopussy (Maud Adams) in a jewellery smuggling caper. ""Orlov"" uses these smuggling activities to cover up his plans to start World War III, with ""Octopussy"" unaware that she is being double crossed. ""Rita Coolidge"" performs the title song ""All Time High"" it wasn't commercially successful though personally I'm a great fan of it. Robert Brown makes his first appearance of four as Bond's crusty boss ""M"".  ""Maud Adams"" enters the 007 hall of fame as the only Bond girl ever to appear twice. Her other role was as the ill fated ""Andrea Anders"" in 1974's ""The Man With The Golden Gun"". Octopussy works because it combines the best elements of ""For Your Eyes Only"" with that of the few decent qualities of ""Moonraker"". Sadly the juvenile humour ""Moonraker"" was fraught with reappears briefly here, most notably when Bond tells a tiger to ""sit!"". This should have been ""Moore's"" last outing as 007, unwisely he decided to return one last time in ""A View To A Kill"" - 1985.",Octopussy
215,ColbyDMay,"Though long in the tooth, Moore shines in ""Octopussy""",8,23 February 2004,"Easily my favorite of the Roger Moore 007 films, ""Octopussy"" presents a well-balanced flick for the James Bond fan, or any other action-film lover, for that matter. This film features one of my favorite Bond-baddies, Kamal Khan, excellently rendered by the usually-suave ladykiller from years gone by, Louis Jourdan. According to the IMDb, Jourdan was 63 years old when this movie was made, and he certainly doesn't look it. He is sinister, articulate, and features the obligatory henchman by his side, played aptly by Kabir Bedi. In the role of leading babe ""Octopussy"" is blast-from-the-past Maud Adams, who also was featured in ""The Man With The Golden Gun"". She looks better here than she did eight years earlier, and lends an air of intelligence to her role. Many things about this film hark back to earlier Bond films in terms of their innovation and purity...the authenticity of the scenery and characters, the gadgets (including a pint-sized jet plane featured during the pre-title sequence), and, of course, the involvement of the then-Cold War-enemy Russians. The John Barry score is classy and, finally, devoid of the disco-inspired elements that marred the music from its immediate predecessor, ""For Your Eyes Only"". Some elements are silly (as they always are in action fare), such as the tennis racquet-wielding Vijay Armitraj, poorly cast as Bond's contact in India (the scene where he defeats baddies with swings of his Donnay is preposterous). But overall, one of the finer Bond films...8 out of 10.",Octopussy
216,ThomasHayden,More Moore!!!,9,1 March 2005,"Many criticized this film at the time of its release with comments like"" Moore's tongue in cheek humor has turned Bond's style into brainless films , full of silly jokes, with no plot or character development. Just look at that annoying jungle sequence with Moore parodying Tarzan."" OK I concede this scene was a dreadful idea. But its minor flaws aside, Octopussy is, in my opinion, one the greatest Bond movies to date. What makes this movie extremely compelling is its adventurous storyline, which successfully combines the classic 70's spy thriller convoluted plot with amazing, yet surrealistic, action sequences, more likely to be part of a comic book (but a good one, indeed) such as the jet escape at the beginning, which is definitely the BEST pre-credit scene in the whole series. Bond moves from England to India, and then to Germany, while he tries to find out the truth in a mysterious conspiracy involving a stolen Faberge egg and... Well, it actually doesn't make sense ...but the individual sequences are great: 009's death, the purchase of the egg at Sotheby's, Bond and Khamal first encounter at the casino, the night assault on Octopussy's palace... and that lovable seduction scene, with these memorable lines: ""We are two of the kind, there are vast rewards for a man of your talents willing to take risks / I am not for hire / Naturally you do it for queen and country, with the praise on your head. I have no country and no praise on my head... she leaves the room , Bond follows her and kisses her, replying, you were right, we are two of the kind"" Ins't it delightful?But the pleasures Octopussy delivers don't end here. Louis Jourdan plays a glamorous, icy, double-dealing villain, perfectly balancing ruthlessness and elegance. He gets this great line"" Mr. Bond, you have the nasty habit of surviving"", almost comparable to Goldfinger's ""Do you expect me to talk? No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die"" And stunningly beautiful Maud Adams gets the leading role she deserved, since she's probably the most seductive and cool of all Bond girls.And the ending gag is wonderful as well, successfully capturing the film's essence. It isn't just Bond kissing the girl again, but reminds us of the fantasy world we have lived in for two hours. I still remember what a good time I had when I saw this movie for the first time. You cannot miss this one.",Octopussy
217,jb007-5,What a year!,10,28 March 2000,"Number 13, and number 6 for Roger Moore (my favorite 007). What a year! It was released at the same time as a rival company released ""Never Say Never Again."" It's a great film. Humor, excitement- of course!! Wouldn't be a Bond film otherwise. More trivia: Maud Adams played Christopher Lee's girlfriend in the Bond film ""The Man With The Golden Gun"", a couple of years later they joined up in ""Killer Force"" (aka ""Diamond Mercenaries""). She was in fact in 3 Roger Moore/ Bond 'epics'. ""The Man With The Golden Gun"" as Andrea, this one as Octopussy and apparently she has a 'walk- on' in ""A View To A Kill."" She was busy! Well, she is a fine actress and if you like all the other 007s, you'll love this one.",Octopussy

219,CCKEITHA,Pretty Good Bond Movie,7,23 April 2020,"Of the Roger Moore Bond movies this is still one of my favorites. The plot can be a little difficult, being filled with a lot of sleight of hand. I do get a charge out of the really bad perms on Miska and Griska. I had one that bad in the 80's too. Kristine Wayburn did nothing in the film except look like an expensive model. But, that too was typical for the 80's. She is constantly licking her lips and maneuvering them as if she were preparing for the next shot. And that hairstyle! What's that about? Way too much forehead. And, typical of a dumb model, she does have the dumbest line in the movie. While she has an atomic bomb about to go off literally under her feet she turns to Maud Adams and says, ""He'll destroy the whole operation. ""What did she think the atomic bomb would do?",Octopussy
220,Boromir007,Octopussy (1983),7,8 November 2005,"Out of all the Bondfilms with Roger Moore as 007, Octopussy is the one with the most Cold War aspects, and yes, what a great atmosphere I experienced when I saw the scenes in East-Germany, truly magnificent. If you are talking about those Cold War aspects you should not forget to mention Steven Berkoff his performance of an insane Soviet general with a hunger for power. Wonderful. The other villains are memorable as well: Louis Jourdan with style and sophistication; Kabir Bedi as one of those invincible henchmen and David Meyer & Tony Meyer are deadly twin brothers with an advanced skill in the trowing of daggers. As for the girls this one features two Swedish ladies: Maud Adams and Kristina Wayborn. Both of them are very strong and they have both some lovely scenes. Vijay Amritraj is Bond his ally in India: worth watching. This is also the first of four films to feature Robert Brown as Bond his superior M. John Barry is once again present with a truly wonderful soundtrack. The film is really amusing and has a great atmosphere. Despite the claim of many critics, Roger Moore is still in good shape. The only scene that disappointed me was the one where 007 is disguised in a circus clown, that will be painful for Bondfans, but the rest of the film is great. Do not skip this one.",Octopussy
221,helenaharrison,'Property of a lady',7,16 June 2001,"Octopussy is one of Roger Moore's latter efforts, but it is one of his best. The pairing up of veteran screen actor Louis Jourdan worked a treat, and there's even some humour allowed between the two. The leading lady, Octopussy (Maud Adams) has a familiarity with Moore, and their relationship is allowed to develop throughout the story. The sets are imaginative and colourful in India, and the chase sequences leave the viewer dizzy with anticipation. This film is much better than 'A View To A Kill' as the characters are allowed to develop, and the plot is much more thorough. Octopussy is a very good attempt with very few flaws. Another film 'For Your Eyes Only' also stars Roger Moore and is definitely worth a look.",Octopussy
222,kmcollins29,The best opening in the series!! Moore's best.,9,23 February 2007,"Sure Octopussy has its slow moments, but when it's good it's easily the third best film in the series.Goldfinger and Casino Royale I would say are both better films. Moore is perfect for this style of Bond. The year that this movie came out, 1983, Sean Connery returned to the part in Warner Bros. Never Say Never Again. Octopussy blows it out of the water. I honestly don't think that this one would have been any better if Connery was Bond instead of Moore.The opening teaser sequence where 007 flies the mini jet is easily the coolest action sequence in the series and still looks extremely cool 24 years later. Louis Jourdan is one of the best villains in the series and Kristina Wayborn is my second favorite bond girl behind Luciana Paluzzi in Thunderball.Moore almost didn't do this one and James Brolin was almost cast. His screen test is included in a documentary on one of the dvds. He looks like he could have been a very good 007.",Octopussy
223,David007,James Bond at his very best!!,10,9 September 1998,"As a Bond fan for more than 20 years, I must admit I love all Bond films. But OCTOPUSSY is the best of all them all; it's also my favorite movie. Roger Moore is in top form, John Glen's direction is excellent, the plot is complex and rich, and John Barry's music is wonderful. Moreover, Louis Jourdan is a beautiful baddie, Maud Adams is one of the most interesting leading ladies, and Steven Berkoff is amazingly frightening. The cinematography is very impressive, as is the production design by Peter Lamont.What more can I say? OCTOPUSSY is skillfully made and astonishingly thrilling from its breathtaking precredits sequence to the very end. Nobody does it better!!",Octopussy
224,Titanian,Better than '90's Bonds,9,14 August 1999,"Watching this movie on Scottish TV 007 Heaven season brings back happy memories of when I first saw it during my childhood. The Cold War, atomic bomb setting looks dated but certainly has the making of a great thriller story. The locations are probably the most exotic of all the bonds. While it may not be out-standing as films generally go, it is one of the best Bonds. The auction and back gammon scenes are among the most gripping I've seen outside of the early JB's.When you look at the 80's James Bonds, there seems to be something about them that has been lost in the recent Pierce Brosnan ones. Back in the 80's James Bond was outstanding British in its style. Now, it is clearly made with the Americans in mind. I think what is missing is probably the traditional ingredients of a spy thriller that have been replaced by the mundane pedestrian Hollywood action/adventure styles of the most recent ones.",Octopussy

This film has an easy to understand plot unlike most of the other ones and it doesn't waste time on action, by that I mean it doesn't spend a lot of time talking it gets straight to the point. Plus this film has two of my favorite villains Magda and Octopussy. My favorite villain is Magda and Fiona Volpe. Anyways, this film is very underrated and often given bad reviews but I don't agree at all with those people. Everyone should watch this film because it's the best. Hope my review helped.",Octopussy

A rogue Russian general would have to be insane to arrange such an incident. Never mind that it was made to look like a US bomb. A US satellite would detect the gamma rays from the explosion, and Rapid Deployment Bombers, RDBs, would immediately head for the USSR as a reflex action that could not be stopped. The concern is what the Soviets would do when all these RDBs showed up on their radar, with no Nato exercises scheduled for that day. If they calmly waited until they halted at their fail safe points, well and good. But they would also have detected the nuclear explosion, and they might decide to launch a preemptive strike. And it is precisely because he is a rogue general that it would be difficult for him to prevent this.",Octopussy

The train stuff onwards is more dark but still has silly stuff like bond in a clown outfit but the film makes it work, roger moore gives a fantastic performance in that scene he is dead serious and the scene is tense as hell as bond has to stop a bomb

228,aclasschris,"Roger Moore's BEST BOND, quite possibly the BEST BOND EVER?",10,5 January 2006,"In 1983, two different 007 adventures were released into theaters. One was the official 007, the other was a cheesy impostor. 'Never Say Never Again' was released as ""bond's greatest adventure"" but what many have come to realize is that 'Never Say Never Again' is simply a re- make of 'Thunderball'. Even the return of a much grayer, more tired Sean Connery could not keep this Bond adventure alive, besides the fact that MGM/UA had no part in the production of this film. But another 007 adventure was released that year and to many it is considered the greatest Bond film of all time, 'Octopussy'.'Octopussy' starred Roger Moore in his sixth outing as Agent 007 and was directed by John Glen, the man who also directed Moore's second best Bond film, 'For Your Eyes Only'. Unlike 'FYEO' we return to some of the humor and charm that Moore has always been known for. We also see the return of veteran 'Bond Girl', Maud Adams as Octopussy. The plot in this film is a bit more far fetched then 'FYEO' but it works on all levels. The film is exotic, with Bond traveling to India for the first time in the series, it's also well put together and has enough action and humor to interest new and old fans alike. Many say that Roger Moore was too old for the role but one of the main reasons this film works is because Roger Moore isn't trying to be a young agile Bond like Timmothy Dalton or Pierce Brosnan. Moore plays a more mature character, sort-of a veteran secret agent. Everything works in this film and is by far the greatest Roger Moore Bond film and arguably the best film in the entire series. Moore should have played it smart and ended on a high note with 'Octopussy', sort-of a grand finale, rather then extend his career through the abysmal 'A View To A Kill'.",Octopussy

Basically a succession of high-octane, spectacularly staged action, chase and fight scenes, with a huge dose of very dry British humour, original twists, story ideas and high-class style. The chase scene in India after bond's arrival there is almost worth all the money this film might cost you. Goes on for a bit too long, but great, harmless fun for adults all the way.

Roger Moore is showing his age! I think he may have been 55 in 1983. The stunts and action sequences e.g. the acrostar mini jet, are excellent as is the photography by Alan Hume but the plot is disappointing and mixed. The film was in competition with a rival James Bond production of the time, Never Say Never Again starring Sean Connery. The film has India as a main location as well as Berlin and Germany. Witness Roger Moore modelling a safari suit in the jungle scene and doing a tarzan yell! Q adds some humour to the movie, especially in the action packed finale with the Octopussy girls. Gadgetry such as LCD TV wristwatches and acid pens are used in the movie. The Union Jack emblazed balloon that Bond and Q use adds some Britishness to the production. The things I do for England! The MI6 office team of M and Moneypenny are showing their age and the film adds Miss. Penelope Smallbone to the cast as Moneypenny's assistant. She was sadly no longer seen in the series! The theme song by Rita Coolidge of 'All Time High' is different to the usual Bond themes and doesn't mention Octopussy in the lyrics at all.",Octopussy

235,megabeady3,"FLAWED, BUT ULTIMATELY ENTERTAINING ROGER MOORE ERA FLUFF",6,17 November 2004,"All in all, Octopussy is a slightly above average movie. If I were Roger Ebert, my thumb would be up--but just barely. I like Roger Moore because of his sense of humor and the elegant confidence in which he carries himself in the Bond role, but he lacks the edginess of the slightly better Sean Connery. I like the ladies in the film, especially Maud Adams, who plays the title character. As fair as villains go, Louis Jourdan as Kamal Khan is below average. He is urbane (like Bond), but lacks the menace to be among the best Bond villains. Baddies like Goldfinger, Dr. No, and Blofeld were great because you really felt that menace. But other than one scene in he eats the eyeball of a sheep, he is too ordinary. The best Bond villains are scary whackjobs bent on world domination.The scenes in India are very good, with a real sense of the exotic. I especially liked the scenes with Bond and Q (the slapstick routine actually works here). The scenes in Germany are a mixed bag. There is some genuine tension when Bond tries to defuse the bomb, but did the folks at Eon really need Roger Moore to dress up as a clown when he does it? Sometimes, he one-liners and sight gags need to be put away, especially in the end of the films. Still, Octopussy is a decent film, and the stunt work at the very begging (Bond inside a plane) and the very end (Bond OUTSIDE a plane), are good moments indeed. Octopussy is still better than most of the brainless action pictures of the last five years or so.",Octopussy
236,rogercmorgan,A very well made film.,10,26 March 2021,"I went to see this at the cinema in 1983 when it came out, I oved it then and I still do. By the time The Spy who Loved Me came out, Roger Moore had honed his style and the scripts were now suiting his style of acting, what you get with Octopussy is a very finely crafted film, the balance between the acting, the dialogue and the stunts and the opening credit with Roger Moore's James bond breaking into a warehouse compound to plant an explosive device and then escaping using a training jet. The stunts and props work very well though you realize in the back shot after the plane leaves the hanger that he's not really flying the plane. This is the only dated gaff though, because the film goes from strength to strength, Louis Jourdan plays a brilliant baddie, and the film exudes charm and class that is sadly missing in today's modern film making values. The premise of the Faberge egg, the raising of capital, the Soviets who were becoming more and more the friend of the West whilst rogues were taking advantage of the Detente going on between the Russians and the West at the time. A theme used in the previous film for your eyes only and the next film, A view to a kill. This film marks the beginning of the end for Roger Moore as James Bond, but it shows why he managed to keep the Bond franchise going very strong for his term playing the role for twelve years.",Octopussy
237,omrod,Awful Bond epitomises the cartoonery of the Moore era,1,9 November 2009,I have loved all things Bond since devouring the books in the fifties causing my being late for school (a school previously attended by Roger Moore his father being a local policeman)I adore Moore as a person and as an institution on the world stage but never as James Bond. Lewis Gilbert and he have a lot to answer for by introducing Magnificent 7 music and camel rides etc leading eventually to Beach Boys music during periods of potential excitement. By the time of Octopussy Sean was returning in the rogue production Never Say Never Again so Brocolli threw everything bar the kitchen sink into the 13th official Bond. The cartoon villains and one line end of the pier humour grated on me with Bond now a tired male model bed hopping around the world with even the music appearing as a form of caricature.The stark realism of the wonderful Daniel Craig was unimagineable then ( Moore running up a crane?) but Roger in Post Office ads was'nt. Roger definitely appealed more to the female audience but i think took the humour too far. Poor film and in my view Casino Royale (2006) was the 4th Bond film after Connery's first three.,Octopussy

This is Bond at its worst and it's sad to see Roger Moore, a fine gentleman and actor, associated with this farce. Not to mention that Moore has some great moments as Bond during his 10+ year run. I only wish to mention a few bad things, because everything is pretty much awful in this movie: from the preposterous tuk tuk chase, to the disgraceful stereotype of India, to the bizarre humorous twists that only the production team seems to get (swear to god, there's yet a guy looking at his bottle of wine wondering if he's had to much to drink and I bet it's the same actor from all the previous movies).

There's also a guy with a blade spinning device, which i found to be pretty cool. The locations are fantastic and you get a real sense of culture like in all Bond films.
