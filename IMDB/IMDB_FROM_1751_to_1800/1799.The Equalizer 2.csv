0,Leofwine_draca,As good as the first,8,30 December 2018,"THE EQUALIZER 2 sees director Antoine Fuqua and star Denzel Washington return to the format of the successful first movie for a sequel which is equally as good. It's very much along the lines of the first, with Washington carrying out day-to-day revenge missions as a sideline to his main job as an Uber driver. The revenge plot kicks into gear around halfway through, and from then on in it's a slow build leading up to a clever and memorable climax in a deserted town during a hurricane, of all things. Washington is effortlessly menacing and charismatic as the lead and while there's not a wealth of action, sequences do come regularly and are directed with aplomb and freshness. The film doesn't skimp on the suspense either, with a particularly good bit involving two bad guys hunting for a kid hiding out in a house.",The Equalizer 2
1,SnoopyStyle,solid action thriller,7,9 November 2018,"Ex-intelligence operative Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) works as a mobile app driver. He enjoys his customers while delivering vigilante justice to those deserving it. He helps his neighbors and mentors local young man Miles. His friend and former operative Susan is killed in a presumed robbery but his investigation uncovers a murderous conspiracy.Director Antoine Fuqua and star Denzel Washington reunite for the sequel. Like the TV show, there's a new victim every week and Chloë Grace Moretz does not return for this one. I would have liked more time with Susan who is the victim of the week. The opening train sequence is unnecessary. It would have been better to have Robert fighting the rich sleazes in the high-rise or the staged suicide-murder. That suicide-murder is really frightening and would set off the tension very well instead of the disconnected Robert train incident. With more time with Dave and Susan, the personal stakes become much higher and the intensity is raised. I do like Robert's mentoring of Miles and I wouldn't mind if Miles returns for another sequel. This is a solid action thriller even if the villains' one-henchman-at-a-time tactics is silly old timey.",The Equalizer 2
2,boblipton,Acts Of Kindness And Death,5,20 December 2020,"Denzel Washington is back as Robert McCall, the ex-CIA operative who's trying to lead a moral life since the death of his wife. Much of the movie is taken up with his attempts to make sure that Ashton Sanders doesn't fall into the gang life, but works on his arts and reads classic books. However, when his old pal from the Agency, Melissa Leo, is brutally murdered by some ex-CIA thugs. McCall takes off his ring and has a Sergio Leone-inspired showdown with a squad of killers.I'm not sure what, if anything, there is in this script to make director Antoine Fuqua and Washington each make their first sequels. Perhaps they simply enjoy working with each other, and this was the project at hand; it was their fourth collaboration. For me, despite the usual graceful portrayal by Denzel Washington, I was not terribly engrossed. Probably it's Fuqua fascination with nastiness and violence for the sake of violence.",The Equalizer 2
3,Prismark10,Ewar Woowar,4,31 October 2018,"The Equalizer 2 is a long way away from its television roots.Former agent Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) spends his days as a Lyft taxi driver. He helps out people in his neighbourhood such as rescuing the abducted daughter of the local bookshop owner.When his former colleague in the agency Susan Plummer (Melissa Leo) is killed in Brussels. McCall exercises his aging muscles to find her killers.The Equalizer 2 is a flabby sequel, with a dull and predictable plot. The treacherous bad guy was easy to spot although the climactic action scenes while the hurricane lashes was entertaining.Also how long was the time between McCall returning from Turkey and resuming his driving duties? His hair grew back very quickly!",The Equalizer 2
4,nogodnomasters,I Expect a Five Star Rating.,9,30 July 2018,"The film gives us a quick view of Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) doing what he does best. Next we see him as a Lyft Driver in Boston, no longer the odd neat freak hermit from the first feature. As a driver, this develops several unconnected subplots, one of which doesn't fit in. Then folks start to die, and he investigates, getting too close. We know the character now and the ""MacGyver"" style of assassination is less intense and less spectacular in the second feature, but still entertaining. Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",The Equalizer 2
5,kosmasp,More but not just the same,7,13 November 2018,"Now depending on how you will see things, you may like the way this goes story-wise or you may hate it. First of all it's not just a rehash of what we saw in the first movie. It also tries to combine a few storylines, that tie together more or less. You have an elderly, a young student sort of thing, a mentor thing and what the Equalizer is good at of course.Now some may feel that it all is a bit convoluted. Others may cherish that it tries so many things and steers things away from what the first one achieved (being straight forward and all). I liked the sequel even though I didn't expect it to go that way at all. Still it has some really good stunts and there is obviously violence too. With the charisma of Denzel you can never really go wrong character wise either of course. Strong sequel overall",The Equalizer 2
6,jboothmillard,The Equalizer 2,5,27 August 2018,"The first movie, based on the TV show with Edward Woodward, was an average but fairly slick and fun watch, I was looking forward to what I was hoping to be an even better sequel, directed by Antoine Fuqua (Training Day, Olympus Has Fallen, The Magnificent Seven). Basically ormer Marine and Defense Intelligence Agency spy Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) now lives in urban Massachusetts and works as a Lyft taxi driver, but with the help of old friend Susan Plummer (Melissa Leo) he still helps the less fortunate. This includes a trip to Istanbul to retrieve a bookstore owner's daughter who was kidnapped by her father, helping a woman from being drugged and raped by a group of men, and elderly Holocaust survivor Sam Rubinstein (Orson Bean) who is looking for a painting for his daughter. McCall discovers that the courtyard across from his apartment has been vandalised by graffiti, young resident Miles Whittaker (Ashton Sanders) is artistic but has a troubled background, but McCall accepts his offer to repaint the walls. Susan and DIA operative Dave York (Pedro Pascal), McCall's former teammate, are investigating the apparent murder-suicide of an agent and his wife in Brussels. When Susan returns to her hotel following this investigation, she encounters the assailants and is killed, after hearing about her death, McCall immediately investigates her death and the case she was on. McCall determines that the assailants knew where Susan was located and were hired to kill her, also that the murder-suicide incident was in fact a murder, and Susan's death is connected to it, he tells this to York. While on a driving shift, an assailant poses as a passenger and attempts to kill him, McCall kills him, taking his phone to get information on who sent him. The next morning, McCall visits York, appearing to need assistance to break the assailant's phone encryption, however he has already broken the encryption, he knows that York ordered the hit on both him and Susan. York admits it, and that he killed Susan himself, as the two assailants failed to do so, he states that she would have found out he was behind the killing of the agent and his wife in Brussels, he rants about the dark choices he made after McCall faked his own death. McCall then meets his three teammates: Resnik (Jonathan Scarfe), Ari (Kazy Tauginas), and Kovac (Garrett Golden), threats are exchanged between them. Resnik and Ari head to Susan's house to kill her husband Brian (Bill Pullman), but McCall intercepts before they can find him. Later, York and Kovac infiltrate McCall's apartment, Miles is there painting his walls, McCall on the phone initially helps him to evade them, but they manage to capture him, and deduce where McCall will go next. As a hurricane moves in, McCall returns to his seaside hometown, which has been evacuated due to the storm. Kovac, Ari, and Resnik go after McCall, while York situates himself at the town's watchtower with a sniper's rifle. Kovac is killed in a tackle shop with a harpoon gun; Ari is disturbed and caught off guard seeing photos of Susan along the way, McCall stabs him; and Resnik is lured and trapped in McCall's wife's old bakery and killed by a grenade. An enraged York shoots at his car, which has Miles tied up in the trunk, the storm is growing heavier, York is knocked down before being confronted by McCall atop the tower. McCall gets the upper hand, stabs York, and shoves him over the edge, York falls to his death onto the rocks and is washed away into the ocean. McCall retrieves Miles from the trunk and takes him to his old house to treat his wounds. Back in Massachusetts, McCall uses Susan's information about the painting Sam was looking for to help reunite Sam with his long-lost sister, Miles finishes the painting of the apartment complex and returns to school to focus on his art, and McCall moves into his old house and looks out to a calm sea. Also starring Sakina Jaffrey as Fatima. Washington remains cool and charismatic as the retired skilled agent working now as what is essentially an Uber driver, the perfect way to hear people's problems for him to solve, being the aggressive good Samaritan with ""special skills"", I will admit the pace of this follow-up is not as slick as before, it takes a while for any proper action to occur, and the story is a little up and down, but when the scraps do happen, the best being the final showdown, it does work, the original is a bit better, but this is not a bad thriller drama sequel. Worth watching!",The Equalizer 2
7,Quinoa1984,"could've been better, could've been a lot worse. Denzel's first sequel: it's ok",5,30 July 2018,"As much as this is in the first half an ad for Lyft, if this can also get even a few people interested in digging in to Ta-Nehisi Coates' Between the World and Me, it should be seen as a successful endeavor (however a minor point that seems).And yet this is one of those times sitting in a theater where I could feel the sagginess and off-pace of the narrative. This is all too long and not interesting enough; the first movie had the element of taking the audience off its guard because (if one was going in totally blind) McCall doesnt do his expert Batman/Ritchie era Sherlock Holmes fighting until a half hour into it. Here, it's like getting a season of a TV show condensed into two hours, but that ironically makes it feel longer (I could imagine a season could let us see development between Miles, the second tier kid from Moonlight, and McCall, but here it has to be condensed so it can eventually catch up with the main plot involving Melissa Leo and her demise).Some of the action is still solid, and the hurricane ending is enjoyably staged, but it's that thing where a director is capable of individual scenes and set pieces, and then when it all is strung together it doesn't all work. With a lessor star this would have been really interminable, or if the action had been even chopper than it is. 5.5/10",The Equalizer 2
8,CinemaSerf,Disappointing conclusion (I hope) to the franchise.,6,11 July 2020,"Sadly, this is not a patch on the first one. When his friend (Melissa Leo) is brutally murdered in her apartment (and it takes quite a while for us to get to that point) Denzel Washington determines to study every piece of evidence he can find to discover and track down the perpetrators. After a while, this all gets particularly close to home for ""McCall"" - the former CIA Black Ops man. It tries, hard, to stay interesting but the underlying plot is muddled and uninteresting; the acting - aside from a competent Washington is mediocre; which is, frankly, all the writing requires - and the last twenty minutes relies heavily on a major storm to generate anything like the suspense needed. It's not awful, but it's not very good either.",The Equalizer 2
9,zardoz-13,"Slow Burn, Second-Rate Sequel",5,30 July 2018,"Denzel Washington reprises his title role as the imperturbable troubleshooter-for-hire in director Antoine Fuqua's crime thriller ""The Equalizer 2,"" but this second-rate sequel isn't half as hypnotic as Fuqua's flawless original. ""The Equalizer 2"" suffers from several serious shortcomings. First, the American villains here are neither as intimidating nor as challenging as the tattooed Russian mobsters in the predecessor. Indeed, our hero slew more Russian ruffians in ""The Equalizer"" than he does American adversaries in the sequel. Not only did he annihilate more Russians, but he also blew up their supertankers. He rooted out corruption in the Boston Police Department tied to the Russians, and he sent FBI Agent Mosely a detailed breakdown of all those public officials on the Russian mob's payroll! Afterward, he flew to Russia, confronted mobster boss Vladimir Pushkin (Vladimir Kulich), and then wiped out Pushkin's entire army of hoodlums. Second, the youth-in-jeopardy, superbly played by ""Moonlight's"" Ashton Sanders, constitutes more of a stereotype compared with Ralphie (Johnny Skourtis), the obese Hispanic security guard in ""The Equalizer."" Few movies have been made about obese Hispanic security guards than troubled inner city African-American youngsters throwing their lives away on narcotics. Third, although he fights for noble causes, Robert McCall is basically determined to thrash the thugs that bumped off a close friend who once worked with him at the C.I.A. Mind you, McCall cannot walk away from these contract killers any more than he could the vile Russians, so he dispatches them with extreme prejudice, too. Unfortunately, the older female spy here isn't as sympathetic as the struggling young prostitute (Chloë Grace Moretz) in the first film. Fourth, ""The Equalizer 2"" talks too much time, and the meandering film never really generates an adrenaline-laced sense of momentum. Fifth, three usually competent scenarists-one of whom actually scripted the 1984-1989 ""Equalizer"" television series starring Edward Woodward--make everything absurdly simple for our skilled hero so he can rout the opposition. The best thing that the script does is foreshadow the foul weather that crops up to complicate the cat and mouse finale. ""The Equalizer 2"" takes Robert McCall back to his days at the CIA before the events of the first film. ""Expendables 2"" writer Richard Wenk, Michael Sloan of the television ""Equalizer,"" and TV's ""B.J. and the Bear"" scribe Richard Linheim explore not only Robert McCall's enigmatic origins but also reveal tidbits about his late wife. For example, we find out that she ran a bakery. If they make another sequel, Antoine and Denzel should plunge back in time for a prequel, so we can learn what made McCall tick as well as his wife. Yes, McCall still lives in Boston, Massachusetts, but he works now as a Lyft cab driver. Meantime, if you saw the first ""Equalizer,"" you know McCall consulted former CIA analyst Susan Plummer (Melissa Leo of ""Oblivion"") and her husband Brian (Bill Pullman of ""Independence Day"") in his battle with the Russians. McCall sought out Susan to provide him with information about the identity of his adversaries. Instead of standing on the sidelines as she did in ""The Equalizer,"" Susan Plummer plays the character of central importance in ""The Equalizer 2."" Indeed, she dies in Brussels, Belgium, on an assignment to investigate a crime involving an apparent murder and suicide that stinks of duplicity. Two thuggish tweakers tackled Susan in her high-class motel room when she was alone. She stabbed one of her assailants in the thigh, and his accomplice suffered some staggering blows. Nevertheless, despite her best efforts, Susan wound up on an autopsy table. A shocked and saddened Robert McCall drops everything and rushes off to Washington, D.C., to visit Brian and get all the gritty details. Furthermore, McCall reunites with one of his former associates, Dave York (""Narcos"" star Pedro Pascal), who had accompanied Susan to Brussels. York is simply shocked to learn that McCall has been alive all this time. He thought his old associate had died. McCall scrutinizes everything about the crime. In a scene reminiscent of ""The Boondocks Saints,"" our hero imagines himself in the dining room of the Belgium couple during the commission of the crime. In ""The Boondocks Saints,"" an FBI agent walked through a crime as the criminals committed it. McCall discovers things about the murder that arouses his suspicions. Eventually, after an assassin struggles to kill him in his Lyft cab, Washington's McCall uncovers the missing link, solves the mystery, and exposes the felons. Meantime, when he isn't agonizing over Susan's demise, McCall is selflessly helping out less fortunate others.Despite all these flaws, Fuqua stages quite a few exciting action scenes. As brazen as any indestructible Steven Seagal character, Denzel Washington's Robert McCall enters confrontations where his opponents outnumber him more than four to one and he eliminates them with split-second timing. You know what is going to happen when McCall sets the timer on his wristwatch, and then wades into the heavies. Some of the joy of ""The Equalizer 2"" is listening to the pulsating orchestral scores that precedes his destruction of the villains. The drawback here is that when a hero is as invincible as McCall, he ceases to be believable. Nevertheless, Denzel Washington delivers another plausible portrayal of a man that you would rather have as your friend rather than your enemy. In ""The Equalizer 2,"" Denzel resembles a self-sufficient Charles Bronson character who never loses his cool and can improvise under the worst conditions. You'd think with the passage of four years that Antoine Fuqua and his writers could come up with something far better than this sequel. Sadly, despite a convincing cast and some suspenseful showdowns, ""The Equalizer 2"" qualifies as a humdrum sequel that barely scratches the surface of a hero whose true depth of character has yet to be shown in all of his glory.",The Equalizer 2
10,george.schmidt,Washington continues to excel in this power-driven sequel to a budding franchise tailor made for his talents,8,22 July 2018,"THE EQUALIZER 2 (2018) *** Denzel Washington, Melissa Leo, Pedro Pascal, Ashton Sanders, Orson Bean, Bill Pullman, Jonathan Scarfe, Sakina Jaffrey. Washington reprises his role as redeemer come avenger Rober McCall and this time it's personal: when a dear friend is killed in an international investigation he begins to unravel a conspiracy of murder while attempting to keep his domestic life in check and demons at the door. Filmmaker Antonie Fuqua reunites with his star again and both continue to work well together allowing the star wattage to overpower the murky screenplay by Richard Wenk (based on the '80s TV crime drama on CBS) Skillful action and some surprisingly affective dramatic moments with Washington prove there's more meat on the bone of this genre actioner.",The Equalizer 2
11,view_and_review,"A Little Less Action, A Little More Substance",7,29 July 2018,"The Equalizer 2 had less action and less fighting than the first but it was no less good. It had a more serious and somber tone and it was definitely more cerebral. Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) was on the trail of those responsible for his friend's death. He had to use some shrewd investigative skills to discover whether or not her death was intentional and who the killers were. But, while Robert was dealing with that he still had time to do some clean up in his hometown of Boston--and I mean clean up in every sense of the words.I liked the different characters in this movie and I particularly liked Robert's interaction with Miles (Ashton Sanders), the young African American male headed down the wrong path. The high-energy, pulse-racing fights weren't aplenty like the first installment but in their place was a little more substance. It was a fine trade off.",The Equalizer 2
12,neil-476,"Not bad, but not as good as the first one",7,25 August 2018,"Robert McCall has accepted his new role as someone who will stand up - violently, if necessary - for those who cannot stand up for themselves. Then Susan, his CIA contact who we met in the first film, is killed in suspicious circumstances, and suddenly McCall finds himself back in a world he thought he had left.Denzel Washington reprises his instrument of writing wrongs with extreme prejudice in a story which reveals more of his background, not that it was necessary. The baddie is no surprise - if you don't identify him immediately then you have probably never seen a film like this before. And, if the main plot is satisfactory if unsurprising, there are a lot of little side plots which work well.It's a shame about the final set piece - it goes on too long and isn't a patch on the inventiveness of the DIY warehouse showdown in the original. I enjoyed it, though.",The Equalizer 2
13,Uriah43,An Assassin's Assassin,6,16 March 2020,"This film essentially begins with the former assassin named ""Robert McCall"" (Denzel Washington) traveling on a train in Turkey and going to the dining car to get a cup of tea. While there he notices four men sitting at a table and when one of them comes over to talk to him Robert begins to discuss the repercussions for stealing a mother's daughter out of spite. Unaccustomed to being talked to in such a manner a fight immediately breaks out with Robert severely hurting all of them. Not long afterward the young girl is returned to her mother in Boston while Robert goes about his normal business there as an uber driver where he meets several different people with problems that he becomes involved with. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a decent film which was mired to a degree by too many subplots which meandered all over the place. Even so, Denzel Washington performed in his usual outstanding manner which gave this film a bit more appeal than it otherwise would have had and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",The Equalizer 2
14,Wizard-8,It's okay... if seen under the right circumstances,6,18 April 2019,"I though that the first ""Equalizer"" movie, while predictable, was a well-crafted exercise despite the script being nothing new. So I was interested to see how this sequel would play out. As it turns out, the story this time around is just as predictable as the first movie. For example, the ""surprise"" twist in the second half of the movie is no surprise at all. And the climatic action sequence is just a variation of the ""deserted warehouse"" action climaxes we have seen in countless other action movies before. What really weakens the movie, however, is how slow it is, particularly in the first half. While the relaxed pace is to a degree refreshing in an age of hyperkinetic action movies, the movie is ultimately TOO slow; you'll soon be egging the movie on to get on with it. I admit that I was never bored by the movie, and Washington does do a good job with what he's given, so I don't regret seeing it. However, I would only recommend the movie to viewers who (1) don't mind seeing very familiar plot elements for the umpteenth time, (2) are in a very patient mood, and (3) don't pay any money to watch it.",The Equalizer 2
15,bombersflyup,"There are two kinds of pain in this world. The pain that hurts, the pain that alters.",5,13 December 2019,"The Equalizer 2 is slow moving and more of the same, but Denzel's acting and the character he plays is just boss.Miles is on the annoying side. I mean, you can sit in a hidden room for a few minutes and be silent without having a fit and then rest in there a while after the killers have gone, bit stupid. He also happens to be a great artist, okay. Denzel has an incredibly strong moment with him though, after rescuing him from the hoodlums. Pedro Pascal looked guilty before he even did anything, big surprise that one. He offers very little of a performance as well.",The Equalizer 2
16,FlashCallahan,The Sequalizer......,6,30 July 2018,"Robert McCall's past cuts especially close to home when thugs kill Susan Plummer....his best friend and former colleague. Now out for revenge, McCall must take on a crew of highly trained assassins who'll stop at nothing to destroy him.......The first film was a pretty perfunctory movie adaption of an eighties TV show with a really sadistic ending that veered toward slasher territory, and it made the film stand out just that little bit more.Whenever Washington makes a new film, there is always an anticipation of greatness, because he has never put in a bad performance, even in Virtuosity.and when he works with Fuqua, there is even a little more, because of the wonderful work they did together on Training Day.And while the sequel is a fine film and compliments the original, there is something underlying that makes it a little underwhelming, because there is a wonderful narrative that's laying in there waiting to get out.The opening scene is a homage to the first fight scene in the original, and this narrative point of the film would have made a good film in itself, but it's a pleasant enough opening, showing that McCall is still a force to be reckoned with.And then we are with McCall and his job at psuedo Uber, meeting people, comforting them, and making their journey all that little more bearable. Again, there is an amazing narrative here which would have made a better sequel, involving a drugged girl, and some sleazy men. This had potential to be something that could have gone a lot deeper, but the writers decide to go for the traditional revenge plot, which isn't really exciting, or very memorable.But it's still a worthy sequel, we have a Karate Kid sub plot where McCall is philosophising to a ne'er do well teenager whom McCall sees great potential in, but then this is only integrated to the plot when the teen comes into danger.Halfway through the second act, the obvious villain reveals himself, Washington spouts some threatening lines with glee, and we end up with a finale that looks like it was filmed on the same set as Hurricane Heist.And this is the problem with the film, it does the exact opposite of the first, and in doing this, gives the viewer false hope for a better film than the first.The first films two acts were perfectly fine, but a little predictable, but the finale was so over the top, so out of sorts from the rest of the film, it made the film excel from what it should have been.This has two wonderful first acts, that really get inside the character of McCall, and then the final set piece is bizarrely dull, and feels rushed, and unsatisfactory.Washington doesn't disappoint, and the rest of the cast are fine, but it goes for the safe revenge narrative, and is let down by a below par finale.",The Equalizer 2
17,phd_travel,More character and story than the usual action flick,8,3 September 2018,"This isn't a kill a minute type action movie. There is action but there is quite a lof of story too. Although Denzel's efficient killing machine is a bit like Liam Neeson in Taken - an older guy who obviously doesn't do his own stunts but manages to take out the entire room of bad guys. But I like the invincibility of the character. There is quite a lot of plot around the killing with Holocaust survivor friend, a neighborhood teen who requires saving from gangs, and his uber driving. The pace may be slow for some but it makes the action more meaningful when it happens. Big role for Narcos's agent Pena Pedro Pascal who shows his versatility here as an agent.

The pain that hurts, the pain that alters.'",8,23 December 2018,"Director Antoine Fuqua (Training Day, The Magnificent Seven, Olympus Has Fallen, The Equalizer) once again works with Denel Washington in an arresting continuation of THE EQUALIZER, now Part 2. The film is very dark and brutal and presented with excellent photography (Oliver Wood) and a decent script (Richard Wenk and Michael Sloan), but the final result is a bit belabored and less involving than the first Equalizer.Former Marine and Defense Intelligence Agency spy Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) now lives in a diverse apartment complex in urban Massachusetts. He is working as a Lyft driver and assists the less fortunate with the help of his friend, Susan Plummer (Melissa Leo). McCall anonymously travels to Istanbul by train to retrieve a local bookstore owner's daughter who was kidnapped by her father. He also helps Sam Rubinstein (Orson Bean), an elderly Holocaust survivor who is looking for a painting of his sister; the two siblings were separated when they were transported to different camps by the Nazis, but the painting is found to be auctioned off and Sam cannot prove that he owns it. After discovering that the apartment courtyard has been vandalized, McCall accepts an offer from Miles Whittaker (Ashton Whitaker), a young resident with an artistic but troubled background, to repaint the walls.

When the two separate after reaching their hotel, Susan is murdered in an apparent robbery and the chase and investigation plows forward.Washington and the rest of the cast are excellent, but the pacing is off and what could have been accomplished in 90 minutes exceeds two hours - at times tedious.

20,Hellmant,"I really enjoyed the third act, but not so much the first two.",7,20 July 2018,"'THE EQUALIZER 2': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A sequel to the 2014 hit action flick based on the 1980's TV series (of the same name). Denzel Washington returns as Robert McCall, a retired CIA Black Ops operative, turned vigilante, who this time wants revenge for the murder of a friend. The sequel was once again directed by Antoine Fuqua (a usual partner of Denzel's, many times now), and Richard Wenk also returned to write the screenplay. The movie costars Pedro Pascal, Ashton Sanders, Jonathan Scarfe, Melissa Leo and Bill Pullman. It's gotten mixed reviews from critics, and it's projected to be a modest hit at the Box Office as well (the first one was a big one). I really enjoyed the third act, but not so much the first two. Robert McCall (Washington) is now working as a Lyft driver, who sometimes acts as a vigilante still (especially when he picks up a woman who's been assaulted by a group of young privileged white men). Then one day Robert learns that his good friend Susan Plummer (Leo) has been murdered. He of course investigates the crime, and learns that an old associate was involved. McCall of course then returns to his violent vigilante ways full time, until revenge is accomplished. The movie is really slow-paced and uninvolving (at least in my opinion) for more than fifty percent of the film. Then it picks up though, at about the beginning of the third act. There are some entertaining and interesting moments before that, but I was mostly bored with the movie until the big climax. The climax is pretty cool though, and there's some awesome Denzel action hero moments in it. The scene where Denzel gets revenge for the assaulted young woman (early in the film) is pretty cool too. It's not as good as the original definitely though, or as entertaining as most Fuqua/Washington action flicks are.",The Equalizer 2

i was so bummed out that the friend turned out to be the bad guy, which i almost immediately guessed, and even thought i hope they don't go this typical lame route. and the hurricane thing wasn't really utilized well. not sure it was necessary. i felt like they just copied off of hurricane heist, which even though you can't take it seriously, was much more entertaining than this",The Equalizer 2

It was one of those films that was just crying out for a sequel, even though it was almost guaranteed to be not as good, even with the original director, Antoine Fuqua, and original star Denzel Washington, reuniting. And so it's not a big surprise that this does turn out to be the case with The Equalizer 2, but luckily, it's still far from a failure.The action is as brutal and unflinching as the first instalment, and Washington is once again solid as the methodical, precise, soft spoken hardman. There's also a well staged finale set during a hurricane. Fuqua adds some effective depth to the proceedings with some nice human drama, with McCall trying to help old Jewish guy Sam (Orson Bean) and misguided street kid Miles (Ashton Sanders.) All of this manages to be sufficiently distracting from a weaker, less satisfying villain than the original, and a less straightforward story, that doesn't move as pleasingly from A to B than the last one, maybe trying to be a little too ambiguous and complex for something so distracting.Inevitable seems to sum this one up. It's inevitable it was made, it's inevitably not quite as good as the first film and it's inevitable I went to see it anyway, but it's not something I regret, something as solid and dependable as it could hope to be. If they want to make a 3, I won't lose any sleep. ***",The Equalizer 2
23,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Long, unfocused and messy; even a fairly interesting set of villains and a compelling finale can't quite save it.",5,19 August 2018,"'The Equalizer 2 (2018)' feels very long and unfocused. As counter-intuitive as it may seem, though, that lack of focus essentially forces it into featuring much more of the stuff that's less narratively-important but is actually more enjoyable and 'rewarding' from a character point of view, the stuff that doesn't directly involve killing folk or otherwise maiming them in any way (though this seeps into every story-strand at some point or another). Still, our 'hero' is as cold-blooded as ever and he always seems to escalate every situation into a life-or-death one no matter its initial severity. This time, however, the film does manage to move its emphasis somewhat away from apparent endorsement - or having the violence appear to be the 'solution' to every problem and pushing this on the audience, like in the first flick - and more towards the protagonist's near compulsive need to crack skulls at the first sign of trouble, though it still doesn't explore or even comment on this penchant for chaos in any meaningful way. Because of this, there seems to be a clear, if not quite clarified, distinction between his actions and those 'recommended' by the filmmakers themselves, be it more directly or - as is usually the case and was for this movie's predecessor - through what is shown to be 'cool'. A small attempt to introduce some morals, a counter-point to our 'hero' in the form of himself, only really incurs a sense of the hypocritical, as the lead denounces violence to a supporting character while constantly practising it in essentially every major scene (in most of which he isn't even on the defensive side of things). It's nice that they're trying to go deeper into the character, who's already lost - to an extent - much of what made him distinct in the first flick, and vigilantism should be explored when its depiction borderlines on glamorisation, but the work done isn't deep enough to feel as though its inclusion was even worthwhile and, honestly, it almost feels like a patch-job attempt to fix an issue that goes much deeper, one that still persists despite some decent work done in other areas of the screenplay that do begin to mitigate it. For example, there are some interesting things done with perspective in the finale, allowing the 'hero' to be framed more as a slasher movie's 'villain'. This enhances the effect of a fairly compelling and unconventional final sequence that feeds from some interesting, due to how they relate to the protagonist and the way they're presented, if predicable villains who unfortunately enter the plot too late in the day to have any real impact. The slasher villain framing honestly suits the protagonist's slightly sadistic actions rather well. He's basically Michael Myers except he chooses his victims based on a loose moralisation system of his own design, one that allows him keep killing and claim - perhaps even to himself - he's doing it for the right reasons. Of course, this reading is, at the very least, exaggerated. The character is supposed to be a vigilante who believes in his moral code, through and through. I feel he should be presented more as an anti-hero, however. This would allow for his methods to be seen as truly grisly to the viewer and open a genuine debate as to whether they're a necessary evil. As is, the killing is just a power-fantasy presented in as slick and pleasing a way as possible, which would be fine if it weren't tinted with sadism and a story that aims to focus on and totally justify it. Granted, the sadism is toned down significantly from the first, but the theme of personal punishment still runs thick. The issues with the violence are no where near as prevelant as in its predecessor, but they do dampen my enjoyment and give me pause upon retrospect. Again, the stuff that works the best is the stuff in which our lead isn't kicking anybody's head in. When he helps people by being there for them and doing what he can, that's when I find the film to be its most compelling. The character's relationships and the way they evolve are actually rather interesting and quite well rounded, making for some enjoyable sequences that do pay off in the end. I know it's strange that the low-key, meandering drama aspects are the best bits of a big-budget action-flick, but here we are. 5/10",The Equalizer 2
24,ThomasDrufke,Revenge isn't as Sweet,6,2 August 2018,"If there's anyone in Hollywood that I would believe is actually a real life bada**, it's probably Denzel Washington. The first Equalizer was a surprisingly brutal and visceral action film that gave Liam Neeson movies a run for its money. While the sequel is full of just as many, if not more, incredible kill sequences by Denzel's character, I think there's a lack of connection I felt this time around. I wasn't nearly as connected to the story, and perhaps that's because the revenge didn't feel as sweet this time around. The ending of the film is a great sequence on its own and there are certain scenes I will certainly revisit, but I'm not sure the film as a whole works quite as well.6.6/10",The Equalizer 2

26,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews....,6,13 December 2018,"The Equalizer 2The key to keeping every thing equal in society is to treat everybody like crap.However, the egalitarian in this action movie levels playing fields with firearms.Rideshare operator Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) does more for his neighbours than simply taxi them around in his vehicle; he also uses his past military experience to settle scores for them. But things get personal when an old colleague (Melissa Leo) of his is killed while investigating the suspicion death of another government agent. To get his retribution, McCall must face his past head-on and heavily armed.With its plodding pace, infrequent action scenes and boilerplate plot this sequel is much less gratifying than the 2014 adaptation of the 1980s television program. In summation, this outing's biggest setback is that it is more cloak and dagger than street-level vigilantism.As for the difference between the two, vigilantes tie their neckties around their foreheads.

At running time 2 hours i really enjoyed this movie. While there are some plots in here that kinda dragged maybe a bit, but they enriched this movie eventually. Acting was very good by all involved and Denzel, well he is great as usual. There is one sequence in the middle of the movie with a young kid which he rescues near the elevator - Denzels acting in that scene reminded me why he one of my all time favorites.Overall, ""The Equalizer 2"" is a solid entertainment for those who enjoyed the first movie.

This time he quickly get to rough up some Turkish men, one of whom is a wife abuser and kidnapper, and later he deals with some rich spoiled business men out for kicks, and later he must hand out justice with two personal crises much closer to home. There's a point where all the rather innovative and refreshing ways to kill someone gets oddly enough old and the screenwriter attempt to incorporate contingency plan ""B"" and a climax in a much different setting that one might expect from an assassin movie don't really work well. Kudos to the writer however for somehow making two storylines work decently until it's overused unnecessarily. Overall, this movie is able to stand out above others in some ways, but it doesn't succeed in its sustained credibility and high stakes tension as John Wick Chapter Two (2017), Jack Reacher: Never Go Back (2017), and even Peppermint (2018) do.",The Equalizer 2
30,The-Sarkologist,It Really Drags,4,21 July 2018,"Well, I initially thought that he was an Uber driver, but it turns out that he works for Lyft. Mind you, I do wonder where he gets all his money from considering that working for one of these ride-share companies really doesn't pay the bills at all. In fact, sometimes it appears that maybe he has quite a bit of money stashed away and only does this to keep himself occupied, but then again I never really thought that being special ops really paid all that much. In fact, there is always the argument that being in special ops pays pittance, and in the end you are basically discarded.
 So, we have our friend McCall doing what he generally does these days, and that is helping out the little people. Yet there is something that is going on in the background, namely a group of people cleaning up lose ends. It becomes apparent, about half-way through the film that they are actually former employees of this unnamed organisation, and they are getting rid of all traces of this organisation, or at least removing people that know of their activities.
 I guess this is where the film falls down. Sure, I can't remember the original series from the Eighties, and whether the people that he used to work for end up becoming entangled in his life again, but the idea was always that he would go around supporting those who were being bullied and pushed around by people much more powerful than them. Yet, that would make for a rather disparate film.
 However, this film really does drag a lot, but then again so did the previous film. Still, there was a lot more coherence there than there is here. It starts of pretty disparate, and then all of a sudden, about half-way through, it seems as if they realised that the film was going absolutely nowhere and decided to throw in some sort of plot. Then there was the artist, that they decided to use as a hostage, and sure enough, when everything is said and done, he realises how close to death he was, and decides that it might be better to start making something of his life.
 Yeah, this film really didn't seem to know what it was doing, and seemed to also drift away from the idea of the ex-special forces guy who goes around helping people and into the 'oh, your old buddies are now out to get you'. Yet, he is supposed to be dead, but then again it does seem that in a lot of cases the dead don't always stay dead. I guess a part of it had to do with him trying to flush out the killers. Also, like the other film, this one does seem to jump around a bit, and go off on tangents that don't need to exist. Yeah, I guess I found it somewhat dull in the end.",The Equalizer 2

The only person who knew the truth for him and she was also his best friend is dead and now he has to do everything can do in order to find who is behind her death and of course to take revenge.I liked this movie very much and since I had already watched the first movie I was prepared for this and I also had high expectations from it. I have to admit that despite my high expectations and hopes I wasn't disappointed at all from it. I liked very much and for one more time the interpretation of Denzel Washington who played as Robert McCall and he was just outstanding. Other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Pedro Pascal's who played as Dave York and Ashton Sanders who played as Miles Whittaker. Regarding the direction which was made by Antoine Fuqua I believe that it was amazing and I enjoyed the fact that combined and presented very well the past of Robert McCall with the present and how that influenced and changed him as a person so much.Finally, I have to say that ""The Equalizer 2"" is a very good movie to watch and I am sure that you are going to enjoy it very much.

33,cruise01,Denzel Washington delivers with a powerful punch but suffers from being a dull sequel.,6,20 July 2018,"The Equalizer 2 (3 out of 5 stars).The Equalizer 2 is an okay thriller. With a slow pacing and a story that took a while for it to start. And a few short action sequences. At least Denzel Washington does pull off delivering another awesome character with bare knuckles and strategic fighting techniques that leaves many bones broken in a brutal fight. But it is a very few fight scenes as well which may leave the action genre enthusiast a little disappointed if you are expecting it to be as good as the first movie. Robert (Denzel Washington) is a retired government agent. He does odd jobs such as searching for people and helping a kid who was taken from her mother. Which leaves Robert taking a few guys down in a train car in Turkey. While back home, he works for lyft. Driving people and hearing peoples problems. He does help a girl who was abused by a group of men. He pays them a visit and beats them down. He also helps out his neighbor who is a troubled teen that is on a borderline of getting involved in a gang. He mentors the teen by having him help repaint the graffiti on the apartment building. When Robert's personal friend is murdered. He goes on a vengeance to trace the killers that are involved. And to eliminate them. Denzel Washington is a great actor. His character is the best at what he does. He can get in any fight situation and always get out with barely any injury to him. He takes down a few guys in a train car. By using his awareness of every object and techniques to take them down. He also plans a fight with a few paramilitary bad guys during a hurricane in a small town. And takes them down one guy at a time. Sadly, if you are expecting a lot of action. You will be left disappointed. For starters, the film is slow moving this time. At least the first movie had Denzel Washington and Chloe Grace Moretz getting to know each other. Talking about books. Why Denzel is reading a list of books. About his past and his wife. This film focuses more on the sub plots with Denzel helping this troubled teen Miles (Ashton Sanders). Miles has lost his brother from a gang. And is willing to join another gang to get revenge. After like half an hour in the movie, the plot kicks in involving Melissa Leo's character and Pedro Pascal getting involved in an arranged homicide with a couple in a different country.The films plot did feel weak this time around. With a conflict being about tying up loose ends. And Robert going on revenge to kill those involved that killed his friend. This is no Punisher movie but Robert follows through with his code of protecting the innocent. And giving payback to those that deserves it. Overall, The Equalizer 2 is a fair film. Denzel Washington is great as the character. Helping others and beating the bad guys. It does have a few action sequences that are short and brief. A little smaller than the first movie. The villain is a decent one which feels undeveloped. The direction is slow with subplots that is more exciting to watch than the plot itself.",The Equalizer 2

35,eddie_baggins,A pointless and tiresome sequel,4,31 March 2019,"Well here we have it ladies and gentleman, last year's most unnecessary and pointless sequel, The Equalizer 2.A surprise smash hit of sorts, 2014's The Equalizer introduced us to Denzel Washington forgoing awards baiting dramas for a little slice of the Liam Neeson geriatric action thriller vibe, that saw him inhabit seemingly everyday hardware store employee Robert McCall who unleashes a combination of Jason Bourne butt kicking with a James Bond attitude in a film that ended up being more entertaining than it had any right to be.It was an event though that didn't leave us all screaming for further adventures of McCall, as he uses his previous life skills of hunting and ending baddies in innovative fashion but Washington and his good directing buddy Antoine Fuqua decided it was something we absolutely did in fact need.It's a huge problem the Equalizer 2 just can't overcome, as the film makes no real point as to why it exists or in fact adds absolutely nothing to McCall's story that we didn't already know and therefore becomes two hours of ""entertainment"", that whilst not last year's worst by any stretch of the imagination, is arguably the year's most unneeded exercise.In saying so, any film with an actor of Washington's charisma and smarts will always be watchable and the veteran performer does typically solid work here, meaning you will undoubtedly believe Washington could take down a room full of goons with a credit card or infiltrate a bunch of drug addled hoodlums without a single second of retribution but even the esteemed performer must feel a little embarrassed about the Equalizer's 2 existence that sits fairly uncomfortable in a largely solid C.V of impactful and entertaining offerings.The other huge problem for Washington and Fuqua is in the fact the film fails in ignite anywhere outside of the lead performer with bland supports from the likes of Pedro Pascal, Bill Pullman and Melissa Leo adding nothing to the story of McCall seeking revenge for those who killed his lifelong friend, that inexplicitly includes unwarranted plotlines such as McCall's train trip in Turkey, an eventful taxi ride and most annoyingly McCall's relationship with Ashton Sander's street artist Miles Whittaker that is the very definition of Hollywood cheese.Final Say -Thanks to Washington and a few neat action beats The Equalizer 2 is a watchable action exercise but also a highly pointless one. Failing to justify why it exists around a plotline that barely hangs together, this is a film that you're best off skipping.2 credit cards out of 5",The Equalizer 2
36,leonblackwood,Decent action but the storyline needed some work! 5/10,5,6 January 2019,"Review:
I quite enjoyed this film, even though we have all seen this type of movie before, but I liked the intensity throughout and Denzel puts in a decent performance. It does take some time to get going and I found the storyline predictable in parts, but for an elderly man, the action scenes were impressive. I am a bit worried about Denzel's range, which seems to be stuck in one mode recently, so I'm hoping to see him starring in other genres so he can get back to his Oscar-winning performances. Anyway, back to this movie! Former Marine and Defense Intelligence Agency spy, Robert McCall (Denzel Washington), now lives in a diverse apartment complex in urban Massachusetts. He is working as a Lyft driver and assists the less fortunate with the help of his friend Susan Plummer (Melissa Leo). At the beginning of the movie, Robert travels to Istanbul by train to retrieve a local bookstore owner's daughter, who was kidnapped by her father. When he returns home, he discovers that the apartment courtyard has been vandalised, so he offers Miles Whittaker (Ashton Sanders), a young resident with an artistic but troubled background, money to repaint the walls. One day, Susan and DIA operative Dave York (Pedro Pascal), Robert's former teammate, is called to investigate an apparent murder-suicide of an agent and his wife in Brussels. When the two separate after reaching the hotel, Susan is attacked in an apparent robbery by two men with backpacks, who got off the elevator on her floor. When he receives the news, Robert begins to investigate both her death and the case she was investigating. After reviewing elevator CCTVs, Robert determines that it was likely the backpackers who got off on her floor, could have been involved in Susan's murder. He also confirms that the incident that Susan was investigating, was in fact a murder and that Susan's death was connected to it. During one of his shifts, Robert is attacked by someone posing as a passenger. Robert kills the assailant and retrieves his phone to collect information about who he was working for. After breaking through the military grade encryption, Robert discovers that his former partner, Dave, was on the phone call list. He visits Dave at his home and confronts him, where he admits that he's now in it for the money and how the government agency used him. Dave admits his involvement and divulges that he himself finished Susan off, as she would have figured out that he was behind the Brussels killing. To tie up loose ends, Dave and his hitmen attempt to kill Susan's husband, Brian Plummer (Bill Pullman), but Robert gets to Brian before the hitmen arrive, and he whisks him away from danger. Meanwhile, Miles is starting to paint Roberts apartment, while he monitors his place via webcams, and he sees Dave and his hitmen breaking in. He helps Miles hide in a hidden bookcase, but when he thinks they have gone, they capture him and Dave figures out where Robert is heading, so they make there way to his location. Robert returns to his seaside hometown and prepares himself for Dave and his team. When they finally arrive, Dave positions himself on the town's watchtower in a sniper's position, while the rest of his team try to find Robert. After taking out his 3 man team, Dave shoots at his car, which has Miles tied up in the trunk, and uses him as a hostage to lure out Robert but he runs out of bullets so Robert takes full advantage, and takes out Dave. Back in Massachusetts, Miles finishes repainting Roberts apartment and returns to school to focus on his art. Although you know that Denzel is bound to survive, there is still some intense scenes, especially towards the end, but there aren't enough unique moments to make it a stand-out movie. It's still worth a watch, mainly for the action and the father/son concept but apart from that, it's an average film which could have been much better. It did seem like Denzel was overacting in some of the scenes, and his moody persona does become slightly annoying after a while. If they choose to release a third movie, it would be good to see another actor alongside Denzel, that can bring something fresh to the franchise. Watchable!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Antoine Fuqua, who directed many R'nB videos in the '90s, for artist like Al B. Sure, Brian McKnight, Christopher Williams, Father MC, Heavy D, Aaron Hall, Maze, Usher, Toni Brixton, Shanice, Prince, Arrested Development, Coolio and Stevie Wonder. In terms of movies, he directed the Replacement Killers, Bait, Training Day, Tears Of The Sun starring Bruce Willis, King Arthur, Shooter, Brooklyn's Finest, Olympus Has Fallen The Equalizer, Southpaw and the Magnificent Seven, which also starred Denzel Washington in the lead. This is the first movie that Denzel has agreed to do a sequel, so it's no surprise that he also produced this project. After watching the bonus material on the disk, the director spoke a lot about Denzel's input in this film, and how he changed a lot of the scenes because he thought that they would work better for the role. As Fuqua and Denzel have worked together a few times, they have grown to trust each other, when it comes to getting the best out of the scenes, but I personally think that it's time for Denzel to try something fresh because I know that he has a much bigger range than he has shown in his recent movies.Budget: $62million

37,TheMovieDiorama,The Equalizer 2 packs twice as much humanity but loses double the amount of memorable action.,6,17 August 2018,"Its predecessor was a pleasant surprise, with both Fuqua and Washington crafting another solid film together. The dream team return for the sequel and, whilst it remains consistently gritty with captivating dialogue, unfortunately falls short with an unfocused narrative. McCall, now running a driving service to which he seeks out justice for the oppressed, is tested as to how far he will go to save the individuals he cares for. This series would not be anywhere near as successful as it is without the ever dependable Washington and talented Fuqua. An actor who transfixes all who watch his performances, and a director who allows his stars to be at the forefront whilst still retaining control of the film. This is no different, in fact Washington owned the screen with his commanding yet cool demeanour. What sets this apart from the previous film is the abundance of humanity that is injected into the plot. McCall is portrayed to be a guardian angel for the innocent civilians who do not deserve to be exploited, with several touching moments that reveal him to be a protective figure. This is particularly apparent when he is attempting to steer a troubled teenager towards a better lifestyle, as if the boy is a reflection of McCall's past mistakes. This is where the film excels, but at the unfortunate consequence of substantially losing the stylised action sequences that made the original so compelling. An imbalanced screenplay from Wenk that, in turn, prevented Fuqua from creating a focused film. The combination of a dramatic crime plot with random combat encounters acting as sub-plots just did not work. It felt unnecessarily overlong, taking a conservative forty minutes for the primary plot to commence. Fortunately the final stormy confrontation was filmed to precision, as if we ourselves were taking cover from the sniper overlooking the drenched town. Alas, an excellent lead performance and humane character development couldn't make up for the minimal amount of gripping content that was presented.",The Equalizer 2

40,paul-allaer,"Denzel is Denzel, but the franchise needs new ideas",5,5 August 2018,"""The Equalizer 2"" (2018 release; 121 min.) brings the on-going stories of Bob McCall. As the movie opens, we are on ""Turkish Railway, 400 km. from Istanbul"", and we see our man McCall in disguise confronting a group of Turkish men about the kidnapping of a young girl from her US mom. It's not long that McCall takes care of business and we see the young girl reunited with her mom back in Boston. We then go to ""Brussels, Belgium"", where a couple is brutally murdered but the perpetrators make it look like it was a murder-suicide. What is going on here? At this point we're less than 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: both director Antoine Fuqua and leading man Denzel Washington return for more, after the unexpected hit that was 2014;s The Equalizer (itself loosely based on the 1980s TV series). McCall is a Lyft driver who, being the ex-CIA guy that he is, also dished out vigilante justice on behalf of those who need it, a veritable and seemingly indestructible one-person army. It makes the role appealing and a bit mysterious, but it also presents a big challenge for the viewers. How to get invested in a story when the outcome is all but inevitable? Denzel is Denzel, always worth watching, but even he cannot solve this conundrum. Melissa Leo and Bill Pullman both return as well, in small but vital support roles. Ashton Sanders gives a good performance as Miles, the neighborhood kid in which McCall takes an interest and sorta mentors.""The Equalizer 2"" is now in its third week in theaters, and has done nicely at the box office. Fuqua has already said that he's interested in making a 3rd movie. I'm guessing that before Denzel says yes to another chapter, he'll want to see some fresh ideas in the script. The Sunday matinee screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended very nicely (25 people or so). If you liked the first movie, you almost certainly will like this installment as well. I, for one, found it a bit too traditional, dare I say, predictable. But don't take my word for it. I'd suggest you check it out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",The Equalizer 2
41,subxerogravity,There is no equal when it comes to Denzel.,8,21 July 2018,"I'm starting to think that Denzel low key loves action movies and wants to do them. It seems odd that such a heavy hitter like Denzel is a victim of type casting, but it's true. He's such a high caliber actor that many would say it's beneath him to do such a mindless thing as an action movie, but I wouldn't be surprise if Denzel saw his boy Wesley Snipes in Blade or something and was like ""I want to do that"". So when stuff like the Equalizer showcases a fuller acting spectrum, Mr. Washington jumps on the band wagon.That first Equalizer was so good. Denzel and director Antoine Fuqua has a masterful combo of action thriller. Something that you don't want to mess with and try to copy (but you know Hollywood)However, Lighting strikes twice and it strikes hard. I feel that Equalizer 2 is arguably better than the original film. One of the things that makes it better is how this sequel kinda flushes out how the TV series this movie is based on works. It's almost like 2002's Spider-Man vs. Spider-Man 2 type of situation, in which the Spider-Man 2 is considered a better movie because they get to concentrate on the character now that the origin story is out of the way. Although McCall's life as a spy that's suppose to be dead makes it hard to reveal anything from his origin in the original film, in the sequel we get to see the character develop when he seeks vengeance for the murder of his closet friend (Played by Melessia Leo), at the same time, there are several subplots of McCall just doing his thing, helping random people out who need help.Denzel is electrifying in this movie. He's just the type of actor who always gets an emotion out of me, and you never catch Denzel sleepin on his thespian skills.That's why Antoine Fuqua has to come correct with this film. Making sure he's making something more than some action fluff, that it has the substance that's Denzel approved, making him a sophisticated action hero (Almost better than Liam Neeson)It's one of the best sequels ever.",The Equalizer 2
42,jtindahouse,An uneven sequel that disapoints in most areas,6,15 December 2019,"I really liked the original 'Equaliser' film. It was fast-paced, violent and I liked that he didn't use a gun, meaning the writing had to be a lot more creative. Then the sequel rolls around four years later and the first thing you notice is he is holding a gun in the poster. That seemed like an odd choice to me after all the hard work the first film put in. I understand that the character isn't adverse to using guns, but if the point of difference your films possess is that he doesn't have to use them why would you promote the film with him holding one?Most sequels up the anti. They are usually more violent and with a higher body-count. 'The Equaliser 2' is almost the exact opposite of that. It reels it right back to the point where the film feels like an out and out drama at times. It's a lot slower and the stakes feel a lot lower. The movie consequently feels very uneven in tone. It's like two films spliced into one. I understand they were trying to put in the ground-work for later on but it just wasn't well done at all and weighed the film down massively.I think the biggest crime the film commits though is that it didn't make me hate the villains enough. For any revenge film to work you have to passionately hate the bad guys as much as the protagonist does. 'Rambo: Last Blood' was a prime example of a recent film that did this very well. On that occasion I needed 'Rambo' to get his vengeance, in 'The Equaliser 2' I couldn't have cared less.There are some great fight scenes and one very well done action scene involving an in-car fight. Denzel Washington also does his best with what he is given to work with. He is as watchable as always and personifies cool. The film certainly isn't as creative as the first with its kills, but it does still make a fair effort on that front. This wasn't the sequel I was after though and if they do a third one I hope they learn from their mistakes.",The Equalizer 2

Here again he is a man on a mission to help people in trouble, much like John Wick, just substitute Denzel for Keanu and it is the same formula. The villains are of the standard variety but Denze is so likable that I found myself cheering for him against his opponents for the entire two hour running time.

But will really put himself to the test, when his friend(Melissa Leo) is murdered, and he will do what it takes to take them down.
Denzel Washington once again delivers a terrific performance as McCall, one part friendly and polite, and quite cunning and ruthless for the second, and he does quite effortlessly. Does have some good suspenseful moments will keep on the edge of your seat. And when he swings into action you just jump with excitement and it really delivers.

This is a sequel to the 2014 movie that is based on the 1980's tv series. It's also the first time that Denzel has done a sequel. Denzel returns as Robert McCall, the retired spy/assassin that now spends his days just helping ordinary people in need. He drives an Uber, where he meets most of his future clients. In the first movie, he had one person in particular that he wanted to help-Chloe Grace Moretz-from a life of prostitution. This time it's Ashton, a young kid in his apartment building, that is tempted to join a street gang and needs Denzel to put him on the right path. There is also some mercs that kill a good friend of Denzel's-Melissa Leo from the first movie-which is not a smart move, on the bad guys part. And, I'm not giving anything away here, it is shown in the trailers. FYI: Melissa and her husband, Bill Pullman, are the only original cast members making a return for this movie. Of course, Denzel has to give the bad guys some payback, teaching them that it's not a smart idea to mess with the Equalizer. Pedro plays Denzel's old partner, back when he worked for the government, and Orson is another side story person in need of help. There is not much new here-story wise-but it is still quite entertaining. The fights are brutal and most of them are hand to hand, with Denzel setting his watch to time himself, on those special occasions. He also uses knives a lot-I only recall him shooting a gun a few times.
It's rated ""R"" for brutal violence, gore, language and drug use and has a running time of 2 hours & 1 minute.
I really enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",The Equalizer 2

50,alindsay-al,An Above Average Action Sequel,6,13 September 2019,"I really enjoyed the first Equaliszer film starring Denzel Washington and I have now finally had a chance to see the sequel and I found this film enjoyable but definitley a step down from the original film. The premise of the film sees an ex special forces soldier go on the hunt when a close friend is killed. As mentioned Denzel Washington plays the lead in this film and he definitley elevates this film so much. He oozes charisma and charm and is such a likeable person to follow, he also nails all of the action scenes and fits the role incredibly well. The supporting cast are a bit of a mixed bag, I thought Pedro Pascal did a good job in this role and anything that he is in seems to be elevated as he is a top quality actor. Though nobody else in the film really matters even though there are some top quality performers like Melissa Leo & Bill Pullman, they really could have been played by anybody and it took something away from the film. The story is at its best when it focuses on a simple revenge plot and deals with the hunt for these assasins which is great seeing it through Denzel's eyes. However, this film has a side plot of Denzel trying to help a youth but it isn't particularly compelling and takes something away from the film and makes it feel longer then it actually needs to be. The script is okay, Denzel has the charisma to make the script work but it isn't particularly entertaining apart from what he makes out of it. There is some okay drama but it isn't exactly as dramatic as it could be. The style in the action scenes were fantastic, some brutal scenes and effective action set ups. But the pacing of the film wasn't very good and as mentioned it just drags in the middle and makes it feel longer then it needs to be. Overall this is an okay middle of the road action film that is serviceable but not going to be remembered in the long run.",The Equalizer 2

52,jimbo-53-186511,Lethargic thriller that lacks both momentum and excitement,5,25 June 2019,"Retired CIA Agent Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) is back as a part time cabbie and part time ass-kicking vigilante. However, things become more personal when McCall finds himself avenging the death of his long-time friend Susan Plummer (Melissa Leo). Calling upon all of his old skills, he sets to work on finding who was responsible for her death whilst dispensing his own form of justice...I have to admit that I quite liked the first Equalizer film; it was by no means a brilliant film and it sure had its share of flaws, but it was at least reasonably entertaining. Unfortunately, this sequel isn't quite there I'm afraid...After an impressive opener, the film then becomes slow and somewhat dull for the first hour; sure McCall is a vigilante who goes round kicking loads of ass and does target people that deserve it, but oddly enough I just didn't care all that much for any of it and I almost found myself slightly detached and distanced from proceedings. OK I'd be lying if I said that there isn't a modicum of enjoyment to be had from seeing Denzel kick some ass, but it's tainted by the lack of a real reason to care. Writer Richard Wenk does address this by introducing the death of one of McCall's friends which acts as a driver for the plot and whilst this does give the film a sense of purpose it still doesn't really improve on its earlier weaknesses.What really lets the film down is its very weak sub-plot involving McCall trying to look after his neighbour and put him on the 'right track' so to speak. It's so clumsily and half-heartedly chucked into the story that it practically becomes laughable - it felt like it was only included to try and give weight to the thin story and becomes worse when you learn that this kid was only really there as a plot device!!Washington does the best he can with the role; the fight sequences are good, but there's just not much to care about here, but this isn't Washington's fault. The supporting cast are all OK, but you just feel when watching this film that no-one's heart was really in it and naturally it suffers as a result.My head's telling me this film really deserves a 4 out of 10, but I have to admit that despite all its weaknesses it's still pretty badass so I've upped its score to a still rather mediocre 5 out of 10.",The Equalizer 2

Denzel stars again here as ""Robert McCall"" the deadly ex-CIA Agent who uses his special setbof skills to help the innocent against the Evil of the world & oh my Denzel gives an amazing performance that shows his heart as well as his brutality within his ""McCall"" character.
The excellent Director Antoine Fuqua who loves working with the legendary Denzel in films such as ""Training Day"" & ""The Equaliser"" & ""The Magnificent Seven"", here he brings out the best of Denzel as his unique & Awesome character, also this fantastic sequel is given a really atmospheric mood & darker tone, we have a windy Autumn atmosphere & a bigger scale threat from old Ex-CIA ""Friends"" that have turned against the system & are brutally killing off their old work buddies, this film feels much darker & much more personal for ""McCall"" & gives him a savage quest of vengeance.
There's lots of nice little character moments & nice scenes seeing ""McCall"" with other people that he cares about, this is my favourite Denzel character by far. This is an Action Thriller but with heart.The cinematography is gorgeous.
The music is suspenseful & moving.
The Direction is tense & exciting.
The Drama is emotional & the violence is raw.
Denzel Washington is superb.I also really just loved some simple scenes of Denzel just sitting & talking & sharing a tender scene with the legendary Bill Pullman!!!

It's also really predictable, which is annoying because I knew what was happening as soon as I saw certain characters.This isn't bad, it just feels like a generic action movie.

Think a more realistic The Punisher. Denzel Washington once more proves the character of Robert McCall ""is"" the non-comic book righteous crusader requiring no suspension of belief to buy in to. That' this is important is an understatement and Washington inhabits his role so well it absolutely is the film.This is not really per se an action film as it is more of a steady thriller. The action, however, is quite effective every time it is used. If you need action what's here is fine, but it's the character of McCall in his quest to met justice that intrigues. McCall is so complex and Washington so nuanced in bringing him to life that given the decent, but oft used storyline, might have been so much less without Washington's skills. It works just fine here and made a long movie seem much more compact.Worth noting is the use of a hurricane to heighten the final act. Normally this just seems like a cheap device, but here it helps create a mysterious kind of stealthiness in which McCall uses to gain his advantage. I like the way it captures the zeitgeist of McCall's i""deadman"" invisibility.

But the show's fantastic chases, split second action and brilliantly conceived and executed finale render such points mute. It's all just so enjoyable. And it's also true that whilst the story from a certain point all adds up after the blink-and-you'll-miss-it sleuthing, there's still a ponderous 'why' as to the event that started the ball rolling in the first place. But again, who cares? Maybe the bad guys aren't as enigmatic as the psychopath from the first movie. Again, who cares? I can't bring myself to dock this near masterpiece more than a single point for such finicky. The filming is tight and gritty, as well as sympathetic and moving, just as in the first movie. Face it, the action is better in this one, as is the sense of outrage. Denzil is cooler, which nullifies that you often know what's about to happen. He's also patient, heightening the tension and satisfaction when we see the eventual redress. From a cinematographic point of view, to me, all the direction, editing, soundscape, stunts, etc, are all flawless. The locations are better, and far more varied.

63,rgkarim,Does it Equal The First,7,20 July 2018,"It is the age of movie transitions, and the age of passing torches to the younger generation in hopes of establishing new legends into the mix. Yet, it doesn't mean that the current legends have faced their last mission. Tonight's movie review proves the case as the incredible Denzel Washington leads another movie, in hopes of bringing the success to a sequel. Can the man who made so many epic films do it again, or is this a series that needed to retire? Let's get into it as I review: The Equalizer 2 (2018)Director:
 Antoine Fuqua
Writers:
 Richard Wenk, Michael Sloan (based on the television series created by) 
Stars:
 Denzel Washington, Pedro Pascal, Ashton Sanders
LIKES: Acting: Denzel is a good actor, we all know this. His ability to play these hardened, battle scarred, internally struggling super soldiers never fails to impress, and I always enjoy his intensity when playing these characters. Still with the finesse delivery, Denzel's ability to deliver his dialogue is magnificent, brings inspiration and motivation to many. Ashton Sanders achieved his role quite well, not quite as motivational, but certainly capturing the struggling artist motif of his character. A nice balance was struck between these two, which established a dynamic relationship between these two. The rest did fine in their parts, but it was these two who held most of the screen time. The Realism: It's an action movie, but it is grounded into the realm of reality. Equalizer 2 does have some tense moments to spice things up, but it doesn't resort to flashy special effects and physics defying moves to do it... mostly. This film sticks to tactic combat, utilizing skills and the mind to play a deadly game that will deal the justice you want. While they are limited through much of the movie, the end game is where this strategy is really capitalized on it. In addition, if a player gets injured, they don't recover quickly so that helps keep things exciting.The Second Half Pace: The movie really takes off at the half way point, taking the steam to push them into the action/thriller component. Once the movie hits into this realm, it finally gets super interesting and engaging, amping up the tension and trying to keep you guessing at what will happen next. And even better... it actually doesn't feel like the movie is dragging by this point. The Character Development: Surprisingly, the movie opens up Denzel's character to help explain more of the backstory that molded him into the super assassin hiding behind the chiseled features. I did enjoy learning more about the central protagonists haunting past, but also in seeing him evolve, so that he may overcome his struggles and attempt to move on to something else. It fits well with the movie series, and shows potential for any future installments they may try to make. The Dialogue: Hands down though, my favorite part is the dialogue/writing of the movie. Not so much in terms of story, Equalizer 2 wins points for inspirational words that only Denzel can maximize. It's writing that fits very well into the theme/premise of the movie, almost as if Denzel is defending the audience and trying to make them better. Even Sanders lines are decently developed, fitting his character well and doing the lifting of establishing relationships and connecting Denzel to the characters. Hands down this was the solidifying factor that tied the movie together. DISLIKES: The Pace of the First Part: It helps get the movie established in that Robin Hood like atmosphere, but it dragged for me. Equalizer 2 needs some major pushing to get us to the good stuff, with a few action appetizers to try and hold your energy. It's not the slowest opening, but editing could have taken some time to trim the fat and help tighten the story. Predictability: It's easy to figure out what's going to happen... not much more I can say about that. The trailers have done a decent amount of revealing, but those that haven't seen it should have no trouble figuring this out. The Action: Realistic as it may be, the action is still not quite as spiced up as the trailers tried to make it be. Impressive as tactical combat is, the movie still doesn't quite have all the energy and excitement I like in a film (which is often fast paced gunplay with lots of boom). While I still did enjoy the slower combat, I would have liked to see more of it, as there are huge gaps between short lived bouts that make for a slower movie. Yet, if you are a fan of the most recent Borne Film, you should have no problems with this presentation. Story: My least favorite aspect though is the story. I'm not saying Equalizer 2's tale is horrible, or the worst thing ever, but I also don't think it is the most groundbreaking either. The opening feels like a charity meets Robin Hood approach, a sort of toned down Death Wish to establish the setting. After that though, I struggled with appreciating the four subplots interweaving with each other to try and craft an overall plot. True, this multi-tiered approach opened avenues for character development, however the main plot of vengeance took many detours that felt skipped at times. When the rabbit hole's bottom was reached, it wound up being very lackluster, realistic and certainly making a point, but nothing that had my eyes bugging wide. Even worse, when the exciting climax did happen, the bite sort of fell out of the antagonist. The VERDICT:  Equalizer 2 is better overall for me, though I won't lie that it was missing that original component (e.g. clever trap battles in hardware stores) the first movie had. It's got great heart, fantastic writing, and smarter acting, which makes it a prime target for thriller/spy/crime dramas that have toned down action. However, the pacing, surprise, and story of the movie require some redrawing for the next installment to really maximize the modern-day vigilante genre. If you are a Denzel fan, I'm not going to stop you from hitting this film up, and if you are looking for a thriller/action this movie is the one. However, I do recommend waiting for home rental on this one to maximize your funds. My scores are: Action/Thriller/Crime: 7.0

64,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of The Equalizer 2,7,12 December 2018,"Released about four years after 2014's The Equalizer, The Equalizer 2 is at least 10-12 minutes shorter in length. You can plainly tell. ""2"" also feels readily like an outlying sequel and at the same, has almost no connection to the first film. Don't worry though. ""2"" plants Denzel Washington as its reliable, one man army ringer. He's probably my favorite actor and might be the coolest, most badass dude that ever lived. ""I'm gonna kill each and every one of you and the only disappointment is that I only get to do it once."" Ah Denzel, you slay me as Robert McCall bro. You are a beast!Produced by Washington himself and being the fourth collaboration between him and director Antoine Fuqua, The Equalizer 2 again pits Denzel as a 60-plus-year-old, anti-hero juggernaut (Liam and Mel rank a close second). As a film, ""2"" initially comes off as slightly diluted, slightly globetrotting, and mostly slow-burning. Then at the hour and fifteen minute mark, Fuqua puts the pieces together making The Equalizer 2 a climatic and suspenseful revelation (check out ""2's"" cutthroat, final twenty minutes in the midst of a hurricane). Antoine has always been the slickest and most darkest of action firework helmers. His style of a modern day Western here coupled with remorseless soldiering is all the better for it.Now in the first Equalizer, Denzel's McCall mysteriously works at a hardware store while trying to avenge the mistreatment of a teenager brutally owned by Russian mobsters. In The Equalizer 2, McCall mysteriously works as a Lyft driver while trying to avenge the death of his best friend and colleague, Mrs. Susan Plummer (played by the chameleon-like Melissa Leo). In hindsight, ""2"" is not as brutally violent or candidly exhausting as the original. However, the flick at times seems more ominous, more lustrous, and truly more revealing. With folded tea bag, hot water, iron fist, and glaring eye at his disposition, Washington's character is again the Jason Voorhees of savage dispatchers. He's gliding, stealth, and surgical in his bone-cracking gambits. The galvanizing Equalizer 2 succeeds because of him and even succeeds a little bit on its own. My rating: 3 stars.",The Equalizer 2
65,Easygoer10,Decent Sequel,6,3 April 2021,"This is a fairly good film, albeit predictable. I did like Pedro Pascal (""Dave York"") as the primary antagonist and Ashton Sanders (""Miles Whitaker""). They are both terrific. Unfortunately, what I find cheesy is the ""happy ending"": We see that ""Sammy"" finds his long lost sister ""Magda"". Also, ""Miles"" paints an unbelievably beautiful mural on the courtyard brick wall and meets a very cute girl on the bus. In other words, this is the world as we would like it to be; not the world as it really is. Although this ending is understandable, it lacks a vital component: Authenticity; something very typical of films today.",The Equalizer 2

67,elliotjeory,Awesome film,9,31 October 2018,"If you are a fan of Denzel Washington and the first equaliser you will love this. Met expectations in story, action and fight scenes. Yes the first one was probably better but this is still a worthy sequel and highly enjoyable. It would be great if there was a third to complete the trilogy.",The Equalizer 2
68,Luigi Di Pilla,Not so hot as the first one,6,31 December 2018,"I didn't hesitate to buy the sequel on dvd. Seeing Denzel Washington in this role is a pleasure. The story itself was in my opinion less cool than in the first one. Then it was interesting to watch Pedro Pascal after I could discover him in the Netflix Narcos series.
What I liked was the switching places between Turkey and Belgium. The storm scenes at the end were great cinematography. 6/10.
Anyway I am already curious for part three.",The Equalizer 2
69,MR_Heraclius,Good,7,22 February 2020,"This fell into the typical cliché riddled story mode and it lost all the hard work created in the first film. They never invested enough time in the friendship to pull off this story beat and the film doesn't work. I enjoyed the first film and when you compare the films, the sequel is less interesting story wise. Washington is the key here and even he cannot rescue the contrived plot chosen by the filmmakers. I wanted to like this film and the action can only compensate for so much. The supporting plots felt uninspired and with only a few of the subplots paying off. Good action scenes but a friend death that means nothing and serves zero purpose is wasted. Hopefully they can redeem themselves with a third film.",The Equalizer 2
70,Troy_Campbell,Denzel's charisma vs subpar script.,5,25 July 2018,"2014's Equalizer was a surprise smash hit, so it's no shock that Denzel is back as philosophical arse-kicker Robert McCall, this time brought out of retirement to seek revenge for the murder of a dear friend. Dealing in the sort of earnest criminal tales that director Antoine Fuqua has built his career on since garnering acclaim for Training Day way back in 2001, this Taken¬-esque franchise doubles down on 'serious-Denzel'. Basically an invincible monk warrior, McCall enjoys the simple life but also won't let injustice go unpunished; a combination that should be the best of both worlds for those looking for Denzel monologues and Denzel smackdowns. And it is, partially, because of the lead star's sheer charisma, but second time around the fatigue has already well and truly set in. The action starts strong in the opening act with two slick hand-to-hand combat set pieces featuring the series' trademark ultra-stylised 'Denzel Vision', however they're not topped (or even matched) for the remainder of the movie, with the finale a particularly limp effort. Compounding this is Richard Wenk's lacklustre script; his reliance on well-trodden genre tropes and stereotypical behaviour is frustrating, especially as it signposts the ""twist"" and hamstrings the talented cast. Fuqua has enough flair behind the camera to keep things visually interesting-and wisely resists the urge to over-edit, a common problem plaguing middle-budget action flicks-though it's not enough to fully compensate for the undercooked screenplay. Denzel is always watchable and Fuqua injects some pizzazz, but The Equalizer 2 could have been more than just a lazy rehash of its predecessor.",The Equalizer 2

I'm not against violence in movies, but we are talking about age appropriate.None of the action scenes had any tension because we know before it starts that Mr. Tough Guy is going to come out on top.And why is it supposed to be so cool that he sets his stopwatch before he goes on a murder spree? Spoiler Alert! It isn't cool or interesting in the least.And as he kills upwards of 30 human beings in the film he lectures a young lad in the neighborhood about values.So there is almost nothing in the way of a story and the action scenes are ridiculous.

72,Prashast_Singh,Visually impressive action film and a treat for Equalizer/Denzel fans!,10,18 September 2020,"Finally watched it after an unnecessary 2-year break. Should've seen this long ago, but somehow couldn't. Anyways, The Equalizer 2 is a power-packed sequel that delivers every bit of the knockout action and vigilante hero charm the first one had. This time, the film looks a lot more gorgeous due to its mostly bright setting, as opposed to the first one which mostly had dark colors. Denzel Washington never ceases to impress, and that can be seen here as well. His fight scenes, dramatic expressions and dialogue delivery are spot-on. Without a doubt, he's one of the greatest actors and action stars of all time. His interactions with several characters, both leading and supporting, are done in a sweet manner. The real surprise is the action-packed third act which is filled with a stunning choreography and eye-pleasing locations. It has to be one of the greatest climax fights I've seen to date. It's also somewhat less gory than the first film, although the level of violence is still strong, making it unsuitable for kids. If you like raw action, The Equalizer 2 is definitely worth a watch. And while you may add it to your watchlist, make sure not to put it on hold like I did.",The Equalizer 2

Technology, superhero character, justice, emotions, moral, skills, stunts. Deeper and more complicated, just like Taken 2 is compared to Taken, but still does not affect my rating. Good presence of different locations, vehicles, accidents or confrontations, all comparable to real life issues. The character is the best, filled with high level of confidence, experience, wisdom...then the skills which are graphical especially the beheading and stabbing which looks so real, deep, brutal, and scary. If this was 1st sequel, then I would give it less rating, but considering that it 2nd, it is acceptable to be more complicated. Nice graphics of environment or nature.",The Equalizer 2
74,blott2319-1,"Nothing remarkable, but still watchable",7,24 July 2020,"I was a fan of the first Equalizer movie, and was interested to see what the same team could do with a sequel. Denzel Washington is still great in the lead role, although it felt like they downplayed a lot of the character's OCD tendencies in this film. The repetition of his life seemed to play into his skill, and it also gave a calm and controlled vibe to all of his aggressive actions, which makes them seem more intimidating by comparison. They touched on a few of the key details that defined The Equalizer, but only briefly, and never made it an essential part of his story. I was a bit surprised after the setup we see in the first film, that this wasn't a plot where our hero is hired in order to help someone else in need. However, I appreciated that this story made his mission more personal. Taking a cue from the run of modern action movies like Taken and John Wick, it simply works better for our hero to have emotion driving him, because it makes us care more as an audience.I'm not sure if we were supposed to be surprised in any way when we discover who is behind the murders, but it is such a cliche that I never doubted it for a moment (not to mention, the actor in question looks like a villain to begin with.) It also felt a bit odd how little The Equalizer 2 cared to explore motivations or who is ultimately responsible for the killings. This is one of the most streamlined explorations of a revenge plot that I've ever seen. Yet there's enough meat on the bone for me to still get some enjoyment out of it. If I had one major complaint about The Equalizer 2 it would be that the hero is too infallible. He never once makes a mistake, he never misses a shot, and he never gets injured himself. In a way it dehumanizes him a bit too much and turns him into a superhero. That doesn't make The Equalizer 2 a bad movie, but it's nothing special, just a moderately entertaining revenge film to fill a couple hours.",The Equalizer 2
75,saptesh786,Action with Emotion,7,11 December 2018,Just seen 'Equalizer 2'. A good movie in the view of action and thriller. Although plot is predictable it is worth to watch for Denzel Washington. He is perfect in action especially in quick action. Unfortunately I did not see first Equalizer so I confused about back story and could not connect it with heart. Will see in coming days. Chemistry between Denzel and Ashton Sanders is perfect. Denzel guiding him and force to make study is a brighter side of this darker crime genre story. Also meet scene of brother and sister after a long gap of years is emotional and appraisable. Action scenes are looks real. I recommend this movie to action lovers especially for those who love Denzel Washington.,The Equalizer 2

Acting level infinity.Before watching the movie i knew ""Chloë Grace Moretz"" won't be in it ,, so i went wondering like how it'll work ,, and my thoughts went to the ""Kingsman"" movies .. but after watching the first movie again and then this one ,, i realized that this movie is all about Denzel Washington and boy i liked it this way.back to the story itself ,, it was good ,,as some of the reviews will probably say a bit expected,, but in my opinion,, it was just perfect,, singled out The Equalizer and put him on another category.final thought ,, watching the first movie might not be of necessity but i did it either way ..

77,rockman182,The Equalizer (2018),7,23 July 2018,"I wasn't that crazy about the first Equalizer, but admittedly having Denzel Washington kicking butt is awesome. Its crazy how Denzel has had such a storied career and this is the first sequel that he has done. This also begged the question of if a sequel to The Equalizer was even necessary. Having now seen it, I dug it. Its nothing amazing or unique, but it does what it needs to do when the action comes to make it a brainless popcorn flick.The film follows Denzel's Robert McCall as he has to explore the mysterious deaths of his friend and others. In the midst of this all he takes a liking to a young man who lives in his building. The problem is this young man is steering towards the wrong path; one filled with crime. Also, as with the first film McCall is bringing justice upon those who need it. There's actually quite a few plot points going on with this film, more so than with the first.That's an issue for me. The story with the old man reuniting with his sister could have been omitted. The film tries to stay too busy in its story that it just doesn't feel as focused as it could have been. Also, the film suffers from a cookie cutter weak villain and predictability and familiarity in portions of the plot. Its not the most sharpest effort from Antonio Fuqua but the entertainment value comes from something else.The action in this film is good. Denzel's McCall is very likeable and it is fun watching him to do unto those exactly what they deserve. The fight scenes are shot well. Washington clearly is carrying the series, otherwise I don't think we would have cared as much about this series. For me personally, I think this film is better than the first film although not by much. Its a purely brainless action film that has its strengths where it needs to.7/10",The Equalizer 2

80,Holt344,Worthy sequel with high focus on well choreographed action sequences and great characters,8,17 February 2019,"This is a action thriller that is focused on brutal action sequences, great characters and acting and those three makes perfect for me as it does an incredible job at that. With the focus on the characters and the dark and deep story of Robert McCall we get more of what made the first movie a great thriller but the overall story and plot was lacking, could have been better but this is what we got. Superb choreography and sound editing.If there would be a real life vigilante out there, Denzel Washington would be the perfect man for the job as his portrayal of Robert McCall is splendid, again a perfect performance. The supporting cast is also perfect but not on the same level as Denzel but Pedro Pascal was the other that stood out, I truly missed Chloë Grace Moretz's character in the movie as that was one of my favorite parts of the first movie, the side characters in this movie doesn't give the same feeling and depth as her character had. The same director, Antoine Fuqua is back in the directing chair and once again he doesn't let down in bringing something unique and perfection to the movie, he's one great filmmaker, his movies are pure perfection and it's the same with this one in its own way.",The Equalizer 2
81,RforFilm,"Though it has some satisfying action and Denzel Washington's charm, The Equalizer 2 feels slow an uninterested",5,23 July 2018,"Back in 2014, a movie called The Equalizer was released with Denzel Washington as the lead. I skipped put on it, but with it's sequel now out I decided to take a look. While it's nothing masterful, it was an enjoyable action movie about a one man defending the little guys against the mafia, corrupt politicians, and just about anyone who made his world a bad place. Yeah, I've seen these kinds of people before, but it still worked thanks to Denzel Washington and his natural charm. He's a rare actor who can play either side of the moral line. But when he is the hero, he usually selects roles where despite his good nature, could crack and you don't want that to happen.I've never seen the television series it was based off of, but I can only imagine that it's similar. As I've said, much of the original Equalizer movie works mainly because of actor Denzel Washington and direction by Antoine Fuqua, who also directed him in Training Day and the remake of The Magnificent Seven. I figured that The Equalizer 2 would try to recapture the unexpected hit with more of the same. Former Black Opts agent Robert McCall (played by Denzel Washington) seems to have tried settling down again, this time as a Lyft driver in Boston while living in a apartment complex. He still drawn to helping the little guy, including a woman who he suspects were abused by the people calling him for a Lyft. Still, he seems to rather help in an non confrontational way unless absolutely necessary, including troubled artist Miles (played by Ashton Sanders) and Holocaust survivor Sam (played by Orson Bean). After a visit from his friend Susan Plumber (played by Melissa Leo), she's sent to Brussels to investigate information for Robert, only to be attacked and killed in her hotel room.Like before, Robert jumps right into her murder investigation including breaking into her apartment, speaking to her husband Brian (Played by Bill Pullman), and hacking into her electronics to find any clue. He even contacts his old CIA partner Dave York (played by Pedro Pascal) to see if he knows everything. This results in him doing more of his typical spy/action material, to get to the bottom of things, while trying to be the hero to those in his apartment and in his Lyft car. I won't act like The Equalizer was amazing or original, but I had fun with it. The Equalizer 2 tries, but even the charm of Denzel Washington can't save this. Is this bad? It is, but it's hard to really get mad over this one. The story is just as typical as a lot of spy movies and the result is about what you expect. I won't give away who the villain was, but I was able to figure it out twenty minutes in. it just takes a while for it to reveal. In fact, it takes a while for a lot of things to get going, including the plot. 
I'm not sure what director Antoine Fuqua was thinking, but despite being shorter, the pacing feel slower. I think it has to do with the fact that Denzel's character doesn't really have an arc nor does he learn anything. Something happens, he responds, and...that's it. A lot of James Bond and Mission Impossible movies do this too, but there's at least an attempt on some interesting action scenes and to make the stakes higher. The problem with The Equalizer is that while they try to make it personal, it doesn't seem to affect him. The movie treats Denzel's reaction like he's cleaning up spilled coffee rather then dealing with a friend's death. Will action fans be satisfied? Probably. I can count several action scenes (like the Lyft encounter, gang home, the home invasion, and a hurricane sequence) that I liked, but it does take a while to get there. Or at least it feels like it takes forever. The script is simply trying to build on the surprise success of the first movie, but builds on the wrong areas. It seems more interested in building Denzel on the outside rather then in. I'll give this five Lyft stickers out of ten. It has entertaining parts, but the movie feels so slow, that I'm not even sure it's worth sitting through to get there. I say it's worth a home rental, but nothing major to see on the big screen. If you want to see this just for Denzel, then you'll have plenty to look at. Give it a watch and see if this is someone you really want to see continue.",The Equalizer 2

When someone close to him goes through dire consequences, Robert will stop at nothing to get justice for his friend. The Equalizer 2 is a great film. Director Antoine Fuqua revisits all the aspects, that made The Equalizer(2014) so memorable. However, certain key characters like Chloe Grace Moretz's character, is dearly missed in this sequel. This movie is also slightly dragging in bits & pieces, unlike the first one. The action set pieces are fantastic. The climax is the highlight of the film, with the stakes being much higher compared to the original's climax. Denzel Washington is spectacular as Robert McCall. Pedro Pascal is outstanding as Dave York. Ashton Sanders is amazing as Miles Whittaker. Bill Pullman is brilliant as Brian Plummer. Melissa Leo is excellent as Susan Plummer. The supporting cast is effective. The Equalizer 2 is a must watch for fans of the first one & Denzel Washington fans. Go enjoy Denzel effortlessly kicking a lot of butts.",The Equalizer 2
83,bankofmarquis,"Smart, well-acted action flick",8,29 July 2018,"I really enjoyed the first EQUALIZER film. Based on the TV show of the same name, it followed the exploits of Denzel Washington as he ""righted wrongs"". I nicknamed this film ""how to kill bad guys with things you find at your local Home Depot"", for that is what happens. Denzel's character improvises traps and weapons to dispatch the evil-doers.So...I was ""all in"" when they announced a sequel to this flick. I figured that Washington and his frequent collaborator, Director Antoine Fuqua (both Equalizer's as well as helming Denzel's Oscar winning performance in TRAINING DAY) would make things ""bigger and badder"" as often happens in sequels - bigger stakes, more bad guys, bigger - and trickier - improvisations - this time, perhaps at a Walmart!But I was wrong - they didn't go bigger, they went smaller and smarter - and the movie is better for it.In EQUALIZER 2, we get more personal with Denzel's character, Robert McCall. There still are plenty of bad guys getting the punishment they deserve, but it is the toll on McCall and the reasoning behind why he is doing what he is doing that is at center stage in this film, putting the weight of this film, rightfully so, on Denzel's more than capable shoulders. He comes through - as he always does - tremendously well. There is one scene where Denzel is trying to get a teenage boy to walk away from a gang. I was amazed that I was watching an ""Academy Award"" level scene in the middle of an action flick, but that is absolutely what it is.Now...make no mistake...there is plenty of action, chases and violence in this film, but Fuqua shows great restraint, giving the violence a purpose instead of being gratuitous. Even when they have a final battle in the middle of a hurricane-level storm, Fuqua rightfully focuses on the people element of things - and not the spectacle of the elements and circumstances.Both Fuqua and Washington make some smart choices in this film, which makes it a smart movie, well made with just enough action to please all.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",The Equalizer 2
84,agmoldham,Will there be a third,5,29 August 2018,"It's 4 years since the first Equalizer and the second movie carries on where that left off. The balance between action and plot has moved more towards action in the second movie and that's probably not a good thing. In addition to that the good side of Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) doesn't seem quite as believable in the second installment.The plot doesn't really contain any surprises and isn't really distinguishable from most of the action movies churned out by Hollywood. Denzel Washington is always watchable though and that is the saving grace for this movie. It's a shame we didn't get to see more of Bill Pullman. Undoubtedly not one of Washington's better performances, but even a mediocre Washington is well worth a watch.",The Equalizer 2
85,Vivekmaru45,Solid sequel to the original.,8,20 November 2018,"I was well entertained on Sunday when I watched the film. Denzel Washington is a favorite actor of mine. I have seen such good films of his in the past: Philadelphia(1993), The Pelican Bried(1993), Crimson Tide(1995), Virtuosity(1995), Fallen(1998), The Bone Collector(1999), The Hurricane(1999),Training Day(2001), John Q(2002) and many more...I am also a great fan of director Antoine Fuqua and I love his style of direction. The movie continues from the previous one, Robert McCall(Washington) now lives in a diverse apartment complex in urban Massachusetts. He is working as a Lyft driver and assists the less fortunate with the help of his friend, Susan Plummer. One day, Susan and DIA operative Dave York, McCall's former teammate, are called to investigate an apparent murder-suicide of an agent and his wife in Brussels. When the two separate after reaching their hotel, Susan is murdered in an apparent robbery. When he receives the news, McCall begins to investigate both her death and the case she was investigating.The action sequences in the film, background sound-effects and cinematography are extremely well executed. Antoine is a director with great vision and you can see that in all his movies. Denzel gives another excellent performance and his acting is very convincing.

87,MihaiSorinToma,A worthy sequel of a great movie,10,11 August 2018,"Robert McCall, an apparently normal man who works as a taxi driver, is a person with a complex past which has granted him a great set of skills regarding combat. Due to his nature, he tries with every occasion he gets to make justice, using his own methods. But, as a beloved person of his gets involved into a big conspiracy, he'll have to go much deeper than his normal acts in order to get to the bottom of the mystery.As a sequel to The Equalizer, a movie which I truly admire, we face the same character of Robert McCall, during his everyday routine. Unfortunately, he will soon be faced with a great conspiracy which will, once again, put his skills to the test, amazing us with every chance it gets. The story it features is pretty well thought and put into play, managing to make everything coherent and attractive. The movie also has a gift of creating links between characters. Multiple times, we're presented scenes which some might find static or boring, but have a great impact in terms of character development. They make you care about them, about what is going to happen to them, thus making the impact it prepares with its intrigue more powerful and also more dramatic.McCall's character is by far the most important, being very impressive with what it does and how it manages difficult situations, while involved in multiple threads at the same time. I got so attached to it that it really managed to keep me in a state of suspense throughout the entire movie, especially towards the end. The action sequences in which he's involved are also very well executed, making it even more impressive. It also manages to be very unpredictable, having a couple of twists up its sleeve, ready to pop out when you least expect them.I have to say that I am really impressed by Denzel Washington. I really admire his work, his dedication towards the characters he portrays and this movie is absolutely no exception. His tough character really make this movie entertaining, fact which I find in all of his movies. He has an unique way of making his characters likeable and credible, fact which makes him a great actor.As a conclusion, it's a movie which is hard to dislike, at least as far as I'm concerned. You have great a character development, plenty of action, plenty of drama and a very good plot, thus being an entertaining picture overall. It is on par with my expectations and it is on par with the first installment as well, which I personally loved. If you liked the first one, you'll certainly like this one as well. It really has everything I want to see from this type of movies.",The Equalizer 2

91,kjproulx,A Superior Follow-Up,8,20 July 2018,"It's not all that often that a film receives lukewarm critical reception and only a decent box office return, but still somehow manages to get its main star and director returning for a sequel, but here we are. The Equalizer 2 has just hit the big screen and I feel my reception of this film is going to be different from many viewers. The first film was a solid movie that took far too much time to get to each action sequence and its runtime was far too long in my opinion. I enjoyed it, but I wasn't raving about it like a lot of moviegoers were. With that said, I find myself feeling that way towards this sequel. In my opinion, The Equalizer 2 takes the best elements of the original film and goes in a new direction, which I think made for a much better viewing experience. Here's why I believe this is a superior film and why you absolutely should check it out if you liked the first film, or if you're just a fan of the genre.When the first movie concludes, it has a slight opening to allow for sequels, which I was pleased by, because with a central character like Robert McCall, there is a lot you can do, story-wise. Continuing to explore the underground gangs and any other clans that may be wronging citizens around him, he now operates as a Lyft driver, meeting as many people as possible and getting to know different personalities. When a close friend is taken from him, he is thrust back into action, bringing up hidden secrets from his past and making for a much more engaging piece of storytelling (in comparison with the first film) in my opinion. On top of that, the absolute best thing about this film is the fact that it doesn't have much connection with the first film at all and really does stand on its own.Denzel Washington continuously proves why he is known as one of the greatest actors of our generation and his performance here doesn't hinder that at all. His person on-screen is enough to hook you alone, but I believe the true standout performance/character here is in Miles Whittaker, played very well by Ashton Sanders. Receiving critical praise for his role in Moonlight, I have had my eye on him ever since, and I recognized him the second he popped up in this film. His character arc was fantastic in my opinion and is pretty much what took this film from being enjoyable to bordering on being great.In terms of the action, you pretty much get what you expect and the movie plays out in a very similar fashion to its predecessor, but I think the pacing is far more improved here. With some hardcore kills and a final set-piece that felt very unique for a film like this, I was impressed from start to finish. When it comes to the villain of the film, however, I was surprised, but letdown at the same time. You can sort of see when a villain will come into play, and the way that it occurs did catch me off guard, but, upon re-viewings, I truly believe that twist will wear pretty thin.Overall, The Equalizer 2 does almost everything that the first film failed to do for me. It creates a compelling reason for him to need to dive into his past, it brings in new supporting characters that added a much-needed depth to the overall emotional core, and the action sequences didn't feel as much like set pieces as they did in the original movie. At a solid two hours, I think this film breezed by fairly quickly and the direction by Antoine Fuqua is definitely the culprit for that aspect. He is always able to get fantastic performances out of his actors and I can truly see him directing a film that receives Academy recognition one day. The Equalizer 2 has its issues and won't be everyone's cup of tea, but if you enjoyed the first movie or if you liked it in any way, I have a feeling you won't be disappointed with this follow-up.",The Equalizer 2
92,kuarinofu,Not even that bad,7,17 November 2018,"Surprisingly enough, the sequel is not weaker than the first one and even does surpass the original in many ways. It is slower, but not too slow. It has some very basic and ground-level morality and life philosophy built to ground the concept of the Equalizer itself. While it is stupid in some ways, I generally liked the message they were trying to give.I would've given this a better rating but the place this movie takes in-between basic everyday life drama and a mindless home alone style action just doesn't work so well for me. Some of the writing also was cringy and in-your-face, but I guess there was no big surprise over this movie anyway. I wish they would take more risks and make the main character actually challenge his beliefs. He's too perfect as he is.This should've been more focused. Yet I do understand the idea behind this, the Equalizer does good for people and restores the balance with his everyday actions but sometimes he has to do this with force and vengeance. This adds a lot of side stories that barely contribute to anything besides the idea I just mentioned.Overall, for what they were trying to do - they have succeeded. Not particularly enjoyable personally for me, but still a good watch after all.P.S. I love how this role is perfectly written for Washington (you'd see that immediately if you've seen some of his interviews).",The Equalizer 2
93,bopdog,Very good - and the lack of logic and narrative flow is easily overlooked,8,21 July 2018,"I had a good time. Denzel is a god, of course, so he's always watchable. I must present a quibble, however: the movie makes little sense. Haha! I took it in as a series of random scenes that were not really tied together or explained.I did not know what the Denzel character did, or for whom, or why. About 3/4 of the way through I also realized that I had no idea who the villains were, or who they worked for, or why. Despite that I enjoyed myself, and guess that you will too. It IS very well made, if not particularly careful with the narrative flow.",The Equalizer 2
94,brankovranjkovic,"Equalizer2 - works as a taxi driver this time, listens to his passengers, fixes their problems.",7,11 September 2018,"Gritty action adventure.Based on the British 1980's TV drama.Denzel Washington plays the mysterious Black Ops veteran with OCD. Denzel works as a taxi driver this time, listens to his passengers, fixes their problems. Denzel plays the customary 'father figure' to a talented teenage artist who he meets, who is in with the wrong crowd and being led astray, so he helps him with advice 'it takes talent to make money, but it takes brains to keep it' - basically 'stay in school and work hard'.
 
Revenge and brutality are frequent themes in the multitude of plots, but it's Denzel who carries the film throughout.Not great but better than the original, starts well, but goes a little downhill from the hurricane scene to the end (15 minutes)",The Equalizer 2
95,lojitsu,There are two kinds of pain in this world...,8,22 August 2018,"""The Equalizer 2""
Or: ""He was scarier with his head shaved.""
 Genre: Action/ThrillerWhen I heard this was coming, I had such anticipation. John Wick 2 was so close to the first that I couldn't wait for this one to hit the big screen. It was a little disappointing that the movie could not live up to the original...but I still liked it a lot. Let's get the tea bag and the spoon ready for this installment of The Lowedown and break this movie down OCD style!
Cast=7
Denzel Washington returns to tackle the role of Robert McCall...that's worth four points! We also have the return of Melissa Leo and Bill Pullman and that's worth another two points. I'll close it out with one point for the addition of Pedro Pascal...This is the 3rd big role I have seen him in, so his point total is about to get a lot bigger (Kingsman: The Golden Circle and The Great Wall). That will bring the score to seven out of the gate.
Acting=8
Denzel always shines as an actor...I can feel his emotions and he never disappoints. Melissa Leo and Bill Pullman were good, but I give mad props to Ashton Sanders; who plays this film's hard luck story. This earns a respectable eight points to the total.
Plot=8
Robert McCall has been helping the innocent and standing up for justice and respect...but when his dear friend is killed he comes out of hiding to get to the cause and to make sure those responsible pay the ultimate price. The plot is a little vanilla, but still worth it's mustard when you are considering those involved. Throwing eight points for a solid yet worn plot.
Ending=10
Here's is my recipe for a great ending...insurmountable odds with a pinch of a background event to add tension, stir in lots of explosions and gunfire and bring to a boil with an innocent in danger. It's takes an even braver man to stand up to his friends...I award ten points to Neville Longbottom!!
Story=7
The predictable nature of the story loses a little bit of weight for me. It's still solid, but I knew what was going to happen before it happened. Still a good story, although There are a few dragged parts I was able to get the closure I wanted. With that, I will award seven points and seven points is what I award.
Favorite Quote: ""There are two kinds of pain in this world...the pain that hurts, the pain that alters.""Genre: Action
Violent=10
Of course it's violent...about the same amount of violence as the first. It seems like a new 'one man army' era has formed with John Wick, Robert McCall, and Jack Reacher out in front. When you know the character and what makes him mad...you can't help but feel sorry for the bad guys when they do it. Ten points are given happily to the score.
Pace=7
The pace has to be epic with the action genre and this doesn't quite stack up. There were a few slow parts that take away from the overall excitement of the film. It was like the difference between running on level ground and running uphill...you have to work a little harder to get over it but it's rewarding when you reach the top. Seven points for a good but not great pace.
F/X=9
The effects are top notch...just a little issue with the CGI that caused a blur at the end so I can't award full points. It's directed by Antoine Fuqua, so the camerawork and visuals are amazing...he can really get his point across from the other side of the lens. Let's give Equalizer 2 a score of nine for tis aspect...well done.Sub-Genre: Thriller
Intense=8
""I'm going to kill each and every one of you...and the disappointing thing for me is I only get to do it once."" The intensity was really good, but not as good as the first. That intensity factor is when you are sitting in your seat doing what I call ""White-Knuckling it""; which means you are gripping the seat in anticipation for the ball to drop. I'll give this a respectable eight points.
Twist=7
You know there has to be a twist for a Thriller to give you what you want. There is a good twist here, but you can see it coming a mile off. I could spoil it, but that would be just wrong...I will leave it for you to make that sandwich yourself. I will cap it all off with seven points.
My Score: 8.1
Yes my friends, this is a full point lower than the first film, but solid scores for all aspects. The steak may be under seasoned, but it's still a steak. Throw some salt on that puppy and have fun with it...just make sure you throw some over your shoulder for good luck. I hope it does well enough in the theater to make a third one...they should close it out as a trilogy. It's ok...I can wait.",The Equalizer 2
96,athies,Good dental advice..,4,23 December 2018,"There is no way to rush through a revolving door.Seems like a lot of time given because they have specific scenes to shoot.I assume the doctor?

He just said he would!Those specific scenes from earlier where to keep up satiated during the investigation portion.These gangsters not coming down the stairs after him?Should've stabbed through the seat.He's drinking his orange juice :)People left their car lights on.He should bar the trapdoor.Before he could have a line. I saw how they had someone be his voice to call for entry than moved the shot back to him. All so they didn't have to pay him. Tsk. Tsk.He's not returning your call.",The Equalizer 2
97,TheTruthofItIs,Batman as a Lyft operator,6,8 December 2018,"Denzel, now 64(!), plays a retired (previously reported ""dead"") special ops guy that makes a prosaic living as a Lyft operator. This affords him various opportunities to perform vigilante justice, not far removed from Batman, where he kicks butts that are 20-30 yrs younger, hmm. In fact, given he always talks calm, measured and low and has a panic room in his place which further fosters the superhero image. So if you're expecting authenticity and plausibility, sorry. His fight scenes are purely showcases for his awesomeness, I don't think he's ever even injured, not a cut, so... The one scene that held my interest for a few moments was the table talk he had with Dave a bit more than half way through, discussing the philosophy that justifies. The rest of the film is Denzel as plainclothes Batman, meh.",The Equalizer 2
98,apryla-58795,Denzel is solid...nuff said,10,2 January 2019,Denzel can't miss. I want to keep seeing these. I hope they make as many more possible while he's still alive and able-bodied enough to do so.Love ya Denzel!Oh also the young kid was really good. Hope to see him more.,The Equalizer 2
99,cdcrb,"revenge, not so sweet.",6,24 July 2018,"It's a sequel, so, you know. denzel is a legitimate movie star (there aren't very many of them) and as usual he's fine. the story is pretty tired, but the cinematography is really good and the film looks very professional. and expensive. the wind up is a real mess, though.",The Equalizer 2
100,rdoubleoc,Better than the first.,8,4 July 2019,"Surprised to see reviews saying this wasn't as face paced. While that may be true, I ultimately think it is the better movie of the two.",The Equalizer 2
101,statuskuo,Denzel As Travis Bickell,7,29 July 2018,"Let's be honest, we LOVE Denzel when he's a man who was wronged and needs to right the ship. Typically the smartest guy in the room and also the most active even when he's not active, he has taken the reigns from former middle aged do-gooder Liam Neeson to thwart gangs, child abductors, treacherous government officials and...vegetable gardens?
We WANT a Denzel in our neighborhood. A man who says and does what is necessary for peace, though always in the shadow of dark assignments that once made him more lethal than a bomb.
What I love about this movie is that the critics disliked it. Why? Most likely because the film addresses victimization of the urban landscape. How we can't fall into the patterns of thug life in order for others to make you a statistic. In this, McCall demands a wannabe gangster in training man-up and straighten out his life, less he loses it. Unfortunately, it's Denzel's world that jeopardizes lives. And anyone he is in contact with. Though, he understands the responsibility it needs. That's too conservative of a thought process for the liberal media (critics). But Americans love that we are tired of bad people doing bad things and everyone ignoring it. This time McCall gets to see the underbelly, in what I can only describe as director Antoine Fuqua's ode to ""Taxi Driver."" Perhaps channeling the kinder side of Travis Bickell.
I love Denzel's slow boil. We anticipate some awful happen to awful people. And you get the feeling that even hard gangsters respect Denzel's drive to be on the right side of the law.",The Equalizer 2
102,saadanathan,Spectacular performance 7/10,7,1 July 2020,"I believe The Equalizer 2 is way better than the first one, it has a richer story and more Intel on Robert McCall (Washington). His character is more developed, now he not only goes to help other people in their manners but has a new motive, to avenge a friend's death. Washington proves again with his acting skills that he is one of the best actors of all time. It's always a pleasure to see Pedro Pascal in a movie, he gives new senses to the story and movie. Great cinematography with long shots and close ups, the sequence in the island during the storm, the final battle was perfect and well portrayed. Antoine Fuqua is a good director and for the first time that he directed a sequel, he did a pretty good job.",The Equalizer 2
103,sbweightman,"Overall, pretty unremarkable",4,27 September 2018,"A slower paced and more down to earth action thriller that is pretty unremarkable apart from the strong acting from the lead characters. The plot is predictable and heavy handed and the final confrontation is a bit far-fetched, but the action scenes are quick, violent and well put together.",The Equalizer 2
104,latinfineart,Pretty entertaining,7,10 October 2020,"This is certainly no masterpiece, but it was a pretty good story, typically great acting by Denzel some good supporting characters. Fairly well directed, pretty tight production and compared to the majority of the dribble that is coming out of Hollywood for the past 10 years or so, this is a pretty decent film. Definitely entertaining.",The Equalizer 2
105,FrenchEddieFelson,Almost boring,6,16 March 2019,"If in the first opus, Robert McCall annihilates the Russian underworld of Boston, on the other hand, in the second opus, he ... helps. He just helps, nothing more. By being slightly in bad faith: he helps an elderly brother to find his sister, he helps a young woman abused by 3/4 men, he helps a student with his art studies, he helps a mother to find her young daughter gone on the wrong train, ...In the third opus (if any), he will probably be a nursery school supervisor and we'll see him reduced to dealing with conflicts between these kids.The second opus is significantly less exciting than the previous one. Still efficient but disappointing.",The Equalizer 2
106,cinemamoviecars,"this time, is personal",10,18 October 2021,"This sequel of the equalizer not only his more dramatic, also have alot of melancholic moments from the start to finish. Is the kind of action movie that denzel know best. Gruesome action scenes mixed with sadness and morals, all in the same movie. Even the ending of the movie let you thinking, that even the equalizer gets more wounds inside than you can imagine.is equal sad, equal moving, equal good at being a action movie. This script basically feels more tony scott than the previous equalizer, and that movie already have shades of that style.",The Equalizer 2
107,funtasticfour,"Still fun, but the first was far better",6,20 January 2019,"I remember the series in the 80's. It was one of many fun shows, that I'm not surprised was made into movies. Denzel is an excellent actor, and revenge movies are fun, but they don't necessarily belong together. In my opinion, it's often been a last resort for actors as they get older. Liam Neeson, Sean Penn and scores of others. I'm sure there are lots of better roles than this available to Denzel, and I""m also sure he's not desperate for a pay check. That being said, the first movie was quite good and this one is ok. This one is supposed to be more personal, but the first one felt more so because of his hardware job, which felt like a family, and the set up for the end in the hardware store was excellent, whereas this old town in a storm ending was just not up to par.",The Equalizer 2

Like the opening of this movie on the train - slap, bang, boom! But this movie slows down - way, way down. I would use the word 'boring' for some stretches. I think this movie suffers in comparison to the first, in that there is no strong bad guy. Marton Csokas was so great in this role in the first one, and in part two, it takes a while for the bad guy(s) to even appear. Conversely, this movie has much better support roles, and most importantly, no horrible acting like Ralphie and his mom! Denzel is awesome, and goes big time in his speech at the crack house! BIG time! Part one is much better, but I liked this one, and would definitely go see Mr. McCall again!",The Equalizer 2

111,nikola17,Still Good Sequel and it's Watchable But It Needs Changes.,7,23 July 2018,"I am a Denzel Washington and Antoine Fuqua fan they love working together it's great i liked first Equalizer film i saw back in theater in 2014 it was good worth watching but i thought it was too much mixed with Man on Fire (2004) sequel but this was very like Equalizer, but it's still and still 2h 1min film i mean it's same running hours just like first movie, the movie needs to be slaright forward action opening scene has action but then it slows down a lot, i almost fell sleep i am like what the heck ? then i got back to movie. the movie is far and far too slow again needs to change into fast paced it needs more of Denzel Washington character it needs more FOCUS on him Robert McCall not any another characters ? just like first movie, story goes Robert McCall then it goes with him training Security guy ? i am like ok ? but in sequel i thought it would be better much better but for me it ended up just like first it was good worth watching but it hasn't changed anything for me I was really excited when I started seeing the commercials for EQ2. I read they wanted to make a sequel for years, but nothing really came about. I really enjoy action in this movie and first i would have to say the action POP up in opening it was great then sadly it slowed down then action doesn't began like in 30 minutes or something, sadly but it doesn't make to hate movie to death i liked the showdown at end of it was better then Warehouse scene. i wanted Antoine Fuqua to focus on Denzel character not anybody else it just slowed me down it slows down the action, the trailer and poster made look like action movie but it slows down for too much drama, The story line was similar to the first Equalizer Denzel helping those who have been wronged i am like please that needs to be stopped how about focus more of McCall then People who has been wronged, but there is a new location, new job, and new characters. i don't understand why film it doesn't move on it's fast pace to make it a slaright forward movie like John Wick because In John Wick it really Focus his character a lot more not anybody else in movie. in this franchise of Equalizer it focus Robert McCall but then it switch's to another characters focuses on them i am like what ? that's what it needs to be more Proving more effort in just Robert McCall it needs more focus in Robert McCall nothing else just him and it needs more slaright forward action just like John Wick, that's what it needs to be improved. but film i enjoyed it so far it was alright it has action moments in movie i liked i would give credit to a lot of it. there's no cut scenes this time just like first movie, in this sequel i swear to myself no cut scenes, where McCall kills Bad Guys that's good it needs to show violence in movie. Showdown at end of movie was good way better then first movie at Warehouse at end witch it made laugh at final bit of movie. You get a couple of twists and turns here and there and Denzel's acting really fits the role.story still continues (Denzel Washington) returns as Robert McCall, a vigilante-type figure and former special forces operative who now lives in a diverse apartment complex in urban Massachusetts he doesn't work in warehouse anymore he moved Neighborhoods and he works as a begins the movie on a mission in Turkey. After such prologue, the film centers in on its primary narrative thread: Robert is working as a Lyft driver and helping the less fortunate with the help from his friend, Susan Plummer. One of McCall's loyal Lyft customersa woman Susan Plummer (Melissa Leowho) from first film she was in she is husband to Brian Plummer (Bill Pullman) not much in movie McCall he worked with on multiple missions has been killed by thugs in Brussels. he is out their finding out who did it. and it doesn't explain and doesn't do anything with Chloë Grace Moretz, nothing explains anything about first movie just shows Plummer's characters back and McCall as lead, i thought action in some scenes were really good i liked how he got job as a Lyft driver then he saw crying girl in his car her shirt is been ripped off like she is been raped, then he goes back beats up 4 guys up, there's something missing in trailer when he said have you seen star trek makes guy hand to Vulcan salute then he snaps guy fingers, in scene i wasn't sleep but all Robert said give me a 5 star rating that's all and it happens he doesn't say star trek bit that's cut of for some reason ? when you watch Trailer and to movie you will understand the difference i like that part is improved. this movie is like it's on it's own not copyed like Man on Fire because if you watch Man on Fire and Equalizer and John Wick together you will know it's kinda same movie, this movie you can't relate noting to it, it's what it is. i loved at end of showdown of Hurricane storm in his location where his house where he use to live in, that was good part of movie the showdown kept me on no cut to cut scenes. it showed a bit of origin of Robert McCall in movie no flashback scenes, just talks you need to imagine it witch it was good and it ended well, never ended like there's no sequel their is going to be a Equalizer 3, it needs different director who knows how to make a fast paced action film not focusing like first Equalizer Denzel helping those who have been wronged i am like please that needs to be stopped how about focus more of McCall then People who has been wronged. i love Antoine Fuqua but maybe another director would maybe be a better choice maybe but if Antoine keeps directing this franchise no problem at all he needs to improve more of action, more slaright forward kicking ass action just like John Wick films, it needs to stop focusing another characters people who has been wronged. i am like jeez focus more of Robert McCall. i give this 7.10 just like first Equalizer (2014) in 4 years nothing has changed with sequel still slow pacing, still not focusing too much Robert McCall character it goes to another characters what it needs to be focusing is McCall that's all no one else, what has changed is no cut scenes, action is far better then first movie, this was a lot better action at showdown at Hurricane Storm it was great, lets see about 3rd Equalizer Antoine Fuqua Needs to improve more and it needs fast action paced not slow down beat to middle of movie.",The Equalizer 2
112,SkullScreamerReturns,Decent sequel if you liked the character first time around,6,23 September 2020,"I was happy when I noticed there is a sequel to The Equalizer. That was a surprisigly good action film where Denzel Washington became a major action hero. But the character was left a little bit hollow, so it's great to have a sequel to expand the story. So, Washington returns as the former agent/assassin/whatever who lives a peaceful life and is a humble guy, but he has his secret past with powerful enemies, and also his personal code of justice; everytime he sees people treated bad he will give the bad guys what they deserve!The sequel is a little bit slower with less action. That's ok with me. Denzel Washington does again a great performance and his character alone is so relatable and cool that it redeems the film no matter what. I read that this the first ever sequel of Washington's career. I guess he's careful to choose what project to take part in, and his judgement was that this character is so good that it's worth a second shot. I'm glad he thought so. (Actually I wouldn't mind even more sequels!)We get to learn more about the main character's past and the overall situation in his life. That's all good. My only complaint is that the story is...how should I put it...a bit unfocused. There are a lot of small story elements that could have been expanded even more. It feels like watching a Netflix series compressed to one movie. I think with a little bit more adjusting the script could have been even better.If you liked the first movie and the main character, then you will probably like this film too. Just don't expect it to be exactly like the first part.",The Equalizer 2
113,Cinemaniac1984,Enjoyable action thriller and Denzel Washington is awesome to watch,7,19 July 2018,"Following the blockbusting success of The Equalizer back in 2014, we see the return of Denzel Washington as Robert McCall in The Equalizer II. Antoine Fuqua also returns to the director's chair as well. Denzel Washington has enjoyed a stellar career (Training Day is my personal favourite movie of his) and The Equalizer II has the distinction of being the first sequel that Denzel has appeared in. While I had an enjoyable time in the cinema, the first movie is definitely superior.Retired CIA Agent Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) continues to live the quiet life as a Lyft driver in Boston but also works secretly as a vigilante by setting out to right the wrongs in society by unleashing swift justice to the perpetrators and protecting the victims. Robert McCall finds himself returning to his old life when his best friend Susan Plummer (Melissa Leo) is murdered by thugs under mysterious circumstances after she starts to uncover a secret conspiracy involving the deaths of other agents at the hands of highly trained assassins. McCall also reunites with a former friend Dave York (Pedro Pascal) with whom he worked with years ago.Watching Denzel Washington return to his role as Robert McCall was definitely the main reason why I enjoyed the movie. In the first movie, you saw an everyday man go about his business and there was an air of mystery about his lethal skills and abilities. I also found myself quietly cheering during the climatic action scenes. The storyline was cleverly done and it was still great fun to see McCall take down the bad guys. One slight disappointment was that I felt like some of the action scenes were a bit overblown which slightly tarnished the movie. That aside, I was glued to my seat throughout the whole movie and there was no way that I was going to dismiss this as just another sequel. The ending also opens the door for a third movie.If you are a fan of Denzel Washington and you liked the first movie, sit back and have a great time watching Denzel in action.7/10.",The Equalizer 2

I found the first one to be a bit slow paced but this one is actually better. If you're looking for the next big thing, this movie is probably not for you. It's predictable and full of clichés but it's also fun and there are even a few touching moments. The storyline is similar to the first Equalizer, here Robert McCall is working as a driver, helping random strangers and punishing those who need to pay until someone close to him gets hurt and then all bets are off. Personally, I like watching the bad guys get what they deserve.

Pedro Pascal is 43 and Denzel Washington is 64. Couldn't the director take noticed that an oldie take over a much younger person with so ease? And it was so predictable that Pedro was going to end up rogue, as his previous characters from Kingsmen...Even Melissa's character fate!Denzel giving lessons of motivation to the teenager was the highlight of this package.

120,DuskShadow,Where are the reviews by those that actually know about Death?,8,8 November 2019,"I see none. Ever.
All I ever see when crummy movies get made are sterling reviews by snowflakes that have about as much taste as somebody born without tastebuds.
Yet when a better than decent, good movie, with some unique elements that work so well come about, the snowflakes suddenly melt under the delusion they know what they are talking about. But thats always wrong.
Where are the reviews by those that have killed? That know the pain and torment of sleepless days and nights haunted by the faces of the innocent and guilty alike, taken dispassionately since the advent of the most cruel and impersonal wepaon of all: the modern gun.
Where are those that have served, or work in private security, or those that have held and shot guns regularly? OR gotten into fights of the truest variety that can only end one way?
Well all I will say is, this movie, was about such a man. A man, like most men, but that had simply gone a bit further, so to speak, and lived to tell the tale. To try to make up for any amount of the wrongs done in his life. A man with a certain..set of skills. lol No I am not meaning to refer to Taken, but its much the same character tbh. A man, made to be more than just a lackey, a thug, a soldier or warrior. But an assassin, trained to kill dispassionately and quickly. Efficiently and stealthily. And then not to fall apart when the game is over and theres no foe left to take out. This movie was not much longer than others, but the pacing and placement of events was so well orchestrated that it seemed to last a long, but not torturous amount of time. Everything had its place and purpose, including one of the coolest envirment fights I have seen without a buncha of cgi. A great sequel that engaged and drew me in, and filled me in more on the bakcground of our would be Equalizer. BEtter than the first film. Well donw Dezenl Washington. 8/10",The Equalizer 2

Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - The Equalizer 2. So we're in that sequel territory. It's an area beset with pitfalls and black holes into which some films deserve to fall, never to be seen again. Not this one. Denzel Washington revives his role as Robert McCall, a man retired from black Ops who now acts as a vigilante looking out for those who are downtrodden and oppressed. I didn't remember much from the first film and I can honestly say that is not a problem. This is a stand alone film and I can honestly say I have never sat through a film that is so slow yet so gripping. It took a long time to bring all the pieces of the puzzle together to give us the whole picture. The scenes seemed to jump back and forth between different plot lines but eventually it all came together and you come to the realisation of how everything is linked to create the overall story. Superb performance from Denzel, that guy is ageing like a fine wine and long may he produce acting like this. I like how so much was said on the screen without masses of dialogue, and the relationships McCall built up with his neighbours gives you a look into the sort of man he could be without all the baggage. If you want to see a film that keeps you rooted to your seat, this is it!!!",The Equalizer 2
123,ginocox-206-336968,Denzel goes all #MeToo on those who assault women,5,5 November 2018,"The Equalizer 2 features thirteen product placements, according to ProductPlacementBlog. Some seem natural fits. McCall (Denzel Washington) times his fights, so the fight scenes are bookended by shots of the Suunto sports watch on his wrist. Others seem to intrude into the plot. McCall no longer works at the home improvement shop, and is now driving for Lyft, which also provides multiple opportunities to feature a Chevrolet Malibu in numerous scenes and even to mention the model in dialogue. Others seem incongruous, such as the BMW M55i automobile McCall drives in one scene. Why is McCall, who lives modestly to avoid attracting attention to himself, cruising around in an $80,000 BMW?However, even the most incongruous product placement isn't nearly as distracting as the imbedded political messages. One subplot concerns an Iranian immigrant neighbor, who spends much of her time tending to a vegetable garden, gives McCall some of her vegetables and is the victim of a senseless hate crime. The implication is that immigrants are good-hearted, industrious people, particularly the Iranians, who would never cheat on international accords, develop nuclear weapons, or fund terrorist groups such as such as Hezbollah, Hamas, Islamic Jihad or the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.A child is kidnapped and spirited out of the country by an abusive estranged husband, but the government is powerless to intervene. Obviously, we need stronger laws to protect women, children and especially mothers, who should always have custody.A young man on his way to a job interview rehearses commending a prospective employer's record of environmental responsibility.A swarthy, corpulent girl who seems to be of Mideast descent, calls her mother to announce her acceptance into a college of engineering. The implications are that girls should be given the educational opportunities denied them in many Muslim countries and that minor speaking roles should be given to plus-size actors, not to the producer's comely girlfriend.An ethnically mixed group of children get along famously, because school integration and inclusion programs work.The bad guys all use military-grade assault-style automatic rifles, suggesting we need stronger gun control.A subplot stretched across half a dozen scenes borrows heavily from Woman in Gold to convey the message that survivors continue to suffer from Holocaust atrocities, especially the separation of families, vis-à-vis separation of illegal immigrant families by ICE.In a lengthy subplot, McCall goes #MeToo on a group of affluenza types who apparently drugged and gang-raped a prostitute, but didn't even bother to ask her name.One almost expects McCall to wear a Hillary For America T-shirt.The political messages are invariably liberal. And yet McCall engages in vigilantism, carries a concealed weapon without a permit, doesn't store his weapons in a firearms safe, seizes and searches cell phones without a warrant, uses threats and torture to elicit confessions, et cetera. Adventure thrillers are, by their nature, right-wing and the numerous imbedded liberal political messages seem incongruous and distracting.Beyond that, the time spent lingering on product placement shots and political commentary leaves less time for plot and character development. Consequently, the movie drags a bit and is ultimately less satisfying.TE2 has no conventional romantic subplot. McCall has no girlfriend, but frequently sits around acting morose over the death of his wife. No girls come on to him. He doesn't visit a strip club or even ogle a pretty girl walking down the street. There are no scenes of gratuitous sex, no femmes fatales, or sexy girls in revealing outfits, or even muscle dudes displaying chiseled bodies. Everybody keeps their clothes on, although the only product placement for clothes seems to be for trainers. The only person McCall hugs is another guy. The setting is very feminist-centric.In place of a romantic subplot, we have several ersatz love relationships. An old Jewish Holocaust survivor is a father figure. McCall's former CIA handler is a surrogate mother figure. A neighbor who is at risk of becoming a gangbanger is a surrogate child, as is a young girl he rescues. His former fellow mercenary assassins are surrogate brothers.There are several scenes depicting violence toward women. Several scenes touch upon the evils of consuming alcohol or drugs. Women are strong, equal partners. The entire movie has a strong liberal feminist vibe, like a modern WCTU perspective.There are no chase scenes. The martial arts are quick-cut and difficult to follow. Forensics and police procedures are a bit dubious.Production values and performances are solid, although not exemplary.Overall, the film is not bad, but feels as if it could be much better. If all the screen time, effort and passion that was devoted to political messages that are largely irrelevant to the plot were instead devoted to making the characters more three-dimensional and the plot more credible and less derivative, the film could be much, much better.",The Equalizer 2
124,mgd_m,"Starts good, ends flat",6,14 April 2019,"This actually starts better than the first movie, expressing a lot of potential while depicting Robert's everyday life, and all the small and great things he does. Halfway through, I thought ""Hey, this is probably the best action character ever created"". And I mean it.
But what seems to be an interesting international intrigue is soon killed off, the plot becomes flat, and the last 30 minutes are standard action, without all the fun and creative kills that ended the first movie.",The Equalizer 2
125,Mcduff3601,utterly dissapointed,5,5 November 2018,"The writing/story for this sequel falls short on so many levels. I am a HUGE fan of the first movie. I was soooooo stoked when I saw it was going to be the same everything, the same writers the same director the same actor but they blew it.They stripped out some of the things that made the 1st one great, supporting characters that had some depth where you cared about them. A villian that showed just how bad he could be. A hero who has almost super powers but seems vulnerable at the same time. This movie has none of that.There is a twist that you can see coming a mile away so there is little to no emotion when it happens. The moments that McCall does his thing seem so flat, even the climax of the movie.I really don't know how you can take a great movie like EQ1 and not realize what made it so... great.",The Equalizer 2
126,ayoreinf,"The Robert McCall I love is back, thank you",9,13 September 2018,"I had one major issue with the previous installment in this Antoine Fuqua new franchise. It borrowed the title and the basic premise from a series I liked a lot but turned its hero from a super brainy agent to a killing machine who liked to read books. As far as I was concerned the original movie was visually beautiful, like all of Fuqua's movies, but super simplistic, and a waste of a good idea and some very good acting performances. But I was still curious how did they up their antics for the second installment, like they're required by the Hollywood code of sequels. I'm glad I was, as they dared going upward in a surprising way. As it was mentioned here by previous reviewers, this installment is much slower. In a way it's even predictable, but it's still riveting. Because it's not about the action it's about the man - Robert McCall, the pensive character created by Edward Woodward back in the 80s. The one that tought everything out carefully and always came on top because he was better at his job than all the others. Yes he's border line super being, like Antoine Fuqua likes them, but he's much deeper than a simple killing machine. His strict moral code, his obsession with order, his devotion to his friends and his compassion all shine through this film, and it's all the better for it.",The Equalizer 2
127,joeyford-55342,"GREAT movie. Denzel is on point, captures the energy in every scene",8,23 July 2018,"It is hard to follow-up on such a great success. The first one was groundbreaking stuff, amazing from the opening frame to the closing credits. This one is a step behind but still an amazing story well told. Denzel is 100% believable as a retired CIA assassin trying to help the world be a better place, making up for the sins of his past. His supporting crew do a great job as well, compelling roles well played. See this movie!",The Equalizer 2
128,kaptenvideo-89875,Denzel is back to kick-ass those who deserve it.,6,23 July 2018,"With 2001's ""Training Day"", Antoine Fuqua was the first director to utilize Denzel Washington as the thinking man's kick ass hero.""The Equalizer 2"" is their fourth joint venture into this territory, following 2014's original ""The Equalizer"" and 2016's ""The Magnificent Seven"".In my opinion, Washington is one of the the most magnificent movie stars to ever grace the silver screen, and I love him to death, but there's a slight problem with action projects where his main aim is to kick ass and shoot people in the face.Namely, it has long ago become a genre in itself, and genre offerings have a tendency to repeat exactly whatever made it successful in the first place. The same holds true here.Washington is a powerful actor with a strong presence, so he has always chosen action projects with a bit more style and depth than usual. But only a few of them offer a decidedly unique or interesting story to support all the stylish mayhem.This is certainly true with ""The Equalizer 2"" too. The movie is always the most gripping when showing individual little stories which always end with McCall dishing out revenge to the bad guys.His own journey is intriguing on some general intellectual level, but is not really developed to any emotionally satisfying depth (or height).It would probably help if the pacing was faster but the authors are in no hurry to get anywhere soon. They certainly know how to create moody and somber atmosphere, sadly there's not much character development to enrich the journey.You come out pretty much knowing the same about the mysterious McCall as in the beginning. Lyft driver by day, crime-fighting superman at night...The bad guys look cool but lack personality too. Nothing to dinguish them from all the other cool bad guys in Denzel's other actioneers.To be fair, it always is and probably will be satisfying watching Denzel fighting and shooting his way through numerous evil men. He has become something of a jazz artist of revenge thrillers which is exactly as awesome as it sounds.But after 17 years and many movies offering the same thing, it's just not exactly earth-shattering anymore.Yes, I loved every action scene here but it was more difficult to stay excited about all the rest surrounding that.",The Equalizer 2
129,jb_campo,Denzel has no equal. This film delivers,8,5 January 2019,"The Equalizer 2 continues the story line of Robert McCall (Denzel) who has a mysterious military background and fights for the common person.This film succeeds on most every level. The director Fuqua weaves together various stories of McCall helping people whom he contacts in his day-to-day life as a Lyft driver. There's the terrific opening scene on a Turkish railways car, an old man seeking solace, a young woman who has been abused by colleagues, his young neighbor Miles who is fighting to escape ganghood. All these stories are beautifully intertwined throughout the movie, which centers around an attack on his only true friends from the first Equalizer, Susan (Melissa Leo) and Brian (Bill Pullman).The cinematography excels, especially for those who know Boston. Beautiful pictures of neighborhoods and daily life adorn the screen, and underscore the daily grind that people go thru to survive - the skullers on the Charles river, the joggers on the Common, the Lyft drivers, waiters, students, and care givers. Fuqua does a superb job of making you feel that this film is about the common person, and someone with the right skills and character who can stand up for those who are abused by evildoers. In some ways, this film engenders the spirit of the Rocky films, which make you believe that anything is possible.The acting is top notch, especially Denzel. The fight scenes illustrate his boxing and hand-to-hand combat skills where he again uses whatever weapons he can to defeat his opponents. In the Special Features, director Fuqua says that all weapons shown have really been used in fights, per the special contributors to the choreography and stunts. We again get the 500 Frames-per-Second slow down when McCall assesses the danger threat rising against him, and then speed back to regular speed as he implements his plan, all while timing his actions for his own compulsive tracking. He's a neat man, from his tea ceremony, to his lining up apples, to the plan he creates on the spot to destroy his adversaries.One big negative to this movie is the main bad guys. We learned around halfway thru who the bad guys were, and it was a small surprise, but not an oh-sh-t-i don't-believe-it surprise, like No Luke, I am your father. The scene where he confronts his adversary at home made me think of the kitchen scene in Kill Bill 2 with Uma squaring off against I think it was Vivica Fox.The other big negative was the entire final scene that took place under the onslaught of hurricane Frances arriving. Sure, I understand that Fuqua was underscoring the fury of Denzel by the fury of nature, as shown by the ocean. But the CGI storm was sup-par. The entire final seek-and-kill scene was very predictable and had me shaking my head asking why would the bad guys handle it this way, knowing who they were dealing with.Otherwise, Equalizer 2 delivers a super thriller, especially for those who love Denzel and the first film. I watched the original TV Equalizer series with the British gentleman McCall, and I must say that having a more common-day man portrayed by Denzel was a stroke of genius that should appeal to a large number of people.Equalizer 2 is a terrific, must-see film. Enjoy!",The Equalizer 2
130,deepakdst,Superbb direction!!,8,23 June 2019,Direction was really amazing. I have 8 because of it's plot. There were many unnecessary things that distract you in movie. These subplots were meaningless but overall it is a good movie to entertain only if you have lot of time 'cause plot is slow.,The Equalizer 2
131,bazookamouth-221-898097,Denzel Washington rocks!,7,29 August 2018,The slight problem with this movie is that the good samaritan subplots are more interesting than the main plot. The villain in this movie is Pedro Pascal. He was not very good. He has a rubbery face. He looks like he is wearing a prosthetic. The showdown at the end was chosen in a terrible location. A hurricane battered seaside town. I couldn't see anything. Also it lacked some female eye candy. Melissa Leo just doesn't cut it. Still all in all. Denzel is the man ! He is the best black actor ever. Great movie.,The Equalizer 2

134,elliotte2,The way action movies should be made,7,7 September 2018,"Fan of the TV series, fan of the first movie, went into this one expecting a dropoff. There was none. The action is nicely paced throughout the movie, no need for CGI or green screens, and Denzel always deliver as a actor regardless of what he is doing. Having a action star that can actually act(like Liam), this move does a very good job of giving the characters depth and emotions. My only negative was the movie did not fully explain the bad guys motivations, we know they are bad, just not sure why.For those tired of superhero or over-the-top action movies that spends more time being created on computers then being filmed in front of a camera, it is nice to have a throwback, real acting, real stunts that do not break the laws of science, enjoyable movie.

The ending is so predictable and silly, that you will have guessed it long before it arrives. (I wonder why Hollywood sonetines insults us in this way?) So here it is.

137,itsbobr,It's okay up to the point of the big shoot-out,7,12 December 2018,"When Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) - aka The Equalizer - goes to Boston, MA, he becomes a Lyft Driver (like an Uber Driver) and learns that his friend and former CIA colleague Susan Plummer (Melissa Leo) has been killed and now it becomes personal for him. To catch you up remember McCall is an Ex CIA Agent with special skills and he will use them to find Susan's killers. Let's get started.The movie starts with McCall on a train to Turkey in Muslim disguise. He tells a man on the train he is going to Turkey to find a man who kidnapped his daughter from her mother.The Equalizer is someone who started out helping others who could not help themselves in certain situations. He basically helped by equalizing the situation. See? Okay, that said, we see a little of that as he drives his Lyft car. Later, we see a dinner in Belgium where a couple is shot to death in a most brutal way and yes, I jumped then and so will you. The brutality in movies is getting worse. Why were they killed? Never explained. If you watch this and know, tell me.Susan goes to Belgium to investigate that murder, and she is killed too. McCall sees the crime photos and goes thru imagining the scenes as if he were there. He tells his findings to Susan's CIA partner Dave York (Pedro Pascal) who says he will investigate.The first three quarters of the movie is very much vintage Equalizer, but the last quarter when we see the big shoot-out at McCall'sea-side hometown where his dead wife had her bakery is a big blur. The shoot-out went on for too long , and was not very good due to the storm in full force mode. We could hardly see anything. Very disappointing and this could have been better or done differently, and it wasn't . Bummer.Music. There was music? I didn't notice. So that tells me it wasn't very important or special to the movie.Notables: Bill Pullman as Brian Plummer, Susan's husband and he was wasted in here, with hardly any screen time; Ashton Sanders as Miles, a talented artist, who gets involved with a bad gang and McCall tries to straighten him out.This was a sequel to the first Equalizer in that we see Susan from the first Equalizer, and a remembrance of McCall's deceased wife in his hometown.
Yes, there is a twist in here.My advice: Stay, but leave when you know the big shoot-out is about to happen. (7/10)Violence: Yes

And it's good, it make this movie be more than just action movie.but, because of that message's too the movie are go into to many direction that make 'the' Equalizer not that good as everybody expect. yeah i know you try to make some good and strong background because look's like this movie will continue But you put to much stuff while telling it.i usually rate an action movie from how long the final part take. in this case, it take around 30 minute and it's good number. And the final was as i expect from what McCall will do.i guess if this movie will continue it will go to the death wife or the to whoever gave pedro order. surprise me. haha",The Equalizer 2

And there is a murder of someone who is completely unknown to the story,but who is connected to Denzels Character.For being a Vigilante movie, it's really over complicated in terms of story and simply killing the bad guys.

142,Lewis_Heather787,Not a conventional sequel !,6,9 August 2018,"To be honest I thought that the first film was ok/average but didn't really land with me. For me personally it had to follow in the footsteps of similar modern day action films like the first Jack Reacher and the two John Wick films. Unfortunately the first film didn't achieve that level, so I was extremely surprised when the studio announced the sequel..... where could they go with the story? In some way I actually really admire the story that this film tries to tell even if , in my opinion, it doesn't fully pull it off. This is not your conventional sequel.Right out of the gate the directing by Antoine Fuqua was always going to be good just look at the guys resume. Not as much as action in the film as I thought there would be but most of it was save towards the third act of the film. Fuqua is brilliant at shooting action scenes and his individual flare definitely shines through. The other nailed on part of the film is Denzel Washington, you know I cant remember the last time that man gave a bad performance, has he had a bad performance? Jumping straight back into the character but definitely moving the characters story forward seeing a different angle to this everyday good-guy. The part I commend the film most is the story that is being told. I film does not fall into the cliche of film sequels when everything has to be bigger, badder and just more of everything. If anything this film is at a smaller scale than the first film, it has completely flipped the cliche on its head. Whereas the first film is much more darker and brutal visually and in terms of story, this one has far less characters and is a much more contained story. It really takes balls to try this in the sequel, my hat goes off to the studio and Fuqua for trying this at least.However if your going to have a more contained story and smaller scale film everything has to work perfectly not one part can fail otherwise the film as a whole will not stand up. Unfortunately a fundamental element to the film for me doesn't work. Firstly the biggest problem is the villain of the film, simply put just awful, I would even goes a far as to say its not good casting. Pedro Pascal is not the right guy to be playing that part, he is the complete opposite of Marton Csokas in the first film. Even though that sounds great not the same villain twice, its the fact that Pascal is not menacing nor threatening in any way. Oh and also it doesnt take genius to work out the Pascal is the villain, talk about right in your face I knew it was him almost right away. Just me??The other problem that I have is the story line involving the kid he is trying to help out, ""Miles"". To me the story line here is a little pointless, is the character of Miles really needed in the film. Or is this character just there to make Denzel's character look like the good guy. Doesn't really serve much of a purpose?? Might be just me on that one.Overall even though I commend the film for trying to flip the film sequel cliche and trying something different it didn't pull it off unfortunately, this probably is not as good as the first film. 60% out of 100 or 6 out of 10 its ok/average just like its predecessor, but I believe that this film is not as bold in action or story compared to the first. Its fine, not as good as the first.",The Equalizer 2

The first was a fairly cheesy action revenge film with little substance and a terrible story. I actually enjoyed the second far more then I expected.The story again follows a whodunit revenge plot that is incredibly predictable. The big twist of the movie was completely spelled out in the first 20 minutes. That being said it still was pretty well done. The writing and directing were all around tighter this time around.Of course the action was intense and in your face. The fight scenes were well-choreographed and surprisingly brutal. Denzel also added an extra layer of humanity to the role making the title character far-less one-note. He certainly isn't going to win an award for his role, but Denzel was the best part of the film. You can tell he was having fun with the role.The film was about 20 minutes too long though. There was an unnecessary redemption subplot that really didn't need to be in the story. The film would have all around been a more enjoyable action thriller if the pacing was improved. Still, it was an improvement over the first and it was an entertaining film overall.

I love watching him beat the bad guys down. However, this one just didn't feel as good as the first.The movie starts off with Denzel in incognito on a train, beats some bad guys, and saves a little girl. So I'm glad he's gone back to helping people. He doesn't work for Home Depot this time. Instead, he's a Lyft driver and still helping people along the way.Basically, his friend from the last film Susan Plummer (Melissa Leo) is killed and Denzel is going after the guys responsible. That's basically the plot. He still does some killer moves, and once again, there's a Home Alone style final confrontation just like the last film.Whereas the last film, the lead character felt a little more identifiable, seeing him work a deadend job, sit in a cafe with his books, and often sitting alone at home as the clock ticks by. Here he is constantly being dragged into bad situations to move the plot forward. He does have some kid he is paying to paint walls, which becomes intricate to the plot later, who I guess is the replacement for Hitgirl in the last film.Also, the villains on this one seemed too cardboard cutout to me this time. None of them really standout, and where they seemed threatening in the beginning, become bargain basement midway through the film. The villain in the last film was a monster, but these villains just never lived up to that.However, it's a good sequel and if you are a fan of the first like I am, you will find some enjoyment out of this. I'm hoping they make this a trilogy as I would love to The Equalizer's further adventures.",The Equalizer 2

This film was so boring, it should have been called ""Happy Nappy Time with Robert McCall"". I love Denzel Washington. If Denzel's name is attached to a film, I'm watching it. I don't care what it is, I can usually expect it to be awesome...but not anymore. This movie was terrible. It was slow and boring.

They allow me to study the scene, the characters, they provide a sense of calm, that allows me to really feel what is going on in the movie. They are almost like music.I liked this one better because the main character was established, but also because his 'back story' was revealed so smoothly, and was so beautifully entwined in the unfolding story of the movie.I liked the secondary characters. I liked that the characters, 'good guys' and 'bad guys' alike are adults, not cartoon characters. I love that the acting was consistently wonderful, and I must really praise the director for this, too.I sincerely hope that there will a third installment in this series.",The Equalizer 2

The second film was much better than the first because there was a bit more action. They couldn't have picked a better actor to play him. Denzel kicks butt big time in this one. I'm a big fan of karma, revenge, and vigilante-style movies and tv shows and this one was no exception. I was entertained throughout the whole movie and didn't look at my watch once. I love how Denzel's character is so cool calm and collective just before he gets started. I'm hoping there is a 3rd. I could watch him all day.",The Equalizer 2

So they all split up individually and allow the goodie to kill them one by one.Lazy scriptwriting is the cause.It requires so much more time and effort to think up and write something believableOK watch once film .

158,bastille-852-731547,"Denzel Delivers A Solid, If Unspectacular, Follow-Up",7,19 July 2018,"I'm a fan of Denzel Washington and enjoyed the first ""Equalizer"" movie. That said, ""The Equalizer"" was not a film I was necessarily clamoring for a sequel to--although I still was looking forward to it since Denzel Washington and the action scenes in the trailer would be worthwhile. After seeing ""The Equalizer 2"" at an advance screening, I can say that while the film is not perfect, it's an entertaining ride for adult action junkies that is on par with the first movie in terms of quality.Denzel returns as Robert McCall, a vigilante-type figure and former special forces operative who begins the movie on a mission in Turkey. After such prologue, the film centers in on its primary narrative thread: a woman who he worked with on multiple missions has been killed by thugs in Brussels. The rest of the film primarily concerns McCall's attempt to bring the perpetrators of such heinous crime to justice, although the film also contains multiple sub-plots--including a new, older adolescent-age character who could theoretically become somewhat of a protégé to McCall in a possible third movie in the franchise.The action scenes in ""The Equalizer 2"" are thrilling and intense. Sometimes the intersection of Fuqua's cinematography choices and sound edits can feel and appear a bit choppy at times, but the film certainly brings the white-knuckle goods. The film's action-packed finale scene, a climatic showdown in the midst of an incredibly rough hurricane, is thoroughly effective and satisfying. Just like the first movie, the violence in ""The Equalizer 2"" certainly earns its R rating. Denzel Washington is great as McCall, blending a unique mix of charisma and ferocity. Just like in the first movie, he is able to carry the film on all of its levels from beginning to end. That said, the film does have one large flaw--that of which the story is highly predictable. If you've seen any other ""vigilante""-style action movie before, you'll be able to guess the key plot elements well before they unfold, and the film's sole attempt at a plot twist can be guessed within the first 20 minutes of the movie. Fans of the first movie and Denzel Washington should be able to look past such banality and enjoy the action-packed ride, and I do recommend the film to them. 7/10",The Equalizer 2
159,torrascotia,The Equalizer? No the Overreactor!,3,29 August 2018,"Does the world need another revenge movie? I ask this question as some people may think this is actually a movie about a ""good guy"" who protects the innocent from evil. It aint.
Instead what we have is basically a psychopath who maims and murders sadistically on a whim while showing no emotion. Why does anyone think this is a positive role model or sympathetic? 
At least the Death Wish movies were alot of fun and had humour, this has none of those qualities as it takes itself far too seriously.
The problem movies like this one have is that we end up with a hero who is as bad or worse than the bad guys. 
Where revenge type movies fall flat is when the revenge is seen as sadistic and not proportional to the original crimes. Can we have sympathy for someone who appears to enjoy killing more than the bad guys? At one stage he says hes annoyed as he only gets to kill someone once.
What these kind of movies are good for is identifying people who lack a moral compass. If you are the kind of person who doesn't believe in an eye for an eye, but instead one eye means carte blanche! 
The plot could be written on the back of a stamp. Someone kills his only friend and its carte blanche time for 90 mins. Thats it.
Denzel doesnt really suit this type of movie and not just because of his age but because he is almost the African American version of Tom Hanks, sorta middle aged, out of shape and amiable. A slick killing machine doesnt fit with his profile.
If you enjoy Segal movies this may be for you however none of the Segal movies come close to the sadism in this turkey. This is quite an unsatisfying two hours of cinema. Avoid unless you have no moral compass or sense of proportion.",The Equalizer 2
160,elenaphysics,"Not bad, just not as good as the first one",7,13 November 2018,"I wanted to say that the first movie had set a really high standard ,so this movie was somehow disappointing..
This one was a bit weird because we see him as an avenger.
In the first movie he was reluctantly involved with russian mafia and at the end of the movie he decided to help those in need.
In this movie he helps those in need but in the wrong way.
For example,those rich kids who raped that girl..Why did he have to kill some of them? The father who abducted his daughter, he did not know his side of the story. Maybe he had kidnapped her because he cared about her,maybe not. But he did not let him explain. He went on with the mother's perspective.
He was on a killing spree. Then he finds the people who killed his friend and he kills them and seems like he is enjoying this. In the first movie it is different. He killed only when he had to and he did not seem happy about it. In this movie, the character behaves differently. It is not a bad movie. It has everything an action movie needs. Action,action, action. But it loses in comparison to the legend the first equalizer presented.",The Equalizer 2

So Denzel's character works for lyft, I mean you can at least reduce those scenes a bit. It drags on and on.Denzel travels from Turkey to Washington D.C. then to Belgium. Not once they show him going to the airport. I find it rather odd.I really don't get the motivation from the bad guys perspective. Cutting loose ends. But why? Denzel Washington kicks ass when he fights and I give him credit for what he does.I love the chemistry with the black kid and Denzel by the Elevator scene about making a choice in life.

168,themovieparadise,Same Strengths and Weaknesses as the First Film,6,6 August 2018,"Denzel Washington is simply one of the best actors working today. There's no real question about it. I still contend that he should have won Best Actor at the 2017 Academy Awards for his role in Fences instead of Casey Affleck for Manchester by the Sea. Affleck was really good, but I thought that Washington acted circles around him. So whenever Denzel is in a movie, it immediately has my attention. The Equalizer 2 comes four years after its predecessor, and I thought the first movie was good but not great. Denzel was, of course, excellent as always, but an unevenly paced second act and too many subplots dragged the movie down. But while The Equalizer had its shortcomings, there was a lot of possibilities with a sequel. Perhaps Antoine Fuqua learned from The Equalizer's mistakes, and could deliver on a tighter, stronger sequel. So while I wasn't counting down the days until I got to see The Equalizer 2, I went in hoping it would deliver. And The Equalizer 2 is pretty much the same as the first one. Denzel Washington gives another great performance, and Antoine Fuqua delivers on great action sequences, but it is still too long of a film with an over complicated narrative...",The Equalizer 2

The third act of the movie was ultimately unnecessary and sadly didn't resolve anything for me.

170,PaxtonMalloy,Uninspired and predictable,5,4 November 2018,"Let's get the good out of the way first. There is a truly amazing moment between Denzel and Ashton Sanders, kind of a father/son moment. Denzel for a brief moment shows, what he is capable of if there is actually something with depth.That was everything good about this movie. Director Fuqua delivers an awful movie. It is not only his fault because the script is just as bad. Is is uninspired, predictable and the whole structure is off which makes the movie so slow paced. When it comes to the the climax the movie is bathed in just atrocious CGI that even 10 years ago would have looked out of date.I know going into a movie like this not to expect Shakespeare. But even for what it is a simple revenge action flick it is even poorly at that. Fuquas movies have one thing in common. There are very simplistic and just full of cliches. Training Day might be the only exception but even that movie lives by its stellar Oscar performance by Washington.By the way this would have been fixable. They should have build the relationship between Sanders and Denzel and then getting the boy captured or killed. People would have been actually invested. Get rid of the ridiculous CGI and fix the structure of the script.",The Equalizer 2

The Equalizer 2 has numerous sub plots all fleshed out to completion except for the main plot which maybe i missed i.e. that been who is really behind the assassination of McCalls' colleagues. If i have one criticism it is this, why are there no sub-titles in the first act, i.e the spoken dialogue in Arabic (i guess) and French, dialogue is always a driver for a film, it's not a Charlie Chaplin movie so i have no problem with a foreign tongue but i personally would like to know what is said.

174,andrewrye-06535,What Happened?,5,1 February 2021,"I watched the first Equalizer and it did a great nod to the Edward Woodward 1985 series which I loved at the time. Although, going back to look at it now it didn't age that well but it was the uniqueness of fighting for justice and the victim, putting things right that stood it apart from other shows at the time.In the first Equalizer that DW starred in he was portrayed as a learned man with an obscure reading list spending his time humbly in privacy and peace reading at a late night diner. This made DW own the character as, although it was a significant departure from the original 1985 series (EW lived a higher more extravagant life style) it stayed true to form and drew you into his private world. The plot in the first one was about protecting a young woman and his co-workers in the hardware supply store. So generally along the same lines as the Edward Woodward model. In fact I preferred this McCall over the original.Now, number 2 comes along and it feels like the original character is only given a passing nod. Starts with rescuing a young girl and anonymously visiting the parents bookshop to buy a book on his list. That took all of 5 minutes and after that it was just about McCall. His ex-secret service (what service is not revealed) is killed and he is the next target. The story is wafer thin, the plot is thrown out the window after 10 minutes and it descends into a violent free for all interspersed with boring nothingness. The cringiest scene was when he turns up at another ex-secret service old bro's house and the wife and kids treat him like an old family friend. It's revealed that this old friend is trying to kill him (nothing personal apparently. With friends like this?) and he uses the new found love of the wife and kids to leave. that had to be the worst get away I've seen. And the conversation with the young guy after they get off the elevator after threatening the gang (who respectfully don't chase him after he beat a couple up) was ridiculous. Shoving a gun in someones face to convince them to stay away from violent crims? Yep, can see how that would work...laughable crap.The one I saw also had some unnecessarily gory scenes that really weren't needed and didn't add to the story. The guy in the bakery with half his stomach missing. I guess this is just a vehicle for DW to do the super human thing like Bruce Willis had Die Hard, Liam Neeson had Taken, Tom Cruise with Mission Impossible and Denzel Washington has this. What a shame they couldn't continue with the characterisation from the first Equalizer. It would have made a better story and made me root for the good guys. I found I just didn't care about Denzel's Character because it had lost the original meaning. It just felt disrespectful. A shame, I do like DW's earlier work but lately it just seems to have gone to putting bum on seats without a great story.It's a 5 in the hope they don't make a Equalizer 3 - McCall takes on the Russian army, single handedly!",The Equalizer 2
175,boris_unanimate,Movies For Old Men,5,1 September 2018,"How old is Denzel? If it were according to this movie, he'd be 70 and would yell at all the kids in the neighborhood. I went in expecting more precise action and a dumb plot. I was only let down when it comes to action because the plot was as dumb as they come. It was almost as if they had to check every single movie stereotype off THE LIST; it's too predictable even for an action movie. EVERY. SINGLE. CHOICE. IS. PREDICTABLE.First off, you've seen this movie x times. Only this time it's got a black hero, a white antagonists and a lost love. Jesus, what's up with every character being written to fulfill an agenda. In the first movie he has to save a lost girl, this time he has to save a black kid from gang life. Who writes this stupid nonsense? Also, you can see Denzel's age each time he has to fight someone; the action looks very rigid, with Denzel moving as little as possible as to not show he's no Jkhn Wick.I was hoping for a great action thriller, but all I got was sleeping pills after only 10 mins into the movie. The only redeemable aspect is the final 30 mins with a long action scene that is almost decently shot but very confusing at times. Go watch it if you can't fall asleep. This is great for the elderly, because the movie cares more for old farts and their relatives than giving young characters a developing arc other than ""I don't wanna be in a gang no more 'coz you showed me I can do better.""

So when I chose to watch this movie, I didn't expect anything, but then I am really really entertained. Denzel is still stunning like hell. His actions I think are all original without stuntmen. The main story of this movie is about the investigation of a crime scene that leads to other big crimes. The way the Director lead the audience is so smooth but sure. We can not blink our eye because each scene is connected to each other. The cinematographer are quite professional to do grammar of the scene because audience can not guess who is responsible for all crimes, yet we knew that Denzel is the only one hero here. I am not familiar about the first movie of Equalizer, but it seems that the appearance of Denzel here is the continuity of his role on the first part.

189,MovieGuyFunTime,Better Than The Original,9,14 April 2021,"I enjoyed the first ""The Equalizer"" movie well enough but found it was overly and unnecessarily marred by plot holes and implausible situations that made an otherwise excellent adaptation of the 80's TV series less-than it could have been. Apparently, the director took notice of these complaints (made by several reviewers) and addressed the problem in ""The Equalizer 2.""Not only are the ""MacGyver moments"" all but non-existent in the sequel (save one reasonably believable use of flour), the story and motivation for our hero is not a simple cliche this time, but it is much more deep, interesting, complex and plausible. Everything about this sequel is better. The weaknesses of the first film were mostly fixed and the good things about the first were done better. Therefore, I cannot understand why the sequel got a slightly lower IMDB rating than the original. I found it to be a much better film in every respect. Perhaps many of the reviews were made by people who didn't bother to see the original. After all, there is a five-year gap between the original and the sequel which is pretty long. If you've seen the original, the sequel will be very rewarding. However, if you did not see the original, I can understand how one would not be as drawn in or appreciative of the subtleties and nuances as well as the character motivations.One thing I did have a bit of a problem with was that the back-story relating to the bad guys was not clear, at least not to me. On a vague level, we understand sort-of what their motivation is but it was never quite fleshed out well-enough for me. It felt like they just needed to be bad guys and the motivation wasn't as compelling as it could have been. I understood Denzel's character's motivation well but not that of his adversaries. Again, as with the first, this is a weakness that I believe was unnecessary and could have easily been addressed with just a little more attention to the writing.Over-all a very good action film with strong characters even if fairly formulaic and predictable. While the basic ""One-Man-Vengance-Machine"" concept is far from anything new or original, the way it is executed (no pun intended) and the colorful characters is what sets this film above most of the others in the genre. A must-see for anyone who enjoyed the original and if you want to see this film and have not seen the original, be sure to watch the original first. It will be much more enjoyable.",The Equalizer 2
190,Opinion02122,Sick of this plot,2,3 June 2019,"I'm sorry to give this only two stars, but I'm MORE than tired of movies that show men who were dedicated to our country turning their backs on it in favor of money. Is this what we truly believe of our American heroes? I believe that these poor movie plots are an insult to the brave men and women who dedicate and risk their lives for our country.I grew up watching Jim Phelps, and his MI group, fight injustice. Each week they showed us their integrity and devotion to what was right!. Yet someone decided, when writing the plot to Mission Impossible, the movie, that Jim became a traitor for money! WRONG. This time, we see the entire ""team"" that Denzel's character led in support of American interests turn their backs on our country, again, for money. I could go on to name MORE movies, but, you get the idea. ENOUGH!Plots don't have to show Americans turning bad and losing their integrity just to show another American as a hero.Hollywood, get better writers.",The Equalizer 2

192,clacura,WOW...So Not the First Movie!,3,1 September 2018,"Read some reviews here and anybody who gave this more than a 5 was stoned! This is a massive departure from the first movie. Fuqua lost his way on this project. He nailed the first movie with memorable scenes. An action movie today is lined scenes that set a tone and give a mini jolt of adrenaline. That is all it takes today because it has all been done before. First movie had instantly developed character actors. The setting and pace was simple to grasp--diner, apt, restaurant, Boston...this move has no clear definition. The hardware store and those characters each were memorable. Yes, it was cheesy at times (guy steals ring and boom, McCall puts hammer back after wiping blood off in the store), but the righteous rush you got when he brought justice to scumbags worked well. This move has none of this. EQII is drawn out, no clear energy flow, characters not developed, nothing about this movie gives that rush the first offered. The villain in the first was perfect casting. The more I think on it, the more this movie is a real disappointment and will do its time on HBO then hopefully disappear.Cannot recommend this movie. Watch the first one over!",The Equalizer 2

194,muons,A feel good movie for not so deep thinkers,7,28 August 2018,"The movie starts with an exotic scene from Turkey with Denzel W. disguised in a pious muslim outfit on a night train ride. The first action scenes take place in the restaurant wagon with Denzel incapacitating/killing three troublemakers with impunity. This is also the time telling you should suspend your logic if you want to enjoy the show. As a lonesome knight who shows up dead on the records, it is a mystery and incredulous how he can find resources to get into a foreign country, kill three people on a train ride and come back to US unscathed despite all the mess he had created during his trip. Cinematography is quite good with nice scenery from Turkey and Belgium, which certainly makes the movie more interesting. The stormy scenes from a small coastal town are also impressive.The main plot is quite ordinary for this genre with a predictable twist and a long stretch of imagination as well as some loose ends. Pedro Pascal's motives for example are never explained. The subplot involving Ashton S. as a confused young man looks a bit drab but indeed helps the movie to balance its pace and gives it some depth for character development. Otherwise, the whole project would turn into an unbearable action packed mindless junk. With his good acting style, Denzel Washington carries the story almost by himself. With another action star, the movie would struggle and couldn't even come close to theaters. As much as Denzel W. physically looks though and credible in action, the fight scenes don't look very realistic. He takes on multiple people at once and puts them out of action almost immediately but at the end, he looks very nonchalant and breaths as if he were sitting in the next chair watching the movie. OK, as a veteran agent, we know he's physically fit but no matter how skilled someone is in martial arts his adrenaline level would increase and his breathing rhythm would change at least at the end of the fight.All in all, this is a feel good movie if you accept the story at the face value without giving much thought to details. For analytically minded audience with a nit-picking attitude, the entire plot would crumble under its own weight.",The Equalizer 2
195,sujanfaster,Denzel Dynamite,8,21 September 2018,"Antoine Fuqua and Denzel Washington partnership is always quite a show. With a second film of the same character, the director manages to bring out the badass Denzel successfully again. The Equalizer 2 is a pure Denzel show like the first one, or probably more than the first one. Looks like this might turn out to be a franchise of its own.This movie gets more personal compared to the first one and there is no prize for guessing the plot as it is all but revealed in the trailer. But movies like these doesn't need a strong storyline, they just need some strong characters and good charisma. This movie has both. Apart from the main revenge plot, the movie has its own little moments where Denzel's making people's lives better. This kind of strengthens the character and makes this movie go beyond the action genre. The action sequences this part is more on the subtle side. The movie manages to keep the thrill alive with very few main characters which is not easy for a mainstream action movie. There are not many characters linked to each other trying to make the plot complicated. Denzel Washington could roll out of the bed and start playing a character like this straightaway. He does make it look so easy. Melissa Leo in her short time on screen does get a very intense role. Pedro Pascal and Ashton Sanders have important characters as well.The Equalizer 2 is a very good watch for an action fan and it has turned out to be a superhero movie without a superhero.",The Equalizer 2

Makes no difference if Denzel Washington is in this movie or Jim Carrey.Where is the main villain man ? What exactly is Denzel doing throughout the film nobody cares. Fight scenes boring, gun fights a great big yawn...It felt like someone is trying to force a piece of rotten slice of bread down your throat and wash it down with milk gone bad. Terrible movie for the confused and people who like watching movies while sitting in their toilets. Or for people who like to scroll through movies with a mouse and watch the whole film in 6 seconds max.I will probably catch up with all future Denzel movies after he is long gone and Im just too bored.

I'm sure a large chunk of that $69 million budget has something to say about it, as the filmmaking is not that of a $69 million film.There is a scene in this movie of two characters in a room talking, and it's shot out of focus. This film spent over $69 million and couldn't even bother to have its cameras set up correctly. I don't know if anything better epitomizes a film's mediocrity than bad cinematography. You really have to focus to know that this film's terrible or your brain will tell you it's simply mediocre.The pacing is also bunk. There are solid moments and arcs and characters throughout this film, surprisingly, but much of the film's goodwill is undone by the half-way point in which it stumbles into its final act and sacrifices sensibility and nuance in favour of dumb action setpieces, generic villains, and long, bloated action sequences that needed much more work from an editor to be even remotely acceptable. I'm not for a second believing that Snipey McSniperson would be thrown off when shooting at a literal fish in a barrel by a simple blown tire when his vantage point was some 200 meters in the sky on a tower right next to said barrel of fish.Let's not make an Equaliz3r, please.

Now, that is fine as long as the plot and the rest of the story is well done, but unfortunately it isn't. I never give away spoilers so I will simply say that the plot is nothing special, you pretty much see everything coming from a mile away and the bad guys have a real serious case of ""plot stupidity"" (they do really stupid things just to further the plot).

235,ChristianLeFeuvre,Not a 'bad' movie but not a memorable one either,6,27 April 2019,"Denzel Washington is back in the role of 'Robert McCall', and this time it's personal as he learns that his close friend and former colleague 'Susan Plummer', played again by Melissa Leo, has been attacked and murdered whilst investigating a supposed suicide-murder in Brussels. When those responsible finds out 'McCall' is on their trail he becomes a target.
Although this is the main plot and storyline of the movie there are sub-plots along the way as 'McCall', who works as a 'Lyft' driver (similar to Uber) sometimes hears things from his passengers he doesn't like, and he sets out to help them get the results they should.
Antoine Fuqua who directed the first 'Equalizer' movie is once again in the director's chair and does a good job here too.
I thought the first 'Equalizer' film was not bad, watchable, and had some pretty good action scenes and is good for a one-time watch, and Denzel is easily the best thing about both films. 'The Equalizer 2' is pretty much on the same level I thought, it was alright, I enjoyed it, it was a fun film and had some good moments. There are again some good action scenes and a couple of scenes which are actually really great. One scene in particular between 'McCall' and a young guy called 'Miles', played by Aston Sanders, is terrific. It's just after a confrontation in an apartment and 'McCall' has sort of become a father-figure to 'Miles' who is an aspiring artist but is being dragged into the gang lifestyle and 'McCall' is determined to help him get out of this. I thought this scene was so powerful and undoubtedly the best moment in the movie.
As mentioned, there are some good action and fight scenes which are exciting and extremely brutal and bloody. I just wished the plotting and pace of the film had been as strong as the action. I found it quite disjointed, and it takes so long for the events that happen in Brussels to become the main focus because it's constantly interjected by these other scenes of 'McCall' up against bad guys and there's a fight scene, which is, of course, thrilling and entertaining to watch, and it just seems to drag on before the film focuses on this main event. There is a touching sub-plot with an old concentration camp survivor who was separated from his sister at the camp and his only memory is in a painting of her he is trying to recover, but even this seemed so detached that the pay-off of this was unsurprising and weak.
The final confrontation battle was quite impressive but it was predictable and too obvious.
All in all, I'd say this movie is as about as enjoyable as the first. One thing that is definitely stronger in this film though is the relationship between 'McCall' and the younger person he's trying to help. In the first movie, it was a character named 'Teri', played by Chloe Grace Moretz, and in this film, it's 'Miles' by Aston Sanders, and the storyline and relationship in this film is so much stronger and actually much more believable in this one,
There are some great acting, some brilliant dialogue and some thrilling action sequences but for me, it's the pace and the plotting that is the problem with this sequel, it takes a long time for the film to feel like it's going anywhere.
That being said, with the terrific acting, the brutal action and fight scenes and the gritty direction by Fuqua, there's a lot to like but it's not particularly a memorable, edge-of-your-seat action movie.",The Equalizer 2
236,ryanbartlett-870-746486,Didn't follow behind the original,5,27 July 2018,"Enter into another sequal and another movie that couldn't quite capitalize off of the first's success. Equalizer 2 picks up where the first left off, with Robert McCall, Denzel Washington, rebuilding a new life of secrecy now that the old one was compromised. This is their first mistake in my mind. Yes, this is probably the character would have done, but you already set the scenes, his home environments, relationships, then in the sequel they just through that all out the window. 
 If you were wanting another shoot 'em up, killer movie, all yours. Equalizer has proven once again that it can provide Denzel with ample scenes to deal damage on bad people. However, in the first film which set it apart from other shooter movies, was the in-betweens. The lulls and character development between the murder was what really brought together the whole movie and what set it apart from others.
 What the film did do well was bringing up the commonly found concept of who is good and who is bad. The driving force of the film, one which as you move further and further into the film you realize just how brutal Robert McCall is. He isn't Batman and tieing people up for the police. McCall is more like the Grim Reaper telling people when their time has come. Minus the opening scene, he immediately throws out the whole concept of you have a choice to make it right. You know the one thing that made it original. Which lead it down a new road which wasn't original or really wanted.

I found it very predictable at times but it doesn't try and be more than what it is. I don't know if it was just bad supporting cast acting or it was meant to be like that.

I felt... that it failed miserably. Knowing that Denzel Washington doesn't usually make sequels, I figured this one should probably be pretty good. It feels like, though, that he just cashed a paycheck for this one. A long section in the middle just feels aimless, and like it's just wasting time. It takes a little while to really set up the story, and then just kind of wastes time. The action picks up more near the end, but by then, I was checked out. Melissa Leo and Bill Pullman are wasted in their roles, and have very little to do. The good guy vs. bad guy fight at the end just feels like every other action movie, and just isn't that impressive.

Or almost no plot anyway. Some bad guys want to kill Denzel and he kills them instead. But you get no real explanation as for why these things happen. Why was the guy and his family killed at the beginning, and who ordered it ? Since it's what starts the whole thing, I thought that it would be interesting to know, but they never bother to explain that. Then there are the side plots, that merely seems like fillers to make the movie a decent length. There's the old guy who tries to get a painting of his long lost sister (presumed dead in a nazi camp), back. But fortunately Denzel manages to find her alive and reunites them. We never find out how he did that either, it just happens. And so it goes on with a lot of ""this happens because the script says so"" moments. Clearly nobody really wanted to make a sequel. If they had, they should have come up with any kind of story that made just a slight amount of sense. I'll give it 5 stars because Denzel is always good, even if the movie is not.",The Equalizer 2

I loved the plot, action, story, and most of all Denzel as I felt he was at this best!! I could see everyone else in the theater was like me on the edge of their seat, as it got tense at times, and you didn't know where it was headed. The movie was smart as it kept the viewers guessing.

Some of the set pieces,particularly the climax are different and thrilling in a believable way! The quieter moments are very effective as well!It reminds you of a similar Denzel movie (Man on Fire) but also has similarity to the Bourne movies in trying to make everything believable. Just as Bourne consults a map before driving out of town, the movie explains how Denzel comes to conclusions but within reason,considering it's an action movie after all. So, if you are looking for a John Wick -like movie (I loved them) with incessant mindless violence, you might feel let down a bit.

The story spent some time on developing the main and side characters to create a more realistic and relatable world of Equalizer. Before the grand finale, there are a handful of brief but gripping action scenes featuring speed chase, fighting indoors and on a train. I actually find the final fight scene is too long drawn, despite the obviously expansive and expensive $$ production set.The conspiracy in the story is kind of over-convoluted, but the main point of the movie is to portray the Equalizer and his friends are do-gooders who enjoy ordinary dinner gatherings, helping out neighbours and youths in the community.

259,ikizdevran-882-254684,I'm your father. You mama forgot to tell you about me.,6,4 August 2018,"There is a huge debate going on among the critics about when to write a film review. Some say it is best to wait for a couple of days for your feelings to settle so that you can write an objective review, where others claim it is best to write the review right after you have seen the film. I prefer to write the review within the next 24 hours after seeing the film, because my feelings and observations don't change in time. I have seen ""The Equalizer 2"" in the late-night viewing last night. For the first time, I have been to the cinema to watch Hereditary by myself and loved the experience and decided to do it again with ""The Equalizer 2."" Late-night cinema experience was equally beautiful, but I can't say the same thing for the film. Despite my high expectations, ""The Equalizer 2"" turned out to be a film I would not see for the second time. In the first film, the story and the character that the story was built on, was strong. In ""The Equalizer 2,"" I constantly had the feeling that the main character is a totally different person. I can agree on the fact that the story is going to be different, even unrelated to the first film, but the main character must build some kind of connection with the first film's main character if you are making a sequel. They are the same people, with the same personality, same thoughts and feelings. I failed to catch this connection, and this is the main reason why I didn't like ""The Equalizer 2.""This time we see Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) as a Lyft driver. He has this job to help people in need, without a particular purpose, with the help of his dear friend Susan (Melissa Leo). He is like the modern Robin Hood. Robert is bored and he doesn't value his life. He is the guardian angel of the people in need. Film opens with a scene on a train in Turkey where he kills several men and saves the daughter of an American from his Turkish father who kidnaps her and brings her to Turkey. In the film there are no police who investigate all the killings done by Robert. As far as I know, Robert doesn't belong to any organization anymore, and I wonder how he gets away from all these killings. He delivers justice, but the rest is not taken into consideration. Everyone needs a hero like this, but this hero has nothing to do with the reality. We know that he is a professional killer who can speak a lot of languages, and for some reason, everything happens in the exact moments that fits him. He makes a plan and everything goes smoothly. The materials he uses to kill all those people, and the people who he kills are exactly where they are supposed to be at all times. All these actions and situations pull the reality of the film down. ""The Equalizer 2"" is a superhero film which has nothing to do with the real life, just like other superhero films. It is intended to be a serious action film, but if you take this film serious, a lot of things I have mentioned above are not going to make any sense. If you can manage to treat ""The Equalizer 2"" as an ordinary action/thriller film, you may get satisfied, but this is pretty much it.There are a lot of similarities between Taken and ""The Equalizer 2."" I have mentioned this while I was writing for the first film as well, but the similarities are even more obvious in this one. In the first film, Russians were the bad guys, here, American secret agents are the bad guys. First film was criticized for being too violent, but ""The Equalizer 2"" is even more violent than the first one. In ""The Equalizer 2,"" we get to familiarize ourselves with Robert, deeper. We get to understand who he truly is and what is his purpose in life. He is more than just a random retired secret agent with a set of skills, who helps random people in need. He is more than that, he is empty and doesn't expect anything from life anymore. His random deeds are the biggest examples of my thesis about him. This is also the main reason why I find differences between his characters in both film. He was still the same empty guy who was helping people, but in this one, he really doesn't care about anything anymore. He is just a killer with an empty soul.""The Equalizer 2"" is the fourth collaboration between Denzel Washington and Antoine Fuqua, after The Equalizer, Training Day and The Magnificent Seven. ""The Equalizer 2"" is still watchable, it is still entertaining, and it is still action packed, but it fails to create a credibility and fails to establish a balance with the first film. It wasn't a waste of time, but I wouldn't lose anything if I wouldn't have watched it either.",The Equalizer 2
260,TheJohnnyPHreak,Character Film That Happens To Be An Action Sequel,8,29 December 2018,"In the summer we are all used to sequels by now. It's a staple of the summer and the summer movie season. And now with the film industry hit by the franchise bug (thanks MCU) sequels are churned out at a higher rate. Some are very much wanted, others are not. Then some are wanted but they always come too late, with the ideas getting stale. Then there is every year, that sequel that comes out that film fans never knew they needed in their life. The Equalizer 2 is that sequel that was up in the air for a while but well worth the wait.Denzel Washington reprises the role of Robert McCall, an ex-special operative who helps the helpless. He once again joins his frequent directing collaborator Antoine Fuqua, this being the first sequel for both. McCall is now a Lift driver in Boston who takes it upon himself to help his passengers who need the help but can't reach out for it. When a tragedy strikes his life, McCall swings into action as the bringer of death we all know (and love).The real plot of this film doesn't kick into gear until about halfway through the film. This is a character piece first. The film follows McCall's life as a driver and helping the neighbors around him. It follows him on his day to day activities. The way the first hour plays out is much different than expected for a sequel to an action film. It was quite refreshing. Most sequels for action films try to go bigger, louder and bolder. Fuqua here quiets things down. There are some interesting action choices which are brutal.Fuqua is one of the best and most creative action directors working today. He stages the action very well. When the plot gets going there is excellent ""car chase"" which is something I hadn't seen before. Washington is never bad and here a McCall we get to see more of how much a badass he really is. There are points in the film that dives deep into his past and the universe. He still has quite a mystery around him but we do get some insight into this very special operative.Pedro Pascal shows up as a former partner of McCall and is quite good. He seems with this and Kingsmen: The Golden Circle, having fun playing a certain type of action role. He has a certain edge here that was missing in that film. I like that he stepping into the action film role. He just needs a starring vehicle. Melissa Leo & Bill Pullman both come back in their roles. Both parts are small but intricate to the overarching plot.The this an action film in all sense of the word. But also more so than the first The Equalizer 2 has elements of horror. The final large-scale action sequence feels like a horror movie. It has suspense, thrilling moments but it extremely violent. McCall is like McGuyver when it comes to violence. I was taken aback at times with how bone-crunching and brutal it was. But it was very fun to watch. Washington as McCall is the consummate badass outthinking and outsmarting anyone that gets in this way.Most sequels go bigger and crazier, but Washington and Fuqua dial it back. This is a character study that happens to be an action film. I wouldn't classify it as an action drama because of the level of violence. Denzel is one point as ever. The action beats are short but so satisfying, with the ending feeling like a slasher film more than an action sequel. This may be an old man action film but easily a worthy and subtle sequel to an entertaining first film. Can we get a third?!",The Equalizer 2

However I felt that in this instance Mr Pascal has unable to live up to the extreme antagonism that was palpable between Marton Csokas and Denzel and which made the first outing beyond compare in this genre. The whole film was slower paced and to me relied on the side equalizations to make it watchable. I like the side issues and want more of them to cement his role as the modern day Robin Hood/Don Quixote. Melissa Leo was excellent in her slightly larger supporting role and kudos to her (or stunt doubles) action scenes. I fail to understand but enjoy Mr McCalls use of strange manners of termination while eschewing conventional and readily available weaponry. I hope a third installment is on the cards with a return to some genuine menace on top of multiple side equalizations.

While a couple minor plot elements felt a tad confusing or slightly underdeveloped, I think that The Equalizer 2 might actually be even better than the first. I feel like it might be a bit more of a slow-burn compared to the first one, but to me, that only serves to enhance the mystery driving the story. An interesting fact: this was the first time both Denzel Washington and director Antoine Fuqua ever made a sequel. I don't believe a third film is needed, but I do feel that the Robert McCall character has a bit of personal baggage that might need to be handled.

268,chasemykleby,"If Washington and Fuqua decide to revisit McCall again, it would probably be best if they just leave him on his beach.",5,9 March 2019,"""The Equalizer 2"" Review
(5/10)I never saw the first Equalizer, I have wanted to, but have never gotten around to it. So when I was tasked with reviewing The Equalizer 2, I decided to go into it fresh without watching the first.
You don't really need to watch the first one to understand, that Denzel is a super skilled assassin, from the opening scene of Equalizer 2. Even though the evil impulses of the villains feel rote and arbitrary, The Equalizer 2 is not without its pleasures. With his pared-down lifestyle, clear view of priorities and extreme skill at what he does, McCall is a welcome and ingratiating character, an unusual action figure who Washington imbues with calm, grace and intelligence, a man whose downtime is actually more rewarding than when he's once again, but inevitably, called back into battle.
As a film, however, The Equalizer 2 runs roughshod through its motions, an unfortunately consistent aesthetic that has run through a lot of Fuqua's film work. The Equalizer 2, for all its great fights, excellent acting from Washington, and tone of general righteousness, feels largely flimsy. The Equalizer 2 features notable deaths and aggressively brutal violence (there are several messy headshots, multiple stabbings, and one harpoon through the face), but the film's action is haphazardly delivered at random points throughout its narrative; That is to say: Just when The Equalizer 2 should be ramping up, it typically stops for an extended breath.
The Equalizer 2's conventional storytelling is certainly weak, and the violence is particularly brutal, but if Washington and Fuqua decide to revisit McCall again, it would probably be best if they just leave him on his beach.",The Equalizer 2
269,r-angle,SECOND MOVIE NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST,1,17 October 2020,"I loved The Equalizer, the first one. The story worked almost perfectly, for me.
Robert McCall is a reluctant hero and does something about injustice because he can, because he is good at it, and because he is the only one who will step up. Perfect. Yet he feels guilty about it and begs forgiveness. Also perfect.
But that reliable theme is gone in the second movie.
In Number Two, we are supposed to believe that good guys become bad guys for no reason. Is it money? Not really. Are they just tired of being good guys? Are they burned out and disillusioned? Maybe. Mostly, it's because the script calls for it. No! That is so lame! This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.",The Equalizer 2

He's not a loose end, he's a speed bump for a bus waiting to happen all by himself.And Macall would have no idea who killed his friend if they didn't show him by trying to kill him.So if you are a hitman, and get away with it, you go around trying to find more people to kill for no reason.Sub plot of Macall trying to help the young artist avoid the gang life, lesson ONE, learn how a belt works, it's called UNDERWEAR for a reason, not just that nobody wants to see your grungies!I can see why this is the only sequel that Denzell has done, but at least it's not the 'woker than woke garbage with Latifah' still on tv for some reason.",The Equalizer 2

NOT EVEN CLOSE!First, for an action movie, you can LITERALLY count the action scenes on one hand, which is telling for an action movie 2 hours long.Second, there's really not much of a story: the writing is a mix of unrelated, barely explained mixture of stories:How does McCall get back in the US with the librarian's daughter from Turkey?What happens to the girl that was drugged and raped after he drops her off at the hospital? McCall breaks the jaws of the rapey bros, but can't follow up on what becomes of her??After attacking the street gang that was trying to recruit Miles, they never come back looking for either of them? Have the writers known any gangs in real life??How come Susan, a declared badass, can barely take a punch from 2 average thugs?Why couldn't the team wait to settle their score with McCall until the hurricane was over??-What's McCal's story with Sam Rubinstein?? Why is their relationship important to the story?? Is he an old friend or a former client?

View it like seeing McCall/Denzel for 1ST time.
This Is a good movie.
(EP1 Is Great, however)
All of EP2 comes Full Circle at the end. (Interior Subplots are answered).
In this sense, EP2 succeeds.
Am I Hopeful for EP3?
ABSOLUTELY!!!
Fuqua and Denzel will regroup. Will See EP2 as it was received based on following CLASSIC EP1.
It will be GOOD for us Fanatics!!

The only thing More Inane than the disparaging remarks about this film is how/the order in which these comments are listed.
Remember, an onion has Many layers?

2) why did he pretend to be dead and disappear?
3) why was the guy and his wife killed at the beginning
4) who did they originally work for

This sequel is well done and Denzel Washington develops his character nicely.
But it is too much violence. That is why I gave it a 4. It is like violence is the main purpose and expression, not the human beings in the story, violence takes over from the characters.. question is.. do I go to the movies for violence or for a story and characters I can relate to?",The Equalizer 2

While I thought it was somewhat slow the first half of the movie, with some action sprinkled in, it takes its time to build to some tense scenes. Denzel delivers as always. The bad guy wasn't hard to figure out.
One scene with the bad guy in the backseat... I don't know why he didn't just use his gun from the get go. That wasn't plausible. Other than that, still a good movie.",The Equalizer 2
285,maureenfox-19518,Great film,7,22 November 2018,Again Denzel Washington delivers as he portrays the secretive main character who is forever seeking revenge for the wrong doing of others. All the more watchable by his elements of kindness he shows to those around him and how his influence changes them for good.Very dark undertones throughout but has a fantastic crescendo at the end.The characters entwine with there stories and the direction is awesome.

286,jeremyhaydon,"Nah! Too much CGI, and too many plot holes!",5,14 November 2018,"Denzel is an ex Mil, martial arts performing old guy with endless resources!
The opening train scene was blatant CGI! Why? Can we not use a real train in real countryside in this day and age?
What the hell was the accent those generic muslims on the train were using? 'Torrkey'??? What?
Denzel's hair grew back real quick after visiting 'Torrkey'
How did he know what apartment to visit to get info from those rich kids?
After he beat them all up, why didn't they report him?
Where did he get that high end BMW in the second half of the film? Was it a rental?
Why did he have that secret closet in his apartment? Why all the hidden CCTV?
He didn't have any enemies that he knew of!
The 'Miles' character seemed like he had a disability? The way he walked and talked.
The 'bad guy', Dave York, really didn't seem that evil, or that bothered, that Denzel could possibly take revenge on his family.
His kids seemed very into Denzel, hugging him, holding his hand etc, despite only just meeting him!
Where did Denzel get the cop badge from, to 'return' to his old home near the coast, during the hurricane, why didn't the cop check it out properly, or are they really that easy to fool ?
Why do knives make the 'metallic' sound when you swing them through the air, or bury them into soft flesh??
Since when does swinging your fist or leg, make the 'whoosh' sound?
The final battle was over the top and predictable. Denzel has endless Ammo, and ends up with only a scratch!

I went to the watch it because he usually dosn't do pointless zero plot movies. Like Man On Fire lots of action but good store line and character build up. Then came the opening scene where it's just about Kicking butt and this movie didn't progress much passed that. Just like they do in your Hollywood Martial Arts flicks. Denzel Washington is getting too old for believable fight scenes. Little build up, villains are mannequin's actor's you'd find in any ""b"" action movie totally forgettable. Nothing to explain why he's changed jobs, cities nothing to build on his character. Hollywood moves today have a narrow focus, where action movies editors just cut any decent plot or story line.

That is certainly not always so clear here. A lot of the violence was unnecessary to the story, and some of it, as in some Tarantino films seemed to take too much pleasure in itself. There was also a good deal implausible -- and cliched about it. On the other hand the story regarding Denzel's character and the younger guy showed to me that the makers had been reading or come to the same conclusions as Thomas Sowell, the GREAT intellectual.

The Equaliser 2 is in my opinion not as good as the first one. The main reason being the villains in this movie don't do as much to cement a solid hatred for them and thus make you root for Robert McCall (Denzel Washington). Denzel Washington is outstanding as always, and one scene in particular stands out. The rest of the cast do little for the movie.It also doesn't flow as well as the first movie, with choppy editing in parts and lack of the ""obsessive compulsive"" Robert McCall we saw in the first installment.It seems Antoine Fuqua went to Greg Jackson's gym in New Mexico to hire the majority of his villains, which is probably another reason why it lacks proper villainous acting.Still a very good action movie (in my opinion much better than Mission Impossible fallout) and definitely worthy of a trip to the cinema.

The bad guys were more interesting because they were led by a good guy turned bad guy. And with one victim being already a good friend of the Equalizer, that element justified even more the Equalizer's involvement in solving the crime and delivering Equalizer-type justice.

There's also the group of bad guys that look so terrifying, yet he can kill them all easily. There's also the same subplot of a person he tries to save/change his/her life, and a lot of small, karma/retribution scenes, where he punishes or kills bad people, sort of like watching a compilation of karma videos on youtube, where you go like ""yes! he got that coming, that was so good and satisfying to watch!"".Anyways... brainless but entertaining.

The first film delivered a good story, very good violent mature action, great dialogue, and an awesome villain plus the reliable Denzel leading the way.However this film does not deliver and is not on par with The Equalizer. It followed the steps from the original, did not change much, but the movie just felt flat, and had very little life to it. The villain's in this one were not very intriguing or intimating like the original, felt very weak. The movie contains tons of little side plots for Denzel to do, and kind of jumps all over the place instead of focusing on the main story. It is a little messy!This movie is the definition of mediocre. This is the first sequel Denzel has ever done and I think it was a mistake to do.

Forster would call a round character, sandwiching in his persona the tender daddy who teases his daughter about calling a puzzle piece ""New Hamster"" and then in an ensuing scene reverts to the brutal thug betraying his good friend and ex-team leader. The director here makes far more efficient use of major and minor characters and you really must pay close attention or you will miss something integral! It is almost as if the very weather is a character: How Shakespearean! Took me a while to recognize Orson Bean in his last on camera role, his scenes also a keeper.

All I can remember from 'Equaliser' was he worked at Home Depot and utilised its construction tools for other purposes.I came into 'Equaliser 2' without much expectations in view of some of its uneven reviews and sequel fatigue.Surprisingly 'Equaliser 2' has a well constructed storyline and enough action set pieces well spaced out by some thoughtful messages.

Thy profits will be done

Give us this day our daily sequel,

as we forgive those who make bad movies,
and lead us not into the franchise universe,
but deliver us from superhero woes.
For thine is the movie industry, 
and the power, and #metoo,
forever and ever. Amen.Since The ""Equalizer 2"" is a sequel to the brilliant ""The Equalizer,"" it is hard to judge this one without standing on the shoulders of the first one. I must have seen the original Equalizer about 5 times, and it is Gold. This is a good sequel, and I understand why some reviewers see it that way, but it is definitely not better. The energy, the thrill of the unexpected, the rawness, ultra-evil villains, and authentic action set pieces from the original are clearly missing in this one. It's clear that the writer and director wanted this outing to be personal for the character of Robert McCall and they do succeed in making us care for his cause. He dishes out justice to the evil doers while living his model citizen life as a mentor and good Samaritan in his trademark way, but it is this very predictability of the events, interspersed with not-so-inspiring action sequences, that stands in contrast with the originality of the original. Ultimately, what we do end up seeing is more of the same albeit to a lesser degree. We do get to learn more about Denzel Washington's character, and despite the slow burn, thankfully, the director manages to keep the tension high. One scene, in particular, comes to mind that involves Denzel Washington giving a hard knocks life lesson to Ashton Sanders' character outside a gangster's hideout (which, I must point out, is the very reason why we go to see a Denzel Washington movie). Other than McCall's character, unfortunately, others do not get to shine. Bill Pullman's character looks like he walked onto a wrong set and keeps having wardrobe issues as if it's his defining character trait. Some sloppy writing or editing right there. But, the cardinal sin of this action movie is: the stakes are never high. In the original, we saw Mr. McCall fight the international Russian mafia, corrupt cops, assassins, and his own troubled conscience that made him lament the amorality of criminals and cops alike and thus forced to unleash his lethal skills. In the sequel, however, besides exacting revenge for the wrongful death of his best friend, the movie burdens itself with sleuth-like skills of the protagonist (which nobody seems too concerned to question) and the unnecessary plot line of a Holocaust survivor. Despite its shortcomings, The Equalizer 2 is a treat for the fans of Denzel Washington, and the actor is incapable of giving a bad performance. My take from the movie: despite a weak story line and poor villainy, it is Washington's interpretation of the protagonist's vicissitudes that never ceased to amaze me. I would love to see another sequel of The Equalizer, the one that gives us a more layered complexity of the protagonist's environment, fleshed out subplots, and high stakes that once again forces our hero to right the wrong for us while we chomp on our popcorn.",The Equalizer 2

I was so emotionally invested in the sequel, but I think that's what makes it so good simply because the stories are more on a personal level and it allows you to see another side of McCall that you could have possibly missed in the first one now that we already know who he is.

328,adriano-40012,Great Sequel,9,18 July 2020,"I see a lot of average ratings over here and someone said Liam Neeson gave these movies a run for its money. First of Denzel Washington is 64 years old at the time of Equalizer II. He's had fantastic roles and movies over more than three decades. Equalizer I was definitely mine. The difference is the way how Denzel represents Rober McCall. He's not just a running John Wick. This is no front against John Wick movies, but the mainstream audience put 96 Hours ( all sequels were awful and disgraceful ) and John Wick movies next to Equalizer, but Equalizer has still so many unsolved questions. Who is McCall and what is his history and what kinda life he lived ?! Those questions weren't solved in Part I, which made fans scream for a sequel. In Equalizer we learn more from McCall's character and to say it doesn't satisfy the revenge thing is not right. Okay things rush a bit for some viewer, but for me it's alright. The intensity, pace and plot is at a good level. The movie contains more personal aspects than in the first movie in terms of McCall.

Eq2 still has that feeling. Mostly. But since it is part 2, they are trying a more twisted plot, not so much explanatory.
His best friend Susan Plummer is called to Belgium to investigate a murder, only for her to be murdered as well. Why did the first murder happened? No one knows. Why was Plummer investigating it? No one knows. Who ordered the hit? No one knows.
One Strength of Eq1 was that McCall tied up loose ends, this time in Eq2 they are talking much about tying up loose ends, which he kinda does, because his friend was murdered, but the film doesn't explain much more than that.
The sequel doesn't follow the main storyline as tight as Eq1 did either.

339,mistramicizia,I was left with the impression that the plot was more personal and made more sense than its already good predecessor,8,25 August 2018,"To be perfectly honest, I wasn't quite excited about watching this sequel after I heard it would soon hit theaters. I was asking myself : ""A sequel to what? Wasn't everything sorted out in the first movie?"". Therefore my expectations weren't high. In fact, I thought it would be some senseless killing spree with the sole purpose of keeping the character of Robert McCall alive, let alone the quality of the plot. Many sequels came out this year, and a considerable lot of them failed to meet my expectations.I was wrong and a obviously a bit prejudiced. The first scene drew attention and I was excited to see Denzel Washington (who, being Denzel Washington, once again put his greatest effort to amaze the public and confirmed his unique appearance that has a little bit of everything) back in action. This movie can be watched independently on the first one and doesn't rely on any events from the predecessor (apart from the main character and his personality), taking into consideration a completely new set of characters appearing in the movie.At least to my concern, no major characters are clichés. There are also some characters that are not directly relevant to the main plot, which to some people seemed like too much deviation and the story losing its compass and being overlong. This is understandable, as the action aspect in such scenes is absent, and people entered the cinema to watch fast-paced action (with myself not being an exception). However, I didn't mind that, because it is actually in the spirit of The Equalizer saga (?) to have such parallel, less harmful, yet equally didactic, plot lines (for example, the relation between McCall and Miles). So, one should not expect non-stop action and violence (which is already abundant, as expected and suitable to the movie's brutal tone) for there are the moments of relief. When the action part strikes, however, expect what you probably came for : the thrill and the anxiety of the characters successfully projected to the audience.Being an action saga, The Equalizer is not a cliché in many aspects, (which would spoil the details if I name them), but also not utterly realistic, and (personally saying) was never planned to be. Don't expect a spectacular movie, but don't make a mistake as I almost did, by not giving it a try.",The Equalizer 2

341,hansefde,Plotholes as deep as the Mariana trench.,4,4 November 2018,"Not a worthy successor of Equalizer 1. I am a huge fan of Denzel Washington but even with a swift montage he looks slow in his movements. Equalizer 1 was great because here was a secret agent that could kill anyone with any tool without blinking an eye. Now it's just another shoot 'm up movie in a desolated village. You know what's going to happen and ofcourse the villains go out on their own and don't give eachother support. So the hero can pick them out one by one. How original. Worst plothole is that you see the CIA black ops agents working in an office, finding clues on the Brussels homocide, discussing with superiors, but in a confrontation with Denzel reveal they are the assassins. Because they were sacked, they decided to become mercenaries. So if they were sacked, why were they walking around in a CIA office and going to Brussel with a superior? So stupid. Treasure Equalizer 1 and hope no. 3 isn't on the agenda.",The Equalizer 2

It's the excuse to involve Denzel's friend and himself.Denzel's character commit so many crimes where he would be seen on camera that his whole story is not believable. He's too out of shape to do all the martial art depicted.One exemple of unrealistic move is when the kid comes out of his hiding place less than a second after 3 killers left the apartment.

I'm aware that a sequel has to step up from its predecessor but it also has to remember its roots.Denzel kills it again. But I feel he didn't have as many memorable scenes as the previous Equalizer.This film was fresh like the first film, and had some great action set pieces. I enjoy the score more of this film than the first. The song used in the climax of the first gave the sequence a weird tone.This movie also surprises me a few times during the story in ways I didn't find obvious which I appreciate. But there's too much jumping around from city to country to city to country to country to city. The advantage of the first Equalizer was that it mostly stayed local, hell you were basically only in the diner, his apartment or the Home Depot and not traveling the world like this movie.There are seeds of greatness in this film, and I think it's worth buying both movies and watching them back to back.

Also is Susan's husband still sitting in that Motel? How did the bleeding stop completely from a gun shot wound after 15 seconds?

The movie is slow paced but it uses its time well, sprinkling action here and there, which carries the drama along nicely. Some surprisingly violent kills in here, and some very touching moments too. Good action that feels pretty grounded. I thought the antagonists were very intriguing and Denzel's acting was top notch.

After leaving his job (not at) Lowe's, McCall finds himself as a Lyft driver throughout Beantown. The set up of the movie tells various stories of the people he drives.Some for sentimental (and yes, even a governmental message overlay) and some to the title role of the film, an equalizer. Also as side stories, the audience learns about two of his neighbors, helping develop the plot of the film. And then the main plot of the film, as well, which is tied directly to his past, as he investigates a murder.

And the 'victim' (played by the great Melissa Leo) appears so briefly and that we really don't have time to care that much about avenging her death.Hence I found myself not particularly rooting for the 'good guy', or wishing the 'baddies' an unpleasant demise, but remained rather indifferent to the whole affair.",The Equalizer 2

Since I am not a special effects movie kind of person, movies have to have substance.

His close friend who was introduced in the first movie. I will not give a spoiler or ""who done it"" just know that it had slight predictability given deep state type of story lines involving secret ops.

The repurposing of Robert McCall from the original 80's TV series character worked well, for me. There was strong chemistry between Denzel and Chloe Moretz in the first movie. While Washington's rapport with his former agency characters remains in Eq2, there was an emotional connection either lacking or that I missed here, which ultimately hampered my enjoyment of the sequel. For me, Denzel's finest work remains Man On Fire. Don't get me wrong, Eq2 is a fine film, well crafted with several strong character and theme beats, but not as good as the first in my humble opinion. No spoilers as usual.

And when it started, I was hooked. The human interactions where so incredibly well done. Everything felt natural and Denzel acted his ass off.
121 one minutes of Denzel solving other peoples problems and bringing nothing but joy, condolence or sometimes the hard true onto them, would have done it for me. 10/10.
But...
The plot is stupid. Absolutely forced and does not work well. Denzel's charakter does not gain anything from the fight with those predictable twist villains. Nor does anyone else. The Equalizer is of course about giving everybody what he deserves, but for me it was (at least in part 1) more about making a difference for certain people. And killing them all in a forced, boring and unnecessary stretched showdown didn't make an difference. Hell no one actually cared. He even endangered people while doing this.And then, which hurt me the most, the emotional payoff in the end was kept way too short. Cut all those scenes of the ""bad guys"" tying up loose ends and give me more heart to heart conversations between Denzel and his fellow citizen.I'd give this mess of a movie 3/10 or something concerning the degree of entertainment. But the acting was so well done from time to time, that it's a bit above average.PS: Don't ever use Pedro Pascal as a stupid twist good guy is actually bad villian without a GOOD motive. He is way too predictable for that.",The Equalizer 2

395,jsimbumbu,This film is just DUMB! & I love Denzel Washington.,5,30 July 2018,"**No Spoilers**
I've followed Denzel for decades. He's an intelligent actor so why put him in a stupid film worthy of a less cerebral actor like Sylvester Stallone or Schwarzenegger? Stick a watch on these primates & let them do it. I've promised no spoilers so I can't tell you what is so stupid about this film but if you watch it with your brain switched ON (if you have one) you'll figure it out. 
I think even they realised, after consultation, that this film is so dumbed down with simplistic liberal generalisations & stereotypes that they tried to rectify it in a speech by the antagonist near the end but by then it's too late. Some of the acting is atrociously stereotypical particularly by the young boy. Please invite me to any hood in America where young black boys behave, walk & talk like him. What's wrong with this kid? He's trying too hard to be something that doesn't exist! So the story is simplistically juvenile. The acting is terrible in some instances. The movie is predictable. I can only recommend this film to my reasonably attractive but suspiciously demented EX-girlfriend who does NOT know that the city she is living in, AND claims to have been born in, is the capital of the country.

I really appreciated what they tried to do with this and i really like how much heart the Denzel Washington character had. It felt like he really cared about people in a way that most action heros dont and from that i understood why he does what he does.The end bit where they travel to that empty town felt cool but pretty random and i dont think it really worked because i never felt like anyone was in danger.I also thought the dialogue was good for the most part but that bit at the end where the kid is trying to speak good english on the bus to show his character development made me laugh out loud and i wish they wouldve cut it from the film, the painting in the courtyard seemed like a better way of showing how he had evolved.Despite the things i didnt like ill give it a high rating because what other action hero reunites a holocaust survivor with their sister. :)",The Equalizer 2

This movie is even darker in the sense that there is a storm brewing within the plot, so to say within Denzel as he goes through the different phases of the plot. Just like a typhoon hitting the coast in the climax there is the same that Denzel's character unleashes upon the enemies. This is a significant development in his character as in the first one only a part of his past is revealed and no such brutality is shown. Denzel emerges as a storm that is so brutal that it fears no one if any wrong is done. Its perfect!!",The Equalizer 2
406,joshua-c-s-63903,Could've used a tad more action.,7,28 July 2018,"Coming into this movie I was definitely anticipating more action than what I got. That being said the action in this movie is superb my problem is it doesn't really matter. And what I mean by that is, is that most of the action scenes consist of Denzel beating up and killing random scumbags who we have no real knowledge of or hatred towards. So although these guys may be getting what they deserve it's not as satisfying as it could be, as sadistic as that sounds if we had just been given more context.As for the main antagonist he's obviously more fleshed out and his motives are made clear, but I still find myself having the same issue. He even kills Susan which was an obvious attempt by the movie to get us behind Denzel's character. Sorry... but it didn't work for me, and I don't know why they thought it would. I mean I hardly remember her from the first one and now she's barely in this one.Even if I wasn't emotionally effected by the death of Susan, Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) was. Which leads him to seek revenge and give us a very entertaining final hour or so. With the last 10-15 minutes being particularly amazing as he skillfully and stealthily pegs off his adversaries one by one. As for Denzel Washington's first sequel it doesn't surpass the original, but it offers up just enough action to make me happy.",The Equalizer 2

What made Equalizer 1 so good was it's extremely simple story that built a character we barely know yet love, and pitted him against somewhat worthy opponents that tested his ability. This movie lacked worthy villains and all we get to see is Denzel kick-butt with minimal character advancement.

420,cj120uk,Just above average.,6,29 August 2018,"Let me start by saying I wasn't a fan of the first film. I was disappointed, esspecially when i found out that Denzel Washington was involved, that the end result was nothing like the original TV Series. The Equalizer (2014) and this sequel are more akin to Man on Fire (2004). I did enjoy this successor more because my expectations were low as I knew what type of film to expect this time. Unfortuately the storyline is slim but Washington rises it above average by delivering a typical winning performance. His OCD is downplayed this time, which I found unnecessary and distracting previously. In an attempt to make the antgonist stand out the screenwriters try to produce some depth by giving them a family and connections to McCall but these don't really work as up until this film you've never seen this character before. Also their motivations are very fluffy as you never find out the reasons behind the Belgium couples murder that kick starts the plot. I much perferred the way the film started with McCall just helping random people seek justice, this at least felt somewhat like Edward Woodwards take on the character. The Equalizer 2 is professionally crafted by Antoine Fuqua, will lots of well staged action and sickly choreographed fight sequences. The aging Washington truly convinces as the retired trained killer, who'd more than give Taken's Liam Neeson a run for his money. Particularly memorable is the decision to set the finale during a storm in a ghost town, this end chapter is very atmospheric. However the impact is reduced somewhat by the antagonist still making all the same Hollywood bad guy mistakes when it comes to dispatching the protagonist. Like I said it is generic stuff, just well made.",The Equalizer 2
421,Orki72,Not good,5,11 August 2018,"I was just reading through all the reviews here stating that this sequel was as good or even better than the original and I must say I completely disagree.One thing you can expect from a Denzel WAshington movie is good acting and here too, he delivers. But the storyline is just wrong, very predictable and sometimes just plain boring.I think I know what the intentions were. As moviegoers now know what to expect of the ""Equalizer"" they screenwriter and director did throw in a little bit of the ingredients of the first one, try to alter the storyline around the villains who seem to be very different than the ones of the first movie.Spoilers ahead:
First of all the end sequence with the storm and the chase around his old neighboorhood is just boring. I mean these guys are all pros and they know who they are up against. And of course it's a hunting game, but when the storm becomes more relevant than the shoot-out there must be something wrong with the pace.
And you just sit there and think well, just get on with it, we know that the Equalizer will kill the bad guys one by one and still there is no pace.
And the randomly chosen sidekicks as in the first one. This is just too obvious. He ""rescues"" the neighborhood kid from a gang and they don't even try to revenge the disrespect they got? 
Well, it's just all not at all as good as the original. It's too long - well, a phenomenon which almost every movie have these days..why always almost two hours? It's an action movie. 95 to 105 minutes is okay. Just do your editing and the cuts right! But if the storyline would be right and the movie would be more thrilling, than well, you don't look at your watch and can find two hours less long than in a boring movie.",The Equalizer 2

425,zac_g12,"A lot of Action, with a story to nowhere",5,10 August 2018,"Walking into the movie with a mindset of ""Did I like the first movie enough to actually care to watch a sequel? Yes."" With that mindset alone, mixed with the high expectations that it's a Denzel movie, the movie had my interest from the start. 
However, that feel short real quick. Not only was the story all over the place, the acting was amateur. Many of the scenes with Denzel and ""X"" actor sharing dialogue were cut straight from a Wednesday night acting class at the YMCA. To think that this being Denzel's first sequel ever he would have read and contributed to a tighter script. 
To see two veterans like Denzel and Bill Pullman share one of the most cringe worthy scenes was something I never hoped to buy a ticket for. 
The side character and exposition of Ashton Sanders, same thing. Dated and dry, too amateur. The (what felt like 30 minute) paint scene and awkward apartment scene seemed to not help any part of back story or overall contribution to the main story other than to have extra dialogue. Not only did it change ""Mr. Mcall's"" demenour it changed the ""regular guy during the day, vigilante at night"" story the first movie developed so well in the first. 
Overall, the movie is more of a reprising of Denzel's ""Man on Fire"" role, rather than a continuation of ""The Equilizer"". This movie very much had a cash grab feel to it with the story being too inconsistent, the manerisms stiff, the dialogue amateur, the action seems to be the only positive coming out of ""Equilizer 2"". 
If there is a third in the making I only hope the writers build a better character arch and bring better actors to the script that can demand a space along side a veteran like Denzel Washington. Also make his job something more believable rather than an obscure lyft driver. Something more meat than potato.",The Equalizer 2

As in the first movie, the opposition is worthy albeit lacking the discipline of McCall. Robert McCall knows he is at a disadvantage as he is one man against several. He makes up for that disadvantage by simply using his time in preparation and baiting himself in familiar surroundings, leaving his enemies constantly trying to catch up.

I loved the first one, a good balance of him kicking ass and caring for others but this pretty much left all of the main story line to the end.You know in most conspiracies how the trail usually sends them to one clue and then another and another and another and another 5 or 6 times until they reveal the bad guy and their motive?Well in the equaliser 2 they left the main story to about halfway through so the trail was about 2 clues until he figured it out which I felt was really lazy. It's like: let's show this guy being a good samaritan for a while but now we don't have time for a deep plot so let's just connect the dots sooner oh and umm the bad guys... yeah here is a possible motive that I pulled out of a hat.

The first EQ movie was a breath of fresh air, but this one, for me, didn't have the same power. It took a while to get going (yes we know Denzel will be able to mess up some privileged idiots abusing a girl); I guess in that sense it was a bit more predictable - if in the first movie he took out a room full of (Russian of course) baddies, then what threat is a room full of kids, or other sundry bad types? I found myself thinking; when is the real story going to begin? So for me the first movie was altogether a tighter, more focussed affair. But DW, don't stop doing what you do, which is to great (usually) super movies.",The Equalizer 2

The acting is good with a few duds scattered around the movie. The villain was pretty obvious after 30-40 minutes and the final act was lacking the spectacle that made the last act of the first movie so damn entertaining and, in my opinion, badass.

EQ1 showed DW as an ordinary guy with a hidden past that helped those who were oppressed. The story escalated quite nicely yet in EQ2 it seemed that he now travels the world like a one man A team.

I try not to compare second installments to the first ones so to judge on its own I give it a 6.5 out of 10, the first one I give a 7 out of 10. Since I am not a special effects movie kind of person, movies have to have substance. This sequel could stand on its own and there is no need to see the first to understand that Denzel is a special ops guy and he is revenging the death of one of his close friends. His close friend who was introduced in the first movie. I will not give a spoiler or ""who done it"" just know that it had slight predictability given deep state type of story lines involving secret ops. Some may not see the predictability and will be a good cliff hanger. There is good human back story to give depth to the characters and good rounding out of good/bad at the end. Good movie all the way around.",The Equalizer 2
452,bentheimpaler,"It isn't bad. It isn't especially good, either.",5,22 August 2018,"I have a hard time actually nailing this one down. I quite liked the first one, despite not feeling any desire to rewatch it on the small screen. But I can't shake this feeling that it somehow falls short, despite doing a lot of things right (at least on paper). 
For starters, Denzel gives another decent performance as the stoic protagonist. He's not going to win any awards with this one, but his delivery and presence got some good reactions from both myself and the rest of the audience. For their part in this script, the rest of the cast is fine too. Again, not oscar nods here, but perfectly serviceable. All-but-gone are the gimmicky found-items based fight scenes from the first film, which, while creative, might have made this feel like more of a retread than a continuation. However, the heavier use of actual weapons makes the movie stand out less from other vigilante action titles. The take-downs are, nonetheless, just as satisfyingly visceral as ever, with enough sound-design to back up what the extras shrieking lets you know that Robert McCall is capable of. 
The plot, however, needs some work. Despite some decent standalone moments scattered throughout, it overall comes across like a chef had too many pots on the stove and pulled them all too early. There are numerous plot-threads and characters that just never go anywhere, and even fewer that contribute to the central plot even if they come to a conclusion within the runtime. Set up for another sequel? Maybe, though that would suggest more of the same focus-issues which this movie suffers from in the franchise's future.
My biggest gripe comes in the form of the central story itself. The overall concept is alright, if a little clichéd. Had it taken up the entire length of the film, rather than the little, unconnected subplots, it could have been fleshed out into something much better than it otherwise really had time to. The villains, in particular, hint at the potential to be truly sympathetic, human characters who could have both been and put The Equalizer himself in an emotionally compromised position while trying to carry out their respective goals. Instead, you're left to infer too much and wonder what might have been for the inclusion of an extra line or two each. 
Basically, it's okay. With the exception of a couple of one-liners it doesn't stand out much for better or for worse. It's hard to have strong feelings about, with the possible exception of the regrets I have over how much more memorable it could've been.",The Equalizer 2

It's a good film - there's a lot of characters, maybe too many to focus on, and that's the real issue - the central plot is lost; it's set up vaguely at the start and then disappears altogether becoming simply a tale of revenge in the 3rd act. Overall, this film needed a more ruthless script editor and it needed to concentrate on the essence of the concept of 'The Equalizer' - helping those who no-one else could or would help. Just too many storylines without real resolution. The other problem is that it's too damn dark - not the story - the lighting and grading. I wonder if it's because editors edit on computer monitors and don't check their edits projected onto a screen. I was squinting trying to see details in the film. The 'lighting' is nice, and the mainly CGI'd and special effected 3rd act is very well done, but the overall grade is dim. Additionally, and this is not confined to this film, the 7.1 soundtrack is excellent BUT for goodness sake mixing engineers, please turn up the volume of the central dialogue track - the SFX overwhelm it.",The Equalizer 2

Some portions of the story seemed completely unnecessary, almost as if their only reason for existing is to show the audience the redeeming qualities of Denzel's character. Character development is fine of course, but these scenes and interactions don't help propel the story forward, rather they play out like a collage of good deeds hiding beneath the surface of a commercial for Lyft (the ride sharing service competitor to Uber.) These scenes feel like filler and bloat a movie that feels much longer than it's actual run time. The other main gripe I have with the movie is the script. It's just not very good. Denzel and company do the best they can with what they have, but they don't really have much to work with. The jokes fall flat for the most part and the story is highly predictable throughout; you can see the twist coming from a mile away. The action scenes are well done, visceral and appropriately brutal. A set piece at the end of the movie that takes place during a hurricane is also particularly well done, but overall, the script is too weak for the movie to be a well-done thriller and the pacing is too slow for it to be a fast-paced action movie, so this movie ends up stuck in purgatory and turns out to be an average action-thriller where the sum isn't really better than it's parts. 6/10",The Equalizer 2

 Picture did demonstrate somebody understands Sound. I could hear every word Denzel spoke. The women didn't seem to have the same sound engineer. Poor dialogue, and enunciation is a lack of training. I don't know if actors lack training, or the sound engineers, but the music only seemed to drown the co-stars. I learned my inability to hear the dialogue is not my hearing or my favorite local theaters sound system.
I didn't like any of the characters.The writer failed to create any kind of sympathy for these one dimensional bores. They all made bad choices, put innocent lives at risk, in the name of a ""job.""

I was hoping to like it- both Clint Eastwood and Liam Neeson have gotten to play kick-ass action heroes well into their silver years, why not Denzel who exudes more gritty cool than either of them combined?Except... the first thing an action movie needs is, I don't know, actual action. To be fair, there are a precious few moments of in the first 90 minutes of Washington's ex-Marine, ex-CIA avenging angel righting some wrongs with fast jabs to various solar plexus, but these come in drips and drabs and are tangential to the main plot. Basically, it isn't until the movie has about 25 minutes left that The Equalizer starts any actual Equalizing.What comes before this is a 90-minute trudge to nowhere. Director Antoine Fuqua sure does love his scenes of Washington listening with stone-faced empathy to the plight of an elderly Holocaust survivor, or giving words of wisdom to a neighbor kid who might be going down a bad path because he stages them again and again and again. If I wanted 90 minutes of someone delivering lessons on manners and how to be kind to others, I'd go back and rewatch ""Won't You Be My Neighbor,"" which at least was more interesting than this.The most fatal flaw of The Equalizer 2 is that it is all build-up, no pay-off. Besides beating us over the head with repeated examples of McCall's angelic goodness, the movie starts to weave a plot about a CIA friend (Melissa Leo) who is murdered while investigating the death of an agent. For as much time and geography as the movie burns (it literally skips its way from Boston to DC to Brussels and back again over and over), one would hope that it would deliver something in terms of plot, but not really. By the time the first real revelation happens the movie is 3/4 over and the generic bad guys with generic facial hair and generic motives take the stage for the finally, leaving in the dust questions that a good movie might have answered.And as for that finale... Well, I got to give The Equalizer 2 credit for being better than Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom because it at least waits until its final quarter to act like it's lost all common sense. I won't get too deep into plot specifics other than to say that the it's the kind of closing action scene that probably sounds cool on paper, but is executed in a way to make me wonder if anyone involved in the writing or directing or set work of the movie has every actually been through a real hurricane. An evacuated beach island village where there are barely any puddles on the ground much less waist-deep water threatening to sweep hero and villains alike out to sea? Gunfights in 80+ mile per hour winds? Oh, and the electricity is still working.Yeah, right.",The Equalizer 2

While on this subject, how does a guy that is dead have enough money to rent an apartment and have a car? He has no pension as the CIA thinks he's dead. DUMB.

This same Nor'easter does not prevent characters from driving from DC to Cape Cod in record times or prevent McCall from flying in and out of DC and then rescuing another character from the superhero villains that seemingly can be anywhere at anytime. McCall also can't seem to remember whether he was a Marine or in the Army during a key conversation. This is a mistake no Marine or Soldier would ever make. Wait for it to be on cable.",The Equalizer 2
501,fastdiablovt,A Disappointing sequel,5,13 December 2018,"Like other reviewers have noted, Denzel's acting is as good here as it's any of his movies, but that's about the only thing worthy in this anticipated sequel - everything else pretty much a disappointment.As is typical in Holywood sequels, this movie falls well short of the original. The Equalizer 2 never builds up any real tension within the storyline (which is mostly flat, weak and uninteresting). In many scenes, the dialogue was off and even cringe worthy. The characters showed no real emotions or depth in any of the scenes which made it difficult to give a crap about them and the story.By the time the final shootout d emr rolled around I was left wondering why I should care about Denzel's next kill & the uninteresting plot (which was also very weak). I lost nearly all interest in this movie in the final action scene. Overall a really disappointing sequel that could have equaled if not surpassed the original if only for a better more interesting story, plotting and better dialogue. 5/10.",The Equalizer 2
502,mtwhite-32612,Well done action movie,6,11 August 2018,"This isn't going to win any awards but if you're going out to the movies with some friends, this isn't a bad pick. Denzel is great as expected and the action is fun to watch and keeps the audience engaged. It's not exactly a plot-driven movie as you can probably tell, but with that said the plot is fairly solid without holes in it as some action movies tend to fall victim to. One small issue is the irrelevant side plot with the kid in his neighborhood that doesn't exactly lead up to any sort of resolution but provides for some character development. Not a must watch, but worth your time in my opinion.",The Equalizer 2

505,iano1,A better film than the first,7,11 February 2021,"A more nuanced performance from Washington, with a story that balances pace with detail and character development, unlike the original, which was enjoyable but a fairly arbitrary series of action sequences. None was particularly out of the ordinary, and together they didn't add up to much more than a Marvel comic story.This one, on the other hand, held my interest precisely because it took time to build up expectancy and intrigue. There is a scene that, for a moment, I thought was going to rip off 'Taken' but it deftly pivoted away. I guess younger viewers are reporting some disappointment in the film's perceived lack of action but it's all relative. Personally, it's the endless chases, fights and lack of dialogue in many action films that make me yawn.",The Equalizer 2

507,newzealandrules,What a Hot Mess,3,20 July 2018,"This is easily my least favourite Antoine Fuqua Film, I loved The Equalizer and Training Day and even the Magnificent Seven was decent entertainment but The Equalizer 2 was a major disappointment. I struggled to give this film a three the reasons why it got any points are as follows: The Miles character was well acted, interesting and deep, the setting for the final battle was effective with all the darkness involved and the assistant villains while not given enough of a role were fearsome dark and still effective. The problems I have with this film are as follows: firstly the plot was so slow and lacking in action that I was falling asleep half way through. Secondly the main villain was so poorly developed that I didn't even care when he revealed he was the bad guy. My least favourite part of the movie is that they sacrificed having a good plot to shoehorn unnecessary emotional background surrounding Robert Macall's wife. In summary this film is a very poor attempt at a sequel. I don't know if they will make a third film but what disappoints me the most is that they followed the amazing first movie with something so bad. My advice is to save your money and watch the first Equalizer film instead.",The Equalizer 2

511,hantz101,A sequel for the sake of being a sequel,5,2 January 2020,"With no explanation of the opening murder, several plot holes, and convenient irregularities, I did not enjoy this as much as the first movie. While McCall has some technical skill in dishing out hand-to-hand punishment, the ending had me shaking my head the entire time.A sniper takes up an elevated position during a hurricane??? Does he really think he'll be an effective shot with gale-force winds? Not to mention, the assortment of buildings would require a house-by-house search to effectively clear each structure, not the random ""Check the yellow house! Now check the bakery! Head towards the ocean!"" crap. McCall also shoots out an electrical transformer, but is still able to activate the fans in said bakery. And while grain dust explosions are a real thing because of the stillness of the air, a flashbang + flour does not equal a devastating explosion in hurricane winds. Also, shooting the rear tire of a car only lowers it by a few inches, not enough for said sniper to miss ""the middle of the trunk,"" he still has a four foot target. The tower the sniper is stationed on has an unexplained gap in the corner where there's no safety railing. McCall couldn't have thrown him over the top? I find it hard to believe OSHA approved the construction of such a structure. And finally, McCall rescues Miles, and drags him back to McCall's own house instead of the nearest shelter, bypassing several structures where they could have found refuge from the 'cane, then leaves him bleeding while he sits in a comfy chair and reminisces about his former life. In front of two large windows, during a hurricane.Pass this one up and watch Training Day again.",The Equalizer 2

That said, The Equalizer 2 is not one of those sequals. To the contrary, this film exceeded my expectations in every way. Denzel performed his quintessential role as only he can, accompanied by a great supporting cast. The film shouldn't be relegated to a mere action film, as it had several meaningful scenes with great dialogue. Denzel's character seeks to bring out the good in those around him, something exemplified in the relationship he builds with the young man in the film. Overall, I left the theater impressed.

530,beneke200,Very back to the old days action movie,5,17 November 2018,"Basically, it's like you're watching an old 90s action movie again.
The story is pretty undetailed and the movie has to be carried by the incredibly awesome main character, while the villains are forgettable, barely have any build-up and/or storyline and of course, there is the ""damsel in distress"" (In this case a young man).Now, the movie is enjoyable, don't get me wrong. The action is pretty awesome. I personally really like how this movie avoids the cheesy ""let's have a nice long talk before I shoot you"" mentality. Basically if the main character wants to murder someone, he does it. No slow build up, no talking, no monologuing, just pure, simple, sometimes brutal action.I rated this movie a 5/10 mostly because it gets worse when you compare it to the original Equalizer movie. This movie somewhat ruins the mysteries that remain after watching the first. For a simple action movie with not much story, I would've given it a 6 or 7 if it hadn't done such a poor job of being a sequel.So, for anyone interested in those simple old action movies (think die-hard, lethal weapon, John Wick etc); You should probably watch this anyway.

The bad guy is, of course, bad, because morality exists despite his nihilistic philosophy. Make no mistake, this type of discussion adds depth to a movie.

I believe the people who watched the first movie would appreciate it even more than I did. (I havent watched the first movie)However at moments I felt the movie really had no goal.

Both Denzel and Marton made that movie. Now the sequel comes out and we get a forgettable antagonist, he's not even really introduced until the near end of the movie as the antagonist so he's not really as developed as Marton was, which is a real shame because the first one showed that both the hero and the bad guy could have development in a movie. But let's get back to this one, it's slow, veeery slow. The action scenes are badly shot and the slow-mo scenes are entirely gone, and those made the action scenes in the first one amazing. Instead of being a guy that tries to hide from his past and forget it, we get the new Denzel that seeks out people to help instead of helping people that he meets and knows.It's pretty clear to that they didn't quite understand why the first one was so great. It was such a different movie from the other super agent movies where the hero saves the day by using guns and tools that doesn't exist, they had more of a horror hero that used tools that he had close by.If they do make a third one, I do hope it's more of the ending of the first one rather then this action flick.",The Equalizer 2

The film was still decent as Denzel Washington delivered a good performance. The movie was slightly dragging as it didn't contain as much action as the first movie. The writers put too much story and information into the sequel and it almost feels like as if I was watching a part 3, not a part 2. The story was hard to follow as too much new details were added. It felt like that the writers were trying too hard to deliver a good story rater than delivering good fight scenes (as what is expected from this film). The fight scenes weren't as good as the ones in the first movie. The only fight scene I enjoyed was the ending. There were too much subplots in this movie which were hard to follow and hard to connect with the main plot (like the scenes in turkey, and the scenes with the rich guys drugging a girl which were totally unnecessary and unrelated to the main plot.)But overall, it was an okay movie. It still kept the authenticity of the story around Robert McCall.",The Equalizer 2

573,aarseg12,I have never seen such a dull movie in my life,1,31 July 2018,"I'll preface this by saying that I like high caliber action movies and I like intricate plot heavy ones. What I don't like is a lack of either one. The first Equalizer film was a brilliant albeit simple action movie which used tension and feel good motivations to create a really unique and fun movie. This one, however, lacks all of the charm that the first had and paints a bleak picture, has very little action, including a nearly hour long sequence without any combat, a plot that was entirely uninspired and generic, a total lack of color and vibrance, and a picture of McCall as a ruthless agent of justice instead of a sweet old man who wants to bring about positive change through vigilantism. There are a few exciting fight scenes, but in all of them, McCall's motivations are barely explained. The villains lack the intellect and nuance of the first, the good characters seem like filler, and the most ""touching"" relationship in the film barely offers any emotional value, in sharp contrast to the sweet friendship between McCall and his cohorts in the first. The two are so bizarrely different that they seem entirely unrelated, and while the first was a clean, well though out, all loose ends tied up masterpiece, this one is a jaded mess of filler, boring characters, wasted time, and little action. I genuinely have never seen a movie I enjoyed less. Please watch something else, this movie will leave you feeling very blank.",The Equalizer 2

The second however fails to imitate the first nor takes it to a higher state in terms of what made the first one soo great. In the second there is more emotions and moral lessons that I can see the director tries to speak to the audience through Denzel's character. However the multiple unrelated side stories that don't really link with the main one and slow lagging pace really dented my experience watching this movie. Even noticed myself yawning a few times.

During the first hour of the movie nothing really happens and the final and most important scene is over within a few minutes. Apart from that everything is quite foreseeable. Anyone has seen similar scenes before in tons of other action movies. Usually I enjoy watching action movies because they are very entertaining. although most of them don't have much intellectual value. But this one was not even that, just boring. Actually it is a waste of time. Even for free it's not worth the time. In the first movie the character of McCall was built up and described as a humble, benevolent and sympathetic man but also as a retired agent with extraordinary intellectual qualities and fighting capabilities: within the course of the film he became a kind of modern Robin Hood. And this made the first Equalizer so enjoyable. This second part just pretends to squeeze the very last drops of bucks out of the Equalizer orange. There is nothing really innovative or entertaining about this movie. Don't let them take your time or your money.

The story takes a little while to establish itself but on the whole that only adds to the build up the film and makes the action scenes all the more worthwhile with increased impact.

There was a bit of action and the first 15 minutes had me settling in for a great action flick, but somewhere somebody threw in a stupid story about killing people off. We never knew why, we were just fed rubbish and were expected to follow it - which was not really hard to do with zero plot.
The assassin with the knife was about as dumb a piece of movie making I have seen and it kind of stayed in that vein for the rest of the movie.
There was the customary feel good corny bits you come to expect and some enjoy (and I can live with) but overall I thought it was a couple of hours I will never get back in my life.

To say I loved this movie would be an understatement. Had me on the edge of my seat the whole time! I laughed and I cried. Needless to say I had to immediately watch the first one. Highly recommend this sequel!!,The Equalizer 2
649,kowgirltina,took long enough!,9,20 July 2018,"I was really excited when I started seeing the commercials for EQ2. I read they wanted to make a sequel for years, but nothing really came about. I really enjoy action/adventure movies, so this was right up my alley.The story line was similar to the first one- Denzel helping those who have been wronged, but there is a new location, new job, and new characters.There is enough action and suspense, and not a ton of CGI like other movies, which in my opinion, makes this a little more believable. You get a couple of twists and turns here and there and Denzel's acting really fits the role.I judge a movie on whether it's good enough to see again, and I would definitely see it again!",The Equalizer 2

It's not a bad movie, it just drugged a lot. For the first hour of the movie it felt like an episode of CSI. It didn't pick up until the 3rd act of the movie, when he found out who it was and they had a big gun fight. It's not a bad movie, it just wasn't as great as the original.",The Equalizer 2

654,uncritic-critic,Review of the Equalizer II (Spoiler Free),9,12 August 2018,"Review of the Equalizer II (Spoiler Free)Hey, fellow movie-goers! Just got finished watching the ""Equalizer II"". Let me start off by saying that I adored the first Equalizer movie, possibly one of my favorite movies of all time. The sequel managed to surpass the original. I just had so much fun while watching this movie. In a world where it's difficult to find a sequel better than the original, it's like Christmas morning when you find one. The ""Equalizer 2"" is a rated R thriller directed by Antoine Fuqua and released by Columbia Pictures. It stars Denzel Washington, returning as Robert McCall. It costars Melissa Leo and Bill Pullman, revising their characters from the first movie, albeit with much more screen time. Pedro Pascal, Ashton Sanders, Orson Bean and Jonathan Scarfe round out the remaining cast. Denzel's character must face his past this time, realizing that even living as a dead man that your past
will catch up with you.In this movie Robert McCall is living under the radar as a ""dead man"", but now using his talents to help those in need that have no one else to go to. This all changes when one of McCall's few close friends is murdered. McCall must come out of the shadows and figure out who did it and why.One of my favorite parts of the movie is the tension that builds throughout the movie. This is represented by a storm off in the distance that threatens to strike as the movie moves along. The deep thunder brings a heaviness to the movie that is there until the end.I would extremely recommend this movie to any of my friends, especially if they are fans of the first movie and enjoy a great thriller. It is gory in parts with some harsh language, so I would leave the kiddos at home. Hoping this won't be the last because I just adore this franchise. But seriously, it's Denzel Washington, does he do anything bad??",The Equalizer 2
655,Heisenberg2004,Robert McCall- A Great Character played amazingly By Denzel Washington,7,6 February 2019,"If you like the first movie, The chances are you will enjoy this.

656,mhert-24664,It Is Rare To See A Good Hero,8,13 February 2019,"He doesn't kill indiscriminately he doesn't wound without cause. He is so compelling you have to see what he does. This movie is cheesy and simple, but very good and enjoyable. Denzel seems to get this character deeply and while it is slightly unbelievable that a person his age could take down who he does is worth the suspension of disbelief. It is worth seeing a good man fight for goodness. To see someone who takes responsibility seriously and who takes power even more seriously makes it sweet to watch. While the movie is adequate, the charecter holds up this movie and the first. The first one is better but this one is good too.It is a revenge tale vs a rescue mission, but all in all it is a story of justice. The difference between this and any other revenge tale is that this simply seems more justifiable. Watch it.",The Equalizer 2

Second was baffling why it was made, why were they so quiet in his apartment, yet they are shooting everyone else in daylight.

665,tcl_53,Doesn't stand up to the first film,4,20 July 2018,The first Equalizer film was possibly my favorite action film of all time. This one disappointed me on several levels. The action sequences aren't filmed as well and lack the ingenuity of those in the first installment. The movie as a whole didn't seem to flow as well as its predecessor. I have a strong feeling the first film will be hard to top by another sequel or by future movies with similar themes. I thought that Denzel did a good job but was let down by other aspects of the production.,The Equalizer 2

This movie was taken in a different direction from the first and added more textures and layers in story and McCall's character revelation. For example, his rituals about drinking tea, cleaning dishes, etc., were downplayed here, but thrown in as asides, such as in the opening train scene wherein he unfolded what I assume was his tea bag. His depth of love for several characters, seen and unseen, was most welcome because I (we?) tire of the lonesome gun portrayals; next time we would want to see the lady who was mentioned several times. The young man's character was written and acted so well; I have read of the scene between the two wherein McCall tells the young man he is responsible for himself; he was wooed into the foregoing drug scene which McCall crashed and McCall's call to the young man's self was wonderful to behold, and so believable. How many more McCalls are needed today, not as dads, but birth dads? I grinned when I thought about how the young thugs who had enticed the young man were startled when this old guy breaks in and snatches their neophyte from them; they cussed about who that guy was, but they didn't chase the phantom geezer. The confrontation/invervention scene was perfect in every way. Another sequel should be worth the wait. Mr. Washington's career continues to unfold at its own pace; he seems to have perfect pitch whether in a comedy, drama, action role. I go to movies rarely, usually waiting for cable at home; he was worth the price of a ticket, but the popcorn was too expensive.",The Equalizer 2

The initial 30 minutes build up was in line with the first movie but as it progressed I found myself feeling disappointed. It drifted into the usual format of so many other movies before it, where the lead up left no surprises and I pretty much guessed the ending.This really is an exception for me as Denzel is one of my go to actors but I'd have to admit, I'm hoping there's not going to be E3.",The Equalizer 2

Great sequel! If you liked the first, go and watch the second. Denzel Washington does it again. Superb actor. Would definitely recommend this film to anyone. Great watch.",The Equalizer 2
721,talton-36759,On the same level as the first!!!,8,21 July 2018,Great movie! Was worried it would fail like Taken 2 but that was not the case. Must see and Denzel was awesome!!!,The Equalizer 2
722,johantorpk,Close to perfection,9,3 February 2021,"I rarely write reviews for movies and things in general, but this movie is an exception. It delivers in many more ways than the first Equalizer did. Now don't get me wrong the first one was great, but when you see this one it's amazing in comparison. Mr. McCall aka Denzel Washington is a man who has retired from his military background and is now going on about his life. Although someday one of his colleagues gets killed and things get personal for our main character. Then what happens is Mr. McCall tries to get a young kid, he has grown fond of out of trouble and the story goes from there. This movie is in my opinion the best you're going to get from an action movie. It has suspense, thrill, and most importantly emotional depth which in my opinion is the greatest takeaway from this movie, leaving you with feeling like you learned something on a more profound level.",The Equalizer 2
723,sulevyo,mixed feelings,5,23 January 2020,"Movie is alright in my book. solid first half of the film but drop of at the end. left too many unanswered questions for me - sometimes its good but this time it feels just lazy writing. overall ""alright"" effort",The Equalizer 2
724,suyun-38724,Very bad movie !,3,5 August 2018,"This is really a bad movie , just about killing people , the whole story is boring . I feel sleepy during the movie which I haven't done for a long time . I do want my ticket money back",The Equalizer 2

729,mickstar-44744,Fantastically amazing!,10,25 August 2018,"Denzel at his best! Just as good as good as the first film (if not better). The difference to the first film is that: you really get to know who Robert is and where he comes from, which makes it a bit more gritty and personal.
Amazing film all round; can't fault it at all!",The Equalizer 2
730,jamesperrilli,Not as good as the first in my opinion,7,28 December 2018,"I Loved the first movie. Great story, great action, great suspense and great soundtrack. In the sequal, DWs character wasn't cautious like he was in the first. He did what he wanted, when he wanted, (all out in the open) with no regard of getting caught out by bad guys, cops or potential surveillance or witnesses. Way too many outside elements were in DWs characters favor this time around (cars, people, weather etc.) I also cannot believe that the gang did not retaliate against him or the kid. I did like the second, but I think the first was more believable. If there is a third, it needs to be more like the original. Stealth, planning and backup planning and more backup planning, element of surprise and out of the box thinking for fighting and action sequences. (All of which the first one has).",The Equalizer 2

734,petrahtsoit,SUPERB,9,13 August 2018,"What I like most is all serve in good posture story. The target have been known since the early scenery. Then he challenged his enemy and he won it, but it still reasonable. He won the battle because he was well prepared. The story put best location for the battle also. And last thing, I love movies with wise dialogue. So satisfied! You must watch the movie, don't miss it",The Equalizer 2

The action was crisp and clean and executed well it was a very human story with a lot of action and some funny lines a very good sequel better than the first also the last scene on the tower was awesome loved that fight scene the best and the bad guys got all what they had coming to them DVD and Blu Ray release is set for December can't wait till it comes out will be adding it to my collection for sure,The Equalizer 2
737,mbreindl,Breindl Reviews - The Equalizer 2,5,23 July 2018,"""The Equalizer II"" wasn't a needed sequel, but I still had a semi-good time. Despite having Denzel as the lead character, the slow pacing really makes this movie not shine as much as it could've. I did like one fight scene in the second half of the movie, but that it. 5.2/10",The Equalizer 2

739,gunslinger_mario,A different action movie.,10,30 October 2018,"I really like this movie, I wasn't expecting something different from the first one. But when I got out of the cinema I started counting all the different details they've put on this movie.
The opening was really good, Denzel really nails it. The final confrontation it's also different, I would only add 2 more enemies and Zack Hemsey Vengeance theme again.
It's predictable? Well yes and no, nowadays what are you expecting? that there's an enemy under the enemy and at the same time another one under those?
If it has too much story then people say oh it's too boring, if it has too many emotional or lesson time moments then people say oh it's full of sermons and propaganda, and if it's full of gore then oh there's no story at all just a guy blowing others brains out.
Only thing I can say it's a different and enjoyable movie.",The Equalizer 2
740,elzerny,Equal,6,29 July 2018,"Well done follow up.
The original TV show was kool and this franchise was a great reboot.The retribution theme is so much fun to play with and equal 2 gets you to that place.Denzel is more formidable then liam Neeson in taken but it is close.
They run 2 different naratives but bring it together very well at the end.
Ageing good guys are important, but there becomes a point where it becomes less believable?",The Equalizer 2
741,phippers,Denzil saves the day (and this film),6,24 August 2018,Denzil Washington's performance is by far the best thing about this film as the story line is both slow and predictable. Not a patch on the first one and takes far too long to get going. Too many sub stories which are irrelevant to the main narrative which also lacks any real depth.,The Equalizer 2

A true rollercoaster of emotions, fire arms, life lessons and even comedy can be found in this beautiful movie. One might think It's all about badass shooting bad guys, but it is much more. Denzel Washington really finds his top form in this one, and the rest of the cast is spot on. It will leave you in awe.",The Equalizer 2
753,elopezca,"Entertaining, yet slow-paced by the side stories",8,6 July 2019,"Yes, the story is somewhat Batman-esque with McCall saving random people at first. Then comes a bunch of side stories that kinda add some distraction from the main plot. Anyway, I did enjoy the film but I'm definitely hoping for part 3 pretty soon. Third parts are usually better than second parts.BTW, in my opinion, part 3 should include some plot with Brian (Susan's husband) showing his true colors about McCall, maybe finally revealing that he had something to do with the death of McCall's wife in the hotel explosion, and other evil things that his own wife Susan was totally unaware of. The plot could also involve some top military agents who originally planned to target McCall in that explosion and wanted him out of the picture for some reason. Now McCall has a motive to avenge his wife's death and to uncover a huge plot of military and government corruption that has been going on for many years. Hehehe... Just a thought ;)",The Equalizer 2
754,ericsaisrichen,"Denzel reminds us who is king, but not enough",7,9 September 2018,"Denzel dishes out a succulent slice of acting & action in the sophomore effort in The Equalizer 2.Surprisingly, there just as much heart and story as there is juicy shoot em up excitement.But its Denzel's powerful performance with young Ashton Sanders in 1 key scene that makes this movie Stand out from the rest.Shame there weren't more sprinkled in, but Denzel reminds us who the king is.Another good pairing between Denzel & Antoine Fuqua. Albeit, not up to the calibre of Training Day or The original Equalizer this sequel is an adequate effort and an enjoyable watch.",The Equalizer 2
755,doruk_kose-61739,A Ghost of its former self,4,1 November 2018,"This movie just drops so many aspects that made the first one really good. The action is fantastic, and the acting in a few scenes really stand out. However, otherwise it is predictable, slow, and kind of booring. Too many side plots that are completely useless, used to establish the ""goodness"" of a character we already like and sympathize with from the first movie. A lot of oppurtunities for a deeper character development were missed.",The Equalizer 2
756,nawelmc,The Equalizer 2 : Movie of the Century,10,16 October 2018,"The movie is entitled ""The Equalizer 2"". The movie's release date was August 2018. The director of this movie is Antoine Fuqua and the writers are Richard Wenk, Michael Sloan and Richard Lindhein.
This is the story of a driver in Boston who is helping his client. He is named Robert McCall and was a US Secret agent. After he knew that his friend was murdered and her co-workers were hiding the real reason to him. He decides to avenge her death. The mains roles are played by Denzel Washington, Pedro Pascal and Ashton Sanders. 
I really enjoyed this movie, the actors were amazing and the fight scenes were awesome I think the scenario is complete and it's a logical sequel to ""The Equalizer"". I loved how the main character was powerful and strong even if he was alone and lost all his family and friends. 
I recommend this film because there is a lot of suspense and thrill because the story was great and you should watch this movie. I think there is a message through the movie that even if everybody think you are bad you can do good things and you can't trust anyone in this world. If you want to do something, you have to do it by yourself because nobody will help you.",The Equalizer 2

Side stories had no involvement and completely unnecessary. Story like this one should not take more than an hour.

759,Tydara,A Sequel,6,2 November 2018,I am a huge fan of the first equalizer film and had waited anxiously to watch the sequel.I was not overly impressed. It was as though their were two plots happening at the same time. The side plot being much more intriguing and rewarding then the main plot. The pacing was very slow and the conflicts and resolution were predictable.The saving grace of this movie was Denzel's performance.
